","What a bitter disappointment! In order to explain what is missing from the film, please allow me to describe what I love about the books.<br/><br/>Suzanne Collins creates a moving portrayal of a girl living under a cruel dictatorship. Set against a background of extreme poverty, these books show how the unequal distribution of wealth affects Panem's society. Those living in the wealthy Capitol have so little in common with the destitute people from the Districts that they regard the deaths of District children as entertainment. The violence in The Hunger Games is shocking because it is brutal and unnecessary, yet wholly embraced- even celebrated- by Capitol residents. As for the District tributes, they are not enemies but they kill each other all the same, some reluctantly and others with enthusiasm. As the trilogy progresses, it becomes a compelling commentary on the madness of war and the sad futility of violence. However, these themes are woven into the books in such a way that you may not even notice they're being discussed. You become so immersed in Katniss's world that poverty is a given, and violence a sad but expected part of life.<br/><br/>The film follows the basic storyline but lacks emotional depth. The character development is almost nonexistent and the deaths in the arena are bloodless in every sense of the word. The tributes are little more than walking stereotypes so their deaths have no impact. Even Rue's death- heart-wrenching in the book- is little more than a side note in the movie. If I hadn't read the books, I don't think I would have understood the dynamic between the tributes at all, including the conflicted relationship between Katniss and Peeta. Their romance comes across as cheesy and unconvincing. There is no hint of the bond that grows between them as the story progresses.<br/><br/>Perhaps my biggest criticism of this movie is that no one seems to be going hungry! I cannot believe the filmmakers overlooked this important point. The Capitol's exploitation of the Districts is supposed to be the backdrop for the entire story. When Katniss arrives in the Capitol and observes how food appears at a touch of a button, she cannot understand how Capitol residents fill their time. The majority of her days are consumed with feeding her family. It defines her. Most of the tributes have never had enough to eat and this is a major factor in the Games.<br/><br/>The beginning of the movie seemed promising. The ominous mood in District 12 was just right. It is apparent that the people who live there are exhausted and resigned to their fate. When residents appear for the reaping, they look like cattle being rounded up for slaughter. The Capitol, in contrast, is frightening in it's frenetic artificiality. This juxtaposition was well-done. However, the filmmakers lost me when the tributes entered the arena.<br/><br/>There was no sense of tension. The tributes make all kinds of noise as they move through the woods, seemingly oblivious to the fact that they are being hunted. Katniss stands about ten feet away from Cato as he snaps a boys neck and we are supposed to believe he doesn't see her? The scenes from the control room are pointless and add nothing to the movie. They should have spent that time on character development! Unfortunately, this lack of character development causes the emotional scenes to fall flat. I am astounded this was even possible, given the subject matter, but the overall result lacks intensity and depth.<br/><br/>I will credit Elizabeth Banks with an excellent portrayal of Effie Trinket. She adds humor and a sense of the absurdity of Capitol life. Donald Sutherland also does well as President Snow. Jennifer Lawrence is an adequate Katniss but Josh Hutcherson is terrible as Peeta. He's just not very likable. We see none of his inner strength. Instead, he comes across and whiny and weak. And Wes Bentley seems to be included just to showcase his ability to grow an amazing beard.<br/><br/>One more thing. What happened to Haymitch?! He's supposed to be a self-destructive drunk! His cunning is all the more unexpected because he seems incapable of taking care of himself. I was thrilled when they cast Woody Harrelson and he does well in some parts but it seemed like they had to water down his character to market it to young adults.<br/><br/>This movie had a lot of potential but it fell short in many important ways. A score of 3/10 is pretty harsh but I felt as though the filmmakers kept all of the plot points and none of the meaning. Read the books instead."

","Thrilling,Engaging and entertaining dystopian action sci-fiction flick. Really liked the visuals and all the action scenes. This is the real deal of Drama and action. Screenplay,costumes and make up all are decent. Especially the make up and movie sets are very beautiful and elegant which make the people from novel come to life. Now,considering the novel,this movie adaption misses a few things i wanted to see on screen. One is I expected it to be more violent on screen with a R Rating but they made PG-13 Stuff, i don't know why,to make more money i guess. That shaky cinematography too. some of the important messages had been cut down. These things really disappoint me because i loved the novel and wanted it to be more precise. other than that it is good popcorn entertainer. Loved Jennifer Lawrence though. Acting is far far better than that Kristen-NO-Expression-Stewart. Not only Jennifer but all the actors did their job very good. Now looking forward to sequels.Hope they will be better."
"aryassen","3","617","897","23 March 2012"," How can this be a cult movie?
","OK, first let me admit that I haven't read the books, and I didn't even know they existed: I was taken to the cinema by my girlfriend, who saw something in the trailers I didn't which made her all excited. So, I sat there with a clear mindset, no expectations, no prejudice, no background info whatsoever. First things first: whoever invented the the ""let's shake the camera all around because it makes the movie so much more lifelike"" and convinced others to follow him or her, should be shot. Twice, in fact, just to be sure...It is really annoying, and so unnecessary: it is not making anything more real. For me, in many cases the hectic and jerky camera movement seemed to be only a poor attempt to mask fact that there is nothing (or not much) happening, but it tries to make it look intense and action packed regardless. So cheap...and apart from pissing me off, it didn't work at all, but I admit I well may be a minority... The story feels like it is hanging in the air. Again, I didn't read the books so the scenes may have been adequately set there, but in the movie you get 10 lines, and off you go...and it doesn't add much depth later on either. The most fundamental question remained: what's the point? Sending 2 dozens of younglings to slaughter won't hold aggression at bay in itself, actually it is more likely that the infuriated parents driven mad from the grieving over the unnecessary and pointless death of their children will cry for revenge and go into resistance, or even spark a brutal bloodbath (especially that it is an annual event, so sooner or later everyone will be affected by friends or family). Also, the scale is hanging in the air too, you don't know how the 2 opposing populations (the ""citizens"" of the shiny new world and the habitants of the 12 district) relate to each other, which would be rather pivotal. I won't go on with the many potholes, the bottom line for me is that the scene was set simply poorly. The story, well, is very simple and straight, once you stepped over the inadequate surroundings. Feels painfully unfinished, and though I din't know there is a series behind, I told to the (rather disappointed) missus in the end that it must be so because they already have a sequel in mind. Knowing that gives a little excuse, but still left a hollow ""is this really it?"" kind of feeling in the both of us. The striking similarities with Battle Royal I'll leave alone... Acting was OK, considering the absurdity of some of the characters and the whole context (background and story). I'm sorry, I'm not a big fan of the lead actress (Jennifer Lawrence), as I didn't even know her before this movie (althogh I saw and really liked First Class, but somehow couldn't connect). Regardless, she does a good job of portraying and transferring the tension, fear and uncertainty of the situation she is pulled into, at least a good number of scenes, in fact her efforts were one of the few ""ups"" for me among the many ""downs"" during that long 2,5 hours. Kudos to Elizabeth Banks as well for creating a ""sugar-monster"" character, and also for the fact that though I know her face well enough (just seen in Man on the ledge), here I simply couldn't recognise :) Based on the movie itself, I really don't know how this can be so popular, but I admit I'm probably not the target audience, and also the books may be much better (well, it wouldn't be difficult as the bar is set really low). Donald Sutherland was brilliant saying ""only hope is stronger than fear"", but that and Ms Lawrence's occasional shine doesn't make this worth to sacrifice and evening for. I have a frequent visitor card so it didn't cost me anything, but if I've paid almost 10 quids for this, I would be rather upset..."
"groovieknave-177-74234","1","467","676","27 March 2012"," Spoilers! But don't worry, it's already predictable and weak.
","The start of the movie is so obvious, with a tiny little girl scared out of her wits who has no business being in the Hunger Games, most predictably the lead actresses little sister it was obvious she was going to take her place. Even more less surprising we find out that the boy going with her has a crush on her.<br/><br/>On to 1 hour and 15 minutes of Woody Harrelson being not nearly believable enough as a crude alcoholic become soft hearted, a lot of senseless dinners, a lot of hype for the contestants we know nothing about, absolutely no politics or explanation of what the Hunger Games actually are or how it came about, and an awful underlying message sent out to viewers. ""Just be yourself, but do what everyone expects!"" Katniss went from being tough, to a weak and sleepy survivor.<br/><br/>Are you bored yet? So, they get thrown out into the Hunger Games, there is absolutely no build up whatsoever. The only person you know is out there is Katniss and the boy who came with her. The rest of the contestants you don't know, hardly have a clue as to what they're capable of, most of them die at the start anyway. Katniss runs away from the initial slaughter, to take a nap. Then she takes more naps. At one point out of the blue she finds herself in the middle of fiery doom, with fireballs launching at her, she barely survives. Well, lucky for her, though we were never told. she has some sponsors save her, with the help of a silent montage of Woody Harrelson laughing with a bunch of poorly dressed somebodies. She gets saved with super healing medicine! She takes more naps.<br/><br/>Later, we find out the boy who has a crush on her is teamed up with the last of the jerks, for some reason, in a game where only one survives, there are people who travel in groups. Okay? Why??? They make some pathetic attempts to kill her, then give up and sleep. Kat makes a new friend who seems to be the most resourceful, herbal expert. She tells her to dump a bunch of insects on them. Then while it takes forever for her to saw a tree limb off, we're told these are evil, dangerous insects that will kill you. How convenient! She gets stung a few times, and conveniently kills a girl with the bow and arrows, which just so happens she's an expert with. How lucky! Too bad she was stung by these insects, now she's going to take more naps and be saved somehow... by a tiny girl who knows herbal remedies. Wish we would have known that! They turn out to be good pals, what a surprise that is. Well, after a lot more boring stuff of not getting to know anything about what is going on, they randomly decide to go find out what the meanies are up to.<br/><br/>Turns out, they gathered all the supplies and somehow found a bunch of land mines to surround the pile. Okay? What's that supposed to do? Apparently, some girl isn't part of their group, she expertly dodges every land mine and gets away with something. So, instead of gathering some supplies, Katniss blows it all up. Then... runs away! Katniss and her little pal find each other, but get attacked, Kat swiftly dodges a spear throw, and sticks the attacker with an arrow. The attacker dies instantly. But finds out poor little girl was stuck by the big spear. Except it takes FOREVER for her to die, we don't know anything about this character, so we don't care, so the long drawn out death is stupid.<br/><br/>Well, Kat runs off alone and finds her boy who has a crush on her. For some reason untold he's not with the group anymore and he's badly injured somehow. Okay, they hobble off after way too long, and then find a cave where it takes way too long for them to get things going. She decides to go off on her own for some supplies, and gets attacked by a girl who takes too long to kill her, but some other guy out of the blue SAVES Katniss... for absolutely NO reason, and then... just leaves her alone! In a game where only one survives, with the perfect opportunity to turn the odds in his favor... just leaves her alone! She goes back, takes a lot more time, and finds out there is only one person left? Really? Thanks for showing us some of the action... but anyway they leave the cave, and the Hunger Game... techs, or IT people or whatever they are, unleash a bunch of dogs that are really big and full of muscle. Kat and her boyfriend OUTRUN all of them to a huge metal platform where they're surrounded by blood thirsty animals... who could easily make the jump to the top of the platform... don't. Instead the last guy, whoever he is, is bloody and looks like he can barely move, beats the crap out of both of them. How he got by the dogs is beyond me... but whoever can do that must be amazing, until, Kat shoots him in the hand with an arrow. This causes him to fall off and get eaten by dogs. But Kat feels sorry for him, and puts him out of his misery.<br/><br/>After this, there is nothing really to note. Nobody says anything important and nobody cares, they just wish it would end, because they don't really know what happened at all. They don't really know anybody but Kat, Donald Sutherland gives some meaningless scornful look, and walks off and the credits roll."
"Redcitykev","8","78","106","26 March 2012"," An American Battle Royale!
","In the future all wars have ended, but famine and poverty still remain in a new North Amercia, which has been split into 12 Districts. To appease the people, and pay tribute to the fallen, Capitol City have devised The Hunger Games, in which 2 children from each District are chosen to fight to the death live on TV.<br/><br/>The film follows the fortunes of the two chosen from District 12, and we see them whisked off to Capitol City - a pastel coloured ""Willy Wonka"" style place in which the people wear outlandish costumes, have bizarre haircuts and live seemingly empty and decedent lives. Here they are treated like royalty, and trained in readiness for the games.<br/><br/>Eventually the children are pitted against each other and the game begin. It is here that the film begins to remind one of the Japanese classic of a few years back 'Battle Royale' - but without as much blood or violence. As the game progresses the rules begin to change to attain an ending which is pleasing to the masses, rather than those ""playing"" the game, and new elements are thrown in to ensure excitement and ""fun"" for the viewers.<br/><br/>The film takes a long time to really hit its stride - the opening sequences seemingly go on forever - and there is no doubt that this film owes a big debt to 'Battle Royale', as well as nods to the original 'Rollerball' (in as much as war has been outlawed and violence has become controlled and organised for the entertainment of the masses) and even 'Logans Run', but it has enough in it to make it a stand-up, worthwhile film in its own right. Not the least of these is the way in which TV is shown to become cynical and exploitative, where - in much the same way as the Ancient Romans had their ""Blood and Circuses"" - love and death are merely elements in mass entertainment.<br/><br/>The production is very good - the future Capitol City looks amazing - whilst the acting ranges from excellent (the young actress playing the lead role is very good), to screen chewing (Woody Harrleson eats his heart out!!). The other thing about the film is its length - at almost 2hours 30minutes there is no doubt that it is just too long! A good half hour could have been lost without losing any of the tension or drama. Worth seeing definitely, but make sure you watch it in a comfortable cinema (or else take a cushion!)"
"angedemo16","10","66","89","1 June 2012"," I loved Battle Royale
","To be honest, I was hesitant about this movie, mostly because it seemed like a new, toned-down version of Battle Royale. I had never read the books, but I feel that if a movie is good enough to inspire someone, then the book will be good enough to be read.<br/><br/>I want to read the books.<br/><br/>I didn't care for the shaky cam, especially in the beginning, but that's a personal preference of mine. I was highly disturbed that there was a world where children would be allowed to kill each other for sport. I kept wondering ""Who would let this happen? Why are their people cheering for these children's deaths and not mourning them?"" Rue's death satisfied that question. That was the most beautiful scene in the entire movie. Her death struck a chord with Katniss, an entire district and me. It was wonderful to finally see someone raging at the death of one of these kids, and she was the perfect vessel for it.<br/><br/>The lovey dovey stuff was to be expected, but this movie didn't try to shove it down your throat like a certain sparkling vampire movie did. It was subtle, and not even something of assurance, but sweet.<br/><br/>Just watch the movie. That's all I can say. I'm gonna go read the first book of the series. That's how good this movie is. It inspires the viewer to read and I'm ready for the next installment"
"Blueghost","Null","47","62","26 March 2012"," That which is old, is new again.
","I guess I'm just not in sync with popular teenage culture, because I kind of liked this film, but, based on the number of negative user reviews, you'd think everyone would have dismissed this thing as the next ""Gili"". Well, it is a teenage action adventure romp that skews female, so there's bound to be some disappointment among young male audience members.<br/><br/>But, to the film. One wonders if Miss Collins, author of the series, ever read Frederic Brown, or watched classic Star Trek in the late 1960s or during its syndication run in the 70s and 80s, because the basic bulk of the story is taken right out of ""Arena"" (which also saw reincarnation via an issue of ""Adam Strange"" in Detective Comics). Which is okay, because it's not a clone of the story, but uses the basic plot and story written by Brown, and adds many young person and female flourishes to comment on contemporary TV watching habits, and societies' imperilment of becoming addicted to a certain type of bloodletting entertainment.<br/><br/>The film is nicely paced, and seems to be riding a fine line of trying to be edgy, real, and young person's fair all at the same time. I think it achieves this for the bulk of the audience whose dollars they're trying to capture, but the rough and tumble sci-fi gamer who is used to blood and gore via an online gaming server (and I'm talking pre-teen boys here) might probably get little impatient with it. But, the young ladies in tonight's audience, seemed to really connect with the film.<br/><br/>Some critiques here; in the original ""Arena"" we had Captain James T. Kirk pitted against a very fake looking intelligent lizard-captain, with the goal being for said starship captains to finish each other off in a ""more civil"" manner, as opposed to creating a mess in space via starship combat. In ""Hunger Games"" the main characters must fight for a dystopic world, again to avoid a messy war. And that's my biggest critique; the backstory, and the setting; because I didn't get a whole lot of logic to what exactly the Hunger Games represented. There seemed to be some kind of starvation component, but it really wasn't made clear in the film, just inferred that food might be in short supply. Yet one was hard pressed to see starving citizens, and with such lush green forests, one wonders why crops aren't planted to feed the people if food is indeed in such short supply. But, that's kind of the premise of the film, so you have to buy into it to really enjoy the film itself. This verse Kirk and the Gorn who were fighting over territory.<br/><br/>There's some symbolism going on in here. There's a hearkening back to ancient Greek heroes and gods, as well as an Asmodeus like TV producer calling the shots for the Hunger Games. Woody ""let me tie up traffic on the Golden Gate Bridge some 12 years ago"" Harrelson makes an appearance as an aged vet of the games (as I digress bitterly), who relays what wisdom and beneficence that he can to the selected champions of his district.<br/><br/>There's romance, there's intrigue, there's hand to hand combat, there's MTV like shaky-cam cinematography, some girlish moments, and even some pyrotechnics (a rarity for any film). In the original ""Arena"", or rather the Star Trek adaptation of Frederic Brown's short story, Shatner gave another sterling speech at the end to the Metrons who had been pulling his strings the entire time. ""Hunger Games"" does the same thing, only more cinematically, and, unlike my beloved Star Trek, does it with a female bent. Which is better, or which do I prefer? I'm not really sure. Being a starship and phaser kind of guy, you'd think I would lean towards Kirk and crew, but I think I kind of like Katniss's challenge at the end. Kirk uses a Prometheus like solution, where Katniss sticks true to Artemis' ways, even to her ultimate act of defiance to the TV producers and audience. I would ask anybody who reads this to watch Star Trek's ""Arena"", and compare Kirk yelling up at the sky near the end of the episode with Katniss's gesture and solution. <br/><br/>Technical notes; the editing is slow (thank goodness), and there're few jump cuts, which makes watching this film easy on the eyes. No digital cinematography here. This is pure film making. The costumes were interesting, and the makeup fell into the same category; trying to look appealing to young audiences while at the same time being edgy and flashy. All in all respectably shot.<br/><br/>Not a super sterling film, but, using recycled material from a variety of sci-fi sources, with a gripping narrative, and polishing the package with a pink female bow, makes the film an interesting watch.<br/><br/>Check it out."

","There's almost nothing to say about a movie like The Hunger Games -- it's been so worked to death to be a successful blockbuster that all of its edges, the things that make a film good or bad, have disappeared. It just exists as a spectacle, a finished product that defies any critical lens.<br/><br/>I could go on about the particulars of the adaptation -- the ridiculousness of the entire Capital setting, or the sometimes disorienting shakycam work, or the great cast of adults patiently playing supporting characters -- or the source material -- the gestures at social commentary, the way that the story protects Katniss from ever having to morally sully herself -- but they all seem to be beside the point. Look. The movie has the things that happened in the book, but in a movie, competently shot and acted, with absolutely no risks taken. If you liked the book, or want to learn what this whole Hunger Games thing is about without having to read the book, you'll probably like this. It's a digestible film, even an enjoyable one, but in the end it's not really interesting or memorable. But to be fair, it wasn't meant to be."

","Simply, many over the age of 18 read these books and loved them, and it wasn't because there was a girl, a boy, and another boy in a love story. It was about an awful political system where children faced to the death for their survival with awful paragraphs of cruel brutality. This is part of what made the book unique. The movie, was an attempt to draw a crowd like Twilight for money, and completely blurred out children killing each other to survive so that it could be made PG13. Ridiculous. Jennifer Lawerence is an AWESOME actress though, and she did a great job. Throughout the movie I was never convinced that she lived in district 12 nearly starving... or that Peeta was dying in the hunger games.. it was all very pretty and not anything like I imagined they would do with it.

","I've never read the books but went to an afternoon screening to see what the fuss was about. ""The Hunger Games"" I felt was a complete bore. The story unwinds in an excruciatingly slow manner and you really have no emotional connection with the characters. The plot-line itself---people of a dystopian future being made to fight to the death on TV has been done to death (no pun) and done with more wit an imagination in ""The Running Man"" for instance. The gladiator story is told much better in real gladiator movies like ""Gladiator"" and ""Spartacus"" which are both hugely better than ""The Hunger Games"".<br/><br/>For an action movie it feels like days go by before there is any real action. The ""name"" actors like Stanley Tucci, Wes Bentley and Donald Sutherland seem to be as bored as the viewer is with this material. The unknown actors playing the competitors are wooden. When there is action it is usually with such herky-jerky camera work that you can barely follow what is happening. And there are some gaping plot holes. SPOILER ALERT the heroine is treed by the others who will just wait her out to get hungry and come down. And of course they snooze instead.

"rrc-2","1","143","212","1 April 2012"," Didn't read the book - but ugh
","If you are going to make a movie about children being forced to kill each other for the enjoyment of the public, I would think that the tone one would reach for would be something more along the lines of Shindler's List or at least a tone of some satirical value. And you would think that the angst, fear, disgust and overall awfulness for the main characters would be a focal point. You would think the blood lust of the watching masses would form a visceral sense of at least moderate horror that would serve as a backdrop to all of this. And most of all you would think that children, even children raised to expect that they might someday have to enter a tournament like this, would struggle with a conflict between fear, innocence, longing for some sense of decency and trying to sort through the confusion to survive. <br/><br/>It is something of a stretch to imagine a society in which everyone loves seeing children murder each other. That in itself is a plot line the brings a distorted feeling with it. The movie tries to hide that, or at least neglects to even attempt to address that, by layering this movie in and American Idol feeling. There is no sense of outrage. There is hardly a whiff of the sense of all of this in the time we spend with the characters. They are wooden and whitewashed. The most we get in the way of a sense of their overarching dilemma is a few shallow feeling comments and silent looks of stoic concern. <br/><br/>The movie seems to present the material in this fashion to make us forget that we are watching children kill each other. It is as though we are watching running man - only with 8 year olds. Who doesn't want to watch a movie where adorable little boys and girls snap each other necks? Or dogs run them down and eat them alive...?<br/><br/>If a movie like this is to be done it cannot avoid the moral content without seeming shallow and absently depraved. That is this movie. The core is not attempted. It is like red tails meets running man. <br/><br/>I found it absent, vapid and obviously lacking in any real value. It was also a little sick because it didn't even bother for tone whilst presenting the viewer with a mind bending plot. <br/><br/>In short, wooden acting, shallow presentation and not at all smart."

"harry_tk_yung","Null","70","102","24 March 2012"," Not quite ""Battle Royale""
","Many have drawn a comparison between ""The hunger games"" and Japanese cult movie ""Battle Royale"". There are obviously similarities, but even more pronounced differences. The best example is the universal graphic violence in BR. In THG, if you observe closely enough, the two protagonists are never directly involved in the executing of killing of the other 22 participants in the ""game"". They are not lily-white innocent, not by any means. But this watering down is intentional. Even with the protagonist aside, the more gory part of the killing is shown only once, at the beginning of the game, through a series of montages with visual images so fleeting that they hardly register. One other point that is emphasized (by an instructor to the protagonists) is that this game is not so much about killing as about surviving. He even quotes statistics – 30 per cent dies of dehydration or exposure, paying too much attention to their knives and not enough to their water supply.<br/><br/>Set in a futuristic US when the hub around New York dominates and rules, 12 ruthlessly governed districts each provide two ""tributes"" annually to take part in a brutal survival game from which only one winner is allowed to emerge alive. There is a stark contrast between the ultra-modern, high-tech game design and control rooms and the primitive forest that is the playground. The movie is roughly in two halves. The slightly shorter (about an hour) first half establishing the scene and the second half concentrates on the titular event. <br/><br/>The much contested lead role, by three Oscar-nominated young ladies, finally went to Jennifer Lawrence (""Winter bones"") who edged Hailee Steinfeld (""True grit"") and Shailene Woodley (""The descendants""), which seems logical as her Oscar nominee was for Best Actress while the other two's were Best Supporting Actress. And she does prove her worth with a solid performance. In the male lead (which is really a supporting role) is Josh Hutcherson whom I remember favourably from ""The kids are alright"" (2010). Adding pleasure to the movie are appearances in somewhat caricature-like roles by worthy actors like Stanley Tucci, Elizabeth Banks, Wes Bentley, Woody Harrelson and Toby Jones.

","Alright, I'm going to be honest. I thought this film was going to be terrible. I really did. I've read all the books, and I thought they were okay, but not really worth all the hype. Then I saw the film, and I was blown away. This was one of the best films of 2012, and I cannot wait for the sequels to come out, although I am a little upset that they're splitting Mockingjay into two films! Oh, and by the way, there is a film just like this one; it came out 10 years ago, was called Battle Royale, and it was better than this, even though this film was excellent.<br/><br/>The film takes place in a dystopia future, where the world was destroyed by an unknown event. The area that survived, now called Panem (North America), is now split into 12 districts, all ruled by The Capitol. We find out that the districts attempted to overthrow the capital, but they were defeated, resulting in the destruction of District 13. Now, for the past 74 years, two citizens of each district; a boy and a girl, all between the ages of 12 and 18, are sent to die in a tournament called the Hunger Games. The last person standing receives a lifetime of fame and fortune, and the district reaps the benefits. This film follows 16-year old Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) of District 12, an expert archer, who volunteers to take her younger sister's place in the games. Her partner, Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson), is a baker, and they come with a strategy of pretending to fall in love with each other in order to look good and get help from the outside world during the games. They are guided by Haymitch (a great Woody Harrelson), a drunkard who is the only surviving winner from District 12 (only two from the district have ever won). <br/><br/>They head for the Capital, and are trained, and they meet the other tributes. Here is the movie's biggest flaw; most of these characters actually had bigger parts in the book. Here, they run around and get killed off. Only Rue from District 11 is given any substantial screen time, but it's still not enough. President Snow (Donald Sutherland) is the wicked leader of the totalitarian Capital, and he doesn't want District 12 to win, because it results in the poorer districts (9, 10, 11, 12), to stand up and want to rebel again. The games are overseen by Seneca Crane (Wes Bentley) and the Gamemakers, who add new obstacles in order to make the games exciting. Those two were barely in the first book, so their larger part in this film is very welcome. <br/><br/>Eventually, our two heroes work together to try and win, and I won't spoil anything else. This was a very well done film. The actors are great, especially Stanley Tucci as Caesar Flickerman and Lenny Kravitz as Cinna. The effects are all well done, and the cinematography, which I heard people didn't like, is also pretty good. Director Gary Ross (who sadly isn't directing the next film) did a great job translating the book to the big screen, and it was a success. Hope the sequels are as good as this. ""May the odds ever be in your favor"".<br/><br/>Final Verdict: 8/10"
"kosmasp","7","33","45","31 May 2012"," Battle Royale for the young ones
","I am referring to the audience watching. Because the original Battle Royale (japanese movie) with a similar theme, was more of an adult version of this movie right here. Having said that, the idea is so good it translates to the screen, even if it is watered down a bit. Plus I was just enjoying the girls moaning and exhaling in general while watching this and finding romance even in the weirdest of situations. Throw in Lenny Kravitz, Elizabeth Banks and the always reliable Stanley Tucci for some acting/weirdness weight and you got yourself a movie.<br/><br/>Apparently though the movie has not covered everything the novel had to offer (which should be no surprise). What should be a surprise to anyone who was living outside the US, is the fact, that this was one of the most anticipated movies in recent history (though I'm more than happy that The Avengers beat them at the total box office of course). Better drama, story and acting than Twilight, hopefully it stays that way and won't dwindle down the road ..."

","Battle Royal, the Japanese wonder from which ""author"" Suzanne Collins stole the plot to ""write"" 'The Hunger Games', was nothing short of a unique piece of art in a sometime dull cinema industry. It was refreshing, brilliantly played, and even had Takeshi Kitano in it. <br/><br/>And then came the cash cow makers, yearning for fast-money franchise. Makes sense though, you wouldn't work for the lesser salary either. Their job is to make huge profits, and this usually comes with a total absence of feeling. Fair enough!<br/><br/>But 'Hunger Games', really... It is the diet version of entertainment. A terrible actress to begin with. And if you have seen American Hustle or the recent X-Men movies, you know it is not ready to change. Jennifer Lawrence has no acting, no understanding of her roles, and to be true, millions out there are still trying to make sense with her Oscar...<br/><br/>Then come the Art Direction... Again, no creativity, everything being taken from more glorious creators from the past. Make-up just looks like Ziggy Stardust had more offspring than we thought. Costumes look like 'The Shindler List' VERY unfortunately met 'Zoolander' with a failed attempt to ""Jean-Paul Gaultier"" the overall look. And let's not talk about the boring settings... Even if creativity rides along with inspiration, there is a huge step between referencing and raiding. This is clearly the latter.<br/><br/>And yet, there is ONE beacon of hop amidst all this terribly annoying waste of time: the next 'Hunger Game' movie. Stanley Tucci alone gives more credit to the franchise than any other previous actors. Then of course Philip Seymour Hoffman and Julianne Moore. Obviously. Let us just hope that the mediocrity that transpired through the first movies will be washed away by this brilliant cast."
"the_wolf_imdb","2","31","42","14 August 2012"," So... was this supposed to be better than BR?
","I have read a TON of reviews that told us this is THE THRILLER, the revolution, the super amazing thing. Basically it is only huge victory of marketing over the common sense. To say that the Hunger Games is better than Battle Royale is the same as to say that Coca Cola is better than the best French Champagne, because the Coca Cola sells more bottles and it is better known around the world. Oh, this power of marketing that sells water with sugar and forces the masses think that it is mana directly from the heavens! <br/><br/>To say it simply and honestly: The Hunger Games is huge failure. It is super boring nonsense that tries to play emotional, sad or whatever. It is thriller written by the worst author of the love books you can ever imagine. It is movie where the only real thrill is a bunch of silly costumes of the Capitol People. But even they do look as a collection of weirdos from very cheap music video from 80ties.<br/><br/>I loved Battle Royale for its roughness, political message and pure shock value. There is nothing like that, when there is the first combat scene, it fails miserably. You can basically see only shaking camera. Then there is another long boring part, then again some super short combat messed again by another shaky camera. Then some hallucinations, then some memories, then some other boring sequence. There is a lot of similar movies (TV show that will be survived only by the sole victor) and every single of them is more thrilling. The only thing that would make the movie even more unbearable would be Sandra Bullock in the leading role.<br/><br/>The Hunger Games is a joke, it is less thrilling that any Harry Potter movie. It is basically movie for kids dressed as a thriller. It is definitely not recommended for anyone ho seeks real thriller or really powerful movie. But again: If you are twelve it might be fine for you. The leading actress is pretty so you may be happy just to observe her in various dresses and enjoy when she runs around the woods. There is a bit of tears, flower gathering and shallow morale for these teenage girls who may like this Hunting Barbie kind of stuff. As a male I have suffered horribly however.<br/><br/>One extra point for silly costumes and crazy haircuts. This is probably the only shocking thing in the whole movie."

","I read the book years ago and loved it. Now after watching the film I am certainly disappointed. This film is a cookie cutter thriller at best. Save your money and don't watch this; just read the book. The film is similar to the Alice and wonderlands most recent adaptation; the visuals are great, but the story is butchered. I mean love is nice, yet I find myself more entertained by the notion of it when its focus is more than skin deep. Yet, there is no love put into this film it is entirely focused on entertaining your peripheral and lacks substance in dialogue and explanation as well as some of the story being altered in presentation from a book to movie. This may have to do with having a pg-13 rating. I am sure Ms.Collins is more disappointed with the out come than I. Just don't bother disappointing yourself and stay home when you find the urge to see this in theaters."
"jackharding89-1","3","311","493","9 April 2012"," Battle Royale with cheese
","In a cinematic world of re-makes, re-imaginings and full-blown copies, it's inevitable to see a movie like The Hunger Games wallow in the limelight and hysteria of mainstream banality and post-Potter hunger simply because it's there. Adapted from Suzanne Collins' trilogy of teen- friendly novels, The Hunger Games looks set to follow in the well-off footsteps of Harry Potter and the soon-to-cease Twilight as the next big-money, low-brow saga for the GCSE bound masses. <br/><br/>This moderately engaging adaptation of Collins' first novel plays like a pre-teen spin on Battle Royale. Director Gary Ross shoots for a futurist-retro sense of uprising, endurance and wonder and in the eyes and minds of 11 year-olds, he's on target. There's plenty to behold, but little to absorb. Despite all efforts, The Hunger Games is starved of a character or scenario to really care about.<br/><br/>A hyped-up, cheesy and dumbed down treatise on human nature, spirit, freedom and TV culture, this is a badly-acted, action-crammed movie built on a much explored prophecy that's been residing in both literature and film for years; a nightmare dystopia in which society is slave to a tyrannical regime. But what do you know; there's a rebellion on the cards. And guess what? It's only lead by an unlikely yet inspiring hero. The Hunger Games is nothing new, then, but hold your horses; pitting 24 kids against one another in a game of death on a top-secret island is an original idea that's sure to evoke sympathy, shock and compassion. Isn't it? Well, maybe, but not if you know your films; not if you've seen Battle Royale.<br/><br/>A bloody slice of social satire with shock and awe to spare, Battle Royale was by no means the first to offer up a glimpse into an oppressive fictional world where people are forced to fight to the death. Sparticus, Running Man and even Gladiator all touched upon on this idea of enslaved cock-fighting for the ""greater good"" and fun of a bent society. <br/><br/>Suzanne Collins' tale may not be a rip-off of Battle Royale, but it is a blatant source. In director Ross' big screen retooling, The Hunger Games is set in a far from terrifying, post-war America whose totalitarian government get their kicks from a legislation born out of the ashes of World War III; each of the country's 12 districts are to offer up one young girl and boy every year to slog it out on live TV in a last-kid-standing tournament set on a virtual island. This; a sacrificial homage to a nation's thirst for blood and conflict. A punishment for an early, post war rebellion. A tribute to state power; The Hunger Games.<br/><br/>The film follows Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence), a steadfast teen who puts her life on the line when she volunteers to replace her younger sister in the upcoming games. What follows is a predictable tale of heroism and self-sacrifice as Katniss and clunky love interest Peeta (a wooden Josh Hutcherson) are wined, dined, trained and then hurled into a giant lion's den full of determined, blood-thirsty brats who are there to win, to kill. Will Katniss and Peeta fall in love? Will they both make it out alive? If not, will one of them be the victor? Do you care?<br/><br/>The Hunger Games is a self-assured, self-important piece of profit-reaping cinema whose potentially bleak and barbaric set-up cannot be realised through on screen peril, atmosphere, gore and violence due to its mild target audience. Alas, there is a lot of hand-held camera-work and rapid editing to cover up the scuffles, scraps, impact and blood. It doesn't work. Over-hyped and overdone; turns out it doesn't take much to tailor a totalitarian future concept for the modern-day youths; just strip it of all depth, complexity and darkness, throw in some weapons, some fire, a bit of romance and some heartthrobs and you'll be laughing all the way to the bank."
"almirr","1","134","205","28 March 2012"," How did this movie start with 100% at Rotten Tomatoes?! Was it a scam?
","SPOILERS FOR MULTIPLE MOVIES INSIDE.<br/><br/>In the middle of the movie, the most emotional moment, I turned to the right in my row and noticed a woman crying. Within just one minute that turned into several people, herself included, laughing out loud. I've never experienced this before in my life and I think it summarizes really well just how pointless and poorly done this movie is.<br/><br/>In The Running Man (1987) convicts chase each other to death for entertainment of masses. As far as I remember they were all death row inmates and the justification was they were dead already, so we might as well turn their sentences into entertainment. At least one of the contestants was wrongly convicted and fights the game itself.<br/><br/>In Gladiator (2000) fighting to death was based on historical facts. In addition to that the main character was resigned to death because his family was killed by a ruthless psycho ruler. He used the game, which he is forced into anyway, to get to him.<br/><br/>Now we have The Hunger Games. A group of completely innocent kids, one of which was 10 or even younger, are forced to fight to the death. The ruling class is totally thrilled, while the poor subjects watch the live broadcast in hope their kids would come out alive. We are thrown right in the middle of that and the movie does not care to explain to the audience just how a human society managed to degrade to such level as to make gladiator games seem like innocent play. All we know there was a war, and in order to maintain peace we have these Hunger Games which mainly serve as intimidation by the ruling class, but also as American Idol-type entertainment.<br/><br/>Problem #1: The movie ignores the reality of human nature. ""Truth is stranger than fiction, but it is because fiction is obliged to stick to possibilities"" - Mark Twain. Hunger Games attempts to break this rule and it either fails miserably or the audiences are so desensitized that the movie creators did not feel the need to sweat basing the fiction on human nature and realities. Are we really that desensitized? Judging by the praises for this movie, it sure seems tat way. No contestant seemed depressed or try to escape the system, which is what you would expect in such situation. They switch from ""I hope they don't pick me"" to ""ok, how do I win this thing"" with equal emotion and mental adjustment to when I change socks. They even quickly start to enjoy the pre-game show.<br/><br/>Problem #2: Even cruel games have rules that can't be changed in the middle of a game. Hunger Games simply does not have any rules in contrast to its own premise of iron-fist control. At one point Katniss is forced back into the game with deadly fireballs on top of a forest fire which she would have to escape to survive. They are literally shooting to kill her, and I am thinking ""isn't the forest fire enough to convince her to move on?"" The fireballs were completely irrational and unnecessary. They only seemed to place a check mark in front of ""this movie has explosions."" Then, the control decides to change the rule from ""only one can win"" to ""two can win"" and then back to ""one can win"" once there was only two left. Then it changes that rule again to ""two can win"" because the game faced an outcome with no winners. This was probably done with the intention to intensify the suspense, but it made the game itself weak and even more pointless than I was willing to swallow. This actually prevented me from forgetting about the impossibly fantastic premise and getting into the game. <br/><br/>In addition to these 2 philosophical problems, Hunger Games is cinematically mediocre at best. It only does special effects well but nowadays that's a given. Acting reminded me of Terra Nova TV series. In fact the entire movie kind of resembled an episode of Terra Nova. There is only one main character in the movie and the rest are extras. They did not really invest much in the development of supporting roles. Even Katniss was a barely developed role. The boy she is in love with plays no role whatsoever. The boy that has a crush on her is an extra with a crush. I know his character is a supporting role, but it is so poorly developed and acted that I refuse to accept him as one. The makeup and costumes are just plain bizarre. Again, if the movie invested a little bit in the history of how it all came to be.<br/><br/>To summarize, I will mention another peculiar thing about this move. It feels like an open frankensteining from other movies. This new creation feels like all these moves crammed together in a limited amount of time: Acting and settings: Terra Nova TV series or a Star Trek Next Generation feature film. The Capitol city: Alice in Wonderland. The control center: Avatar. The arena and script: Gladiator and The Running Man with a hint of Truman Show. - Story development and dialogue: The Last Airbender (the shameless failure by M. Nigh Shyamalan)"

","Although this movie wasn't particularly bad, it's unfortunate that its a complete copy and ripoff of the Japanese movie Battle Royale, which is unfortunate as it was rumored that Battle Royale was going to be remade into an American Film. However, that can't happen anymore as all these little girls will think its copying the Hunger Games when in fact BR came out in 2001. The author of the books should be ashamed of herself and BR should seriously sue the production company for lost potential profit. Hunger Games is a watered down mainstream version of BR and horror fans everywhere will be disappointed that it will never get the chance to be remade, it had true potential to be an extremely disturbing film. Suzanne Collins should be sued, and this issue should be brought to light."

","This is actually my first review here. I just have to say something about this movie. I was really excited to see it, because it sounded like such a good story and I've been hearing people talk about it all the time.<br/><br/>First of all, I was bored to DEATH during this movie. The scenes seemed so long sometimes and everything in this movie sort of got me annoyed. Poor characters, lame and cheesy lines, stupid teenager love story - that I could not believe until the end because I thought she liked the other guy back in her town whatsoever - the cast was –well- was mediocre, battle scenes blurred, background of the plot was not explained properly(I did not read the books). I only caught a glimpse at why it's actually called 'hunger games'; however no one seemed to starve – EVER.<br/><br/>I was looking forward to the battle scenes but they made them so quick and blurry and f*** up (sorry), that even those were boring and annoying. Also annoying: the 'hero' does not even make use of her 'strength' the bow thing but instead hides in trees and only kills people when she absolutely needs to - of course. It's a teenage movie and why should she kills someone? You don't kill people, kids - even if your life depends on it.<br/><br/>I'm rambling because I am still so upset that I paid 10 euro to see this crappy movie. I enjoyed absolutely nothing about this movie and I don't understand why other people like it so much.<br/><br/>So: do not go see this movie, if you haven't already. It's a waste of time."

A contrast that, rather than increasing the dramatic power of the film, gives off a typical American smell.<br/><br/>The use of Holocaust films aesthetics in the Districts scenarios is, for my taste, another proof of lack of imagination, of narrative consistency.<br/><br/>However, the great work of Jennifer Lawrence (in contrast with other characters) and the resources of Hollywood can make this film an acceptable piece of entertainment."

I did not read the book nor did I know until yesterday that this film is another adaptation. for the book I do not know, but the movie turned out, on my sorrow, to be for children up to 14 years maximum - the magic of 21st century and advertising machinery. <br/><br/>After the first few minutes of the film when you realize you're 28 year old who is stuck with teenage movie and after you realize what would not just the end, but everything, look like, you tell yourself: ''sit back and at least try to enjoy visual side of the movie''. but that too ceases to be an option once you realize that you are about throw up because some producer decided it was more fun instead of continuous motion of camera to record in the way: cut-ear, cut-leg, cut-tree in the background,cut-somebody runs, cut-Hair... and all that in 0.3 second and from different - all possible angles. must be seen to be believed. but even that is not the worst, because imagine what the feeling of nausea you get when you realize that the hour of the movie is spent to describe the characters and get nothing better then awful cliché: bad guys are trained, arrogant bullies that smile too much and of course despite the superhuman strength, arrogant like that, they must be kicked by the petite 16 year old shy girl. but since this is still a children's movie, you will not literally see bloody action scenes where this brave archer girl kills super-strong and skilled bullies, but you will rather see scenes where those skilled bullies can not figure out how to catch a girl who ran away from them to a tree, so they decide camp under a tree until this girl alone does not get hungry and climb down. but because it was cold, of course, the bullies get cold so they find it was smart thing to make a fire and warm themself, but not too close to tree as it could catch on fire and kill a girl they've been chasing to kill.<br/><br/>:)<br/><br/>To conclude, if you're not 14 year old teenager, this is not a movie for you. don't get yourself tricked like I did.<br/><br/>cheers"

The Capitol so rich and so big, yet all its residents being free people. Where are all servants, all people who provide services? In districts? But hey, someone needs to clean those streets or polish toilets. In the film only people seen in the Capitol are gay-like citizens and soldiers. Next, premise is set as if the film is a teen flick. Yet, it has quite disturbing idea behind - teens killing each other in picturesque fashion. Another thing - couple of kids teaming up to kill other kids, while there could be only one winner (putting aside slight change just before the end with 2 possible winners). Also, acting of young actors is wooden as hell. Last thing that comes to my mind - advancement of the Capitol is sick - cameras in every tree and creating(?) beasts and whatnot with some fancy interfaces in headquarters...What the...?

","""The Hunger Games"" was an instant hit when it came out, so I'm pretty sure I'm the last person in this universe to see it. Unfortunately, it sorta felt like I was wasting my time. The movie seemed like equal parts ""Running Man"", ""The Truman Show"" and ""Battle Royale"", but with all the clever elements from either of those movies removed. I don't get a kick out of gratuitous violence or something, but spending the first hour on build-up that will barely have any effect on the plot is looooooooong. Take for example all the scenes where they have to impress possible sponsors (to provide outside help) with their fighting skill, sponsoring comes into play so rarely later on that all those scenes are completely cuttable. During the actual hunger game/battle royale, you still don't get much of an action or adventure movie. They're after pulling heart strings mostly, including the incredibly stretched-out death scene of a character we literally know NOTHING about (a full action-free hour wasn't enough to establish some traits?). The most bothersome thing about the movie though it how freaking convenient everything is. Our main cardboard cutouts (granted, Jennifer Lawrence does the best she can with the material) are up against highly trained manhunters, heavily bleeding and leaving traces all over the forest. How do they not die on the first day? How does nobody spot them when they stand there crying and screaming in a wide-open space? Some other character lights a small fire and is killed within about three seconds, but I guess you can't act stupid if you're not important to the plot. The main characters don't survive because they're so strong, so creative, so quick or so fearless: they survive because the script says so. Therefor there's barely any tension, you can predict everything beat for beat. Given its massive success this movie's got to have lots of appeal, but it must have missed me by a mile."

Simple.<br/><br/>Now this farce of a film is more focused on creating a love triangle between Katnis, (Lawrence) Gale (Hemsworth) and Peeta (Hutcherson). All this district nonsense, all this sacrifice, all the deaths...just for a love triangle. That is what the underlying story and forthcoming films are going to be all about; twilight anyone? It is one of the cheesiest films ever; made me cringe so much i was almost sure my spine would snap at any moment. That my head would go all exorcist and just keep going when i constantly turned away in dismay. This film is successful because of the vast amount of teens who are vacuumed into love stories and won't let go until a shirt is taken off. And anyone over the age of 18 who still enjoys this needs to grow up and go watch Battle Royale and that'll show you what would really happen in a circumstance like this.<br/><br/>The film takes almost an hour to start and when it does start, it actually doesn't. It's slow, uneventful and the characters they try so hard for you to feel sympathy towards are so incredibly unimportant that you simply don't care.<br/><br/>Yet another film, that is over exaggerated, over hyped, over advertised and over the top with cheese.<br/><br/>2/10 (and that's me being nice)"

","In the past couple of years Hollywood has piled on the films made from best sellers, from Harry Potter to Twilight. It's a safe bet for the movie makers cause if the books were read by millions (mainly teenagers) then it's likely that people will watch the film. Though the Hunger Games was a lot more serious than those two, apart from say the last 2 potter books, with a more brutal theme if not new because the successful Japanese Battle Royal was out first but Hunger Games was a best seller so Lions Gate made the film. If someone knows how to make something big out of something small that's LG. They didn't have any mega successes but that's why the made HG. First off we can thank Lions Gate for finding a good director and placing a lot of energy on finding the actors. And they got a good script written. They even paid attention to the budget. Let's talk about the story: The nation of Panem consists of a wealthy Capitol ruling twelve poorer districts. As punishment for a past rebellion, each district must provide two ""tributes"" - one boy and one girl between the ages of 12 and 18 selected by lottery (the ""Reaping"") - every year to compete in the Hunger Games; they must fight to the death in a vast arena, with the sole survivor rewarded with fame and wealth. In District 12, when Primrose Everdeen is chosen in her first Reaping, her older sister Katniss, an expert archer, volunteers to take her place. Peeta Mellark, a baker's son, is selected as the other district tribute. After the two youngsters find sponsors, train they start the HG. Where there is no friendship or innocence only survival. Though the film doesn't clear up a bunch of things, I'm guessing because of time constraints (what's with the hand signal?) they did build up a cool world. Maybe a strange communist world mixed with Rome? Despite that sometimes you can see that they should have spent more money on this or that the set and the filming is great. The atmosphere is great and the awesome music helps that too. The actors are believable, with co-stars like Donald Sutherland, Lenny Kravitz, Woody Harrelson and Stanley Tucci. And the star Jennifer Lawrence has already proved herself before this film in Winter's Bone and she didn't disappoint here either and was someone you can build a franchise on. The film can be split into two parts, I liked the first part better, the whole build up of the show. The actual game was maybe a little jolty. I didn't really get the ""there can only be one"", animal, killer instinct feeling as their motivators, and I thought there would be more blood, sweat and one on one fights. They probably tied the directors Gary Ross' hands to tightly, because unfortunately watching what rating it got was important plus if you want more blood watch Battle Royal or the Running Man. All in all you can really feel that LG did everything to make something good out of a book from a recycled story, they were paying attention to how much they could potentially make from the franchise. This worked through most of the film but by the end I just thought it was a good job, but it still is good to see that a YA book adaptation can be done well. I give it a 6/10 with the side note that if you want to see genius watch Battle Royal. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tg0FxMyBLP8"

It has a stupid one sided love story and its just generally a kid friendly Disney-esk Hollywood piece of poop.

","Blame Twilight! Ever since Twilight came out, all these teen flicks have been a variation of Twilight. Hunger Games is no different, it's just Twilight with teenagers trying to kill each other, oh wait, it IS Twilight, minus werewolves and vampires. The cheesy predictability associated with these teen flicks is in check; in a dystopian future, annually a bunch of teens are pitted against each other in the titular event until only one of them is left standing, all in the name of entertainment. Hunger Games thinks it's smart and different, but I couldn't help thinking I've seen it all before, with young Japanese actors and actresses. Oh yes, I have! 2000's Battle Royale starring Takeshi 'Beat' Kitano. Royale did it way better though: the concept is more credible and in a way, more scary - the youth of Japan are out of control, so a program is introduced to discipline/punish (delete as appropriate) them; the youths are selected by high school class, they are sent to an undisclosed island where they are to kill each other until one is left. The catch? They're wearing explosive collars, any tampering with them will blow their heads off. Now, that's a much more effective concept! For Hunger Games the final nail in the coffin is when Woody Harrelson's Haymitch convinces Wes Bentley's character to give the rioting public something to root for - ""young love""! I literally cringed and almost gagged when I saw that scene! Avoid, avoid, avoid! Watch Battle Royale instead, you'll be grateful that you did."

"nfunkymonkey8","Null","24","32","18 April 2013"," Two Words: Battle Royale
","Seeing the ""Hunger Games"" series gain so much recognition is difficult to fathom; especially when it's more or less a blatant copy of ""Battle Royale"", a Japanese novel (1996), movie (2000), and manga (2000-2005). I've read the entire series of ""Hunger Games"" (2008), and not only is the writing style bland, but the plot is exceedingly unoriginal and not 'unique' like many of you are claiming it to be. Like the ""Battle Royale"" manga, ""Hunger Games"" includes love triangles, a group of teenagers randomly chosen (BR: by class HG: by district), plans to overthrow authority, teens given weapons and forced into a death match, a pair working together to undermine the game with the help of an older mentor who had previously won the game, both female and male main leads, a corrupted government, signal fires and bird calls, a reality TV show program (which IS in the English adaption of the manga (2006) for the series unlike many of you have known), and the list goes on and on. Evidence of these unconcealed similarities can be found on various Internet articles (whose writers I sincerely thank). I urge you to go right now and read the manga or novel of Battle Royale online so that you can compare the two series. The author of ""Hunger Games"" blatantly claimed (*cough* lied *cough) that she supposedly never even knew of ""Battle Royale"", so you can't use 'inspiration' as an excuse anymore. Instead, she blurted out nonsense about Roman mythology and the Iraq war since she doesn't want to admit her source of inspiration is a contemporary. How convenient for her own success since ""Battle Royale"" is a Japanese series that isn't well known in North America. She basically made an American-version of the series that contains less gruesome content and involves districts in place of school classes. Even if she truly did not know about ""Battle Royale"" or mysteriously forgot about it in the back of her mind, it is still part of an author's job to confirm the originality of his or her own to-be published works through researching. I'm posting this all of over the web so that ""Battle Royale"" can at least receive some acknowledgment that the ""Hunger Games"" author denied. Sure enough, both series also share resemblances with ""The Lord of the Flies"" and ""The Running Man"". However, unlike the HR author, the BR author has not denied this inspiration. Moreover, the ""Hunger Games"" is more like a rip-off of ""Battle Royale"" than an inspiration since the majority of the plot elements are nearly identical. There's a fine line between the words 'inspiration' and 'copy', and ""Hunger Games"" has extended far past it. There are also many popular American series that were inspired by Japanese series such as ""The Matrix"" from ""Ghost in the Shell"", however they rightfully gave credit for the 'original' series unlike a certain someone. I sincerely apologize if I seem rash with my word choice, but it's so aggravating that Suzanne Collins had dare stated that she wasn't inspired by ""Battle Royale"" when she clearly was. What's more contemptible is that she's getting not only famous from her rip-off, but she's also obtaining vast amounts of money from it. But hey, that's how reality works, right? Therefore, I don't care if this is marked as spam or hauled with negative comments from ""Hunger Game"" fanatics. As long as it reveals to some people the credit ""Battle Royale"" genuinely deserves, then I'm satisfied. Nonetheless, the movie's portrayal of ""Hunger Games"" is quite exceptional in comparison to other movies adapted from books, which is why I am rating this 2/10 instead of 1/10."
"felliott-133-6341","1","24","32","15 May 2012"," The Hunger Games and the slow death of cinema
","I went to see this movie, without high hopes – but interested in what I thought would be a story focusing mostly on a dysfunctional futuristic society, and the reasons why it has turned to this barbaric way of treating different classes of society. However I had a lot of apprehension about it – with the hints of it probably becoming the next 'Twilight.' My conclusion 2 and a half grueling hours later, is that it is a stupid movie, made for a stupid audience. And it is bad cinema. Its target audience is most definitely the twilight fans lost at the end of the saga. <br/><br/>Every single moment that might not have been 100% clear to the audience, was spelled out even further by a voice over LITERALLY telling the cinema what was going on. For example 'I wonder if they realise that it's a booby trap,' and then 'It looks like she has worked out how this booby trap works.' <br/><br/>The reason that I felt that this story was completely unbelievable, was the explanation of why they have this class system and why they have these 'hunger games.' It was explained that it is a constant reminder of war, and so that there can be a winner that people can support. This is all well and good, if the movie had structured a society around this that worked. Perhaps if they had gone the way of propaganda and brainwashing, pushing the society to see these horrendous games as warnings to the people. This would have fitted in nicely with the media. That the media controls the world and the classes, entertaining the rich by the slow destruction of the poor. I just did not believe that a society that can create trains that travel at the speed of light, and a cream that can cure any cut, that they will treat people so cruelly that they can cheer when children are slaughtered with an axe. <br/><br/>The constant use of shaky close ups, gave me a headache as well as confusing the hell out of me. In the two most important fights, the use of constantly jolting close ups left me unaware who was winning or losing, or even what was happening. It also didn't help that in these two fights, the two people fighting look EXACTLY the same. <br/><br/>And was it just me, or did anyone find this movie a little racist? The whole notion of there being one sector that was mainly black, with black people representing them in the game. This is the sector that starts the rebellion. Also, I found it insane that one of the African American characters spared the life of Katnis because he had saved the life of another young black girl, we see no connection between them previously, and must assume they are on the same team because they are the same race. Also, another huge racial thing I noticed was that the entire upper class were white, there were no Asian's or African Americans, no one from any other race than Caucasian. And the fact that it is a fashion statement that everyone in the upper class paints their faces white, is just way too KKK for me. Maybe I am reading too far into it, but its something I could not ignore and it really offended me. <br/><br/>This movie left me feeling really angry, because I know I cannot just walk away from it and forget about it – there is probably another 5 movies to come – and if the first one is horrible, who knows how truly horrible the others could be."

","I really do not understand why all the buzz about this movie. i think it is boring from the beginning to the last scene. There is a lack of elements that make us care about any of the characters, bad acting from almost every actors (even Woody Harrelson).<br/><br/>The movie can be divided in two parts - the first one is an ode to boredom - it takes almost one hour to present the odd world in which the characters live and the characters themselves. Once again, there is nothing really interesting about them both. The scenario is an alternative future where everyone is addicted to beauty and fashion - an interesting view of a possible and near future indeed - but the bad acting and the SLOW pace in this part of the movie made me want to have a remote control and skip it right to the game.<br/><br/>Part two is the game. I must admit that when it finally began i almost had some hope that from that point on it would be a good experience. But unfortunately it goes back to the reign of boredom with full force. I almost felt asleep two times. I could care less for any of the characters that die or gets hurt, and the tasks that they perform are .<br/><br/>In my opinion, this movie is some kind of rip-off from good movies such as Battle Royale and Brazil (for the scenario and weird people) used in a way that does not work at all. Hunger Games is one of those movies that i will forget in less than a month."
"Kentvaroy","4","11","13","27 March 2012"," Calling this movie average would be a compliment
","A friend told me that a movie just like battle royale was on cinema, where a bunch of kids have to fight to the death. He also told me that reviewers had said the movie was macabre and shocking. So I thought ""This movie cant fail"". I was horribly wrong...<br/><br/>You start with a great buildup, showing the people that are to fight and their lives. There are 12 districts and each district selects 1 male and 1 female for the fight. This buildup lasts for like half the movie, where the kids fighting needs sponsors and to train for the battle. Woody Harrelson does a great job being the main characters mentor teaching them how to survive.<br/><br/>After a really long buildup before the battle, the movie has raised a lot of expectation. This is where the audience is supposed to be rewarded for their patience I thought.<br/><br/>Well, here is what happens. <br/><br/>The contestants run for a pile of supplies, and a lot of kids die the first minutes. The death scenes were boring and unimaginative. The main character flees into the woods with the supply pack she managed to grab and climbs up in some trees to sleep. Turns out some of the contestants teamed up - along with them, the main characters male district member telling the team ""Ill help you find her"" as she is good with a bow and considered dangerous. One big fail I can mention already here, is that she IS good with a bow and half the movie buildup focuses on how good she is with it - but she only uses it once or twice. That she is reluctant to fight just further make you lose interest in her. <br/><br/>The problem with the movie from here is that she teams up with a girl, which happens to die. A girl the audience has NO EMOTIONAL CONNECTION to , and she uses like 10 minutes mourning, crying and whining. At this point me and my friends at the cinema was facepalming, sighing and almost had to look away it was so bad. When that finally was over, we thought ""Hey, now she is mad - this is when the action starts"".<br/><br/>Wrong, she finds her male district friend (That earlier decleared his love for her) and the rest of the movie is a bad Hollywood love story, so bad in fact that I felt so awkward I could die in my chair. This was the second time I just wanted to leave the cinema, as these 2 poorly written and excruciatingly boring scenes took up tonns of screen time.<br/><br/>In the end the love couple makes it, yay. As if anyone cares.<br/><br/>The premise of the film is kids forced into a battle royale type death match. WOW! HOW CAN ANYONE SCREW SOMETHING LIKE THIS UP?<br/><br/>Here is how:<br/><br/>1: Create a superlong intro with characters that are boring and uninteresting, yet build anticipation. 2: Have the death scenes be boring, unimaginative and just straight out bad. (Shocking and macabre? Who said that a 109 year old church priest?) 3: Focus on drama and character building when you already feel nothing for the characters and the director/acting fails to change this. Actually hoping the main character dies says a lot about how bad the movie is. 4: Have a kid die and make the main character cry and hold a funeral for days. Yawn... Can you move along to the action? We already have no sympathy for the characters and don't care. At this point the only thing that can redeem the film is a huge gory fight. 5: ... which instead is replaced by a love story. Ultimate fail. <br/><br/>This movie pretty much failed in every possible aspect. Woody harrelson saved it some, and the buildup part of the movie was actually good. But having the concept of kids in a deathmatch and ruin it by almost no fighting or cool deaths, have the main character cry for a day over a kid we - the audience - don't care about, and add a FRIGGIN LOVE STORY that is so poorly written id rather use the book as toilet paper if i had it? No thanks. <br/><br/>This movie gets a 4, and that is being nice. Seeing this movie average at an 8.0 makes me lose hope in humanity. Clearly peoples standards has fallen so low that they can criticize failure when they see it."

","Three things first: (A)-Read the review and think about it first. (B)-I'm a guy! Haven't read the books, but I now want to. (C)-Please stop shouting 'Team Peeta/Gale, bitch' everywhere! <br/><br/>In ""The Hunger Games"", a futuristic oppressive upper class society sets 24 children in a battle to fight against each other to the death every year. There are 12 districts and each district randomly selects one boy and one girl between the ages of 12 and 18 as tributes to enter the Hunger Games as a way to keep the districts in check and keep any signs of uprising at bay. The strong, sure-footed hunter, Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence), in a first of its kind, volunteers to be a tribute in place of her little sister in the games. <br/><br/>The huge success of ""The Hunger Games"" should be attributed to the awesome marketing and the apparent title of being the next ""Twilight"" when it comes to its money making ability in the teen-fantasy genre. The camera-work is just fine, save for the jerk motions when somebody is being killed. You won't feel any nausea if you are used to Greengrass's style of cinematography. The acting from Jennifer Lawrence, Woody Harrelson, Stanley Tucci, Elizabeth Banks and Josh Hutcherson were great. Where the movie falls apart is in the second act when the contestants are inside the arena. Say what you may, at least ""Battle Royale"" provided a highly definitive motive for the kids to become killers, didn't glorify the regime and didn't hold back. Of course, since this movie is PG-13, there's relatively no bloodshed on screen and I can overlook that aspect. What kept nagging me throughout the whole movie is, the kids in ""The Hunger Games"" have no motive to kill each other! Sure somebody should win. But it never explains why they would pick up arms and go kill someone instead of letting nature run its course as Woody Harrelson's Haymitch Abernathy character explained earlier.<br/><br/>The only ones with any kind of character development are Katniss and Peeta. All the others, save for the little black girl and Isabelle Fuhrman barely get to talk in the movie. We have the standard white hunk and his gang of cliché cronies who are the 'villains' and must be brought down. They smirk and take pleasure in killing others while our leads don't get their hands dirty, at all. Peeta, as far as we could see doesn't kill anybody while Katniss killed one guy in self defense trying to save the little black girl. Even the main 'villain' is killed off by cgi animals instead of our leads. So by the end of the movie, our leads are relatively guilt free and their actions in the arena doesn't affect them much. Also they never showed any of the parents being affected by watching their children kill others or being killed brutally. <br/><br/>For a movie where 'hunger' is the main context, the children who come from ravaged, starved homes seem to adapt to the rich lifestyles quite quickly and they are barely starved even during the games. The social commentary completely fails in every aspect. Here we have a world that is like ours, which attempts to market every atrocious thing in a shiny package for the audiences. It was just touched upon and I felt like the writers were afraid of exploiting that storyline. They wanted to tell the story of a totalitarian regime, but ended up ditching it in favor of pleasing the masses. For all its talk of female empowerment, the movie panders to the audience who love Gale/Peeta including cheesy scenes which never come off as true. The Katniss we grew up liking in the movie wouldn't have kissed Peeta at that moment, unless of course it was a ploy to make the 'star-crossed lovers' notion work for the sponsors in the movie, which was never quite clear.<br/><br/>I was in fact, highly excited to see ""The Hunger Games"". But in its attempt to appease the masses and thereby glossing over the disturbing (yet intriguing) social commentary, ""The Hunger Games"" does the most heinous act any movie could do. The system which we are supposed to loathe and be disgusted by, is cheered and celebrated by the movie by virtue of making the deaths of the children in the games inconsequential by making them caricatures and inserting a convoluted love story even in the most vicarious of situations, set to pander to the teens who will go weak in the knees and forget about the immoral world this movie is actually set in. By refusing to look directly at its own story and by instead fashioning a convenient morality out of its murderous sporting event, it lets the audience off the hook and even encourages them to enjoy the blood-sport as 'entertainment'.<br/><br/>3/10"

In my minds eye, I felt the job capturing the Capitol and the people there, visually, was well done. It looked very much as I imagined, as did District 12. However, so much from there fell short. I even re-read the books after watching the movie, to make sure I wasn't making too much of it...only to come away more frustrated. I do realize they only have a certain amount of time to devote to the movie, but I felt it could have been 2 parts to help that. I have nothing against the casting, for the most part. Personally, Katniss was a tall and buxom for how I pictured her....Peeta a little short....Haymitch, a little too Woody Harrelson. haha. I feel the darkness, desperation and depth of the story are lost. The person I went with hadn't read the books and even felt much was glazed over. Gale for instance, you get no real sense of how deeply his and Katniss' connection runs, or why. You really have no clue other than a flashback as to why Katniss' mother is a shell of a being when you see her or why that relationship is strained. Prim is an un-lovable version of what she is in the books....Rue is simply a sidenote, you're sad when she dies because a young girl dies...not because you've come to know her. What of the whole premise of the movie - HUNGER games. All of the shock over how easily food comes to them in the Capitol and why it's such a huge deal to the characters is non exsistant. Why cut out something like Peeta losing his leg? Why no Madge character, to give Kat the Mockingjay pin? So so so many small details and character builds that aren't there. It falls flat, emotionless and empty. A meaningful, exciting, heart wrenching story....turned into something to bring in a teenage crowd, I can only imagine."

As it stands, the movie is a PG13 version of Battle Royale, with a hint of Running Man, a touch of Truman Show, minus any irony or humor, with a lot less gore (to keep it PG13 no doubt), and a lot more cheese.<br/><br/>The one thing that might have set it apart from its many predecessors would have been the political and social background story which is hinted at in the brilliant but short performances of Tucci and Banks, but gets drowned out by the tedious, incoherent, and unconvincing attempts at action and cheesy teenage romance of the Twilight variety.<br/><br/>Even though the ""action"" is clearly intended to carry the movie, given the amount of time devoted to it, it is largely vapid PG13-type stuff, where the heroine MacGyvers her way out of a tight corner by dropping a hive of waspy insects onto her assailants --- who, in spite of being in a fight for their lives, guard her, and themselves, by collectively taking a nap at the foot of the tree their opponent is trapped in. Common sense isn't the strength of any of the contestants, which gallivant unguardedly and noisily through woods they know to be full of people out to kill them, and spend quite a bit of time publicly (and noisily) emoting when disagreeable stuff happens. Gimmicks abound, many of which easily predictable as they are introduced hamfistedly one by one during the preparation and training phase.<br/><br/>Movie making is a business, and much of the revenue comes from young people, and there is every reason to believe that this movie is successfully catering to their tastes and preferences. Unfortunately for the rest of us, this means that all the interesting commentary on our own lives and societies that the source material might have contained is only a small subtext to a teenage drama that has been done before, better, sharper, and more convincing. The scenes with Tucci (equipped with dental enhancements that accentuate everything he does) and Banks (also in magnificent costume) are the highlights of this film, degrading the main action to mere filler for the teens. Unfortunately, for more than two hours, that's just not enough."

","Have just been browsing thru reviews for Battle Royalle and i chance upon this review and Yes, Hollywood did make a watered down version, lame.<br/><br/>""A film (Battle Royalle) that the US, would never, could never make..."", 15 September 2001<br/><br/>Author: Henry Postan from London, England This film is film that I believed had to be made, and it was only a matter of time before it was. Yet it was a film that the US mainstream could never have conceived making.<br/><br/>Firstly to get it out of the way I will say that I loved this movie, although at no point did I feel comfortable while watching it. It had the power and emotional content, that while not necessarily apparent in the dialogue was visible on screen at all times.<br/><br/>I am truly glad that this film has come out of mainstream Japanese cinema. It would have only been made in the US by independent film- makers who would have basked in the glory of its controversy and felt oh-so-smug that they had created it, while shoving a moral in your face. While I actually have no problem with US Indie film I do feel that a Western background would have comprised on visceral content, and upped the content of cheap moral points.<br/><br/>For those who say the violence was ""cartoon-style"" and laughable must have been watching a different film. Whilst this film is heavy in black humour I can clearly say that the deaths are shocking in the extreme, and there is no relenting from the beginning to the end. Only occasionally does the camera pan away from the final deed. The only deaths that have a dark humour content to them, are those involving Kitano (Beat Takeshi) and the ""lone"" vigilante (those who have seen the film will know what I am talking about). Other sections, such as the ""Training Video"" are equally comedic, and absurd. Yet other deaths are shocking in the extreme, and show how the slightest suspicion can have disastrous consequences for groups that only have trust to keep them together, a truly shocking scene in the Lighthouse reinforces this.<br/><br/>The fact that this film employs Children as the main protagonists of the story is the key to the whole impact of the film. We have all seen films like The Running Man where adults fight adults for survival and it seems that much less shocking, albeit that film was handled in a completely different manner. Children have the innocence that makes the brutality of this film that much more shocking, adults in the same situation would have had the reaction from audiences of cheering at the screen as the hero dispatches yet another victim. This could never and would never have been the case with this film.<br/><br/>To another commentator who felt that this film sticks with you less than Scream, I simply fail to find this to be anywhere close to the truth. The deaths in Scream although bloody are nothing but pastiche of those films that Scream is mimicking, ultimately throwaway deaths that up in brutality in order to out-do the last one that have one or two psychotic perpetrators, who eventually get their comeuppance. In this film their are no victims and besides one exception there are no villains amongst the children. They simply HAVE to play the game or die.<br/><br/>Well I encourage all those who feel they can stomach it to go and see this film or find it available somewhere (as I believe it has been banned in the US). It is not truly a film denouncing the evils of Reality TV or showing us the future of that trend of Broadcasting, that is merely a plot device to place the children in this situation. The nature of the film lies in its deconstruction of Friendships, Trust and our views on Innocence. Go and see it not as a spectator of this BR spectacle but as one of the participants and remember what was important to you when you were at school, and whether any of those rivalries, hatreds and friendships would have been enough for you to decide who deserves to die and who deserves to live."

"blazing-wind","2","66","98","26 March 2012"," The hunger games take on Battle Royale... but wait PG 13??
","OK i was really anticipating this movie, i did not read the book but i am a huge fan of Battle Royale and the concept of humans natural instinct for survival. However, I thought this movie could overcome what battle Royale lacked, i was expecting this movie to not just entertain but also send a powerful message, to let viewers ponder the direction the media is leading our society. The difference in class, the desensitization of violence and the concentration of wealth and power and etc. The hype of the movie and high ratings made me feel this movie will explore all these issues which Battle Royale did not. <br/><br/>At last i saw the movie last night, and lets start off with the good news. This movie was better than.. Twilight? and the Last air bender? The reason this was better was because the lead actress was just a better actor than the ghetto low life so called actors they found from the streets for twilight and last air bender.<br/><br/>Now for the bad news..Let see where to start.. OK the rest of the cast was pathetic, the Antagonist was none existent, there was no story build up for any other characters, the Arrogant and deadly tributes from District 1 and 2 were portrayed as none deadly, illogical morons. Like come on who falls asleep under a tree from there prey? The concept of survival in this movie was portrayed like a child's game. Like come on with such an amazing movie like Battle Royale built at the foundation of this movie, i thought the director would learn and improve? If the movie followed mostly from the book then the author clearly does not know the concept of survival. For example One of the tributes from District 1 was displayed as the deadly and arrogant Alpha male, which lacked any intelligence. However, in the movie it seem every other contestant were equally as childish and retarded. The rules of the Hunger Games were simple, there will be 1 victor yet you have an alliance formed with one of the most arrogant and apparently deadly character? Has anyone ever considered that in situations like this the weak normally team up together to take down a power foe yet you have these idiots working together with this Arrogant moron which they know he will finish them off easily once everyone is dead? The movie just lacked intelligence, the film does not show in any scale that there was any in depth understanding of the human mind and how potentially more dangerous it is compared to a dumb ogre with sheer strength. None of the tributes had any sheer will to survive it seem for them if they die it was no big deal. It seemed the mere thought of life and getting to live was not powerful enough to drive the tributes to actually use their F... brains. The Hunger game was made into a run around game where you have people running around like idiots with no purpose. I was surprise that the Hunger game did not have a time limit. The reason that Battle Royale had a time limit and deadly time zones was to show that this is no joke and life itself was on the line. The hunger games made it seem like it was a camping trip more than a battle for survival. <br/><br/>The movie portrays District 12 as the concentration camps and people there are like living thru the holocaust yet the main character doesn't seem like shes been missing too many meals. The protagonist appears to be a very a confusing and conflicting character, at first she appears to be stuck up but very determined to survive and return to her sister. Yet as soon as the games begin there was no determination to survive nor any real thought about the severity of the situation. The protagonist mainly ran away many times and at times when she had perfect shots at her enemies she decides to do nothing. By the way her arrows seem to be infinite (absolutely ridiculous). The hunger games had a slogan ""may the odds be in your favour"" or something yet the whole set up was unbalanced and unfair. Unlike battle Royale where the students were given random packages making it impartial to what kind of weapons you get, the hunger games basically had some swords, bows and arrows n some daggers set in the middle arena so the big bad ogre will easily win? I'm sorry in a futuristic world you cant think of ways to make this more interesting like come on? The movie creates an illusion of hope that some characters may be more cleaver than it seems like the character Peeta, at times you feel he has a brilliant plan to survive by deceiving everyone and yet at the end of the movie it shows he wasn't anything special, no plans, no hidden agenda just a simple plot that appeals to the twilight fans.<br/><br/>I suppose the biggest disappointment lies within the fact that the plot had so much potential to be great yet it wasn't. The director went with cheesy amateur filming styles IE shaky camera scenes and thought the futuristic special effects from avatar will be enough to impress its audience. I felt at the end of the movie, the worst part of this dreadful teenage flick was the fact it gives you hope. After 1.5 hour of dull character development, Adam Lambert costumes and avatar special effects, you hope that there will be some sort of fulfilment, a raging battle scene or an in depth exploration of human instinct but in the end the only thing that one can learn from this movie is you just wasted 2.5 hours of your life enduring another twilight, last air bender type of crap"
"TheRainsOfCastamere","6","42","60","6 April 2012"," A Twilight take on Battle Royale
","Well, it seems that everything has been said already. The film and the book it was based on adapted the premise of a great Japanese film/book called Battle Royale, without ever giving it credit for the original idea.<br/><br/>Despite knowing this beforehand, I still went to see the film expecting something decent. I was quite disappointed when I walked out. For a film that was supposed to be all about teen violence, there seemed to be very little violence in the film. The few scenes depicting violence were toned down and lacked gore.<br/><br/>Perhaps good character development could save this, but, sadly, there was hardly any. All the dialogues seemed forced and monotonous. I was hoping to see the characters converse with each other, but all I saw was actors reading their lines. I like feeling emotions during films, but short of sadness of knowing I just spent $20 and wasted 2.5 hours of my life, I can't remember feeling any.<br/><br/>The only memorable scene for me was the return of the film's heroine to her district, however it was for all the wrong reasons. It struck me as odd that the boy who liked her was all smiles, despite seeing his love interest make out with some nerf herder on the big screen.<br/><br/>My advice is to wait until you can rent this for $2, and even then, only if you really want to see it for yourself. Otherwise, buy a nice Blu-Ray of Battle Royale and see how The Hunger Games should have been made.<br/><br/>6/10 (1 point added out of my respect for Woody Harrelson)"

","How is movie about teenagers battling to the death not going to actually show any of the killing?! I paid more attention to it the second time watching and realized that every time someone dies the movie goes silent and cuts away. There is actually only one killing death shown, and it's by accident. The movie did do a good job at not making that noticeable, but it's still a big flaw. And also, why do the tributes have to be teenagers? There was no explanation to that at all. I hope the book explained that somewhat. I thought the end of the tournament was ridiculous. First there could only be one winner, then they announce there can be two, then psych, there can only be one, and then the last two are going to commit suicide, so the government decides two is fine again. If you want to see a far superior movie with practically the same plot then watch Battle Royal. It's subtitled, but it's mostly action anyway so that's not a big deal."

","The hunger games is a wonderful film that is angaging from start to finish.I really enjoyed this film and what it had to offer.The action was done well even though the camera was shaky it still had that emotional grip during the action sequences.This film has the basic plot of battle royale young adults killing each other and thats it.The hunger games is sent up in a world were people watch all this violence in amusement and shock.The actiing from jennifer lawrence is to die for she gives a eye opening performance.Also josh hutcherson who was stuck in child actor nirvana for a while shines in this well.Woody harrelson and lenny kravitz did a fine job as well.Donald sutherland does a in the shadows performance.For a PG-13 film it is quite dark and grim especially when the action kicks in and when characters talk about the whole idea of the hunger games.If you want a brutal,sometimes jaw dropping but emotional experience watch the hunger games."

I had no curiosity at all about the ending...because, even if you hadn't read the book, you knew all would be well. I'm so saddened that today's youth is so attached to werewolves, vampires and ridiculous sci-fi stories. I hope all those who make these stories so popular all text and drive too. We are losing our culture to crap. Crap on the TV. Crap in literature. Crap at the movies. Even an old fogey like Betty White (on her new show), has given in to the basest of humor to get a laugh, and unfortunately, she gets them. I'm glad I'm an old fogey too, so I won't be around when the declining morals and taste of this country bring it down...and it will. You young ones will be there when it happens.

"summer-love10","1","118","183","25 March 2012"," What A Let Down!
","I was looking forward to this movie for months and have read through the books going on 3 times. The movie started out decent enough and it looked promising. First problem I had was that hunger did not seem be a huge issue, the characters seemed so pleasant not starving. Now I knew that Madge was not going to be in the movie but there were some details that went with her story that really would've helped explain and put more emotion into the story. Oh well I could have dealt with that but it all started getting shaky when they got on the train. The first scene in the train did not happen in the book.Then The train ride was OK. Not exactly how I imagined but I'm still hoping it will start to get going. Well Haymitch all the sudden sobers up and gets responsible and starts being nice to Katniss. Um... Did I miss something because I read in the book that Haymitch was always sloppy drunk and used sarcasm to communicate with Katniss because that how she operated. She and Haymitch had unspoken understandings later on in the arena (which BTW are sent with a little note instead of her thoughts). The ""fire"" if that's what you even want to call it, that was suppose to engulf Katniss' wardrobe was the lamest excuse for fire I have ever seen. It looked like a cheap production trick. Let me just take a moment and say I cannot believe they spent 100 million dollars on this because they don't have anything to show for it.<br/><br/>Anyways, my next HUGE issue with this movie was that the characters weren't developed at all! I felt no connection to any of them at all and I wasn't pulling for anyone the entire time. The movie didn't suck me into a futuristic society that was so bent on keeping control over all the districts that they produced a hunger games for entertainment. It didn't show me how destitute and hungry the inhabitants were, it didn't show the true horror of the games. It was like reading the inside flap of a book. I felt like I was watching a true kid's version of this story and that does not do it justice! On the games, the Cornucopia was the dumbest thing I've ever seen and what was with all the suit case looking items??? Stuff was supposed to be hanging off the Cornucopia not in a huge neat pile in front of it. Katniss does not get splattered with the blood of a boy tribute for the backpack but Clove chases her and she runs into Foxface (not in book). Katniss in the arena lasted all of like 20 minutes. There was not true terror about it all .. there was no desperation.. no near-death experience for Katniss. No folks, she doesn't get dehydrated in the movie.Oh when Katniss gets burned she throws herself into the lake and here come Cato an the careers and they are like ""look there she is! let's get her! Yeah!let's get her!"" It was like watching bullies at school not kids trying to kill each other. You know if the subject matter is too adult for kids make rated ""R"" don't water down such an awesome story! If they had to be so politically correct as to not offend anyone on the subject matter why even bother making a movie.<br/><br/>When Cato and careers see smoke they leave a kid behind (doesn't happen in the book) Foxface somehow sneaks directly behind him and stills food without him knowing. Katniss blows up supplies does NOT lose her hearing or have a bloody ear. Cato just puts his hands on the kids face and twists it sounds cool it wasn't.<br/><br/>Rue initiates the alliance in the movie. They spend like 5 seconds getting to know each other and then Rue's death (which Katniss proceeds to get her out of the net before she has a spear thrown into her)then Katniss cries uncontrollably for like 10 minutes.<br/><br/>Peeta did not get blood poisoning. He barely was scratched. His medicine was a cream not a syringe. Katniss did not pass out with her injury she ""shared"" Peeta's cream. UGH. typing this makes me sick. The cave scene lasted all of 2 seconds.<br/><br/>Muttations aren't anything like the book describes they looked like over-sized dogs. Peeta doesn't hobble the Cornucopia cause his leg is all better. Cato is already on it when they get there and they fight on top.. Cato talks nonstop for 5 minutes katniss finally shoots. Then 2 seconds later she shoots an arrow and kills him so much for listening to him all night. Yes this is gruesome stuff yes it is horrible but horrible things happen every day and we publicize them! Don't tell me we can't make a movie and not put violence in it.It's so much more than kids killing kids yes this is awful but it's about the capitol and its control over the people and the dictatorship.<br/><br/>I do not recommend this movie just re-read the books instead of going to the theater and wasting your money which BTW is all the producers of this movie wanted they made no real effort to make this a true adaption from book to film . I wish Jerry Bruckheimer or James Cameron could have gotten a hold of this title. I hope someone will re-make it somewhere down the road and have the guts to make it as real as it was in the books."

","This awful movie is nothing more than an extremely poor ripoff of Battle Royale. Pretty much a Twilight version of the original Japanese movie.<br/><br/>The characters- especially Peeta- are insipid and the acting- if it can be referred to as such- is awful. Peeta should have been dispensed with at the beginning of the Games. For most of the movie he follows The Twilight character Katniss around like a lost puppy doing little to defend himself or his true love. At almost three hours, there is so much pure fluff that the movie- or is it a ""film""?- just drags on. An hour of garbage unnecessary to what little story there is could have been easily cut.<br/><br/>And the Games- what a joke. Battle Royale so far outshines this piece of Hollywood garbage. This movie is yet another in a long line of Hollywood ripoffs of really great foreign movies- Contraband and Dragon Tattoo being just two other examples.<br/><br/>The last 20 minutes of the movie is just plain dumb.<br/><br/>I don't doubt that this movie appeals to the typical American audience. No need to go into that statement.<br/><br/>A ""1"" rating is way too high for this trash. I'm sure, just as with Twilight, there will be countless sequels. Hollywood has long since lost any creative talent it once had and is now reduced to comic book movies, third remakes of movies and television series not that good to begin with and really awful ripoffs of very good foreign movies."

Always best to start with a positive though so I will say this movie is probably twice as good as Twilight :) Now for the bad: <br/><br/>1) This movie is paper-light in terms of plot. Dystopian futures centred around class struggles have been done to death. They are not weighty backdrops with which to lend your stories depth.<br/><br/>2) I really couldn't care less about the characters. About an hour in I wished they had all died.<br/><br/>3) The socio-economic backdrop aside, the futuristic vision this film conveys is boring. Maybe that was the point and I am missing it.<br/><br/>4) The premise is ridiculous and clearly Battle Royale and The Running Man had an ugly love child. I understand this film was based off a book series - I didn't know this before watching but even still after nearly 3 hours of my attention if you can't convey the alleged gravitas and merits of this story I am unlikely to be impressed with a deeper literary exploration of this shamelessly exploitative money-grab.<br/><br/>5) Did I mention the plot was paper thin? <br/><br/>6)Any chance of something remotely interesting or 'edgy' in terms of the dynamics of the unlucky lot thrust into the grips of mortal combat was looked over in favour of the mainstream, pleasing approach. I can only imagine this was for reasons alluded to in point 4.<br/><br/>7) The attempted conveyance of a romance in this film was plain ridiculous especially after this lengthy scene was played out straight after the equally ridiculous tragedy of the main characters little friend having just died.<br/><br/>8) Maybe I fell asleep at times but I am pretty sure the only person to have benefited from a 'sponsors drop' was the main girl. I found this odd as much was made of this little rule in the build up and I was led to believe that sponsors would have 'favourites'. Seems they all loved her and hated everyone else.<br/><br/>9) Related to above... Clearly any half decent sponsor would have air dropped a ladder in to the group trying to get her out of a tree.<br/><br/>10) Even as an action film, this flick is nauseating. The 'set piece' fight at the end is lamentable and even then is tinged with the nasty soiling of poorly thought out emotional drivel.<br/><br/>11) Having watched this film not more than an hour ago and having had it rob over 2 hours of my life I think it is still telling that I cannot remember the main characters names. <br/><br/>Anyways, I will stop bashing this film now. Suffice to say I hated it. It's terrible - avoid it if you value half decent cinema. Avoid it if you are just after some cheap action thrills. By all means go watch if you need to test your threshold for boredom, cheesiness or sanity."

The real plot: Jennifer Lawrence can't decide between Liam Hemsworth and the albino kid. That's it. That's the story. The rest is just dressing. The Hunger Games is cashing in on Twilight's success, a product to be force-fed to a target audience.<br/><br/>It's a sick world we live in, where children being made to kill each other serves as a back-story to a love-triangle.

"Thrashman88","7","27","37","25 December 2012"," ""Battle Royale"" light!
","Last night I finally saw ""The Hunger Games"" and I must confess it's an entertaining movie. Shades of older movies such as ""Rollerball"", ""Logan's Run"" and more recently, ""Battle Royale"" are very present in ""Hunger Games"". In a distant future North America goes through a war that leaves the nation devastated. The war was caused by internal uprising, not a foreign attack. After a lengthy war the state prevails, but much of the nation is left in ruins. As means to remember this sad period, the state organizes a reality show called 'the hunger games', where each of the 12 districts that started the revolts years ago, must submit a young boy and girl to participate in a televised fight to the death, where only one can become the sole victor. This is where this movie veers closely to the Japanese masterpiece ""Battle Royale"", with a premise very much alike.<br/><br/>Our heroine comes from district 12, Katniss, played by Jennifer Lawrence. Despite casting a bombshell as a tough warrior, Jennifer pulls it off amazingly well, giving a serious performance. <br/><br/>I understand this movie is a book adaptation and, in my case, I haven't read the books or book so I can't really tell if it's a faithful adaptation. A strange feeling invaded me while watching ""The Hunger Games""; it felt like something big was going to happen, a big revelation or the real truth behind such barbaric game. But this revelation never happened and by the time the film ends I'm left with more questions that answers. Unlike ""Battle Royale"", I developed little sympathy for the rest of the young kids involved in the game. Out of the 24 participants, the movie is designed for the audience to care for only 3 characters: Katniss, Peeta and Rua, that's it. Little or no background is given of the other participants, some of them seemed to really enjoy all the hunting and killing.<br/><br/>Little is said about the president of the nation, portrayed by Donald Sutherland, in what I thought was a waste of talent. <br/><br/>Again, reading the book would probably help me to understand the many plot holes this movie has. I think more could've been done with the movie's premise, a more social commentary, but director Gary Ross apparently chose not to. In the end, ""The Hunger Games"" is really a light version of ""Battle Royale""."
"joman","1","13","16","14 November 2013"," Epicly uninspired movie making
","The main problem with this movie is that you need to have read the book to be invested in the ludicrous premise and any of the woefully thinly drawn characters in the movie. Without the context of the book the whole premise of the movie is basically a big ""WTF"". A better script/director could have overcome this limitation to an extent - some of the Harry Potters managed to stand up OK as standalone movies (although not many of them to be fair). Of course, the tone of the movie is *deadly* serious telling me that I'm supposed to care about these 'characters' and the ridiculous predicament they find themselves in. Maybe I would if I'd read the book...<br/><br/>The ludicrous premise could also have been mitigated by making the attendant violence compelling - after all the premise is that the masses are entertained by the butchery right ? Which leads into the other major problem with the movie. The violence is completely neutered in order to achieve the necessary PG-13 rating to ensure mass consumption and make as much money as possible. As many people have commented, the build up to the titular 'Hunger Games' took a fair while (all without establishing why the Hunger Games made sense at all). Once the games finally arrive I thought 'OK now for at least some good action'. Unfortunately what I got was an incoherent mess full of ridiculously quick cuts so as to avoid seeing any bloodshed at all. Where's the tension and excitement in watching completely incoherent action sequences ? There is none. I guess it must have been exciting in the book...<br/><br/>A lesser problem is the special effects (the flames and the CGI dogs in particular) which are very poor and obviously done on the cheap. The girl on fire scene was laughable to me although I got the distinct impression it was supposed to be a big dramatic scene. I'm sure it must have been in the book..."
"jt1999","1","13","16","23 July 2012"," WHAT hunger?!?!?!
","Someone want to explain to me the title of this pitiful snore-fest? ANYONE -- I dare you! Answer one simple question that should be so obvious it's ridiculous: What the hell has HUNGER to do with the PLOT???!!! They're not fighting over food...they're not trying to FIND food... <br/><br/>But maybe I'm not supposed to understand. Maybe I'm supposed to read the book to understand. Just like ""Seabiscuit.""<br/><br/>But that's just the tip of the pathetic iceberg. Definitely hard to know where to start the postmortem on this turd...but let's begin with the camera-work.. and I use that term loosely. <br/><br/>For years, the Shakicam style -- jerky, hand-held zooms and sudden, erratic pans (not to be confused with good, hand-held documentary work) has gained popularity in both movies and television. It probably started on TV shows such as""NYPD Blue,"" then later, ""The Office."" I guess the idea is to simulate documentary filmmaking, or reality filmmaking, or whatever the hell they call it these days. Movies like ""Cloverfield"" and ""Blair Witch Project"" used this style to convince audiences they were watching a home movie. Fine -- they made their point.<br/><br/>But somebody want to tell me WHAT THE HELL HAS ""HUNGER GAMES"" GOT TO DO WITH A HOME MOVIE SOMEONE SHOT WITH THEIR CAMCORDER?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!<br/><br/>What was Gary Ross trying to prove? It can't have been Tom Stern's fault (Eastwood's current favorite cameraman). He's been shooting extremely steady shots, from tripods, for years. You know, normal scenes you can actually follow that aren't a blurred, frantic jumble of swish pans and out-of-focus abstract images. <br/><br/>The only explanation is that Ross, a middle-aged guy with absolutely NO connection to the average teenager or 20-something, must have figured this was the way to play down to the demographic that loved the book. The shaky ""reality"" look is the only way to be ""hip"" -- and show teens this is really their movie, part of their generation, part of their reality-TV/camcorder/mumble-core/Internet upbringing. Right?!?<br/><br/>Wrong. What an awful, misguided miscalculation. For this disastrous decision alone, Ross should be banished from the DGA. Strung up and publicly tortured. Maybe required to suffer through his own ""hunger"" game (whatever the hell that means -- I'm still not sure).<br/><br/>I won't go into the how stupid and clichéd the script is, how it rips off ""The Running Man"" and ""Westworld"" and ""Rollerball""... or how the idiotic, contrived ""happy"" ending with Catnip Whatever and her cross-eyed, pseudo boyfriend hammered the final pitiful nail into the coffin of this pitiful attempt at cashing in on a book series by launching a money-making movie ""franchise.""<br/><br/>Let's just say this putrid waste of celluloid is an embarrassment to the world of cinema and a permanent black mark that will never be washed off the once-opulent silver screen."

","I already saw this movie when it was called The Running Man. The only difference is it's starring a female with a bow and arrow as opposed to Arnold Schwarzenegger and his pure brawn. Of course you could also pull out your Disney library and see this movie from there as well. Remember Mulan? What about Dragonslayer? Both two Disney films that involve ""sacrificing"" younger individuals for the greater good. Of course the switch-a-roo of the heroin clearly was taken from Mulan. Let's not forget that even the ""kids killing kids"" situation was clearly taken from the much better, original work, Lord of the Flies. This story was not original which definitely showed throughout the simplistic production. The action was missing with a terrible attempt to hide that fact.

","While the film is competently acted, almost everything else about it is atrocious. Since I haven't read the novels, I can't speak to the faithfulness in comparison with the source material, but for a book that supposed to be rather violent, the movie was very tame. My biggest complaint would be the shaky-camera work, which, while useful in creating a sense of intensity or confusion, is quite headache-inducing and more importantly, obscures the action. Among the positives were Elizabeth Banks and Woody Harrelson, who I felt gave rather entertaining performances, and the lighter, more humorous bits of the film were more enjoyable to watch. In regards to the preparation for the Games, I take issue with the backdrop of the whole affair, as it reeks of so-called ""reality"" TV, which I despise. But overall, I felt like this movie was like a watered-down rip-off of Battle Royale, without half of the emotional depth and pretty much none of the visceral content."

(Though at 2 1/2 hours it is way too long for teenagers' concentration spans). However, as far as teen- oriented movies go, it is still better than Twilight, though that doesn't say much.<br/><br/>Take out most of the first hour or so, as this was all just padding and didn't develop the characters or plot much; give it a more realistic, gritty feel and take out the Disney romance, sentimentality and ending and this could have been a decent movie.

Although it is impossible not to notice all the similarities with the Japanese film Battle Royale, released in 2000, eight years before. In this film, students are kidnapped in a excursion trip and wake up with a head-explosive-collar. They were selected to a life and death game with only one survivor or none at all. Each one receive a backpack with food, drink, lantern and one weapon or survival device. Each six hours they are informed about the dead and the danger zones to be avoided in order not to explode their necks. Alliances are made and death follows the smallest suspicion. Previous infatuations and enmities are explicit. Enfasis centers in the animal inside all of us and how thick is the civil layer of our personalities and our survival willingness.

","I don't know a thing about the book, so I just gonna pretend its a movie. Pretty much through out the film I was thinking ""did the writers interact with humans at all?"" And I don't think so. The hole story has its forced sense, where characters and events happen in a not realistic way, with the purpose to get from A to B, and when they would conflict with the story they just go to non-existence. <br/><br/>Like the riot in district 11, that is what would happen if the government how already treats people like slaves, would go ""Oh hey, I gonna take away from Your children and gonna slaughter them for no real good reason. But hey it will be fun."" But in this movie this only happens so the story can progress forward, and once that it done its purpose it goes in to a non-existence stage.<br/><br/>Than there are the evil 4, how teams up for what reason? they will need to kill each other anyway, so no real sense in that. And they keep loverboy as a pet ""Oh he's are best chance to found the hero""... why? (to keep loverboy a life I guess) Than they found her, apparently none of them can clime tree's, they magically can't shoot the hero with bowl and knifes. Than they go, because loverboy how would be dead right there since he served his purpose, goes ""lets just wait till she comes down"" and they like ""okay"" Not that they could not shake the tree, or place a mine on it and trigger it. No. Lets just wait so that the hero can survive. Than they all go a sleep... really? they have a dude next to them how they cant really trust, a chick above them how the same, and other how runs around in the forest how might kill them, but how needs a guard, right? Than there's the bee hive, lets just forget that they probably make that much noise that our hero how is close to them would have realized ""oh bees"" on her own. But angry bees only infects one evil person, even though they stormed the 3 other mean person and loverboy but they get out just fine.<br/><br/>Of course this is just the top of the ice berg, there are so many things wrong with this hole movie its impossible to write it down in this limited space. But to sum it up, its the classic case of lets keep the hero alive even though she should so die here, and here, and here.

They're experienced movie-goers mind you and anything that involves a thoughtful storyline, great action, or captivating drama keeps them going. The movie did not supply enough of any. My wife? She admitted that she wasn't impressed with it either, especially after she had read the e-book -- mainly having the same complaints as I did, but with only the reader's ""disappointment"" insight added. In a nutshell, I'm not going to flatter you with a true critic's linguistics or intellectual discourse in this review. If you like tweenie movies that are overly hyped (e.g., the Twilight series), have no qualms about losing your hard earned dough, have no concept of time, are endowed with high tolerance for camera shake, then go for it and more power to you.

There's just such a dead, pointlessly bland feeling to the whole film, the characters are so wooden and clichÃ©d that I didn't care about any of them, the only good thing was that as they were dispatched we had less bad acting to suffer. Production design is awful looks like some bad TV sci-fi from the '80's. I have absolutely nothing good to say about the whole film. There's not even any real sense of why the totalitarian government runs the games, too oppress, control, for sheer gladiatorial enjoyment? It doesn't even make any kind of social statements of any kind, there's no sense of irony, or anything that would give it some depth. It's not even good as an action film as it moves tediously slowly. The liaisons that form between the competitors are illogical, I was hoping for moments like in Death Race 2000 when the driver reverses over his own mechanic to gain points to the cheers of the hungry crowd baying for blood making us feel guilty as we sit in the cinema watching it........no such thing with this film!"

So many people have been praising it so much, I expected much more. From the previews, it sounded like the movie was about 24 people who were selected to be murdered by each other in a televised event. I could not believe this was for real. I expected some sort of amazing adventure and all of them are saved and they somehow change the world. Nope, it is exactly what was shown in the advertisements. Not one thing was surprising! So i just simply do not understand why Americans go and watch this. Are humans this desensitized that they have no problem watching the slaughter of others? What is the draw? I really wish i had not seen it, it brought be nothing positive. When i was told by young and old people how amazing the movie was, it perked my interest. My girlfriend also got excited and she was the main reason i went to see it. We both sat there in disbelief. Is this for real? So I am very disappointed by our human race. This film definitely should not have been rated PG-13, i have seen many movies with R ratings that were less violent. It was truly disturbing. This movie should not have been touted as a teen flick but as a physiological thriller and the script should have been rewritten to be as dark as the as the material truly was. I am so disappointed by the media, but that should not of been a surprise. I nearly took my 13 year old niece to this a month ago. I am sure that she has seen it by now, almost every teenager has.

","for an $80M budget, you would expect WAY better effects, better class/grade actors, and a s**t ton better story. It was boring as hell too.<br/><br/>I HAVE NOT READ THE BOOKS! Now, i think i should. its one thing for the movie to be not as good as the book, but as a person who had an open mind on the movie, IT WAS A WASTE> I wanted my 2 and half hours of my life back. Thats how sh***y this movie was. <br/><br/>First, The actors and actresses are decent...not the best, but not the worst. There was a constant lackluster ""into-it""--i just couldn't find the characters too into the role. They were all mundane and boring/bored. You can just feel it. In fact, i found myself early on wishing EVERYONE in the movie would just die, a long, horrible, slow death. The characters were just boring as s**t--NOTHING dynamic or worthwhile about them. The main chick, good looking, just 'dull' and partially believable. The main dude contestants, full of fail. And, it doesn't help that in supposedly a harsh, tough society, they ARE ALL PU**IES. Very UN-masculine, very dull and weak. And, the fashion yuppies, the costumes were ugly as hell. For no reason. However, part of that is based on the story/script. IT BL*W nut sacks. I had a feeling like it was suppose to have been a Nazi occupied/Roman empire type feel in the future. However, the setting, mentalities, and demeanor of the ""evil empire"" was barely believable. As an example, when the arrow was shot at the judges/apple, they should have f**king beat Evergreen's a$$ and killed her family. It was just all bull sh*t. DISRESPECT of any tyrannical govt=death and severe punishment and pain...not respect. Just horse hockey. Btw, how does district 12 or any of the any other districts NOT have warriors, i mean, THEY KNOW THE GAMES COME UP EVERY YEAR...WHY NOT TRAIN F**KING WARRIORS? Instead, it was a society of p*$$ies and weak-sauce f*ck bags. These people don't volunteer warriors. They just sit back, cry and whine, and b**ch. Then, get picked like sheep to slaughter. Next, how are there no guns? This IS THE FUTURE--where are the guns?! how does no one (but the capital i guess) have ACTUAL FIRING GUNS? They can even make crude guns...i know they have the means (they can mine, they can build...) Suspension of disbelief?. absolutely, i get it. But don't try to make something ""real"" w/ the basic stuff, like humanism or technology or even basic human will and innovation, being very UNREAL.<br/><br/>The story itself seemed like it was decent, just poorly written and portrayed. It was choppy and added into so many holes. Very unrealistic (in a philosophical sense), very unrealistic and devoid of true humanistic qualities. And, i think that the director ripped off some famous screen shots of great movies, which was a sham. I mean, how about some creativity? For example, when the contestants were first displayed on chariots, the first thought i had was Ben Hur or even Gladiator. Next, was the rip off of the setting in the capital--Star Wars Ep I, II, III anyone? IT just seemed like uncreative, recycled bull.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the need to fire the f**king camera man. The dude must have had a f**king seizure every 2 seconds of had MS or Parkinson's or some stuff. The camera would randomly and very frequently zoom in/out, change angles, move here and there, and go all over the f***ing place. IT PI$$ED ME THE F**K OFF. I don't know why they kept the camera jarring and shaking--my guess is because they thought it would add 'excitement' and dynamics. it doesn't. it just SUCKED and gives you a headache to watch. Which leads to one of the last points (there are lots of them, MOST are bad). The movie was JUST PLAIN F**KING BORING AS $*IT>it was worse than watching paint dry. I slugged it out for the slow, first 30 minutes...it didn't get any better. For 2 and half hours, it was not only NOT worth it, but they SHOULD PAY US TO WATCH THIS SH*T. <br/><br/>i am not watching the next one."
"doug-vavrick","3","8","9","23 April 2012"," First movie I've ever walked out of before it ended
","I haven't read the books - but I will now.<br/><br/>This film presents the viewer with a dystopian post-apocalyptic North America where 12 impoverished and technologically backwards ""districts"" (i.e. states) are politically and economically enslaved by a dictatorial ""Capitol"". Every year, two teen children are selected from each district in a process called ""The Reaping"" to compete in a battle to the death called ""The Hunger Games"". Only one child will survive this competition. The rest will all experience violent death. The entire competition takes place in a virtual reality ""arena"", and the proceedings are televised to viewers around Panem who devour the show much like most Americans devour ""American Idol"" or ""Dancing With The Stars"".<br/><br/>Many of the scenes are shot without a tripod or similar camera stabilizing device, creating a jerky effect and making it hard to make out details in scenes. Most scenes are also ""over-exposed"" (lighting too bright). While I'll guess the director/cinematographer wanted to convey moods and emotions with these styles, they only served to annoy and frustrate me.<br/><br/>I presume the movie portrays this evil society where 23 children are sacrificed to maintain the political, economic and social hegemony over the people as a warning to viewers to avoid creating such a society, and perhaps as commentary that some elements of our popular culture and mass media have strayed too close to what is portrayed in Panem.<br/><br/>I was unable to draw a distinction between the crass residents of Panem who tune in to be entertained by an ultra-violent bloodbath where children repeatedly - and violently - kill other children in The Hunger Games and the people sitting in the movie theater with me, who were being entertained by depictions of an ultra-violent bloodbath where children are repeatedly - and violently - killing other children who were playing a game called The Hunger Games.<br/><br/>I can't believe the movie is rated PG-13. I was shocked when I learned it isn't rated ""R"". The depictions of violence against and perpetrated by children is horrific and intense, and I'm a guy who loves The Sopranos/Dirty Harry/etc.<br/><br/>When Rue died, in what I found to be an overly melodramatic, drawn-out, and entirely unrealistic scene, I decided I had seen enough children killing children for the evening, and I walked out. I've never done that before. I told my wife I'd meet her in the bar across the street after the movie was over. She had devoured and loved the books, and was very excited to see the movie, so I presumed she'd stay until the end.<br/><br/>After walking out, I went to the restroom. Upon exiting the restroom, my wife was standing in the theater lobby, waiting for me. She had walked out right behind me, saying the graphic violence perpetrated by children against children was too much for her as well. She said in the book, you can easily forget the contestants are children. In the movie, you are always reminded the contestants are children. She also was completely disenchanted with how the movie had abbreviated the book's story line, left out what she felt were critical plot elements, and provided no context for many scenes.<br/><br/>I need to read the trilogy so I get context for the violence. Ideally, reading the story will help me supplant the horrific images I witnessed in the theater with less-traumatic scenes created within my imagination.<br/><br/>For those interested in post-apocalyptic dystopian trilogies, I highly recommend The White Mountains, The City of Gold and Lead, and The Pool of Fire. Another similar book is ""Ecotopia"" (a personal favorite). Let's hope I put The Hunger Games in the same category after having read the books!"
"nick-bianchi","2","8","9","3 April 2012"," not worth the hype
","I'm going to start by saying I have read the books and they were excellent books so when I heard they were making movies I was even more excited and leading up to the movie my excitement just kept up when all the reviews were saying that the movie followed the books very closely. Well by the time I walked out of the movie I wanted to cry I was so disappointed. The movie was nothing like the books, from little things like the mockingjay pin where in the book she got from the mayors daughter after the reaping while saying bye but in the book she got it at the Seam and gave it to Pam or the suspense of watching katniss figure out what haymitch was trying to say with each parachute where in the movie he was able to write her messages that sent with each parachute. Even the fact that in the books katniss never met president snow until he visited her at her house in the second book. Some of the little things like that I could overlook but there were just as many big things they changed. Anything from the fact that in the book it took katniss like 2 almost 3 day to find water but the movie she got it right away or when peeta was dying and needed the medicine for his leg haymitch sent katniss something to knock peeta out so she could go get the medicine he needed from the cornucopia where as the movie cut the whole parachute out and she just waited till he fell asleep. How about the fact that Carl got armor from the cornucopia but the movie cut the armor out or how when rue was killed district 11 started rebelling where as it wasn't until half way through the second book did any of the rebellions start or even the fact that the movie had 3 or 4 of the dog mutations at the end but the book there were probably around 20 because each one the the eyes of the dead tributes but the movie cut all of that out. It all sucked!!!! The only good thing I do have to say is that I liked how they showed the gamemakers control room and how that's how they explained about the trackerjackets and other things that were narrated from the first person point of view in the book. So of the 2 1/2 hours long the movie was none of it was worth any of it, it was one of the worst movies I've ever seen and have absolutely no intention of seeing the second one!!!!!!!"

Given that, seeing this movie with an open mind still lead to far more questions and contradictions that just didn't add up. I also saw this movie with someone who did read the first book, and they were just as puzzled. Simply put, there's far too much left out in the screen play, that, if I was to be enticed to read the book after ... I wouldn't. There's nothing here. It's another story of humans hunting humans in a forest for sport. Been done. Several times. And are we supposed to be shocked that children are hunting children? C'mon, you can read more shocking stuff in local newspapers about what kids are doing to each other that's far more disturbing. Entertainment value is gambled on the marketing toward the Twilight/pre-teen vampire/I hate you/I love you angst group that will eat this up. But that's about it.

","This is not the worst remake in film history. I have never understood the idea of a remake at all. If a film, like ""Battle Royale"", is so good to start with why on earth do you want to try and improve on it? If you insist on tampering with perfection, why then do you have to try to recreate it in it's whole? There is nothing original here. Gary Ross put nothing of himself into this film.<br/><br/>They say imitation is the highest form of flattery, but this is ridiculous. There are a lot of sides to a parable as complex as Battle Royale, and I suspect that Ross may have wanted to explore them. Instead the studio forced him into sticking to a cheap imitation of the popular Japanese classic. Tatsuya Fujiwara turned in a performance that lead to one of the most memorable characters in film history and it would have been impossible for any actor, no matter how good to recreate that. The rest of the characters are stuck just as tight to similarly wooden imitations of the originals. It is almost painful to watch very talented actors (namely Donald Sutherland) have that talent stifled.<br/><br/>In the end, Gary Ross set out to pay homage to a great film. Instead he cheapened it, and created a movie that is not worthy of late night cable."

No one to like or root for even as all the characters are cold even the main characters from district 12 I personally couldn't care less whether they made it or not? Best character and actor in this movie by a mile is Woody Harrelson and a shame he wasn't the lead character with some other great actors and a far better script and action to entertain us.

However Battle Royale is much better and much more violent. <br/><br/>I don't know when the book was written (maybe battle Royal copied it first). But if the book was released after battle Royal, it would be like me writing Jurassic park and then releasing a film of it?! In theory they could have made this a great film, but they chose to leave out any kind of violence. I am really interested to see if the book is also just the same as Battle Royale.

"minty-miller","5","578","987","24 March 2012"," Paper thin and watered down
","The trouble with this movie is that I'm old enough to have seen many of its antecedents. So before The Truman Show, which is essentially the same idea as The Hunger Games, we have Battle Royale, The Running Man and of course, Rollerball. They all deal with mass entertainment in a dystopian future society and they all have their flaws. What's really disappointing about The Hunger Games is that unless you've read the book, the film will give you only a fleeting glimpse into why the games are called that. There's nothing else to help the naive reader make sense of the plot and because of this, the involvement of children will seem a bit odd to anyone who hasn't read the book. In fact, that's something you should take into account when reading many of the reviews of the film as they're written by people who have read the books and can fill in the wide gaps in the film without even thinking about it. Some have said its plot line is mildy satirical, but in my view that's just an excuse for a poorly filleted and disappointing adaptation of a marvellous book."

I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone. Read the books. They are worth your time unlike this movie was. It would have been much better if they had stuck with the plot lines in the book. Instead they changed so much that you wouldn't be able to recognize any part of the book except in some parts. They only part that I think they did get right was the actor who played Haymitch. If I was able to give this movie a zero rating I would. For all of those who enjoyed this movie, to each their own."
"lelanthran","1","10","12","25 August 2012"," Don't watch
","Plot: Not too bad, only got going after the first 40 minutes. The first 40 minutes is all character development where we get to see the characters have deep profound conversations and flashbacks while giving each other meaningful looks. Sort of like Eat, Pray, Love, but with less action.<br/><br/>Pacing: Somewhere between a snail on weed and glacial movements.<br/><br/>Direction: Awful. The director is in love with power-point, as we see 2- second shots through the entire movie. The camera man is presumably seeking treatment for parkinsons as every single shot was done in the Blair-witch style shooting by having the cameraman jog while shooting, making for very shaky footage.<br/><br/>Overall: My reason for giving one-star is because this site does not allow me to give zero stars. The movie induces motion-sickness via all the shaky camera work, and as I already said it's hard to see anything when the shot changes every two seconds (I timed it - there is one sequence of the movie which is composed of around 25 consecutive shots of less than two seconds each). Both these issues contribute to feeling nauseous when watching the movie. <br/><br/>As far as I am concerned, any movie that makes the viewer physically ill doesn't deserve any stars. Bottom-line: see this movie only if you're a fan of Suzanne Collins."

"nightcity","1","10","12","19 August 2012"," Mediocre
","While not actually a ""Bad"" movie it was at best mediocre, I have not read the books but I get the impression that the film was made for book fans only, since they would be the most forgiving of its faults. Lets get the bad point out the way first. 1: Too much time spent running around a forest doing very little. 2: Annoying shaky cam. 3: Terrible special effects for this day and age. 4: Derivative - see Running Man, Robocop, Rollerball and Battle Royale to name few (its been done before and better in my opinion). While being derivative is not in itself a bad thing since its rare for a movie to be a completely fresh idea you do need to make it unique in its own way and stand out.<br/><br/>Anyway the plot: Evil empire overlords it over the previously defeated working class population who rebelled, as punishment they have to offer up some children to fight to the death in a reality TV death match called the Hunger Games (sounding familiar yet?)<br/><br/>As usual the dictatorship seems to be a little stupid considering that encouraging the youngest members of the downtrodden class to constantly be in training for a prospective death-match when they are the most likely to rebel is hardly conducive to maintaining the status quo. I mean Rome had gladiators but didn't train all their slaves in combat did it? Perhaps this is the set up for books 2 and 3?<br/><br/>Good points: Some of the acting was decent.<br/><br/>Conclusion: It didn't make me want to run out and buy the books."

","I was a bit disappointed with this movie. I did not read the books at all, though I knew they existed. I read many, many books and so sometimes it's a little refreshing coming into something brand new with little to no knowledge. After seeing the movie, this is not one of those times and I really wish I had read the book before seeing the movie.<br/><br/>The movie was terrible and anti climatic. The actors did a great job, especially J.Lawrence. I've not seen her in any other movies to compare but her performance in this one was great. The problems I had with the movie was that it was 2 hours or so long and I wondered why it was called the hunger games. I know now a little bit from reading the reviews but I think they should have somehow explained it in some way. It was 2 hours long and I wondered why the district people looked so poor and forlorn and why the Capitol people looked so rich and happy, if not a little weird. It was 2 hours long and I wondered how the district people got to this point where they had to relinquish 2 of their kind to go to this Capitol to potentially die on national television. I'm no director or screenwriter and I definitely don't hold any degrees in film-making but with a couple of hours to work with, I feel like all the above could have been explained.<br/><br/>And at the end of the movie, I thought to myself, is this it? Is this all that everyone was hyped up about. I sat there awhile after Katniss and Peeta got home thinking that something else was going to happen and it did...the credits started rolling.<br/><br/>And the Gale/Peeta/Katniss thing is nonexistent in the movie. We meet Gale but we don't spend a lot of time with him in his relationship(?) with Katniss. If it can be called that. And whatever relationship Peeta has with Katniss at home is also nonexistent for me because I didn't understand the whole bread thing.<br/><br/>I gave this movie a 3 only because the actors did a good job with what they had. Otherwise, I will not be going to see the next 2 movies if they make them unless Peter Jackson, Guillermo Del Toro, or Kenneth Branagh is the director. What can I say, I'm a huge fan of LOTR, Pan's Labyrinth and Mr. Branagh is just legendary."

","I was somewhat skeptical when going to see 'The Hunger Games', expecting a novel adaption claiming to be the next Harry Potter, but for older audiences (teenagers like myself).<br/><br/>Set in the Distopian not-too-distant future, The Capitol run by Donald Sutherland and other people with strange dress sense, rules the 12 Districts. Each year, a boy and a girl from each district are picked at random to fight in the Hunger Games, a televised fight to the death spanning days. And in this film, that's really all that matters. Instead of giving this film a heavy political theme, it backs out and presents itself as an action/adventure type film. By all means, that's okay if you want to build a large teenage audience demanding some sort of action, where no thinking is involved, but the action sequences themselves are what this film relies on, and is ultimately let down.<br/><br/>At the start of this film, you'll take a guess that this director loves close-ups, and you'll be right. You better like them, cause the director persists in using them the whole way through the film. As a result the action scenes that this film seems to rely on turn out to be horrible. We are given nearly no vision and it ends up stressful for the eyes.<br/><br/>Taking away the supposed action scenes we are left with minimal character development in the main heroine Katniss, boring dialog and a minimal plot.<br/><br/>What really bothers me is that there are already sequels lined up, ready to gross millions, luring in loyal fan bases for 2 hours of low-par filmmaking. Novel adaptations like The Hunger Games are filmmaking at it's lowest, requiring little to no effort, and shameless sequels, as if the millions this film made isn't enough.<br/><br/>Perhaps the novels are better, at least with books, there can't be a shaky camera with extreme close-ups every second.<br/><br/>Appalling novel adaption. 2/10."
"GlimmerBunny","10","697","1213","19 March 2012"," A true game-changer for movies aimed at teens.
","Let me start by saying that I'm a huge fan of the ""The Hunger Games"" book series by Suzanne Collins. I've read them countless times and when I found out they were making a movie of them a little over a year ago I was very excited. But I was also worried.<br/><br/>""The Hunger Games"" is not very easy source material. The book is written in first person narrative with very detailed descriptions of everything form the characters' looks to the strange futuristic devices they use in Panem, the future version of the U.S. where the story takes place. I couldn't imagine that they would be able to convey every detail as I had imagined it and make the story believable without an R-rating or a huge budget. All of my concerns were wiped away when I saw the movie.<br/><br/>I've never seen a more faithful adaption of a book in my life. All of the costumes, the sets, the locations, the cast (I'll talk more about them in a while) and the pacing is as if they were exactly replicated from the book. And the small things that do differ or are added (such as more insight to the gamemakers' control room) only add to the amazing world Collins created and improve the narrative movie-wise. And the movie is great for people who haven't read the books as well. Not once did I feel as if something was vague or badly explained.<br/><br/>The cast is stellar. Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss carries the movie and makes me regret complaining about her casting because she was too ""hot"" and not starved enough. She IS Katniss and one can feel the graveness of an situation just by looking at one of her expressions. Josh Hutcherson as Peeta is also a true breakout performance. The way he looks at Katniss will makes girls all over the world envy her, just like it's supposed to be. Other standouts in the cast include Stanley Tucci as the flamboyant talk-show host Caesar Flickerman, Woody Harrelson as the sarcastic but caring mentor Haymitch and Wes Bentley as the sinister game-maker Seneca Crane (his final scene might be the best one in the whole movie). The child actors Willow Shields and Amandla Stendberg who portrays Prim and Rue are believable and heartbreaking even though they're inexperienced.<br/><br/>Despite the PG-13 rating the movie doesn't gloss over or sugarcoat anything for their audience. The violence may not be gloriously graphic but it's still there. People will feel the tributes' pain and despair and not even realize the violence isn't gory until you've left the theater. The movie also deals with important themes like survival, governmental control, grief and helplessness. There is a minor love story subplot, but it doesn't distract from the movies main themes. In my opinion I think it rather improves them by showing some light in the dark.<br/><br/>The only complaint I can think of is that the movie feels too short. It's almost two and a half hours long, but it feels as if it goes by in a blink. I will have to see it again to fully pay attention to every detail (such as the costumes and animation of the Capitol, which looked amazing). But this is still not me saying that the movie is rushed, because as I stated the source material is very dense and the filmmakers managed include almost everything.<br/><br/>People are expecting this to become the next Twilight-style teen movie franchise. I can't say I think the two stories have anything in common even though I hope ""The Hunger Games"" will do as well at the box office. But if the first movie is any indication of the quality of what's to come - this will be a series way out of Twilight's league."
"silversmith27","6","23","32","25 March 2012"," The Truman Show meets Battle Royale? I had hoped so.
","Genre : Scifi/Action Big Names : Jennifer Lawrence Synopsis: The Hunger Games is based on the eponymous novel, the first of a trilogy penned by Suzanne Collins.<br/><br/>Post apocalypse North America, now known as Panem, is now ruled by the autocratic President Snow, who each year conducts a gladiatorial combat contest where 2 teens, called 'tributes', from each of the 12 remaining 'districts' battle it out to death in front of all of Panem. The Truman Show meets Battle Royale? I had hoped so.<br/><br/>Disclaimer: I had read the novel before watching the movie. As a result, comparisons to the book are inevitable. I have also watched The Truman Show and Battle Royale, which this movie remixed and gurgled out, inadequately.<br/><br/>What's good: The novel was the first that I had been able to read cover to cover within 24 hours, in a really long time. While the concept of children killing each other in a scenario of complete societal breakdown is not new (Lord of the Flies), Collins did manage to put a decent spin on it and make it an interesting read. Katniss Everdeen, the protagonist, is a strong character and an ace archer and when she volunteers to take her little sister's place in the morbid contest, its hard to not root for her.<br/><br/>Played by the gorgeous and fast-rising Jennifer Lawrence, Katniss genuinely comes across as a do-gooder and one who doesn't take things lying down. She is assisted in her conquest by the other tribute from District 12 -Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson), who for me was one of the better actors in the movie.<br/><br/>Stanley Tucci as the MC was entertaining. The only stand-out performer for me was Woody Harrelson who plays the District 12 mentor.<br/><br/>What's not: Okay so I really did not enjoy the movie. Several reasons. The screenplay was highly unimaginative. With a fine crop of actors, I could not understand how the director managed to get such wooden performances out of everyone! In spite of its $100 million budget, the special effects looked shoddy and very 90s. The camera work was appalling – it was always too dark or too shaky. When you film two people going for each other's throat, you must film from a distance, not from 2 feet away! The editing was very off – several scenes just did not flow from the previous one.<br/><br/>But the worst part was, the setting just could not match the imagery of Panem that I had in mind. It didn't even come close. But I guess, very few movies can do justice to the book. I hated the Harry Potter movies as well (No Emma Watson, I still do love you!).<br/><br/>I think this movie just didn't know what it's target audience was. You want 2 dozen kids' throats to be brutally slit and you want to get a PG rating for the movie?! Even Harry Potter was much more adventurous in spite of its audience being 11-year olds.<br/><br/>Verdict: The script may come across as inventive to people. Heck, I think a lot of people will actually really love this movie. But then I recommend watching The Truman Show and Battle Royale and reconsider your rating for this movie.<br/><br/>My rating: 6/10"

","I am a person that kinda likes teenage movies. So I am not so critical about them as other people are. But this..this is... I don't think I am allowed to say the exact words that describe what this movie is about.<br/><br/>For the persons that have not read the books this may be tolerable, but lots of things are just thrown in there without any explanation as of why. For the people that read the book, it is your opinion and I respect it, but how can you say that this is a faithful adaptation, or that the changes made don't alter the story? We might have read other books, or you have read them more in the past than me, but I can name two incredibly big alterations that affect the story hugely in my opinion:<br/><br/>1. Where in the movie is explained that Katniss doesn't love Peeta and all was manufactured ant the big fight an break-up..instead they are portrayed as actually in love..yes clearly follows the book by the letter..did not change the understanding of the viewer at all over the story<br/><br/>2. Peeta lost his leg in the books... again extremely not important..at all<br/><br/>And I don't even want to go into the small details left out. I understand that the pace in the book is quick and cannot be covered in 2 hours..but make the movie longer you have completely changed the tone and feelings that it must arise.<br/><br/>As a final recap..if you never read the books, you might like this movie. If you have... please don't see it, you will never forgive yourself."

As for plot, there was no character building and the most that was built up was boy likes girl, girl doesn't know, she finds out, a quick kiss and end. <br/><br/>There is also nothing statement why the Hunger Games still exist (apparently this is the seventy-something or other game), just a quick thing about something about war.

","This must be one of the most hyped films over here in Europe this summer and naturally I took precautions to watch it due the fact that hyped flicks mostly fail for me. <br/><br/>The Hunger Games are based on a book and here things already go wrong. It is loosely based on the book. I just will refer to the dogs at the end of this flick, here they are created by the masters of the game. In the book they are the dead that resurrect into dogs. A big difference and also one of the reasons that shows that it was made for the youngsters among us. While the books have a lot of blood and gore the flick doesn't show us anything of that. <br/><br/>But is it all that bad, no, there are a few good actions taking place and it never bored me but it failed by choosing for a flick that fits for whole the family. By saying that it brings me back to another trilogy I doesn't like, Twilight. The way the lover birds are talking does take you back to Twilight. <br/><br/>I was more into the brutal Immortals (2012) a flick that failed for others but worked out fine for me. If you like The hunger Games but would prefer it a bit rougher then I should recommend Battle Royale (2000) but let's wait for the remake of Battle Royale coming out in 2015 if it will be like the original one.<br/><br/>Effects and acting was okay but it's a trilogy I wont follow any more. <br/><br/>Gore 1/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 3/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0/5"

","Overall spoilers below. What an awful movie. Let us go step by step. <br/><br/>1) Script and story line. First of all when you go to watch movie you are looking for nice story. Story is so awful. First of all, when District 12 had chosen small girl.. and then big girl replaced her (yeah, she is really big, if you look further you would see that her shoulder are more wider than Lenny Krawitz ones). That girls is like a cow. And there is no doubt that she would kill all of them.. because she is so big. This doesn't make sense to storyline. Second, name of Movie is ""Hunger games"", where are in movie ""games and fights"", there are no fights at all, all movie 2hour of movie is about preparation (about some good food for poors, some sponsors, some ridiculous 4-days training, there is no sense at all). No any action in the movie. Third, concept of these hunger games is not explained. Why they organized, what happened next, what happened with district 12, why they live like in medieval times.<br/><br/>2) Main characters are not beautiful. Main actress is a very big and have small little eyes. No really, is it possible to find beautiful actress and show her in movie. She got nothing, either eyes, nor chest and etc.<br/><br/>3) Why they skipped all games. It is very interesting to watch how other people were killed, or how guy from District 12 have agreed to cooperate with other districts, how they made negotiations, how they canceled later and hunt for him later. It is nothing. <br/><br/>4) Don't get idea with all sponsors idea and costumes fetish.<br/><br/>5) Studios please give money to good directors from other countries that are not constrained with such bullshit as social research, what would be good to show in movie for different ages and etc... Movie should have great script, emotions, and essence to feel characters.. There are not so much these things in American art of cinema .<br/><br/>6) About racists thing. I think the most racist thing is to show black people as a good people, please show them as a normal. May be it is related to book, but it is awful. It is games to kill each other, and why black ones would be gentlemen's and ladies. Please go to black district in the night when people are also making ""hunger games"". I am not against blacks or something, i just suppose that they should behave as a common human being who have to kill others in order to be alive."
"amyecurtis","9","75","120","25 March 2012"," Addressing concerns of violence, and Battle Royale.
","Addressing the concerns of violence in The Hunger Games movie: The acts of compassion outshine the acts of violence. Also, the message of persevering through something so tragic, and being the spark of hope that eventually surpasses fear, is a great message for kids -- as well as, good verses evil. If you talk to your children about life and how cruel people can be, and to try and be a good role model for compassion, they will understand this movie. As the old cliché goes ""the book is better than the movie."" -- not so in all cases, but in this, it's true. I have to say, they did a good job with this one -- being that it was written in a first person narration, it was pretty close to the novel, and truly captured the essence of the tragic tale. As usual, with every novel that has been adapted into a screenplay, there will be some changes and some things left out in the making of the film. But, overall I was pleased with this movie. Before anyone critiques it, they should see it, as well as read the books. This movie has been criticized for its violent content -- but, kids today are actually exposed to much worse through TV, movies, video games, music, etc...as well as the DAMAGING doses of sex being slipped into every form of entertainment we're exposed to in our society. We should educate our children with the knowledge of how blessed they are to be living in a free nation such as ours -- instead of places like the Sudan, where people are suppressed, terrorized, starved, and slaughtered, everyday. There is a huge difference in trying to keep your child's innocence intact, compared with keeping them naive to the cruelties of mankind. Also, if you've ever read the famous works of The Brothers Grimm, Hans Christian Andersen, and other greats, you'll know that many stories written have exposed children to such good and evil of this world...providing many with a moral to the story. Movies such as Harry Potter, The Chronicles of Narnia, The Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, etc...have their share of battles that contain a measure of violence as well -- as so with The Hunger Games, they too, were forced to fight what was evil. I believe, if at all possible, in taking the negative and turning into a positive. The heroin in this story, was able to do that -- as she's a much better role model than most kids have on TV. <br/><br/>Also, there are those who're comparing The Hunger Games to a 1999 Japanese novel, Battle Royale. Both novels are great reads in their own right -- don't knock either one of them until you read them both. The stories are completely different as with the characters. The only similarity is the tragic tale of kids being forced to fight to the death with only one survivor aloud to live -- all for the totalitarian purpose of terrorizing and suppressing the nation's populous with its life threatening methods of control, fear-mongering, and propaganda. In Battle Royale: The kids are all of the same age (9Th grade), they are gassed on a bus during a school field trip, kidnapped, and then taken to an island ""School"" as part of a military research project called the ""Program"". These students, from a single class, are isolated and are required to fight the other members from their class to the death, allowing only one survivor to live. In The Hunger Games: The Dictator, President Snow, demands a National ""Reaping"" of two kids, one boy and one girl, between the ages of 12 and 18, taken from their home districts to the Capital and calling them ""Tributes"", then forcing them to fight to the death in an unknown arena with only one survivor aloud to live. Two completely different plots, but two very good reads. I could go further into detail about each book, but I'm sure you get the gist of it. I highly recommend that both are read with an open mind, especially for those who are so critical without reading them first."

"norgannons_finest","1","15","20","29 April 2012"," Disappointing.
","It is always hard to watch a movie after reading the book. Never comes out at the same caliber. Maybe its the lack of having to write in the details to paint the picture because you can actually see the picture. Maybe its the fact that how you pictured it in your mind is all wrong from how its depicted. So rule of thumb never nit pick a movie made from a book on the small details or even the little descriptive dialog they leave out. That being said I was super stoked to see Hunger Games. The book is nothing short of amazing and well written. The movie started out promising. You could feel the tension during the reaping. Great. But as the movie progressed, so did my anger. BIG MASSIVE parts are left out. Continuity errors running rampant. A couple that really irked me: 1) They never mention that Peeta was injured. In the book you found out pretty early in the games that for being a traitor to the alliance, Cato cut him and left him to die on his own accord of infection/the elements. In the movie all that was said until you actually SEE the injury is Rue saying ""oh hes by the river"". 2)The day she blew up the alliance food stash. She in the book was fully and then partly deaf. No mention of that in the movie. It kinda made a distorted sound for a couple seconds but no mention of her completely losing hearing in her ear. 3) The whole disappearance of the hospital scenes after the games and things that were carefully put in the book for a reason like the crazy showers at the Capitol. 4) No hover cars scooping up the dead 5) No mention of the Everdeens being healers. 6) At the end it didn't show the tension between Peeta, Katniss, and Gale. Gale looked sad she was with him but Katniss never had the discussion with Peeta she was confused. 7) The uprising of districts didn't happen in this book. We can go on and on but those are the ones that are a slap in the face."

","First of all, I haven't read the book yet but have already watched the movie recently.Sorry to say, but trust me, this movie is just not what you think it will be. I'm a movie freak and have been watching all kind of movies except only few of horror movies. To be honest, I don't find The Hunger Games to be a movie that deserved high ratings. In my opinion, it is just another movie with a simple story and the concept that been used in the story is more or less similar to the movie ""the condemned"" where bunch of people was selected to fight and kill each other in a place where cameras are everywhere to catch the action for the live TV shows and until left the last one to be the winner and in HP case, they got 2 winners. Some more, the movie was boring since most of the time they were like having more conversations rather than focus on what the title of the movie tells. Overall, i don' think this movie is anywhere near to what a good movie should be."
"joephillips93","1","7","8","31 August 2015"," Unoriginal.
","This movie was made just to make money. It is based on the first of a series of books no doubt written by a group of people (not just a Suzanne Collins) with the idea simply to cash in on children. It has the perfect recipe, popular actor/actress, watered-down violence and an unoriginal premise. There is nothing in this that hasn't been seen before, think The Running Man (1987) without the fun, or Rollerball (1975) without the originality, or Battle Royale (2000) without any good bits. It's made for 12-year-olds who have never really seen anything else other than maybe a Marvel movie or a Disney cartoon. <br/><br/>To the movie, it's long, tedious and filled with unnecessary characters, wooden acting and you feel that's it's just trying to build up to the next one (which I shan't be watching). What's worse though is the fact it's fuelled other awful series such as The Maze Runner and Insurgent.<br/><br/>I genuinely went into this thinking that it's the next big action series and that I might like it, but no. I hate this film, I hate what it stands for and 6 months after the last one has been released on DVD and Blu Ray, it'll be forgotten about like Twilight and it's audience would have grown up and started watching ""more grown up"" things."

Anyhow, I took a chance and saw it before it left the theaters. Why did I see it? I have no idea. The plot of the story was very disappointing. Kids killing other children. What has America come too?

"haris_manda","3","7","8","29 July 2012"," Bad ... just ... just bad
","When I heard that there's going to be a cinema release of ""The Hunger Games"", I was really excited (as many fans, really). Casting seemed kinda appropriate, even though not perfect. I believe they should cast actors of the age as represented in book, not any other. <br/><br/>Beginning was ... okay. I guess. They drill us in by few slides of the basic explanations of everyone who hasn't read the books. However, everything from that on goes downhill. At least 80% of original scenes from the ""Tributes"" part of the book were either changed or left out completely. She buys the medallion on the market instead of being a gift from a friend. Peeta's father never visits her, giving her promise that he'll watch out for her sister. Haymitch is nowhere until the train scenes. I mean, his failure of drinking problem is NOWHERE NEAR AS POINTED OUT AS IN BOOKS. I like the actor they cast for him, Woody, my boy, but they just don't give him an opportunity. There's no chemistry between characters, actress who plays Kantiss is just staring here and there like a dead seal, without any acting whatsoever. Actor who plays Peeta might be even worse. There's simply no connection whatsoever between them, no chemistry - before or during the arena. <br/><br/>For everyone who has read the books, Ru's death was one of the most emotional scenes in whole book. In movies they scavenged it to 30s scene without any emotion whatsoever. It's like watching that dude who died at the first step in arena being buried - no one cared! Jokes were plain, not well executed, Kantiss's absence of water was never portrayed (as if she instantly found the water), scenes in the cave were empty, without any emotion whatsoever, scene where Tresh spares Kantiss was plainly retarded as if he had the eyes over the arena and saw what she did for Ru ... I can't begin to describe the enormous burden I bared during the movie time. They almost destroyed the book for me. I can bet up my house that (if anyone ever decides to make it) this will be the easiest movie to make parody of (maybe just above Twilight) simply because they thought they can make it to look better in the books. <br/><br/>They ruined great R+ books and dug them down to the PG+13. I mean, seriously? There's like three drops of blood in the entire movie. Main actress looks as if she ate her whole life ten meals a day, not starved for half of her life. She doesn't lose weight in arena, no, she actually gains it. <br/><br/>I can go on and on about the flaws of the movie, but I think this is enough. I'm just hoping someone will remake it in the future and make it ACTUALLY R+ because that's what it is. It's not a freekin' teenager drama but the movie about survival and overcoming the tyranny that was put upon them.<br/><br/>They even put president as if he was nothing. Just a dumb guy. They added a ""bonus scenes"" so we can see what's happening ""behind cameras"". Oh God ... even special effects looked as if the movie was made in 2000thish. Seriously movie makers ... if you can't do your job properly, don't do it at all."
"wan_sandage23","4","7","8","31 March 2012"," Inconsistent design and context
","First of all, I was highly prejudiced before seeing this movie. I knew it was a take on another recent book series, most of them I don't appreciate, neither even read. But, apparently it was important to see it, and well, gave it a shot. Likewise, I've heard about Battle Royale, mostly negative opinions, but haven't watched it personally.<br/><br/>For the first part, and the part I was personally interested, the visual design of the cities and sci-fi proposal was just inconsistent. Apparently, the art designer wasn't sure if it wanted to portray a classic ancient Rome with electricity and flying trains, or actually wanted a more sleek, high tech environment. So, just mixed them both, and the result is rather unpleasant. For the look of the games, apparently didn't knew if they wanted them to be some sort of fashion show, a pageant like Miss Universe; an exaggeration of the modern Olympic games; or just a brutal televised blood bath. So, decided to try them three, and it definitely doesn't work. All of the anxiety they were expecting to create is completely vanished when they try to make it repulsive by placing it in front of a TV camera. Character development, terrible. Its impossible to feel any kind of sympathy for any of the characters. Rue's death and mourning is just overreacted, and the relationship between Katniss and Peeta is completely artificial and cheesy. In short. Not disappointing, true, because I wasn't expecting much in the first place. Entertaining, yes. The dystopia we were promised? The social critique? The horror? Nope, none of those. Just a cheesy forced story in a poorly constructed dystopian world."

You can barely see what's happening as it look like someone filmed it with a hand-held cam recorder... Also, Katniss' face is all clean through the entire movie while everyone else's covered in mud and some blood stains.<br/><br/>For last: It's called the Hunger Games right? It's a bloody murderous competition. Where's that in the movie? There's some blood, as when Rue get's pierced by that spear, but all the brutality and bloodshed in this movie is covered up by the shaky filming in the fighting scenes. My personal opinion is that this movie had been better if it had been more like a Game of Thrones. It needs to be graphic. You need to see the sword, spear, arrow, whatever pierce through the skin and penetrate the the flesh. You need to see the blood squirt out from the wound and and the killer covered in it."

","It goes unsaid that the book is almost always better than the film. This movie is unique in the fact that it is much worse than the book. I'm not a fan of the latest fad of teen literature to begin with, but being a science fiction fan and a lover of the movie Battle Royale, I had high hopes for this. The word ""hype"" doesn't even begin to summarize how much attention and praise this movie has received, and it definitely did not deliver. The lead actress was great and the idea of a bleak future landscape separated into districts to keep the population in check is a great story. But the film didn't tell that story well. We get only flashes of how or why this system game into place or what the ""hunger games"" purpose actually is. It was very slow, very predictable even if you hadn't read the book and had virtually no action. The fight scenes it did have were quick flashes that if combined total two or so minutes of the movie.

"babsensei","3","11","14","15 April 2012"," A TV movie, nothing more.
","Let me start with a general appreciation. Hunger Games is not such a bad movie. Acting was really great, the setting and environment of the world was well designed and artistically well executed, with nice CGI, costumes and decors. I can't complain on this. The overall story is also interesting and I surprisingly found myself craving for the Games to start.<br/><br/>But despite all these good points, watching Hunger Games was a very frustrating experience. Ironically, I left the theater hungry, not for more Hunger Games, but for what was missing in this first installment of the series. <br/><br/>The first missing element is a steady and adequate rhythm. The show starts rather slowly, and full attention is given to the sole and only leading character of the movie. But the time taken to nurture Katniss' persona was oddly too long and unnecessary as it failed to bring us in the story. In our minds, the following twists of the plots are clearly predictable and offer no suspense at all, and yet it sill took more than 20 minutes to get there. And once we set foot in the Hunger Games and their training until the end, everything is gone : the attention to details that gives life to the story, the easy-to-follow pace, the feelings of the characters.<br/><br/>The second missing element was a real director. The close shots of faces lead us to think the focus would be on character development rather than on the action. It will later show that it is in fact an artificial trick from the director to make us forget how bad the story telling was going. Action scenes have never been that awful and were just trying to hide a complete lack of choreography and creativity. Proof is that 2/3 of the tributes are killed off screen. Most scenes were made of the same objective : give focus on the present, so that the spectator feels immersed and carried away by the plot. But it happened in the wrong way. The director completely failed at bringing up new elements, they didn't create any expectations, like the big dogs who didn't raise the adrenaline level at all. The movie also failed at giving resonance to past events, whether it was related to the mechanics of the universe of the story, or to the characters. Indeed, how could Katniss forgive Peeta for betraying her at the beginning of the games so fast? The kissing scene was so unrealistic and showed the complete lack of character development. Like if it was just meant to happen, to please a teenage audience, most likely. <br/><br/>The last missing major element was the attention to details. Arrows vary between 2, 3, 4 even when Katniss just lost a few while fighting the girl near the pyramid. Or when she just shot the apple sack. If the principle was that resources are scarce, they completely failed to give us worry for Katniss. And her hair was always different between shots, sometimes just a second apart. With dozens of people on set, and dozens of eyes paying thorough attention to every details on screen, how can this still be possible ?<br/><br/>I still perfectly remember the first Harry Potter and the comparison is not in favor of the Hunger Games. Sorcerer's stone perfectly managed its three main missions : introduce us to a very detailed and rich new universe, its mechanisms, its characters, its ambiance; Give space for the first adventure of the young wizard, and give plenty suspense, action, comedy and romance; Conclude the first story and bring the spectator to fancy and hope for a second movie. Hunger Games failed at these three main objectives."

And the fact that Gale gives Katniss a biscuit and she says""oh my god is this real"" doesn't really show that they are starving and this is something that is considered rare and a luxury for district 12. I hate movies where I have to explain things to my parents on why something is happening.And I had to explain a lot to them about this movie.My dad even stated my explanation was better then the movie itself.I like a movie that has a story that even people who haven't read the books can follow. This movie was decent but it seriously failed its fan base.I saw a review on TV that said this was extremely violent.And when I was watching I was wondering when the extreme violence was going to happen.They didn't really show much in regards to extreme violence. And the love story between Peeta and Katniss was horrible.You didn't really get that Katniss was falling for Peeta.And one particular scene that irked me was the scene where Thresh pulls Clove off of Katniss and kills Clove then turns on Katniss.In the movie he says""just this once district 12"" and runs off.I was sitting there thinking they couldn't even get that one scene right.Safe to say its a waste of time to someone who read the books."

I blinked and the games were over. They botched the part with the mockingjay pin, but that's Hollywood for you. But most importantly, they did not spend enough time developing the star-crossed lovers from district twelve. That was what we fell in love with when we read the book. Watching Katniss fall for Peeta during the games.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie gives you your edge-of-your-seat action. Jennifer Lawrence doesn't disappoint.

","After seeing a relatively high rating here at IMDb, I was surprised at how weak the film turned out.<br/><br/>Firstly, the camera work in this film is the absolute worst I've ever seen. The camera was frequently, and for no artistic reason that I can discern, zoomed in way past the point of comfort, was frequently focused on the wrong thing for no apparent reason, and most of all, was shaky shaky shaky! And I don't just mean for fight scenes which were ridiculous. Even when they are just sitting there are walking casually around, the camera shakes like crazy!<br/><br/>Secondly, while the story remains somewhat interesting and we feel for the characters, the director has chosen to focus so much on the kids who are fighting that we see hardly any cutbacks to the announcers or the folks at home. The announcers are shown only twice that I can remember, and audience reaction only once, when they went berserk and started ripping the place. I think much more could have been milked out of this story if it was portrayed better.<br/><br/>Third, while I haven't read the book and can't say how accurately it is truly portrayed, the story itself seems very unrealistic and weak. The way the games were finally played, and how they willy nilly changed the rules, and threw in fireballs and (seemingly) computer generated ferocious dogs, was just silly. The ""alliances"" formed by the kids was random and disconnected, and the sequence of events confusing.<br/><br/>Lots more to say, but I can't see how a film like this gets above a 4."

","(Spoiler alert) I viewed Hunger Games last night and was expecting a true blockbuster. Well, technically, the film met my expectations. Yeah, it was all that a blockbuster promises and delivers. However, in my perfect world of movies, I want character development and I want some ""soul"" in the storyline. So, I get a lot of action, a body count, gore, but from the beginning to the end, I did not feel any plot or character development. All the players were cardboard figures. The buzz I was hearing was encouraging to me. I had read that there was a message about governments becoming too large and powerful. However, the plot was just about where TV reality shows (and I detest them) might end up someday: a Roman gladiator-type spectacle. I wanted the two main characters to make a statement or do something that would absolutely reject this futuristic amoral society and its annual bloody, senseless ritual. (spoiler) The writers had a perfect chance to copy the Romeo-Juliet ending, but chose not to. It's a good thing they didn't as that would have just made it a sappy ending! Instead, the movie is just over.The two main characters just make comments about them wanting to try to forget what happened. There was nothing at the end that said young people would ever reject this futuristic society without a soul. In fact, the ending laid the foundation for formula sequels. Did I mention? I detest reality shows and sequels..."

","As a father of four, the idea of children killing other children simply turns my stomach. I really don't see why anyone would want to watch it.<br/><br/>The actors and special effects were all great but I simply cannot get away from this concept which I just don't like. I'm not saying I think it's ""sick"", just that I find it really hard to deal with and I can't understand why someone would want to write a story/film about either. I can handle most genre of films with hard hitting content but any that include children dying or being killed I draw a line at. <br/><br/>In my opinion the children could very easily have been replaced by adults with little change to the film. Perhaps I've missed the point?<br/><br/>For those people who are parents that feel strongly about safety and well being of children, I say don't watch this."
"Sergeant_Tibbs","4","9","11","2 August 2013"," Confusing, boring and unpleasant.
","When The Hunger Games came out, all non-book fans could think of was Asian flick Battle Royale of which I think is an okay but forgettable movie. Meanwhile, the concept of a televised people vs. people contest always reminded me of Arnie nostalgia-classic The Running Man. In retrospect, it's a pretty cheesy movie, but its execution with all its 80s gritty excess makes the idea chilling and believable in its dystopian world. My biggest problem with The Hunger Games is that never once did I feel the concept fit the world. I think it's a pretty good setup with the idea of a uprising that didn't work and that the upper class would punish them but with a kid v. kid battle to the death? There's something about the film that never once convinced me and it lost me right from the outset.<br/><br/>Perhaps this is because the film so far removed from our world that there's no relatable one. On one hand, there's the districts which feel like a cleaned up Deadwood then there's the Baz Lurhman does Dr. Seuss civilized world. There's no believable sense of time transition from how it can get to its opening written setup to this world with its infrequent odd sci-fi flashes. It's trying too hard to have social commentary. Above all there's no heart beyond teenage angsty feelings and no sense of a morality we can relate to - albeit, Stanley Tucci was a delight and I wish he could host everything ever. Yeah, Jennifer Lawrence's protagonist is brave and I supported her but the writing was so underdeveloped that I found myself confused at what she was or wasn't doing a lot of the time.<br/><br/>The film is just so contrived to try and force the concept to belong in this world. The plot is relatively easy to follow but there's way too many times when I found myself asking ""why are they doing this?"" without explanation and ""why don't they just do this?"" without ruling the alternatives out. I feel like the film never took a moral stance on the killings. Sure, the civilized world find it entertaining/punishment and the Deadwood world finds it tragic, fine, but I'm interested in the internal feelings of the ones actually involved. It just felt like their plan was ""to win"" but strategies were never revealed. Why didn't they just slaughter everyone while they were ""training"" with all the weapons? If they weren't allowed, why didn't the film demonstrate it beyond the few words ""don't fight here""? I never bought it.<br/><br/>Maybe their plan was to just survive the best they could and stay hidden, but this was never stated. Why were people making alliances when there could only be one winner? It never made any sense, especially when there was absolutely no character development. Perhaps this is what you get with a film that's about the one thing it can't show with a PG-13 rating and shaky cam. I imagine these kinds of morality and strategy things are in the book and fans are just filling in these gaps by themselves, but The Hunger Games movie just confused and bored me with its slow plot-hole ridden script, unpleasant hook and unsatisfying climax. Give me The Running Man for the dozenth time instead, at least it has a bit of balls when it comes to its action.<br/><br/>4/10"

Though, I will admit I never read the books, but now that I've seen this movie, I'm completely turned off by the thought of trying to read them, which is a huge shame because I know that realistically there is no possible way the books are this bad.

","A completely derivative film that is not only bad, it is breathtakingly bad. The first half is so over the top ridiculous looking it is laughable, and not in a good way. It is as if all the worst hair and clothes designers in the world were recruited to attempt a futuristic frolic filled with oh-so-outrageous fashions and it just looks clownish, not creative.<br/><br/>It is a mix of a dark concept with a light approach. We have teens killing each other with PG-13 violence. So we have a disturbing concept spun to be appetizing. All of the sociological statements are so muddled and thrown away ending up pointless. <br/><br/>There is nothing gripping or anything that for one minute seems frightening or fearsome. It is all handled with such a feathery touch that the deaths come and go without any feeling of loss or lament. Even the lame attempt at a flowery funeral is without much pathos. <br/><br/>The Romeo and Juliet affair is also so unbelievable and the rules of the game change so much it has a dizzying rather than a dramatic effect. It is all so detached and diluted, the movie can't decide where it is going or what it wants to be. A complete catastrophe with so many unfulfilled elements that are just confusing and confounding. It remains a half-baked, horrendous mish-mash of a movie that doesn't bother to be anything but dumb-downed dreariness.<br/><br/>This is just so bad that it is sobering.

The story is mediocre to begin with and the cinematography is even worse which ruins the whole experience.<br/><br/>Not sure what the director was trying to achieve here but all I can say is its really hard to see an action movie when the cameras aren't showing any action!Really they show trees, random flying object, pointless close up shot of one of the actors anything and everything except the actual action scene!<br/><br/>By far the worst movie I have seen this year.

One of the worst, chopped-up, poorly-directed, poorly-acted movies I have seen in a long time. This had the potential to be a fairly suspenseful commentary on a futuristic world. Instead it chose to become a mish-mash of many themes. No coherency, no flow, nothing holding it together. If this is a commentary on the movie taste of today's youth it is absolutely scary. Go rent yourself some of the great classic films and do not spend you money or your time supporting this type of dross which today's Hollywood is producing."

","I'm a girl who had not yet read the books when watching this movie. What it did do was make me want to read them, so that was a good thing! However, the movie itself was terrible! <br/><br/>The actors and actresses all did decent jobs. No blame on them! But the movie starts terribly slow and continues to be terribly slow all up until the last 1/3 part of the movie. I mean, it's like an hour before they even get to the place where the action is supposed to take place and when it starts off Katniss spends the next half an hour hiding in trees! The action scenes are very lame, I'm not the type that needs to see blood and gore all over the place, but if you make a movie about kids murdering each other in cold blood then at least the poor victims deserve to have believable death scenes, even if they are not the major character! Besides, most of the kids got killed off so early there wasn't much point having them there in the first place! And the main character really got very little action. The little she got was annoying. I felt most of the movie was talking, hiding and napping. This was supposed to be about hunger, survival, etc. But no. Technically it seems all you have to do is hide in the trees and you'll be all good! <br/><br/>No seriously, I couldn't care for any of the characters, except Rue, none warranted any attention, no character development. Very little emotional depth, tt was all very fatigued and uninteresting. What a shame, because the concept was interesting and it could easily have made a great movie. Then it annoys me seeing the high score it's getting here on IMDb. It's like seeing this juicy hamburger on a commerical poster and getting served the miniature dry version on a plate. The focus shouldn't have been on these two people and the issue with their ""pretended"" love affair. Timing was all wrong in this movie. Ineffective. If the makers had made a timeline for themselves as to where it should peak up, where to climax, etc, they should have seen that as far as how movies, books, etc, are supposed to progress this failed miserably. Besides, what do I care if the woman has a ""burning"" dress and looks awesome on a red carpet. Hunger Games, people, seriously! *Frustrated* I wouldn't even let my 13 year old sister see this movie. Gotta keep some sort of quality control.<br/><br/>This all annoyed me because the trailer seemed exciting, the movie plot sounded good. Me and my sister (21) were excited about seeing it, but it fell terribly flat. All that's left is reading the books and hope those are better."

NOthing happened in the end, nothing was solved, it was totally pointless.<br/><br/>Some examples: Catness played the hunger game , the rule was only one survivor, then suddenly there could be 2 survivors, she didn't have to kill anybody, she didn't take any though decisions and in the end nothing changed in the districts, WTF?????? .She falls in love with this stupid guy from her district (or didn't she?)and all is well in the end??? the movies would have been a lot more interesting if he stabbed her in the back with a knife (or vice versa) and the districts would overthrow the regime., or that she had to at least kill the cute girl and hang herself out of misery. So many opportunities for a good movie and they just missed them all!"
"nathanhmcdonald","4","9","11","29 March 2012"," Predictable and unexciting.
","Let me start of this review by saying that I have never read The Hunger Games book. That may to some of you discredit what I have to say here, but please read with an open mind.<br/><br/>First of all, I only went to see this movie because of the MASSIVE amount of hype its garnered. When I initially saw the preview's to it a few months ago, it did not seem like anything special or something that I personally would I particularly would care to go see. However, I was offered a chance to go see it (Free of charge) here recently so I took up the offer in hopes that I might be pleasantly surprised. Needless to say...I wasn't.<br/><br/>In short the Hunger Games is about a girl named Katniss Everdeen and her trials surviving the Hunger Games, which is in itself kind of like televised modern day gladiators. Katniss selflessly volunteers to participate in the games when her much younger more innocent little sister is randomly selected to represent their district.<br/><br/>There wasn't very much I cared for in the movie itself. The first half of the movie is spent basically building up to the game itself, showing little tidbits of training and preparation but nothing really exciting. The second half of the movie is mostly just Katness hiding from other competitors waiting for them to pick each other off (Which in reality would be the smart thing to do)...However it makes for a relatively dull movie. The actions sequences in the movie are few and far between, and only mildly exciting when they do occur.<br/><br/>The thing that really bothered me about the movie though was the predictability of it all. For example...(MAJOR SPOILER AHEAD)... Katniss and the boy selected to compete alongside her in the games (Peeta Mellark) create a faulty love interest with other in order to gain sponsorship during the games. Which apparently having good sponsorship really helps your odds of winning. Anyway, in order to create suspense the proprietors of the games change the rules which originally stated that there can only be one winner of the games changed to their can be one winning district (two individuals) to win. Of course they go back on their word at the end and expect Katness and Peeta to kill each other; however their plans are thwarted when Peeta and Katness enter into an apparent suicide pact after which they allow them both to live.<br/><br/>To me...That was just a total cop out...I would have been much more impressed (And would have raised my IMDb score a few points) had Peeta and Katniss brutally fought it out to the death at the end of the movie.<br/><br/>Either way, I refuse to rank this movie any higher than 4/10. It was mildly enjoyable at times, but painfully uninteresting at others.<br/><br/>Perhaps if you're a fan of the books then this might be a better watch for you...But speaking from the standpoint of an outsider who had never even heard of the books or the movie until a few months ago...I can wholeheartedly say I was deeply unimpressed."
"GazeRock","3","406","726","31 March 2012"," A missed opportunity...
","I will start off by saying that I did not read the books. I'm also one of those people that when I first saw the trailer, I thought it was a Battle Royale remake. When I found out it wasn't, I was quite surprised, cause they seemed very similar. You cant always judge a film by it's trailer though. So to be fair, I decided to give this movie a chance, and not go into it comparing the two.<br/><br/>The movie has quite a slow start, and even though they take a long time building up; I didn't get the idea that I was getting to know any of the characters. They really didn't do a good job making any of the characters likable, or let them develop in any way. The main character in this film, Katniss, was already portrayed as a tough girl from the very beginning of the film. Nothing in the first part of the movie did anything to either develop this, or add to it.<br/><br/>When the games finally start, I was kind of excited, because I was looking forward to some action finally. Unfortunately for me; the action was lacking quite a bit. Shaky camera-work, which I guess is meant to be artistic these days, left a lot of the killing to your imagination. Due to lack of character building in the beginning of the film, I didn't really mind who died, cause I didn't feel any connection with any of the characters. On top of that; many scenes from the actual games seem to be lacking dept, reason or logic. It was as if they went for too many scenes in too little time. This resulted into the whole story of the movie being kind of blur to me, and left me wondering if there was even one there.<br/><br/>On a positive note; the acting was quite OK. Jennifer Lawrence portrayed her role quite well, and her acting had nothing to do with me not being able to relate to her character. Elizabeth Banks was splendid, as a character that at first sight seems totally misplaced in this world, but totally works in the way it's portrayed. <br/><br/>All in all, I'll have to be fair and say I don't quite get the hype. The movie seemed to be lacking in too many areas, in order for me to stay interested throughout the entire two and a half hours. Not comparing this film to Battle Royale while watching it was made quite easy, simply because this wasn't close to being as good. A missed opportunity for an interesting theme like this!"

","One of the things I liked the most about reading 'The Hunger Games' was the intensity of how it was written. Feeling the story seemed maybe even more important than reading it, so when I went to see the movie, my expectations were very high.<br/><br/>On the upside: Great performance by the main characters, excellent visuals and well directed.<br/><br/>On the downside: The book gives a lot of context as to how the characters feel and how things have come to be the way they are. The movie changes a number of things to make it at all possible to show the story and for me the choices made took down the quality of the story a bit. To give at least some context, it took the movie a while to get really started and even despite that, some of the characters, again in my opinion, didn't really develop in depth the way they should.<br/><br/>Long story short, I liked the movie and thought it was a nice adaptation from the book, but it lacked a bit the intensity from the book."

"fildowns","3","239","428","29 March 2012"," A disappointment
","It's a shame how one aspect can spoil the entire experience but that's what happened for me. Other reviewers have commented on the use of hand-held shaky-cam, fast-cut camera-work - none of them positively that I can find.<br/><br/>From the Trivia section on IMDb we read this one sentence:<br/><br/>---- The director has stated that his decision to go with shaky cam work, ""had a lot to do with the urgency of what's going on and to reflect protagonist Katniss Everdeen's point of view."" ----<br/><br/>There was nothing ""urgent"" about the first 2/3rds of the film. I'm glad I don't go around throwing my head from side-to-side in normal life, stressed or not. When are film-makers going to realise they are the only ones that truly like this type of camera-work? They sit there editing the film on their desktop monitors in an office but faithful movie-goers have to watch their ""creativity"" on 50ft+ screens, where every sudden jerk sideways is at best distracting, at worst nauseating. It doesn't convey urgency, it conveys amateurism. Enough already.<br/><br/>Hitchcock asked the composer Friedhofer, ""where would the orchestra be?"" when the latter wanted a string piece for a scene in ""Lifeboat"" The composer replied ""The same place as the cameraman."" We expect movies to have a soundtrack, and if the music is working properly, then we don't really notice it because it joins in with the visuals and enhances the scene. We are viewers of make-believe, sometimes realistic, often fantastical, and immersion into the world of the story is key to a satisfying movie-going experience. A camera being wiggled about on purpose draws attention to itself, and it shouldn't. This constant reminder of the presence of a, seemingly badly trained cameraman, is a real turn-off. Please stop it.<br/><br/>As far as the other aspects of the film were concerned, I found the narrative somewhat plodding, and the pre-games section of the film could have done with being 20-30mins shorter. I knew nothing about the books beforehand, so I'm of the opinion that this is perhaps one for the S.Collins enthusiast rather than the general movie-goer. Though if the other reviews are anything to go by, plenty of Collins' readers are not very pleased either!"

","As simple as it is, this movie and book is a rip off of a Japanese novel and Japanese movie Batoru Rowaiaru or Battle Roayle. Novel written by Koushun Takami, who beat Suzanne Collins to the idea by about 11 years. A writer who can't even come up with her own ideas shouldn't be credited for anything at all, especially a writer who steals the basic concept of one idea and makes a few changes. Movie sucks, the book is a rip off simple as that. I personally found it very upsetting that Suzanne Collins even denies every hearing or knowing about Battle Roayle, a straight lie. Which shouldn't be hard for anyone involved in the movie business. Even Mr. Tarantino says Battle Royale has been his ""favorite movie of the last 20 years"" The fact that stuck up Suzanne Collins would deny the fact she has never heard of this and that the idea for this book came up of thin air is disgusting. I will add that Battle Royale might not be the most popular movie in America, but regardless Writer Koushun Takami should receive some kind of credit for this, which to my knowledge of now he hasn't been."

","First: Battle Royale VS. Hunger Games...<br/><br/>I'm not going to comment on this. I did see Battle Royale some time ago, but my intention here wasn't on comparing those 2 movies.<br/><br/>Second: I usually don't read books... I'm a lazy bastard and usually prefer to simply watch a movie... But because of all the hype on Hunger Games, I thought I'd give the book a try. And to be honest: I loved it. I loved the characters, I loved this whole 'poor districts vs. wealthy Capitol'-part, I loved the actual 'games' and many other things.<br/><br/>But this movie... wow, that was bad o.O How did it get the 7,3/10 when all the reviews I'm reading are like 3/10 or worse? After reading the book and while watching the movie I noticed that so many good and important parts of the book were skipped here. It seems like a student's poorly done recap of a book he only just read on the bus on the way to school.<br/><br/>By poorly done I mean: - e.g. their fire-costume at the beginning... while reading the book I was like 'woah... I'd love to see that in reality (in the movie)'. But when I actually saw it 2 hrs ago in the movie I thought 'ehmm... that's it? that's some lame CGI-work'. - the characters (e.g. the other participants): they are barely mentioned. Some of them are shown/named, then the next scene shows their (rather quick) death and that's it... forgotten... - the control-center scenes. Oh my God - I had to mention them... those are so bad. Did they hire a trainee and let him do a quick work in 3D Blender?<br/><br/>I'm sorry if my review isn't as detailed as many others here - but so was the movie. I'm just so very disappointed that I had to post my (very first) review here. I thought about watching the other movies and skipping the reading-part (lazy bastard, you remember...?) but I'm just too afraid those movies are as bad as this one and that I might actually miss a good story."
"mjscheer89","6","4","4","1 May 2012"," Hollywood ""Ruined Another""
","Let me start off by saying the casting was really good but thats the only thing good about ""Hunger Games"". The director and others took major key plot points/characters out of the book. For instance the Avox girl who in the books plays a pivotal part with Katness and the capital. Also they took out how Katness really got the Mockingjay pin and why the capital and President Snow are so evil. I also didn't like how they made this feel like the next teenage girl twilight movie trilogy. The Twilight movies sucked too and now since twilight series is ending Hollywood has gone and ruined a great book so they can bring in the crazed teenage girls to watch a movie that probably some have not even read. I was very disappointed with the movie and thought they put no effort what so ever into making ""Hunger Games"" into what it really could have been. A great book series one of my favorites turned into a disappointing and uneventful movie."

","The reviews for this movie are ridiculous, I can't understand where all the high ratings are comings from (Possible hormones?). The actors are competent, a mile better than that twilight rubbish - decent cast; but the implementation of the filming and the way the story is portrayed is poor. Most people will have read the books, if not - do, the film is a poor reflection. Not enough focus on the circumstance the people have been forced to live under, nice scenes up until the hero's get to district 1, but pre-arena and in the arena the story changes from telling the story to a number of poorly imagined variations of the set pieces in the book, to such an extent that it gets embarrassing to watch. Each 'major' scene is trimmed to its absolute minimal essence and does not link well chronologically. Suddenly Katniss finds some random blood and voilà, there is Peter? I'm sorry - but cake decorating and being Leonardo DaVinci in body painting, with no links or explaining material? Absolute rot, and just accepting on one or two arrow shots that Katniss is ""Herne the Hunter"" reborn does not scan well, and without the books support its a bit of a head nod ""Yeah right"" for too much of her exploits.<br/><br/>I saw Pirates on the same day, which blew me away, creative, good characters and story and compared to a poorly told story with a huge budget; I would take it any day of the week.<br/><br/>Imagine ""The Golden Compass"" but a better story and acting; i.e. it still sucks like a kid on a MacDonalds milkshake; but you don't feel 'quite' as bad for the production crew...<br/><br/>Also, almost nobody has mentioned how its a blatant rip-off of The Running Man - only with teenagers, The Running Man is superior in so may respects, but this film has the advertisers buck and a lot of money men rubbing their hands. Lets hope this overrated debacle improves in the second and (groan) third parts.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, the film with such a small amount of change in the direction and a few better linking scenes could have been excellent, but as it stands it simply isn't a good film. One of the main bugbears is the lack of involvement from the outside world when the combatants are in the arena; a few poorly chosen scenes and some weird sky-dome CG - nothing of Haymitch's efforts on the outside, crowd reactions to internal events, sponsors gifts etc... (I'm sorry - but the soup scene after so much focus on this aspect in the books, is simply poor storytelling) just random unjustified huge escalations in the social situations, which also does not bear out the book. i.e. the populace has been watching this show for 74 years, yet all of a sudden one of the contestant dies (The young herb girl, uh-huh) yet now they are so peeved they revolt violently. 5-6 out of 10 is fair, but for the money they spent and the advertising overdrive 4 is more accurate.<br/><br/>If you haven't read the books, you'll wonder what all the fuss is about, and if you did read the books - you will moreso.<br/><br/>Wait for the DVD; or better still don't watch it - suckers to the advertisers one and all :-("

","I read the first book and thought it was crap, boring, clichéd and repetitive. I also think it's for kids anyway regardless of the 'gore' considering I saw it being sold in the children's section anyway. I only read a bit of the next book out of curiosity but realised that I couldn't bother to finish such a crap book :L. It was so stupid and unoriginal. In my opinion they messed up with the characters too. Gale doesn't seem right and neither does Katniss. Katniss is meant to be 16 whereas Jennifer is not. I liked the bow and arrow thing but that's probably because I was interested in it before I bothered with 'The Hunger Games'. I fell for it because every one seemed to be reading it and saying how good it was. <br/><br/>If you're about 14/15 or so, you might like this film and the books of course. I'm 16 and I prefer reading books with more intellectual elements to them. I don't even need to watch the film to judge how stupid it was."
"djkimic","7","23","34","25 March 2012"," The Sadden Misadventure of the movie known as The Hunger Games
","Warning: This review contains spoilers!!!<br/><br/>I am a fan of The Hunger Games Books. I have just read the first book a week prior to viewing the movie. The book captivated me...it drawn me into its world of systematic oppression via the madness of a celebration called the Hunger Games. When It came to the movie itself I felt as though the directors completely miss the mark. The directors manage captured the essence of the nation of Panem but have succeeded in missing the emotional connections to all of the characters and arrange the story oddly. They have added details that I felt fill in some of the holes in the book, but left out so many details that would have been crucial for viewers. The rest will contain spoilers so if you want to stop reading here, I advise you to do so. <br/><br/>The first 20 minutes of this film was boring....it was quiet. It lacked dialogs there for it lacked interest. However the images of District 12 was dynamic. The pitiful looks of the people were believable. The bleak look of lost hope was beautifully portrayed. But the film itself was far too quiet. For a film that promotes a soundtrack, it surely lack musical expression. During the silent flashes of life in District 12 they could have strategically placed an musical mix to amplify the emotion of living in the District. <br/><br/>Next the way they could have improved was the characterization of the people. Effie and Katnis hit the nail on the head, I couldn't have asked for any better examples. Haymitch was not drunk enough. The book had a comedic quality to the way Haymitch was drunk as a skunk but still had the wits to mentor Katnis and Peeta. Peeta was an OK character although he look somewhat similar to Cato. It was hard to decipher the difference between the two in their fight towards the end. The portrayal of the Capital people was genius. Their interest in the superficial and entertainment in the Hunger games was both naive and annoying. The play fight between the capital kids was a nice touch. Cinna was cool, calm and collective which was great, however it seem to register to the audience as an unintended romance between him and Katnis. <br/><br/>Speaking of relationships, lets discuss the lack of one between Katnis and Peeta. It was incredibly cheesy the way they made their ""love"" scene. And the strange flashbacks to the rainy night by the bakery was horribly placed. People who never read the book did not understand its purpose even when Peeta later made reference to it. A friend of mine who never read the book said it look like that event took place like a week before the reaping. When in actuality the book placed that event 4 years ago when Katnis was 12. Also Katnis mourning of Rue was heart wrenching scene in the movie as well as the book. However the movie failed to show the build of the relationship between Katnis and Rue. All the audience saw, was two allies eating, sleeping and plotting together. No one saw the true connection of friendship between the two. <br/><br/>As far as other scenes go Katnis hallucinations, the elevator, left audience sitting with obvious question marks as they looked on. Other questions that arise was, why is President Snow always in a rose garden? Why didn't Cato see Katnis when she watched him killed that one kid? Why was Katnis' face so perfectly clean throughout the Hunger Games? <br/><br/>Lastly what they missed was the setup with the mocking-jay pin. The book had its source of the mocking-jay pin coming from a friend of Katnis rather than buying it from the Hob. This was a significant piece of information once you read the 2nd book. I wasn't upset nor really pleased with the end of the film but I did like how they left you at the end of film wondering if that really was the end. Mainly because it leaves the possibility of a second movie that may cover the 2nd book of the trilogy. <br/><br/>Overall the film missed so much but captured so little. I did wonder how people would react to the idea of watching children fight to the bloody death for a film. With all things considered I give this film a 5. It seemed rushed but if they do come out with the next installment of the Hunger Games Trilogy I will be there, yet again for opening weekend, with the hope that the second film will go beyond all expectations."
"yfguitarist","5","189","337","24 March 2012"," Battle Royale Lite
","Not comparing this to Battle Royale is impossible - the premise is too similar to be ignored. I'm extremely biased as well, considering Battle Royale is one of my all-time favorite films/books/graphic novels. So let's get this rant out of the way: The Hunger Games takes the concept of Battle Royale and waters it down to a product more accessible to a wider audience, specifically the younger crowd. My biggest problem with this is it loses the impact of Battle Royale - a frightening, beautiful, orgiastic display of shocking violence and social commentary. What makes it so twisted is that the contestants are all fellow students and friends, and we get to know many of the students, making their deaths more disturbing. In The Hunger Games, we follow two contestants and the rest are nameless, and with the exception of one young black girl, their deaths are meaningless (and mostly off-screen). The fact that the violence is so much more tame seems irresponsible - we don't see how horrific and terrifying it would be. The characters in The Hunger Games are black-and-white, good and evil with no grey areas, whereas the characters in Battle Royale feature heroes, antiheroes, complete monsters, and terrified teens. They're plunged into a situation and act like normal teens would, freaking out, committing suicide, going ax crazy, professing love, etc.<br/><br/>As a film, The Hunger Games is certainly not bad - it's a well-made, well-acted spectacle that is entertaining albeit predictable. It takes its time getting to the action, but when the contestants are finally released it's thrilling (there's also a particularly intense scene involving a wasp's nest). It's probably the best we can expect from what a predictable Hollywood remake of Battle Royale would look like - significantly toned down, with a gorgeous cast, and a soundtrack featuring Taylor Swift, Maroon 5, and a couple good indie bands (as opposed to Battle Royale's classical music). I also like that The Hunger Games focuses more on the media aspect of the game, which was mostly ignored in Battle Royale. It's much less melodramatic than Battle Royale as well. The bizarre costume designs are great too.<br/><br/>TL;DR - It all comes down to taste. If you prefer fantasy stories, don't like subtitles, and have no desire to see kids kill each other in over-the-top gory fashion, you'll like The Hunger Games. If you're a fan of horror, exploitation, or extreme Asian cinema, you'll like Battle Royale. I prefer the latter, but The Hunger Games could've been a lot worse."
"avatar_108","3","12","16","7 April 2012"," So pedestrian I was tempted to buy it a bus timetable.
","I had heard so much hype about Hunger Games, I admit I was a little bit blind sided. I decided to go into this with an open mind - Hollywood/U.S Film & T.V industry, whatever you want to call it have been snapping up the book to movie adaptations & much to their credit, they're getting much better at it. I can see why, it's immensely profitable. Say what you will about Twilight but those movies sold books, and Edward's face (whatever his name is) sells teen girl magazines. The Harry Potter series as very decent, and I haven't met many people who have had a bad word to say about Game of Thrones. So I must concede I was surprised at how bland Hunger Games is. <br/><br/>Katniss is your typical diamond in the rough, volunteering to save her sister from the barbarian spectacle that is the Hunger Games. She is swept away to the ""Capitol"" to participate in these Hunger Games where she is given every bit of assistance to becoming the most successful candidate, which she does. This character is carved from ""strong woman"" clichés.<br/><br/>The problem I have with this movie is that it is so very pedestrian - there is no tension, Katniss is never really in doubt as to the being the superior contestant, everything she needs, sponsors, and such, come along simply as a matter of course. There's no tension & every possible source of tension or complication is quickly smoothed aside. Might Katniss have to kill the guy who's in love with her? No, because the powers that be decide that ""young love"" might pacify the Districts, so they decide to let a couple from both districts win.<br/><br/>The context is supposed to be the 74th Hunger Games yet for some reason none of these behind the scenes power players like the President, or Seneca Crane had ever planned for the contingency that her district might win? Apparently this is linked tenuously to upheaval in another District (I must admit I really had stopped caring) - again I found myself wondering, ""Wow, you've been killing these people's children for nearly a century, and now one of them gets mad?""<br/><br/>Again even the premise stretched credulity - the Capitol kept the Districts in line by killing their children? I'm no politician from an art deco future but I'm fairly certain that taking children by force and then forcing them to compete in a gladiatorial contest will not ensure their allegiance.<br/><br/>The movie meanders from point A to point B, with nary a complication or tension. I found Katniss and Peeter's performances wooden in the first half of the movie and average in the second. The romantic angle was yet another example of how /pedestrian/ this movie really is. I'm supposed to feel something for Katniss, but it seems she was given most of the advantages out of everyone. <br/><br/>The movie just ambles from one point to the next, the result never really in doubt. Finishing this was a real chore. If you are a serious film goer, I wouldn't expect too much from the Hunger Games. Pedestrian is the word that keeps coming to mind."

","I had been following the trailer for long time. The movie had good reviews and great rating in IMDb. But the movie does not scale up to the hype or the expectation.<br/><br/>The story was great, till the Games start. They had build up much hype in the first 30 minutes and you expect all the action to start once the Game starts... You keep waiting till the climax - wishing at least the climax will have some action. But, sorry no action for you.<br/><br/>Too much predictable drama. Twilight had much more action than this one.

"CheeryToes","2","24","36","2 April 2012"," miserable adaptation of a terrific read
","(spoilers abound) My daughter read the first book after I had read all three and we went to the movie yesterday. I don't know where to start with how disappointed I was. There was little to no character development. You don't understand the bond between Katniss and Peeta - you don't like Josh Hutcherson - terrible terrible casting there. I was excited with Cinna's casting, but they don't show what an important part of her life he becomes in a short time or even the three who make her over. The arena scene was limp ...all the gripping emotional struggles she goes through, are virtually left out. Things that are important are changed...the Mockingjay pin's origin, for instance. The (spoiler)animals at the end with the horrible eyes of the dead. The Mockingjays don't SING they whistle. The thing about Mockingjays is they talk in the voice of the speaker. They would have sung Rue's song. From the initial shaky camera work to the casting, to the last scene...I did NOT like this movie. Terrible disappointment as far as I'm concerned. If you love the books, you'll go see the movie, just be prepared to dislike it. In fact, parts of it at the beginning, well, practically the first hour and a half are terribly slow and boring."
"ps-ashok1983","2","24","36","31 March 2012"," Waste of time
","This is really a junk movie after a long time seeing in Hollywood (after some of the Harry Potter series :)). The first 30-45 minutes is giving lots of hype, but the other 65% is real waste of time - the concept is little fine but not that great for the hype given; the cinematography has actually spoiled the entire movie. Real thanks to the camera man and the editor for that (I think they took real effort to shake the picture). I don't understand why the camera had shaken all the time for all chasing and fighting scenes. I'd a real head-ache after watching this movie. For sure it's not a worthy movie compare to movies like Narnia, Harry Potter first 5 parts."
"johnschulz66","3","21","31","28 March 2012"," Could have been so much better...
","I have a lot of problems with this movie. First off, I never read the books and didn't really know anything about this movie going in. I had heard the basic premise that kids were going to be fighting to the death in some game controlled by a fascist, totalitarian state and it intrigued me. This sounded like a smart, sci-fi that should reveal something about how we glorify violence or give our government too much power or something. I expected to be enlightened, at least to some degree. Let's start with the good. Jennifer Lawrence is fantastic as Katniss, our reluctant heroine. Her performance was one of the few things that kept me from walking out of the theater. The plot's kind of interesting, I guess. It kept me awake. Now on to the bad. The movie has no idea what it's trying to be. It tries to show us how horrible the government is, but I never really seemed to notice anything that made them look bad aside from the games. It tries to be an action flick, but no action occurs until the last hour or so when the games start. And even then, the camera is so jerky and the director cuts so often it's hard to tell exactly what is happening. I couldn't tell whether the screenplay was awful or the production because I found it very hard to care for anyone in this story. We're supposed to feel bad for Katniss and her sister, but we never really see anything that shows how horrible her life is. There are a couple of moments later where we get a glimpse into her terrible past, but I couldn't find any time to care because they jumped quickly past this and and went right back to the slaughtering of children. Oh yeah, speaking of slaughtering children, why was this movie PG-13? This is a very R-rated story, but I guess they wanted to market it to the teenage audience or something. The lack of an R-rating really bogs down the film through poor action sequences and unbelievable dialogue. I guess the filmmakers just wanted to make money instead of making art. This really did feel as juvenile as Twilight and that really hurt the movie. <br/><br/>OK, this is all well and good, but I really didn't start to hate this movie until the end. I know this is supposed to be the next Harry Potter franchise or whatever, but the main difference between this and Harry Potter is that every Harry Potter movie can stand on it's own (excluding the last two). Each movie had a plot line that, while adding to the over-arching plot of the series, was independent and could stand alone as one story. The Hunger Games does not do this. In the end, I felt cheated. Nobody won. Katniss has to go back to her life of hunting and caring for her family and, as far as I can tell, nothing is changed. The government is still in power and the riot is quelled and broken up like its a high school party being busted by the cops. <br/><br/>Overall, I felt the good acting couldn't overcome the poorly written script and shoddy directing. The filmmakers didn't want to make art, they just wanted teenage girls to give them a lot of money. And they succeeded in that. My theater was filled with girls gasping and cheering as these children on-screen killed each other. Good thing I saw it during matinée, because paying full price for this is unthinkable."

You will figure the entire plot out at least 10min in advance throughout the whole movie. <br/><br/>The story, illogical and dreadful. The acting, just painful. The special effects budget is spent on the wrong scenes and feels just wasted. The humor, none whatsoever even though it tries at some points. <br/><br/>It is also very clear that they put a whole team of cultural marxists in charge of the production. You have the multicultural towns being oppressed by the white-only bad people.

","I was very excited about the movie hearing it is so great and in the first week millions of dollars were paid from the audience because it's such a great movie. <br/><br/>I went to a theater with a buddy and it was a shock. From the beginning till the end the movie was very unsatisfying. <br/><br/>Some examples:<br/><br/>Why didn't she shoot a guy in his face instead of shooting the apple?<br/><br/>Why do people team up nevertheless they have to kill each other and why does every one sleep so that she could escape?<br/><br/>And after a few days of surviving the girl who gets shot with a bolt looks like she just came from a wellness-weekend pulling the bolt out and taking it easy and is relaxed.<br/><br/>Another unforgivable thing is that the controlling people just add some bad monsters to the surface... like they could create anything what they want and place it where they want. Is this a startrek-like- holodeck? Instead of bad-ass-monsters they could just materialize some food or more useful stuff...<br/><br/>And besides all the crap the movie even don't have some nice visuals like special effects.<br/><br/>Yes, it reminds me of battle royale... to be honest, that movie was great compared to 'The hunger games'. <br/><br/>It's not a bad adaption of the book written by Suzanne Collins...<br/><br/>even more worse... she ripped the mainstory from 'Battle Royale' and made a poor remake of the original story.

How hard is it to get a tripod out and film a nice shot?<br/><br/>Half the film is spent in the quite boring preparation for ""The Hunger Games."" Several cheesy scenes, weak dialogue and the continuous struggle to make character interesting and/or likable felt too drawn out. Once the games begin we are thrust into a beautiful forest landscape. The camera shots improve and the action begins.<br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence was fine as the lead, she manages to show enough emotion and shock for someone in her position. She's easy on the eye and quite likable. Stanley Tucci and Elizabeth Banks both overacted horrible characters, Lenny Kravitz channeled a vacant gay man for no reason, Woody was fine and Donald Sutherland sadly has minimal screen time. <br/><br/>Disgusting set design, hideous costumes and poor special effects lather a boring futuristic world.

However, at one point, Katniss' (Jennifer Lawrence) mourning of Rue was too dramatic and over the top.<br/><br/>The shaky camera effect was at first mildly irritating and annoying, but I guess the audience becomes adjusted to the shakiness about a third of the way into the film.<br/><br/>Some of the scenes were very unbelievable e.g. The evil gang failing to kill Katniss because she climbed up a tree. I distinctively recall one of the clique members being able to throw a pocket knife skillfully enough to kill a lizard.... and the rival archer gave up after two arrow shots? <br/><br/>I found Katniss's naivety to be too unbelievable.

Also the camera work was wobbly, like Bourne times 10. There was a scene where 2 girls punched, i don't know who threw the punch. The acting was substandard. There was a ridiculous love story thrown in. Woody Harrelson's character is inconsistent. First he is a drunk that does not care about anything.

Yet another case of a director taking a great work by a great author and thinking s(he) is even greater, so the work has to be distorted somehow, so the director's ego's stamp is on it, so everyone will say ""this director is a genius in his own right. (NOT). I guess it's tough to be a mediocre director faced with putting on a work of greatness. Where is the director's input? Sorta like opera, where they intentionally sing out of tune and harshly, and those egoists call that art. Opera has been around for hundreds of years, yet this horrible rendering of it is only 50 years or so old. Movies have been around less time, but they're already mucking it up so they can say, ""look at me, I can f*ck it up, and I did, so go blow"", like children in a playground. It's really amazing how many shills the producer got to vote high ratings and give good reviews. Actually, I have to commend the producer and director for the con they perpetrated. Obviously, they put in the least amount of cost and work, and they got mega-millions back for their paltry effort. The bottom line, thats the reality of our world. I'm sure one could write a high school English essay about the role of ""bottom line"" in the ""Hunger Games"" book. That might have more value then this movie dreck. Remember what that means?"

"jasonlivesagain","1","13","18","14 April 2012"," THE HUNGER GAMES: Boring, disconnected, and all-around pointless
","If at any point in your miserable existence you considered watching this, consider something else. Like suicide.<br/><br/>I was quite shocked to find out after watching the movie that people actually thought this was good. Hollywood releases crap on a weekly basis, but this was terrible. I also found out it was based on some books which were popular with teenage girls or something. Had I known that, I would have skipped it for sure.<br/><br/>It was one of the most boring films I've seen in theaters in a long time. Even worse when you consider it's 2+ hours long (and will feel like twice that) and poorly made. It moves along at a snail's pace. Occasionally the camera shakes, it speeds up a little and is edited poorly to give the illusion of action. Ah, PG-13.<br/><br/>Watching this movie is about as boring as waiting in your doctor's office with all those crappy outdated magazines then painful because the doctor happens to be a proctologist. It brought up memories of films with similarities, however remote, with THG. It's like a combination of BATTLE ROYALE, THE RUNNING MAN, GLADIATOR, TWILIGHT... Wait, TWILIGHT? Combining anything with TWILIGHT will end in disaster.<br/><br/>One of the main characters' names is Peeta. Not Peter. I thought Lawrence's character was retarded or really wanted a pita. Was Peter too lowbrow for you? You know this work is going to be over-dramatic and overserious when the author has to work at some of these names here. Coriolanus? Now you're inadvertently reminding me of Shakespeare, too. We get it, it's supposed to mirror Ancient Rome, gladiatorial combat, whatever. Your work can hearken back to the past without being explicit about it. SUBTLETY, WHAT'S THAT?<br/><br/>This film has a talent of featuring reputable actors who do nothing. I get this weird feeling that Woody Harrelson was genuinely drunk because he realized what a terrible film he was in. At least, I hope he was. Donald Sutherland shows up, is barely used and is almost like a punchline in this joke of a film. The film itself basically accomplishes nothing. I don't buy the 'sequel' defense. A film should stand on its own; also, I'm even less interested in watching a sequel. Plus, that basically paints Hollywood as a bunch of money-grubbing douchebags. Oh wait...<br/><br/>They also introduce plot points that go nowhere. There are cameras that monitor the contestants. At first I thought it was going to be like THE RUNNING MAN where they end up subverting the population into revolt. That sort of happens after a little girl dies and it's supposed to be emotional because it's a little girl but I could really care less. I actually laughed. A bunch of people in her 'district' see this and they start rioting. And then nothing. It's never ever brought up again. At the very end, the two main characters survive, and they've changed the rules and nature of the game or something, and you get the feeling it's supposed to be important, but it's not. The movie ends on a flat note. The whole movie is like that, it just goes on for awhile and then stops.<br/><br/>The general story and its universe are easy to understand. But some things seem to come out of nowhere, sometimes disrupting the flow. There's how the game's overseers can interfere by blowing things up and setting things on fire. By the end, there are huge mutated dogs sprouting out of the ground and they expect us to go along with it. If you have no idea what's going on and why there are all of a sudden dogs coming out of nowhere (basically meaning that if you didn't read the books) you'll be completely taken out of the film, wondering if one of the employees spiked your drink with acid or if the movie is really THAT stupid. The overseers actually look like they're genetically altering dogs. So basically in this future you can create mutated dogs during a game show. And then make them disappear just as quickly. Okay.<br/><br/>The big problem is tonal shifts from scene-to-scene are so jarring that it completely takes you out of the film. It's like the movie is experiencing these strange mood swings. It's also way too serious. As a result a lot of scenes end up being unnecessarily cheesy or unintentionally funny. Young 'actors' trying to act tough. Kids dying. Stanley Tucci looking like an over-sized Oompa-Loompa. I took pretty seriously a man dressed as a bat fighting a guy in clown makeup, so I guess they just failed here.<br/><br/>There isn't an underlying mood or tone that holds the film together. It's not that you can't splice different scenes together to make a proper narrative and hold a proper tone. Unfortunately, this director and his crew are so incompetent that they did a horrible job. It shouldn't be THAT hard. It's a straight forward story aimed at teenagers. I don't even know what they were going for. An undercurrent of sadness? Being overwhelmed like the protagonists? It's hard to tell.<br/><br/>I'll just end this with the romance, which I gather is supposed to be one of the real focuses, but feels like it's just shoehorned in there. It's poorly conceived, even poorly executed. It's cheesy. And unbelievable. It seemed to me like some really overlong and boring fan fiction some teenage girl would write. I was almost right. It was actually written by a middle-aged woman. RUN FOR THE EXITS.<br/><br/>But yeah, the entire movie ends up feeling like they were trying to splice together footage from three different sources. Seriously, that's gotta be pretty bad when your film ends up feeling like what Godfrey Ho actually does."

"ravendoc","2","13","18","5 April 2012"," Technically the worst movie I have had the misfortune to view
","I was physically ill after more than two hours of watching this technically inept rendering of what should have been an incredible experience. I love the Hunger Games books and while the movie was a good adaptation and fairly true to the first book I could hardly look at the screen while the camera person shot it like a home movie. I understand that the Director is to blame and blame him I do. It is fine to include a couple of spots that show disorientation such as after the Tracker Jacker incident but this movie only included a couple of scenes where one could actually look at the screen. I really hate that the director ruined a perfectly good movie with this type of irresponsible filming. I cannot believe that he could sit in the movie and watch the results and not know that this would be difficult to watch visually. It had nothing to do with anything else in the movie. If this had not been so technically poor it would have been one of my highest rated movies. As it is, I will not watch the sequels if done by this director and will not purchase the DVD to have in my collection. What would be the point? I had to keep my eyes closed much of the time and listen to the movie because that roller coaster ride gave me a headache for hours after I got out. The actors were great and the scenery was incredible (when I could focus on it rather than being sick)."
"ihertia","3","13","18","5 April 2012"," So disappointed...
","Okay, so let me say this first - I have read the ""Hunger Games"" books, all three of them in a very short amount of time. I absolutely loved them - they were suspenseful, catchy, interesting, touching and overall an amazing read. So if you happen to be one of those people who saw this movie, hated this movie and decided not to read the books - please don't. The books are gold, seriously.<br/><br/>The movie however...I honestly have no idea where to start. So many things were wrong with this movie, I'm having a hard time keeping track with all of them.<br/><br/>First off, the shaky camera. This movie is filmed in a Blair Witch project style - ALL of it. That is to say, you get 10 minutes, at most, of focused camera time, before it starts shaking and blurring and giving you headaches. I've heard some people say that this was done in order to censor the violent scenes with kids killing each other and such. That may be true, but it's still a horrible idea. I left the cinema with a huge headache because of it.<br/><br/>Second of all, I think the biggest problem for this movie is that, unlike the books, it was neither emotionally touching or action-packed.<br/><br/>The action is missing, largely because of all the censoring, I'm guessing, so the movie can have its ridiculous and out-of-place rating. Half of the movie is spent with Katniss going through the entire pre-Hunger Games phases, which worked great for the book, but not for the movie. Technically, this part is supposed to make you empathize with the characters and get to know them better, only it fails so hard that, at the end of it, you not only don't care for the characters, but you're also bored because you were expecting action-y stuff if you haven't read the books.<br/><br/>Then, you think, the Games finally start. FINALLY, there will be some action...except there isn't - not really. Because of the shaky camera, you can't understand much of what's happening, and because the movie doesn't really introduce 3\4 of the characters to you, you just get to see some random kids dying, often in stupid, uninteresting ways. Yawn.<br/><br/>*SPOILERS AHEAD!!! BE WARNED!!* The thing that bothered me the most about this movie was the lack of any emotional connection to any of the characters we are supposed to care for. There may be very little of it regarding Prim, Katniss's sister. But other than that - Rue for example - it is severely lacking. In the books, we get to know Rue, and maybe even care for her, and we are sorry to see her die. In the movie, she's just some random black girl who gets killed. Again, yawn. Same goes for Peeta and everyone else. As for Katniss, she gets plenty of camera time, except that she is written poorly. In the end, I felt about as emotionally connected to her as I would feel with a wall. The acting wasn't bad, she was just written poorly. *END OF SPOILER* <br/><br/>You can either approach this movie from a human point of view - make the audience care for the characters and sympathize with their situation, or you can approach it from an action-y point of view - throw in kick-ass effects, lots of action, make it interesting and exciting. You cannot do both in two hours time. That may work for other movies, but these books don't provide the proper material for such blending. The writers tried to do both, and ended up with none. Throw in the awful censorship - the entire point was to show the world how horrifying and terrible the Hunger Games were, which required some good measure of shocking images and display of violence. Add to that the shaky camera effects, some very ridiculous scenes, and you get the worst movie (by far) that I have seen in a long time.<br/><br/>Bottom line - if you are truly interested in this idea, if you found the trailer interesting, if you feel any urge to watch this movie, just pass and buy the books. The books are extremely enjoyable, while the movie can simply be summed up in one word: fail."

","As long as you leave your brain at home and accept massive plot holes it is an OK film. However, this film is being advertised as somehow wanting to teach us something.. well.. so it wants to be taken seriously... OK. questions. Why if everybody is hungry do all the people look well fed, have perfect teeth and skin? How come that the entire district 12 only has maybe a hundred children at age between 12 and 18? That means it can only have a population of a few thousand. How come the main city seems to have thousands of inhabitants living in wealth with high-tech everywhere, this just doesn't make sense. I just don't believe that all kids from district 1 are mean killing machines eager to volunteer, this is obviously only there so that we don't feel sorry if they get killed. Sorry. Bad story.

After I watched the movie I went out and bought the book. upon reading the book i noticed a lot of things i wish were in the movie. mainly explaining why life was like that, during the movie i found myself asking a lot of questions as to why, why did the hunger games even exist? why were there 12 districts? nothing was explained. also the main point of the book was non existent in the movie. it showed hardly any hardship and the parts that tried to portray that were disappointing and cheesy at best. the actual competition was lacking as well. It is supposed to be brutal? defiantly not, i did not find it convincing. i hope they make the next movies better, explain more things since not everyone read the books before going and i hope they change their target audience to do these books proper justice."
"Tobbersly","4","37","60","23 March 2012"," No no no please nooooooo
","Why? God whyyy??? OK, first of all, I'm a big hunger games fan, I love the books, and I was really looking forward this movie, when I heard the director was going to be Gary Ross, and Suzanne Collins wrote the screenplay I thought this couldn't go wrong, I loved the cast so much, but the main idea if the books, the Capitol's cruelty, and Katniss' Braveness and challenging life on District 12 isn't showed like in the book. Also Rue and Katniss relationship wasn't developed, it felt weird that in the movie they just met, and then when Rue died Katniss cried so much,. I felt that the essence of the book just wasn't there, and I'm terribly disappointed, I really wanted this movie to be amazing, and really successful, the book was so good, it deserved the most amazing movie, but sadly in 2 hours and 22 minutes they were unable to make a decent movie. The camera was shaky, the battle arena looked soooooo cheap and pathetic. What I can praise about the film are Jennifer's acting skills, make up and dressing on the Capitol citizens, Effie, capitol buildings and futuristic characteristics"
"rebeccajanecraig","1","8","10","27 July 2014"," I've read the book, and I'm still not impressed.
","(SPOILERS) So I watched this movie before I've read the book (boy, I learned my lesson when I did that with Percy Jackson) and I was hardly paying attention. I drank four Cokes, and I had to go (movie theaters do that to me). I was also with friends, so I tried my best to hold it and watch. I liked nothing about this movie. I have developed a distaste for dystopia ever since watching/reading The Hunger Games. Since I wasn't really paying attention, I sorta let this slid. It was later I received a book report on a book of my choosing. So, not being a reader, I choose one my sister had in her closet. Only now do I understand why she put it there. There's a reason Suzanne Collins' book is 5 bucks. But I'm not gonna discuss the book, it's the movie that's even worse. I have never liked Katniss. So ""Bold"" and ""Brave"". . . Yea, she was wearing a fire-dress and tied herself to a tree. That's so daring. Oh no, what if those other kids actually used common sense and burnt it down? Then I guess she could break out the Karate she learned from the owl in the woods back home. Katniss had no real character growth, in my opinion. Yes, capital people are snobs, we got that the moment you were all expected to fight to the death. Katniss became so resourceful. Finding 11's little girl was the best thing that happened to her. And in the end she got speared in the gut. Katniss, wow, I expected you to tear up, but shouldn't you be, I don't know, running for your life, not placing pretty flowers on her dead body? Oh, wait, it's the sentimental value, right? So while Katniss is speaking for the trees and take a hundred naps, Peetah has gone Darthvader and joined the dark side. So while he was secretly protecting Katniss by playing the bad guy's lap dog, he was cunningly scheming for a way to save her. Why? Cause he developed a crush on her the first day of school. (why do they have school if most are gonna enter the death games?) So, while he's making his ""Peetah's Clever and Intelligent Plan"" (How To Train Your Dragon Book readers get that) Katniss got close and personal with ""The Bees"". Thank God she doesn't have allergies. So Katniss kills a girl, looks very mean for hurting Peetah, and runs away. With another enemy. Who healed her? Why? It's all or nothing? How did Rue even know Katniss wasn't gonna kill her? Big bugging issue for me; Peetah's a baker and a genius artist. There is no way anyone in their town can afford a cake with that much icing detail. And their icing should be mud, right? If Peetah was bleeding out and dying, how did he find the time to paint one side of his entire body? Where did he get the paint? Why'd he ""trust"" Katniss when she thought he was trying to kill her? Also, what's this ""I'm gonna kill this chick, and that dude, but not you. I have the perfect chance in this Life or Death battle, but you look pretty cool, so I'm gonna let you hunt me down later. EVEN THOUGH you and your partner are about to die and I could win. . ."" from 11's boy? Never read past Book 1, never want to.<br/><br/>There are times when you watch an okay movie and people urge you to read the ""so much better"" book. This is one of those times I really regretted it. Being a die-hard book fan, I have a utter most respect for any and every writer, no matter what. The fact that you can write something, and have the guts to show it, is in itself a great accomplishment. But when you take an original idea and somehow decrease it's decency to mundane, that's when you lose yourself as a writer. Same with copying (we saw Stephanie Myers do that to Animorphs with The Host) Same with movies. Taking something great and making it better is amazing but also rare. Taking an already diluted and paper-thin idea and making it worse is astounding. Still, I can respect the fact that some DID film the movie and put the ideas together. But who's the lazy-guy that did all the shots? One of an leg, an ear, Rue's dead body's side, Katniss stepping on a leaf. That's just sad.<br/><br/>And I'll say it again, I love movies and books. There both amazing creative works. But, this is leaving a bad-taste in my mouth. There are only two books out of hundreds I've read that I actual disliked. Only one book have I stopped in the middle because of how bad it was. I finished the Hunger Game's to find the sad cliché of Katniss using Peetah but finding out she actually liked him somewhat. Oh, but look who's not interested after years of stalking. So prepare for the next movie, Katniss tries to get Peetah to fall in love with her again. And the finale! They are together, but something is separating them. Let me guess, Katniss is somewhere so far far away, and it breaks both their fragile little hearts.<br/><br/>I actually wanna dare people to watch this, and see if they agree with me or disagree. That whole ""I can do camouflage cause I'm a baker"" still gets to me, and is a poor poor excuse to make Peetah a little less useless. 1/10, for a sad movie adaption, a sad plot to begin with (could have been decent) and for giving Katniss a useless baker to love instead of that amazing, great looking, wonderful, other dude (He was so totally interest. . . sorta. (Yeah, I so remember his name, I just wanna make him seem. . . mysterious). . ."

They ruined one of the best books around by pandering to the generation of romance obsessed people. The film should have had far more violence in it but no instead it was filled with nearly all romance and scene setting. They did this for one simple reason so that it had a larger audience, it could and should have been at least a 15 but it wasn't so they could make more money. Say what you want about twilight but at least they tried to stick to the book, hunger games didn't they turned a fight to the death into a romance.

The two main character's (Katniss & Peeta) relationship & back story were treated clumsily and carelessly.

Everything felt flat. <br/><br/>The action parts made me dizzy,I can't really see what's going on because the camera was too shaky. And lastly, attention to detail, it just bothered me to see how almost all of the tributes looked really clean for someone who had been living in the woods for days, even Rue's nails (on her death scene) were so clean, as clean as the Capitol's residents' coming fresh out of the shower. <br/><br/>I wanted to give this movie an even worse score, but out of respect for Suzanne Collins,I give it 4 out of 10."

I forgot about the film pretty much as soon as I left the theatre, and it provoked very little in the way of discussion with my film and literary savvy friends. There's just not enough there.

","First, the idea of a group of innocent people killing each other until one survives is not new, it is the very idea of the earlier book/movie ""Battle Royale"". It's an interesting idea that unsettles a great deal of thinking, and is definitely very hard to think about seriously.<br/><br/>However, the trying of using this idea in the Hunger Games seems just too overwhelming to the authors/producers --- In one sentence, they don't know how to elaborate on this idea, and plainly don't understand it as seen from the movie. <br/><br/>They AVOID discussing in a comprehensive way the subtlety of humanity by simply focusing on the standpoint of two people who is ""by definition good"", and just portrait others as either naive (which is ""good""), or plainly crazy (which is ""bad""). In addition to this simple and naive categorization, none of the good people did anything wrong in the movie, and yet the game with the cruel rules actually can end this way... It just makes it even more simplistic and naive, in other words, Impossible. Why should just the two people from district 12 deserve winning, and can kill others rightfully? Imagine if a majority of contestants are people morally ""OK"", will they kill, and how will they kill each other under this situation? Remember, no matter how morally good they are, the rules of the game still only permits one survivor. I guess the authors have to change the ending as permitting, say, 10 people survive as winners, as they are all ""good""? I can't see any clue of how the authors can resolve any REAL issue from the idea they've taken.<br/><br/>Nothing interesting on this idea can be found from the Hunger Games... As it just AVOIDS it. Then, why do the authors decide to include this idea anyway, if they don't want to elaborate on it? <br/><br/>Indeed, a much better interpretation of the idea can be found from the earlier work of ""Battle Royale"", which make a good try of giving some serious thinking and expression of it.<br/><br/>I would say the Hunger Games is OK for all other parts except its central part --- the game itself."

The movie mostly fails to build any tension at all and is basically a collection of parts from other works (The Running Man anyone?) which makes it utterly predictable (Note: I did NOT read any of the books and went to see it after it was suggested to me by the above mentioned friend).<br/><br/>There were several moments where I honestly wanted to leave the cinema: 1. The wall of fire and fireballs out of nowhere directed at Katniss to drive her back towards the group of allied villains (which Peeta, her dear love, was a part of). 2. The gene modified super wasps' nest as an escape strategy while she is ""hiding"" on the tree (The other super warriors were unable to shoot her out of the tree with bow and arrow and they all sleep happily through the night to wait for her to come down on her own!) and 3. the 3 virtually infused ""dog-beasts"" at the end (Come on!!).<br/><br/>I decided to stay because hope dies last as we all know but unfortunately the remedy for this mess never came...<br/><br/>I give 2 points for:<br/><br/>1. Stanley Tucci as Caesar Flickerman (the only well acted character in this movie!) 2. Jennifer Lawrence's general appearance.<br/><br/>If you want to waste your time and money please be my guest and see this movie."

If the world is going to end this year, I just hope it starts with everyone involved in making this entirely rubbish film. It has nothing going for it whatsoever other than the main character being vaguely pleasing on the eye... Otherwise the art direction is shocking, the dialogue is entirely predictable, and it was just plain boring as nothing actually really happens. I mean the budget was used on what exactly? (save some stupid cg creatures thrown in at the end that were so poorly executed that it was laughable) The guy with the face paint attached to the rock had the entire cinema in uncontrollable laughter at how stupid it was. On the whole it reminds me of a camp, washout, cheesy, trash ridden cross between Demolition Man, Twilight, Running Man and a very poor attempt to get near Battle Royale. Do not waste ya money peeps!

The fact that it's a bunch of kids killing each other in the most barbaric ways and acting gleeful about it is so sickening I wanted to walk out of the theater and demand I get my money back! The only thing that stopped me from leaving the theater is that I ""hoped"" that somehow the surviving kids would realize the error of their ways and overthrow the system.

","On the way home from the Hunger Games we went to the automatic car wash for a bit of entertainment. After wasting two and a half hours in the cinema, watching the suds on the windscreen was a treat. The Hunger Games is desperately slow and gormlessly obvious. The only surprises are supplied by the chronic stupidity of the characters (e.g. constantly wandering around in the open when people with bows and arrows want to kill them), the completely unexplained moral evolution of the good, the bad and the pathetic, the implausible action (e.g. outrunning monster dogs in the dense forest in the pitch dark), and the ludicrous special skills of the combatants (e.g. the ability to make oneself up to blend into rock without any make-up or a mirror). The combatants' acting is wooden. The game show hosts overact and dress stupidly. After the opening 45 minutes waiting for something interesting to happen, the film certainly made me think, but only about how a film as bad as this could be made, released and then positively reviewed. I resorted in the end to making witty asides to my companion and trying, successfully, to give her a fit of the giggles. The Hunger Games is a complete waste of time and electricity. I would like to say that it's the worst film I have ever seen, but I can't because I have seen Battle Los Angeles. Long ago, I saw Battle Royale, of which the Hunger Games appears to be a feeble copy, and I remember is being pretty engaging. Gary Ross, the writer and director of the Hunger Games has written and directed some great films like Big, Pleasantville and Seabiscuit. What happened this time?"

","I was really looking forward to seeing Hollywoods version of the awesome Battly Royale. I know, the author of the book says she had never heard of it before but I am sure the guys in Hollywood were pretty much influenced by it. I enjoyed the first half of the film, getting more into the societies structure and getting info about the games was a good choice, maybe spending half the film outside the battle was a bit much though. On the other hand, the second half totally sucked. The battle was without any believable emotions, character development suddenly stopped and everything came down to a couple of action sequences centered on one person rather than showing emotions and complex interaction of the many. Also, the actual cruelty of these games was not portrayed appropriately. All these things made Battle Royale a greater film and rendered this one a waste of time for me since I have seen it in a much better way before."

I was excited for the movie, not enough to contribute to opening weekend dividends but a friend bought me a ticket, the theater was empty so why not. What a bad decision that was! I left the movie with a headache and nausea. I don't understand how the directors and cinematographers reviewed this movie and were proud of their work. Too many close-up's (who wants to see someone's pores) and shaky camera work absolutely ruined this movie for me. The last fight scene was horrendous! Two blonde males battling to the death, CLOSE UP, you can't tell who is who and who is winningSERIOUSLY?!?! The first book starts out slow, the movie was slower, they followed the books pretty spot on but they left out so much depth. This is the Hunger Games The reason for the Games was not drawn in full detail; you didn't get the feel for how tragic they truly were. Yes, you are sending children to kill each other but WHY? Why is the Capital so rich? Why do the districts submit to this slaughter? Why is Cinna so important to Katniss? Why is Haymitch the drunk that he is? WHY? If you didn't read the books then you're left with so many WHY's. Who knows, maybe they did answer these questions but I was too distracted by the horrible camera work and editing job. Cut here, cut there, here's someone's nose hairs, UGG.

"jediknight-19","1","103","188","27 March 2012"," The Future of American Cinema?
","I'm a big science fiction fan of both movies and literature and usually give the science fiction genre a fairly wide berth. But in the case of 'The Hunger Games' I feel the need to thoroughly pummel the film because of its lack of originality, weak character development, and abundance of predictability. What do I think of 'The Hunger Games'? In a nutshell, think 'Twilight' with a science fiction spin. I'll elaborate on that point a little later.<br/><br/>First let's talk about the total lack of originality. A strikingly similar premise was penned by Japanese author Koushun Takami in novel called 'Battle Royale' which was published in 1999. For those of you who don't read much – probably all the same folks who just love this movie - look for the same title on IMDb as it was adapted to film in 2000.<br/><br/>At first glance I was thinking 'Battle Royale' rip-off all the way, but the more I thought about it, the more another author kept creeping into my gray matterthat author is Stephen King. He wrote a couple of short stories along the same lines. 'The Running Man' in 1982, and 'The Long Walk' in 1979. Heck, you can even throw in pieces of 'Cujo', published by King in 1981. I won't spoil the film for you, but you'll get the 'Cujo' reference if you feel the need to waste your money on a viewing of 'The Hunger Games'. If you're going to write science fiction or make a science fiction film, you need to weave a story that is somehow original. 'The Hunger Games' seems to have pulled elements from various King novellas. So, in my mind 'The Hunger Games' gets a big fat 'F' for originality. Enough said! I'm not even going to mention the fact that the filmmakers must have run short of money because it appears as if they borrowed the wardrobe from 'The Fifth Element' for the ritzy city dwellers. WhoopsI just mentioned it.<br/><br/>Let's move on to the 'Twilight' referenceOK, you know how in 'Twilight' the only Werewolf and Vamp in town both happen to be in love with Bella? Well, here we go reduxthe only two stud muffins - in the supposedly poor hamlet of Katniss (the heroine), both are in love with said female. So what about hunger? Those boys were both built and corn fed. And that's another problem with the moviewhere are the hungry people? Lol Not only that, but the character development was so weak I felt nothing when folks started to die off.<br/><br/>I could go on and on about the holes in this film but I'll stop here. It's enough that's it's not original, lacks in character development, and is as predictable as the lingering smog in L.A. I'm giving this film 1 star – which may be a tad harsh – but I feel the need to counter all the salivating teen girls that evidently love this film as much as little chipmunks love packing goodies in their cheeks. If this is the future of American cinema we're in big trouble folks! Let the chipmunk's rule?I hope not."

And some parts in the movie that were supposed to be serious were instead so ""cheesy"" that half the people watching the movie just laughed.<br/><br/>30 minuets into the movie it hit me, the reason I was finding this movie so unenjoyable was the poor cinematography. 90% of the time the camera was 2"" away from the characters faces. So instead of a cool battle scene we simply saw peoples faces scowling. And because all we could see was their face, there was no context for anything to happen in.

Whats left after the initial 30 seconds is a slow crawl towards the climax that stretches on for over an hour!! Tributes keep dying and all you get to hear are cannons, no battles, no fast paced action sequences and the supposedly strongest tributes die off too easily.<br/><br/>Overall the movie is just too slow and boring, go only if you are dying to see it after having read the book, but trust me you will be disappointed!!!"

","first of all shaky cam does not need to be in ever single scene! i came to see a movie not get sick from one.<br/><br/>i didn't understand the crowd of movie goers seeing this movie... i'd reckon that 60% were twilight, twihard teen girls who scream and clap at everything! I'm sure the books are better, but the movie was anti climatic, I didn't see a good enough established connection between the hero and her little sister, or her best bud - the uglified guy from ""the last song"" OK so the next thing i didn't understand was the rainy flashback between the hero and her 'love interest'??? he threw bread at her when she was hungry, but he was rude about it, so she hated him?? huh? OK and later on he professes a crush on her but it seems like he is saying it to play up the crowd, the tension between them suggests that there is some attraction, but then the interaction the two characters have alone suggests that they are little more than strangers close knitted by a common circumstance.<br/><br/>Peeta, the love interest, is a crowd loving manipulator who knows how to go with the flow whether that is on stage in front of a mob of an audience, or in a small group of killers in the woods he knows who the strong one is and he makes sure he is on their team. he comes across as a spineless worm who can lift heavy things and throw them very far suggesting that he has strength, but then they never showcase that in the movie...??? OK, and he is really good at painting himself to look like the background (rocks, trees, etc) but where is he getting the tools needed to do all of this intricate painting?? OK, so moving on when the story progresses why would the hero trust her love interest when he was accompanying a group of teens who were tracking her down to kill her? also, while we are on that topic, why would the less stronger players gravitate towards the stronger player when they know only one will survive? it seems that they would have killed the strongest player when they could cause they all have to die...<br/><br/>so, i liked the movie enough, but i guess i didn't understand the hype... OK like when peeta and katniss kissed in the cave the entire movie audience screamed and hollered and cheered and clapped and i was like ""huh?"" at the end of the movie when the cato fell off the structure below to a pack of rabid dog like beasts the audience roared to life with claps and cheering... i actually got creeped out at that point and turned to my husband and gave him a look... i could only imagine that that audience would be the crowd of people in portrayed in the movie that would watch with excitement the hunger games.<br/><br/>so the audience was creepy and annoying, and the love thing between the two heroes was really weird... also the shaky cam was over done in the beginning of the movie."

","To begin I have actually read the novel that this movie is based on and the book actually hits the mark, and this film doesn't. I don't even want to confuse this horrible attempt at a film adaption a movie. Thinking about watching this wreck again makes me sick to my stomach.<br/><br/>When I went to see the movie I was really expecting a survival experience like ""The Running man"", ""First Blood"" starring Sylvester Stallone or ""Battle Royal"", but what I got was just disappointing and boring! Even a movie experience like the ""The Condemned"" with Steve Austin was a lot more enjoyable than this disgrace of a film. (I actually enjoyed The Condemned and would watch it over Hunger Games without hesitation). I have seen and heard a lot of complaints about the shaking of the camera in certain scenes and I guess Gary Ross thought it would add a raw feeling to the film, but all it did was make people sick. I have seen the hand-held/shaky camera technique pulled off well in a good movie like ""Saving Private Ryan"" and it actually adds to what is taking place on screen and isn't overdone!<br/><br/>I guess the problem lies in the fact that I am not a teenager and that I have actually seen good movies before. I honestly think that the director (Gary Ross) thinks he can get away with selling a boring movie with a cheap plot. What really confuses me is that this movie got so many good reviews from the critics. Are you kidding me! Did they even see the same movie I endured? <br/><br/>This movie does have some good moments and good effects but anything good is overshadowed by all of the boring waiting around you do as an audience member.

"ShogaNinja","3","12","17","31 March 2012"," Don't believe the hype! A pale comparison to the book.
","SPOILER ALERT: Don't read this unless you've read the book or seen the movie already!<br/><br/>This movie lost just about every single emotion of the trilogy. The only one that they got right was the ""I volunteer"" part. Haymitch was a filthy drunk who vomited at their first dinner, they never ate like ravenous beasts at any time even though in the book they were starving to death (thus the HUNGER part of the games) and thus the need to take additional lots in the Reaping for additional food rations (Katniss and Gale's name was in that basket several dozen times in order to feed their families and also the reason why they hunted). I can understand cutting out some things in the interest of time but when you sacrifice the entire feeling of the book and leave out major plot points at some point you have to ask yourself if it was worth it. <br/><br/>Here are several things that went terribly wrong: She didn't buy the Mockingjay pin it was given to her by the Mayor's daughter which basically said that they supported the rebellion against the Capitols tyranny. Haymitch as I mentioned earlier was a intolerable drunk who only became helpful to them during the actual training part. When they were on the roof they though about jumping off and it was not revealed in the movie but there was a forcefield that prevented such action. This is a MAJOR part of the plot because it comes up in the next movie/book in a big way. There was a love triangle between Gale, Katniss, and Peta, that was not played out in this book. She loved Gale, and was so awkward she didn't know what to do about it, and entirely faked her love for Peta in order to gain aid in the arena. This was only shown in a barebones fashion but it was a major part of the series. Her ""fire dress"" was actually two dresses and as she stood and did a twist the first one burned off revealing a smaller dress underneath. They refer to her as the Mockingjay but that was not done until later in the series. She was just the girl on fire for a while (thus the name of the second book Catching Fire). The book was written in first person, we never saw the control room and using it in this movie only took away from the fear and suspense of what would happen next was disastrous to the movie. At one point she had a flashback to her father's death and they show their cabin blowing up. This is the cabin that she most often lived in to escape her mother who was crazy and shut down after her father's death (and also the reason she had to take care of Primrose, and have to hunt so much and add her name in the Reaping so much to get food for their family). Peta's injury was so grave that he barely made it out and as a result he lost his leg and was forced to walk with a limp for the rest of his life. He did not receive magic ointment that miraculously fixed everything. Katniss herself was majorly busted up and barely made it out herself. She spent a number of days in recovery after the games. It was understood in the book that the dogs that they fought in the end were twisted muttations (as they are called) made from the dead contenders in the Hunger Games (thus showing the gruesome evil mind of the capitol) The main part of this book was the Games but it felt incredibly rushed. They did NOT see the grid in the sky letting them know the boundaries of the arena or that there were even boundaries at all, that added to the mystery and danger and it was all thrown away.<br/><br/>Also I thought that the style of the capitol was toned down to the point that it was almost a punchline. They had colored skin and their hair and wardrobe was described as something otherworldly. This was just a bad interpretation of that as it seemed everyone was dressed for a bad idea of a futuristic Prom.<br/><br/>This movie was so rushed to get out that it went from a very good book to a tween movie in the same category as Twilight. I am an adult and I enjoyed the books very much, at times finding them hard to put down, but this adaptation was lost in translation.<br/><br/>Overall as a book to movie translation I give this a grade of D. If you have trouble reading then it's better to see it than to not experience any of it, but know that the author's artistic hand was largely lost on the big screen, while other movies, such as John Carter, proved that you can take an idea and actually make it BETTER by moving it to the big screen. Go see that instead if you read the books. Ignore the hype of The Hunger Games movie and go read the trilogy. Being a big fan of the books I found sitting through this pathetic effort to be painful to the point of utter boredom. This was made worse by the relative immaturity of the audience."

And nothing. Two lovers emerge as winners. The end. What happens next year? Her little sister gets picked and dies. What a terrible lesson in morality! All you can take home from this movie is some mindless action-packed survival scenes. Is it good to kill somebody, enjoy doing it, or watch people kill each other and get some sick rush out of it? Is something like this really going to happen in our future? Are we going to do something about it? Do we have solutions such that these things can never ever happen? No answers.

Also Woody mentions over and over in the movie that they need to get sponsors - yet they show none of these ""sponsors"" HE actually ""sends"" medicine to Katniss. That made no sense, maybe that will be clarified in the books? Half way through it dragged for about 45 mins, which had me thinking.. okay.. when is something going to happen. Then the mastermind of the games ""create"" these vicious dogs out of no where to attack them? That was weird and anti climatic at the end.

So I was excited to see the movie and I definitely had high hopes but I felt like the movie did not have the essence that made the story so powerful and suspenseful. I understand you cant exactly match the book with the movie with everything that happens in the book. With the little time movies have but the movie should at least give you that feeling of WHY this story is important and WHY certain things are happening. My boyfriend who did not read the book had a lot of questions to what was happening in the film and I had to explain a lot of things to him. A lot of things were left without explanation. That would definitely confuse many people. I have no idea why there is such hype over this film. If you want to fully get the story and characters, read the book! The book is amazing. <br/><br/>Why I am disappointed- I did not feel or see much of the suffering the characters experienced in the story. Especially with Katniss. In the book she was starving and dehydrated in the arena. I felt like she was struggling continuously in the book which made it more exciting as well as the other characters. There are no depth to the characters and their relationships. It made the movie dull. I did not feel the undying love Peeta had for Katniss. Nor did I really feel that Katniss was confused between her feelings for Peeta and Gale. Katniss spent more time with Rue which developed her trust for her. They slept together in the same sleeping bag in the book. There were no night goggles. That would have made the movie more interesting. Peeta's leg was so bad that he could have died because of infection but it miraculously healed with a ointment in the movie. And Katniss was so worried about him dying, I did not see that at all. There is no explanation of the mockingjay pin which is a significant symbol for the story. The scene with Peeta and Katniss when they first met was poorly done. They looked the same age as they were. I did not even feel like it was a long time ago. I barely remember Seneca Crane in the books but he had a huge part in the movie which confused me. They should put more in depth of why the president is mad, he just looked somewhat intimidating but thats it. The ending was horrible to me especially with their interview, Katniss is supposed to be playing an act in the interview, trying to make everyone believe her and Peeta are completely in love but is really just for show and survival. The story was also supposed to end with Peeta kind of mad at her and Katniss feeling like shes losing him. But that was not shown at all. There is no explanation of why Katniss was in a very rough spot in the beginning with her being the only one to support for her family since her father passed away. The other players in the arena also were struggling because they were starving tremendously at one point, I did not feel that at all in the movie. I just felt like they were just there and wanted to kill each other. They did not explain why Peeta joined the alliance in the arena. <br/><br/>Overall, I feel like they could have made this movie more moving and exciting. You should pity the characters and feel their struggle to see the importance of the movie. I felt no connection at all to any of the characters, not even Katniss. The movie is just a huge let down. I never felt this way about a movie that I read a book for. Even harry potter series were enjoyable and tolerable even thought they left some stuff out. I could not even enjoy this movie. The only thing I liked about this movie were the actresses and actors that were casted for the parts. They were perfect for the characters from the book but the movie was not able to showcase their personalities and relationships. It had so much potential while I checked the casting before watching it."

","Okay Where do I start...<br/><br/>This movie (I haven't read the book, so this is a review only based on the movie) was wrong in so many places. It was too violent to be a pre-teen hit, but maybe that was 1 point to the guys side - or maybe not, because this movie also contains the famous Twillight-drama, also known as, the idiotic, stupid, childish ""dramatic"" bullshit, which is all over every ""love"" scene. We've seen the classics: I-love-you-I-love-you-too // don't-go-stay-with-me at least a hundred times before; and it also worked before. But in this movie I feel like laughing out loud every time those fake love-scenes appear on the screen (just like Twillight).<br/><br/>The beginning made it look like it was going to be a movie with the heart on the right place/different kinds of love etc. and then took a drastic u- turn and turned into Charlie and the Chocolate Factory on speed with all those weird costumes, then it turned into a bloodbath!?<br/><br/>I suppose it's a boys-movie for girls?.........<br/><br/>I give up on this to be honest, the point is it's a bad movie, and the only great thing to say about it is some of the actors performances, a few entertaining moments and Woody Harrelson's bad ass character!"

"KineticSeoul","5","9","12","29 March 2012"," Talk about a over-hyped movie
","This is a pretty bad movie, I just don't get the really positive reviews this movie has been getting. So this movie has been getting a lot of hype for a while and thus I was expecting a really immersible and engaging movie, this is just not it at all. I enjoy watch premises like this although it has been done before and in this case it has been done much better than this. The movies that comes to mind is ""Battle Royale"" and ""The Running Man"". ""Battle Royale"" has done a better job with this type of premise and made it engaging although it can be startling at times. And although it had way more students having to play the life or death game, most of them stood out to some degree. And it focused on all the different students while having very few main protagonist the story revolved around and it still worked. This time there is like 24 students playing the game and none of them stands out except maybe 2. The movie focuses on two characters in the game but after a while they just come off bland and boring after a while. I don't get why they would have 24 people playing if hardly any of them stand out at all. There is also obvious plot holes in this movie as well. So in this there is couple of Districts going from rich to poor, while the rich district look futuristic and very retro the poor districts looks like the people are living in the 1930's. With all the hype this has been getting I didn't expect a teenage romance movie but that element is a big part of this movie. I should have caught one when bunch of 12 yr old girls were at the bookstore looking for this book and being really into it. So there is 24 teens fighting for there lives but you don't care about any of them, there is almost no character development so if one dies there is no attachment. Jennifer Lawrence was pretty good as Katniss and Woody Harrelson stood out but that is about it. The theater was packed but a lot of the audiences was yawning and I heard one of them say ""this movie sucks"". The romantic parts are drastic and super corny to the point even the girls were giggling and laughing. And not because the movie was trying to be humorous but the some of the audiences was laughing at how corny the movie is. This movie just lacked excitement. What was really disappointing is the main event where the teens has to fight each other to live. But that was the most boring part of this movie, the beginning when the teens get selected and the training is more entertaining than when the actual game begins. So the build up for the main game is drawn out for a long time but the build up leads to disappointment cause it just isn't that entertaining. The cinematography is choppy just so they can show the violence off screen sometimes since this is a movie for wider audiences. I can sort of see the direction this was wanting to go but it just didn't get there. This might have worked better as a TV show with maybe 6 episodes for better development maybe. I haven't read any of the books in this series and this movie slightly made me want to read it. Since it's been getting a lot of hype and the movie just wasn't that good, thus the book might be better. And this might be a poor transition from book to movie. Elizabeth Banks is also in this and she plays Effie, I don't don't know how that character is in the novel but she was pretty good in this and when I first saw the movie I couldn't recognize her.<br/><br/>5/10"
"omega_work","4","9","12","28 March 2012"," Good story, poor film.
","I haven't read the book but my brother and wife both loved it. The trailers made it look like ""The Running Man"", so had it not been for them I would have had no interest in this whatsoever.<br/><br/>Within the first ten minutes I thought the film was either directed by a woman or made for teen-aged girls based solely on the camera work and editing. The shots of Katniss were brief with shaky hand-held camera work, while the shots of Gale were needlessly long, smooth and drawn out. Also, I can't believe that a film with male audience in mind could ever make Elizabeth Banks ugly.<br/><br/>Katniss decides to volunteer to be a ""tribute"" so her little sister does not have to. They made it seem like being a tribute was a really bad thing, but didn't really give much explanation as to what it meant which really weakened what is a pretty central story point. Maybe they just assumed people would go in knowing that being a tribute meant being pitted in a mortal battle with peers, but it only took me one sentence to explain it, so they should have been able to find a way to squeeze it in.<br/><br/>So Katniss and Peeta are named as the tributes for their city -- which is called Sector 12. They are taken onto a train in a scene that is filmed as though they are prisoners being taken into a concentration camp, the only problem here is that the train is filled with lots of fancy food and luxury (something seldom found in concentration camps). So the film style tended to tell us contradicting things.<br/><br/>Peeta and Katniss arrive in a city full of weirdos that immediately made me think they were now in the land of OZ. Katniss then had a scrub-down which only reinforced the Wizard of Oz parallels in my mind. I'm all for homages, but they have to be subtle or they come off looking like a rip off, such as in this case.<br/><br/>The next part of the film is probably the hardest to sit through as it is a long, dry series of sequences where the tributes from the various sectors are interviewed and trained in preparation for the games. What makes this more frustrating is that the film skips over all of Peeta and Katniss's competitors. If the filmmakers thought they couldn't do it properly they shouldn't have attempted it at all. They did find time to waste with Katniss's farewells to the new friends she made (which also wreaked of Dorothy's farewell to her friends in Oz).<br/><br/>Now the games begin, and being a sucker for action movies I was really hopeful that this would turn the film around. Actually it did get better from this point on, but there was one major flaw that became apparent very quickly: The filmmakers were trying to make a PG-13 film about mass slaughter.<br/><br/>What that meant in this case was using annoyingly shaky hand-held camera work to try to camouflage the violence. It didn't make it intense or interesting, it just felt like another cop-out.<br/><br/>One by one the secondary characters die off while the world watches. One thing that did bother me a bit was when Katniss dropped a nest of wasps on a bunch of unwitting people below. It bothered me for a couple reasons: one was that these killer wasps didn't seem to affect Peeta, who was with the group below, and also because it's a well known fact that wasps will fly up... so the only thing that should've happened is that they would fly up and sting Katniss unmercifully.<br/><br/>Katniss befriends a young girl who reminds her of her little sister, but inevitably the young girl is knocked off. This leads to a bit of a rebellion in the young girl's home sector, which is, from what I know of the story, a precursor of future events. The rebellion scene was actually the one moment in the film where the story shone through and became easily the best scene of the film.<br/><br/>Katniss and Peeta team up for the final leg of the film and eventually outwit the game's creators by attempting a Romeo and Juliette type scheme of poisoning themselves. It's a little convoluted, but for some reason the show's brass seems to think that if these two both die they will beat them at their own game. Personally I'd let them die and then laugh.<br/><br/>So Peeta and Katniss are now global celebrities, which is another point that is not really clear... why would you make these peasants that you hate so much that you make their children fight to the death celebrities? Anyway, Gale, who has been watching the whole Peeta and Katniss romance blossom on television turns up and there is a hint given that Katniss is actually more interested in Gale... so what concerns me now, is that not only have these filmmakers savaged what was a pretty good story, but they've also pointed the sequel in the direction of Twilight, and there are already too many of those films.<br/><br/>I'm sure that some people who have already read the book(s) will enjoy seeing some of the things from coming to life, but I've always felt that the best adaptations make you want more, and a want to read the source material. This film did not do that for me, which is a bit of a shame because there are some good things in the story. If I were the author I'd be livid."

","At the beginning of this epic tale, the camera was completely awful. Eventually the director lost sight of the book, and had Japan nuke the games. This was very anti-climatic and I was very disappointed by it. I wish they had at least included a zombie apocalypse afterwards. OVerall it was a terrible movie.<br/><br/>The flying rhino's were very unrealistic and ruined the story-line. In addition, I had an uncanny need for chicken sauce during the movie which was quite distracting. I believe the KFC company put on this elaborate hoax as a desperate attempt to boost sales.

It's not a movie that I will be throwing much money to, and I hope that when they make the second one that the do a 360 from this movie and correct what they did wrong in this one. Though I have to say they had a fantastic cast, the acting was spot on I really felt for the most part each of the main characters.

","Wow, what an adrenaline rush! I was so impressed with this film that I created an account just so I could review it. I'm from Hawaii and I managed to catch a early screening of the movie. First off let me start by saying that I have read all three books, and I must admit that the trailer made me a bit hesitant. I mean in the trailer they didn't get the little details right (for instance Katniss's backpack is suppose to be orange and it isn't) but that didn't stop me from seeing the movie, and it SHOULD NOT stop you either! The movie followed the books as closely as a ""PG-13"" rating would allow, and the things they did change didn't distract from the overall movie. <br/><br/>I don't want to say too much, but this movie is a magnificent start to what I hope will be an epic trilogy. The actors/actresses are wonderfully cast and their performances are extremely convincing. Not to mention that there is plenty of suspense and action to keep you glued to the screen (even if you've already read the books!) <br/><br/>Now I now it's difficult to watch a movie when you've already read the books. People already have preconceived notions about who the actors/actresses should have been, what the setting should look like, or how the plot should unfold. But I promise you, the movie does the book PLENTY of justice. My advice would be to enter the theatre with a big bag of popcorn and an open mind...just make sure it's ready to be blown!"
"JoeyGreen","1","37","63","1 April 2012"," Quite possibly the worst movie ever made
","Never was I more convinced H.L. Mencken was right when he said, ""Never underestimate the stupidity of the American people."" Here's living proof: a 7.8 rating! for a steaming pile of poop. You people who gave this crappy movie a high rating confirm my worst fears, i.e., American film=goers can't possibly be any dumber. The ONLY reason I went to see this movie was because I liked director Gary Ross's work in ""Seabiscuit,"" which was an enjoyable and well-crafted film featuring fine actors and a wonderful true story. In THG, Ross has lousy source material to work with, true, but also his deft directorial ability is largely absent here as he caves into CGI, an ever-shaky camera and truly pathetic actors. The entire plot was preposterous from beginning to end and so predictable as to make me root for our ""hero"" and ""heroine"" to eat the berries and finally be done with it. But no, there has to be a sequel, doesn't there? <br/><br/>It's pointless to try to critique this film because those ""who get it"" clearly are either on delusion-inducing drugs or have the I.Q. of a fence post.<br/><br/>Finally, what's happened to Stanley Tucci, who has done some good work in film but lately is playing queer roles, starting with Devil Wears Prada. A good paycheck no doubt but he'll never be taken again as a serious actor."
"petermichow","5","126","240","21 March 2012"," Just OK
","I saw this at a preview screening and having never read the books I was unaware what all the fuss is about. Now having just seen the film, I am still unaware what all the fuss is about..<br/><br/>The central story concerns a future society where 12 areas (or Districts) have been locked down under police guard and wire fences, after they have held a rebellion against the state at some point. In punishment for this rebellion and for rising up against said state; they have to provide 2 kids between 12-18 (tributes) each year to fight in 'The Hunger Games' -a no holds-barred death match tournament, in which there can be only one winner. <br/><br/>This is televised round the world and can be manipulated depending on how the action is heating up and who the audience's favourites are (similar to a certain Arnie movie). We follow a girl / woman from District 12, who volunteers to take her younger sister's place in the tournament, after she had been selected and didn't want to go. She travels to the capital with another boy from the district and there they begin extensive training ready for the games to begin. I won't go into any more detail without wishing to spoil the other parts of the story but once the tournament starts - there begins a love story, various double crossing and in a brilliant stand-out scene; a hilarious disguise that even Andy Mcnab or Bear Grylls in their special forces days would not have been able conjure up..<br/><br/>The acting is OK, but the dialogue seems pretty trite and the future-scape and costumes, look like someone has just watched a combination of Equilibrium and the 5th Element over and over and over and over again (Having not read the book I don't know whether these costumes were accurate to that?). The main issue is that the violence is fairly none existent due to the intended teenage audience, therefore surely losing any power about the wrongs of such a tournament? If you're trying to make a point about violence being glorified in the media or a tournament, to water it down or even worse allow the viewer to 'escape' this horror just seems pointless. <br/><br/>The kids are all good looking and clean cut, some of whom are slightly annoying but are given no back-story in the film. So aside from our two heroes you really don't have any vested interest in seeing them survive and obviously because you don't really see any of them die it just doesn't seem that meaningful and they appear to just be making up the numbers.<br/><br/>Overall we all know it's going to make loads of money because there is a die-hard faithful chomping at the bit to see it...but I just didn't get it. <br/><br/>It's a very good looking but ultimately fairly empty film. I won't go down the Battle Royale route but obviously they are incredible similar, so make up your own mind about whether this has been 'influenced' by that.. but I do feel this has been done better and on a lower budget before.<br/><br/>5/10"

","Let me start by saying that I have never read the book, but I knew that it was very popular. I knew a little about the premise and went to see what all the hype was about. As the movie progressed, I noticed an increasingly uncomfortable feeling in the pit of my stomach. I just felt that there was something inherently wrong with this movie seeing kids killing other kids. It is one thing to read it in a book, but another to graphically display it on screen. It bothered me to see adolescents snapping each others neck, stabbing with knives/swords, closeups of young children lying dead with eyes wide open, all part of a game no less. While it was not over the top graphic violence, there was enough for me to feel uncomfortable given the young age of those being killed. I feel that Hollywood was clearly trying to capitalize on the popularity of the book and I feel they crossed a line by making a movie about kids killing other kids and mass marketing the movie to our kids. I can honestly not fathom a society where the adults would actually be entertained and cheer children hunting down other children. Maybe the acting was good, maybe the cinematography was good, but in the end I left the theater wishing this type of movie had never been made."

","The young actors cast as the tributes were quite good, however the adults (including Donald Sutherland) failed to perform as well. Wes Bently's performance was overshadowed by his own beard - that silly looking flame cut was so distracting Much of the context was sacrificed to make room for poorly shot action footage and computer generated images of the fancy 3D displays in the control room. Spending a little less on pointless graphics would have freed up some funds to get some stabilizers for the hand held cameras used for the action shots - maybe then they wouldn't have been so blurry and out of focus. However even in shots where the actors were not moving, the drift made it clear they were using still using hand-held cameras and couldn't keep them still.

","Spoilers from book and movie******************* When I went to see the movie it had been awhile since I read the series and I was unsettled throughout the whole movie because it seemed like all of my favorite parts were missing but I couldn't really put a finger what was so upsetting to me (besides the shaky cam literally making me ill!)<br/><br/>They hardly mentioned the father and how he taught Katniss everything she needed to survive the games...and life in District 12. They didn't talk about why the mocking jays were a symbol of rebellion and so Katniss became an unwitting hero. And just the sets...like the Reaping set...what was that? It was supposed to be in a town square surrounded by shops and quite a festive area...hence making the reaping ""celebration"" all that more ironic.<br/><br/>Now I'm re-reading the book and getting REALLY upset that Suzanne Collins let them ruin her fabulous book. Just in the first few pages we establish that the Districts are starving, that to hunt food is penalized with death, that Katniss and Gale are both a little ticked off at the treatment of the districts but can't say a word because they'll be killed and can't leave because their families will starve. That Petta literally saved the lives of the whole Everdeen family with his offering of bread to Katniss. And why can't we have the Madge character give her the pin??? The director explains that he can't include everything...why not? It would have given Gale his moment of anger at the Capital (explaining things better about the relationship between the districts and the Capital) and it would have created more of a transition into the other books.<br/><br/>And even dumb things were changed like Haymitch's embarrassing turn at the Reaping. Why not show what a screw-up he was? It would make his recovery and help all that more meaningful? Peeta and Katniss knew who he was...he was showing up at the Reapings every year since he won but now it was their lives on the line.<br/><br/>Nowhere did we really establish the huge effect that the Capitol had on the lives of the people of the district. It all came off as just a futuristic Survivor game. They never show that the Capitol has people within the districts at all times keeping control and imprisoning and even killing people that don't obey. That's why it's such a big deal for her to go into the meadow. She could be killed if caught.<br/><br/>I could go on and on but you really need to hire a good screenwriter to redeem the other inevitable movies. Aaron Sorkin would be fabulous but this type of project probably wouldn't appeal to him. The movies need MUCH more exposition and dialog to be able to convey the depth of the source material. The movie didn't even touch on the real story behind the madness..that Katniss Everdeen, just being herself, changes the course of history much like a Rosa Parks who just wanted a seat on the bus, Katniss becomes a symbol of freedom from oppression, whether she likes it or not.<br/><br/>D."

I guess that was what raised my expectations about the movie, especially all the mentions about how faithful it was to the source material and how it was one of the best book to movie adaptation in recent times.<br/><br/>I won't dwell on the technicalities of the movie because I don't know much about those, I personally judge if a movie was good or not based on how it made me feel about the characters being portrayed. I must say that if I didn't read and loved the book, I wouldn't care about any of the characters. It didn't matter to me what happened to them, I just wanted for the movie to be over so that I can continue appreciating the book as if the movie never existed."

","This is the most disappointing movie ever. The hype and unoriginality is so rampant in the movie. It really shows Woody making a paycheck in a movie. This thing is a disgrace. ""Battle Royale"" was genius and the hunger games do no justice to the movie that gave the Hollywood whatever the idea to make a lame American version. Shame on you. The first hour of the film was so boring and hard to sit through. I almost left the movie. I stayed only because I paid for it and believed that maybe it would get better. It did not. This movie is just horrible I can't even say enough bad things about it. I want my money back. I seriously believe that the makers of this disaster should refund us all and never make anything else ever."

It builds up , introduces various contestants and makes you hungry to see the battle.If you have tolerated this one till interval, your expectations are sore high for a mind-boggling 2nd half.<br/><br/>But Alas...WHat happens is even worse.. There ain't any fights.. just a few knife/arrow shots and the contestants die like a pack of cards. The conclusion as we all know , our lead actress had to win with a comic twist in the middle to increase the TRP of the show ..<br/><br/>Jenifer Lawrence does a great job trying to hold the movie together. The visuals are first- rate.The novelty of the plot can be appreciated but there can be no excuses for the poor execution.<br/><br/>In short, avoid spending on this movie and enjoy games at your home."

It is certainly the 2nd. best movie I've ever seen in my life! The acting was superb, realistic and meagerly emotional. The fights were, ha-ha, super violent and action-packed and I'll tell you: THERE WILL BE BLOOD!

"anthonynicolet","2","14","21","10 April 2012"," The horrible Hunger Games
","Monday 10th of April 2012, the Hollywood industry stole US$9.5 from me. I was lured into watching the movie that most recently reached the position of 3rd most grossing movie of all times (what ever that means), ""The Hunger Games"", and came out of it with such anger that I decided to write this review in spite of knowing that I was already too late for it to make any difference; the monster had already gained the hearts of so many who probably don't know any better. <br/><br/>I'll start by acknowledging the fact that it is not an original screenplay; it is based on Suzzanne Collins' novels, and will even admit that I haven't read them; however, no one should use that a shield to hide behind; either the adaptation by Gary Ross was extremely poor or the working material was to begging with and should have been rewritten for the better. <br/><br/>Originality: 0 <br/><br/>The overall story of this first part (cant believe 2 more are to follow) isn't original at all; it basically takes the ""survival entertainment"" theme already covered by many, such as Paul Michael Glaser's 1987 ""The Running Man"" with Arnold Schwarzenegger (Based on Stephen King's novel), or Kinji Fukasaku's 2000 ""Battle Royale"" (Based on Koushun Takami's novel, which is exactly the story of The terrible Hunger Games). <br/><br/>Creation of the world: 0 <br/><br/>A futuristic world composed of 12 Districts, and all Gary Ross/Suzzanne Collins can come up with to make it look futuristic are: a magnetic train (I invented that when I was 12), some colorful hairdos (thank you the 80s') and oh, no, nothing else, sorry. <br/><br/>It's the Future!!! Cant you come up with something else than Bows & Arrows for weapons?! <br/><br/>Characters Development: 0.25 <br/><br/>Katniss Everdeen, the lead character, is well portrayed by Jennifer Lawrence in spite of the poor dialog (discussed further down); but she might as well have been playing in ""Cast Away"" because every other character is either useless (ie. Wes Bentley's Seneca Crane), empty (ie. Josh Hutcherson's Peeta Mellark) or plainly ridiculous (ie. Elizabeth Banks' Effie Trinket). And I wont bother going into the other useless characters portrayed by what are meant to be amazing actors (what happened to you guys?!) <br/><br/>Forgive me, there is Woody Harrelson, who's character, Haymitch Abernathy, is mildly interesting when he first appears on screen (more details below); but it only takes about 3 minutes before he becomes the empty good Samaritan.<br/><br/>Even the ""supposed to be"" evil kids are useless; and I mean that literally because you see them more in training than you do on the actual battle field; although you do see them hoping and laughing after having killed someone, behind the bushes; which makes them look totally bad ass.<br/><br/>Action: 0 <br/><br/>As I mentioned above, it is meant to be a life or death situation kind of movie with a bunch of kids having access to a number of weapons where only 1 can survive, and all you see is the main character sleeping in trees a bunch of times, sleeping in the water, sleeping in a cave; and oh god I'm sleepy now. <br/><br/>Pretty much every killing happens off screen (or behind a bush). You want to make a PG13 movie Mr. Gary Ross? Don't make it about kids meant to murder each other with medieval weapons until only one is standing! <br/><br/>When you first see Woody Harelson's character, Haymitch Abernathy, he is meant to be one of the Hunger Games survivor who's horrific experience in the game made him an alcoholic; alright, right on, the first half of the movie was boring (and actually kind of made me sick because the camera keeps moving around and the frames change every 1.5 seconds) but this has now become something to look forward to; but noooooooooo, you see the survivors (yes there's more than one because rules don't apply in this society and nobody cares) at the end as if they had been pranked with a bit of salt in their lemonade and didn't get the joke; what a horrible experience that was, for me.<br/><br/>Nothing ever really happens in this movie! And in between moments of nothing, a ridicule little parachute comes in with some magical healing cream; god forbid our little heroes ever got scratched. <br/><br/>I am being unfair: the Hunger Games Gods overseeing the entire operation do come up with a great finally: as if kids with medieval weapons weren't enough, they digitally insert not 1 but 5 Pitt-Bears (some kind of Pitt-bull mixed with a Bear) in the game (because that's what you do when you run out of ideas). Remember that terrible scene with the giant puddles in the first Hulk movie? Same, Same, but different. 'and to make it more exciting, let's just suddenly turn the day into night for that 5 minutes scene; why? Because we can'. Shoot me!<br/><br/>Dialogs: 0 <br/><br/>What to say? Apparently nothing! Except at the end when the 2 characters are told that 1 of them actually has to die and with no second thought, no survival instinct, no emotion what so ever, one of them just says: ""go ahead, kill me"". <br/><br/>A beautiful moment in the 5th Art's History; thank you Gary Ross; really."
"amersyn","5","14","21","26 March 2012"," Details left out. Confusion.
","Here are things I had an issue with. (I LOVED the books. But the movie was choppy, leaving out too many details!!). 1. While they explain that tributes are a form of ""punishment"" or ""remembrance"" of previous revolt against the capital, they do NOT explain that the capital purposely starves the citizens to the point that children are forced to sign up for tesserae (thus getting more entries into the reaping. While Katniss does tell Gale during her goodbyes to not let her family starve, there's no explanation for the comment). There are several flashbacks to her sitting in the rain with Peeta throwing bread, but it doesn't explain that she is literally starving to death nor that he risked his hide to burn the bread to give it to her. She doesn't look hollow like a starving person, and the flashbacks would be/are confusing to those not familiar with the book. They do not show people starving to death daily, and the joy that they get out of having a bit of real meat (Gale gives her the bread in the meadow and she sniffs it like she hadn't had bread itself in years, but she by NO means appears starved!!). So when she and Peeta board the train and see the ""fancy"" food, it doesn't mean much. Her strange look at the food could simply be ""How can they think I'd want food when they're sending me to die?"" Perhaps if they'd shown them pigging out ravenously, wiping fingers on the cloth, etc- that'd show they were starving. But the way it was portrayed, it doesn't show that Katniss and Peeta have rarely, if ever, eaten a hearty meal a day in their lives. They also do not explain that it's illegal to hunt outside of or leave the territory one lives in, and that a person can be turned into an avox (also don't explain what an avox is) or even killed for doing such activities. 2. They leave out the hovercraft collecting bodies. That part grossed me out/scared me, and I was actually shocked it wasn't part of the movie. I thought it was important to set a scariness factor to it. 3. They don't explain the 3-fingered salute and the importance/risk of the people doing it. 5. Katniss did not give a pin to Prim for good luck in the book. It was Madge Undersee who gave Katniss that pin as District 12's token. And another thing the film doesn't explain- what the tokens are for. 6. Without reading the book, no one knows how conflicted Katniss is over Gale and Peeta. In the book, she pretends to love Peeta for the public, but secretly misses Gale. She tells Peeta she wants to forget and that she doesn't want anything from him. The movie only hints at the end that she MAY have feelings for Gale. It doesn't explain that she has to keep up appearances that she is ""in love"" with Peeta so President Snow doesn't kill their families. 7. When Katniss is getting ready to leave for the games, she tells her mother not to ""tune out again."" Doesn't state Katniss had to raise Prim for a bit while their mother lost her marbles over the death of her husband... 8. They never explain why Peeta joined the elite teams and ""turned"" against Katniss. Again- needed to read the book. 9. Katniss attacked Peeta after he announced his crush on her, but the movie leaves out the glass cut on the hand. That set him back a bit in the book. 10. Last, but not least- they do not explain that children from the capital are exempt from the reaping. Thus the look on Haymitch's face while watching the boy & girl playing in the capital."

","Sort of a witless, teenybopper version of The Running Man, Arnold Schwarzenegger's 1987 black comedy of game shows gone amok, The Hunger Games is a hash of random thought and truly the worst professional cinematography in a major motion picture I've seen in 50 years of film-going. (It often appears that the camera operator is going through an epileptic fit during a tornado. And that's when people are eating lunch. In a fight scene it feels like an espresso OD might be happening as well.) There are enough plot holes, lapses in logic and dopey coincidences in this film that it would take a volume longer than the entire trilogy to detail them. But let's start--and end, with this one: This is the 75th televised Hunger Game. Entire districts turn out every year to watch their hometown champions. Why then are ANY of the participants unprepared for ANYTHING that happens? That being said, Jennifer Lawrence is the only reason to see this film, and you could do yourself a huge favor by renting Winter's Bone instead. It's shorter by about 90 minutes and Lawrence plays a similar, if tougher, smarter character in that one. The rest of The Hunger Game's cast is either a) brutally, bizarrely over-dressed and over-coiffed or b) faceless and dull. This is a bad, bad movie. And you know what? I'm saying this and I saw the movie for free one Saturday afternoon. Imagine how angry I'd be if I had paid to attend?"

","I get to watch a lot of movies and I find many are good to very good but this one Hunger games is not good. I will give some credit for the originality but that's it the rest of the content is very amateurish even if this was done in Hollywood. I was looking forward to watch Jennifer Lawrence,s acting skills but I was not impress, there is so many good actresses out there but Jennifer is not part of that group. All the talent and money was spent on the marketing of the movie so they could create another sensation like the Twilight series. The problem is that it worked, they made a lot of money creating a movie lacking in all aspects of film making. Hollywood is first and foremost an industry, it needs to make money to exist and right now what seems to be a good bet is to make movies that will attract teenagers who are interested in violence and actors with good looks. So what if they can't act."

","In a similar way to the film Hanna I reviewed a while ago, this is a film that starts off with a lot of promise, and looks like it could be a classic.<br/><br/>Sadly, as the film progresses, you find that it is nothing but an anti-climatic, boring film, where every move is predictable before hand, and offers no new unique perspective. The easiest way to describe it is 45 minutes of boring mythology build up, then 'Predators'.<br/><br/>I was so disappointed in seeing this film - the only thing that enlightened it for me was the rate at which the audience laughed during the course of it.<br/><br/>Very poor dialogue, poor acting, and unbelievably predictable. For something that purports to be one of the highest ever opening weekend takes, I expected an awful lot more."
"yo_bonney","1","28","47","4 April 2012"," Not appropriate for young adult, confusing, and offensive
","I have not read the books but I saw the movie and it made me want to puke. How long will it be before someone gets a group of kids together and makes them fight to the death for real? We see kids killing kids every day and this is just promoting it. I watch Spartacus and I love it dearly which goes sort of along the same lines only you are with one opponent. But the deal is I don't have to watch a little girl get stabbed with a spear I see adults fighting adults. It is supposed to be a young adult movie series. I saw a teacher bring several kids to see this movie, and I do not believe it is appropriate for that age bracket at all. And then there is the fact that the movie is sloppily put together and doesn't tell you why the people rebelled and had to start the hunger games or what period it even comes from. Why in the beginning of the movie was Katniss a awesome hunter but when she was in the games did little to show that? Why did that guy get a bunch of kids together? I get why Peeta joined but seriously if you are all supposed to die to one person to survive what is the point? And then when they have Katniss in the tree they are going to wait her out and they can't shoot her with arrows etc that main leader of the group tells someone to start a fire to cook something to eat? DUH!!! You want her dead right? Did you ever think to burn down the tree? Also they are all supposed to be waiting her out so they all fall asleep and give her a perfect opportunity to kill them all in their sleep? That bee hive deal was pretty sweet though. Now to the movie and the book what happens if the participants in the game (like the big group that guy put together) just decided not to kill anyone? Would they be held there indefinitely or what? WHo is this president guy? What is he the president of? The united states? I don't know because the movie mentions once that he is the president but doesn't elaborate on it whatsoever. How it Katniss who is allegedly so smart fall for the simplistic trick that stated that two people of a district could win? That was pretty obvious that they weren't going to actually do that. How do these hologram dogs actually injure people? I thought this was a survival game for just the competitors so why add all those other things into it. I really don't understand how holograms could hurt you. Truly this movie is sadly put together and is missing some significant story information. It is not appropriate for kids 13-15 years of age. It is not for young adult children. I would never allow my daughter to watch it if she were that age. And if someone took her to see it anyway they would be answering to me. I would rather watch some poorly made comedy movie then watch this rag again."

"moviemaniac008","4","7","9","31 July 2012"," Why all the love?
","I really enjoyed the novel by Suzanne Collins (not so much the sequels, Catching Fire recycled way too many elements from the first novel and I didn't even bother reading Mockingjay), but I was very disappointed with this movie. Let me enlighten you (I'll try to compare with the novel as much as I can, but mind you it's been a while since I read it).<br/><br/>For starters, the beginning seems stretched out a lot. And I mean, A LOT. For the first hour and a thirty minutes or so, we are given descriptions of how the games will be. Through interviews, talk shows, press conferences, seeing the tributes train and prepare for it, etc... The way the film is constructed at the beginning is, in no ways, amateurish, and is actually pretty well done, but I started lacking interest in it about 50 minutes in. It just isn't all that interesting after a while. <br/><br/>By now, after the hour and a half of massing pumping and hyping, you would expect the last half of the movie to be epic, to be impressive, yes? Unfortunately, it isn't. The problem is that the filmmakers tried to market a very violent novel for mature teenagers with a violent premise to kids. The camera keeps shaking constantly to not show any details, and it is annoying, because you end up practically not seeing anything at all. You have to be very, very focused on the screen to make out practically any action occurring in the second half. <br/><br/>A lot of things also seem pointless...Peeta's camouflage in the dirt being the most pointless of all. How useful was it to the story? He showed it to Katniss, as if to waste our time, and never used it after...<br/><br/>The film could also have used more screen time for Haymitch. Woody Harrelson is perfect for the character, and in the novel, Haymitch had some pretty interesting things to say. But, in this movie, Haymitch is so underused that we barely get to see his drunken antics and his powerful thoughts. Elizabeth Banks as Effie Trinket is really annoying...No fault of Banks, the character is just plain annoying, and yet she has more screen time than the 100 times more interesting Haymitch. Effie Trinket really bothered the hell out of me.<br/><br/>Still, there's some positive to be had: The acting. Jennifer Lawrence is brilliant as Katniss Everdeen. Her performance is enough to carry this huge-budgeted overlong film on her shoulders when the film needs it most. Always in character, Jennifer Lawrence shows us all her talents as an actress. It was the second time I saw her in a movie since the amazing X-Men First Class, and I can't wait to see more work out of her. Josh Hutcherson delivers the merchandise in a performance slightly inferior to Lawrence's. Elizabeth Banks, Woody Harrelson, Wes Bently, hell, even Lenny Kravitz gives in a respectable performance. And I have nothing negative to say about not one, but two great climaxes. I liked that the film doesn't end all happy-go-lucky like traditional Hollywood movies, but it foreshadows a sequel, which, I sincerely hope, will be better, darker, and braver than this movie. <br/><br/>Overall, this is a film that could have been so much more. I do not get all the love it has been getting. While all the actors give great performances (Jennifer Lawrence especially), the action is underwhelming and the build-up to the action is way too overlong and packed with unnecessary details. If you want an idea of what The Hunger Games should have resembled, watch the Japanese movie Battle Royale. Now that is one very intense movie. <br/><br/>DISCLAIMER: I'm not a Battle Royale fanatic trying to bash The Hunger Games, I actually first heard of Battle Royale after watching this movie. I just think that, personally, after having viewed both, Battle Royale is much better than The Hunger Games. (I strongly recommend reading The Hunger Games over the viewing of the film)."

I took my husband, who hasn't read the book, and the movie had little meaning for him.<br/><br/>I grant you, it's hard to take a 1st person novel and film it. But even a crappy voice-over (as in Blade Runner theatrical version) would have helped this get closer to the spirit of the original. As it stands, it's just another PG-13 scifi flick that looks and is horribly derivative, leaving out most of the symbolism, motives, and background. <br/><br/>Worse yet, the violence was toned down. Hard to believe, but true. Permanent maimings in the book became minor ""put some Neosporin on it"" wounds in the film. Good grief. The horrible, pointless violence the tributes were subjected to, and its scars, physical & psychological, was a major point in the book. <br/><br/>Only fans of the book who are able to fill in the blanks and don't mind doing so would be happy with this.

They wanted to give you a sense of action, some thrill and extra drama dosage by visually killing the film. It lost any visual attractive.<br/><br/>The plot is not quite bad at all; there are some interesting elements, but the premise that sustains the whole story (the Hunter Games celebration/Ceremony/Feast/TV Show/Sacrifice/etc) is not well explained in the movie, perhaps the books do a better job. The given theory is quite vague and contrasts with available technology and production means, wealthiness, etc.<br/><br/>The Acting is not so bad, some recognizable faces do a decent performance; the protagonist (Katniss) does a great portray, and her character is really cool (at least so far) is not the stupid Bella from Twilight, this is a hard-boiled down-to-earth forest-side-girl, a true hunter and a rational human being, her deeds are credible.<br/><br/>I hope that for the next 2 ones they don't focus the whole story around another Love-Triangle, I think we are kind of tired of the same crap; if the books are like that, I prefer to have the films a little bit distant from the books, letting Katniss to remain a cool Steve Macqueen Girl-next-door character."

OK I shall stop spoiling now, the acting was horrible; children taken away from their families and loved ones, thrown in to a battle field having to viciously kill each other (apparently), acted as if they were doing gym class and they were there to show off how much better they were than everyone else. Jennifer Lawrence pulled off some half decent acting compared to the rest of the teeny cast but it was nothing memorable and nothing like the reviewers claimed it to be. It's not like she spoke much either, OK so she cried a bit and hooked up with the guy she liked, so?. The camera shooting as being mentioned by other reviewers made you nauseous and half the time you were unsure what you were supposed to focus on. The ending was a slight twist but did not make up for my 2.5 hours lost. They could have done so much more with this concept/adaptation, but of-course the money hungry holy-wood producers decided this was a movie for the 12 year old audience who know no better than Twilight."
"JoeBobJones","1","34","59","30 March 2012"," Monkeys would fling their feces at this thing.
","M'kay, where to begin? I should begin by stating that I have never read the books. I am told, by my extremely reliable and well read sister in law that the books are quite riveting, and I do want to read them. So then, on to the film... I have seen worse. Waterworld comes to mind, as does the music video for the 1986 Bears Super Bowl Champions, The Super Bowl Shuffle (not technically a film). The casting in Hunger Games was excellent, so there is that, and Jennifer Lawrence has an ethereal quality which is really quite lovely. <br/><br/>That I have not read the books is quite likely a blessing, because I can only imagine that fans of the novel would fling their own poo at the screen in outrage over this painful puke of a film. I will dispense with character development, because there is NONE, but suffice it to say that what passes as character development passes swiftly and seemingly without consequence, although I learned to my chagrin that this is part 1 of 3 anticipated films, so who knows, perhaps part 2 will be ""Hunger for Character Motivation and Emotion Games"". One can only hope, or not.<br/><br/>Everyone already seems to know the premise of this film: it is an amalgam of Running Man, Lord of the Flies, Logan's Run, and The 5th Element. In fact, the worst part of this dreck is the preponderance of foppish dandies in heavy handed 5th Element outfits and hair styles, who make up the population of what I assume was the rich and succored 13th colony in this post-apocalyptic world. The remaining 12 colonies, who participated in an uprising 75 years prior, are now being continually punished for being bad years ago by being forced to send one male and one female teen to cut each others throats in a battle to the death called The Hunger Games. The reward, perhaps, is that the colonies are all not systematically annihilated, partly in thanks for sending their best and brightest in this random drawing. Oh, did I mention that Shirley Jackson's The Lottery also plays a prominent inspiration? One credibility problem is that not one single character, or actor really, in the poorest and hungriest of colonies (number 12) looks remotely hungry. Granted, they are not as robust as I am, but as poverty and hunger are the driving influence in these people's existence, hunger and desperation should at least seem evident in them. Instead, we are given a cursory flashback of a loaf of bread being tossed to our lead teen Katniss, flung in the mud and rain, instead of to the hogs which were supposed to receive said dinner. She seems grateful, but it is hard to tell, perhaps she is just an angry teen. Point is: folks are hungry, but we can't devote any more time, screen effort, or find realistically starved acting actors to portray that state of being. <br/><br/>Part 2: Katniss is flung into the games themselves. She captures the wealthy dandies just by being herself. HERSELF.. imagine. ""But I'm not good at making friends or talking to people..."". ""honey, just be yourself"". Yawn. Actually, she kind of captures the crowd in part by the unmotivated aid of a drunken Woody Harrelson, who basically instructs her of the ways of TV's Survivor (oh, did I mention this is similar to Survivor as well? Except they don't kill each other in that television show, and they should). His advice: make people like you by giving them what they want: wide eyed honest hotness, young love, and shooting arrows up the wazoos of the aristocracy, figuratively speaking of course. BOOM, they love her! She gets an 11 out of 10. On to the actual battle royale, or the Running Man. Improbably alliances are formed, among the most bloodthirsty pig head crowd as well, who would kill each other in their sleep given the slightest chance, yet his gang lasts until nearly the end of the games. Wrong, the head GI Joe-Aryan boy would have quietly slit the throats of his alliance competitors in sleep and taken their stuff, but whatever, I guess we have a film to run here. Eventually, through little directly violent death, in fact the famed violence of the book is nowhere to be found in this film at all, the bad guys get it, and our victor(s) are handed the trophy of life, but only after one last flipping of the bird at the system (the freakin system, man!) by attempting to exit the game in an unexpected and unsportsmanlike manner. We are left with the clear expectation of episode 2 (boooo!), when Donald Sutherland, the President, raises an eyebrow (episode 2!), scowls, and sticks his ass to the camera and marches back upstairs to his tall tower. I. Just. Can't. Wait. Thhhbbbbpththhht. <br/><br/>OK, it wasn't an epic fail, like Job Bob Jones, or whatever that Disney flop is named right now, and there were a few genuine moments of excitement and tension, but three exciting scenes does not a quarter billion dollar film make. Between those sort of decent moments (which held whispers of First Blood and even Avatar) was a giant tedious mess. Also, the Truman Show-inspired all controlling and hovering Big Brother/show producer/God aspect was distracting and unfair to the premise of the games to begin with. Yes, it was like a Death Race 2000-esque television show for the sweaty gambling masses, complete with betting odds, but I actually turned on my phone to see what time it was and thus how much longer this thing had to continue on. Blurg. I'm sure a much better adaptation could have been made."
"smcgann14","3","15","23","5 April 2012"," Oh no, this is bad
","I really don't like the movie. Wait, scratch that. I really don't like how the movie was executed.<br/><br/>I went into this movie after finishing the book, and I wanted a good and faithful version of one of the best books I've ever read. But soon, one bad thing caused a chain reaction.<br/><br/>I liked the first 10 minutes of the movie, but then at the Reaping, there's all this camera movement that I was warned about by Bum Reviews. Then, there's barely any dialogue. I was bored out of my mind because of how little dialogue there is. Speaking of camera-work, why do 1/5 of all shots feature Jeniifer Lawrence's face? She did give a wonderful performance, but then again I read the book, and they turned Katniss into a somewhat weak and helpless little girl by the end of the movie.<br/><br/>It's weird how the dialogue is so slow, but the movie goes by so fast. Probably because they took 267 pages and used only 100! There are so many great moments in the book, like interview coaching and the friendship between Katniss and Peeta, that are barely in the movie. This leads to zero character development and likability. Also, why is there only one kiss between Katniss and Peeta? Then there's all this hugging, which makes Twilight look like a convincing romance.<br/><br/>What's weird is how the film seems so rushed, but it's 142 minutes LONG! The Help was that long, and it seemed long, but it got the characters to appeal to us. As with screen time of characters, Wes Bently probably has the most, and he was probably in the first book for two pages. I do like the performances of Gale and Cato, but I found Peeta to be too cartoony.<br/><br/>Let's sum it up by saying it has effort, but it failed to be as detailed as the book. Though some things are good, a million things are bad. Or good. Maybe it wasn't too bad. No wait, it was mixed. I don't know why I can't figure out this movie, if it is good or bad. I probably watched too many shaky scenes..."
"authormdarby","3","22","36","27 March 2012"," Had high hopes for this one.. and it disappointed
","I went into the movie excited. I just finished the first book for the hunger games and it was amazing. They left out so many major things that happened in the book. Peeta almost losing his leg to how seneca crane was killed. I think the reason it was rated pg13 was how shaky the camera was. You couldn't tell what was happening. I don't like when Hollywood takes an amazing book and just does crap. If your going to make a movie about a book. At least make it as similar as possible. They didn't even have the night vision glasses!! lol. I think that Woody Harrelson was the perfect Haymitch and Jennifer Lawerence played the character of Katniss well. My favorite actor of all time is Donald Sutherland and he was pretty good as President Snow. But my advice to everyone just read the book. Don't waste almost $10 on a movie ticket to see it"
"grossgirl7","3","45","81","23 March 2012"," The Hunger Games Movie
","I read The Hunger Games trilogy and I was very excited for the movie to come out, but I was very disappointed when I saw it today. A lot of the characters weren't developed very much. Also the movie didn't stay true to the book and a lot of my favorite parts were eliminated. Katniss and Rue's relationship was barely developed at all which really disappointing for me because that was one of my favorite part of the books. I thought it was very clever how the author, Suzanne Collins, used Rue and Katniss' relationship to symbolize Prim and Katniss' relationship. Another thing that was missing was the avoxes. I thought they were extremely interesting in the book. It was proved that the capitol was pretty evil when they introduced the games but the avoxes showed another thing they did that was absolutely despicable, but they almost completely skipped over them in the movie. Other thing they skipped over include the whole character of Madge, the district 12 mayor's daughter and sort of katniss' friend who gave her the mockingjay pin, Katniss nearly dying of dehydration, that Katniss used sleep syrup to drug Peeta so she could go to get his medicine, the fact that the mutts that attacked them near the end resembled the tributes, Katniss and Rue's conversation about how their districts were very different, Katniss losing her hearing, Peeta losing his leg, Katniss freaking out on the hovercraft while they operated on Peeta, District 4 being a career district, etc. However, the acting was good, and the way they portrayed the gamemakers was very good."
"fotogirl777777","1","75","142","28 March 2012"," Terrible film
","This is a terrible, terrible film! This director CANNOT direct! It looked like a bad TV show. There were no cinematic shots at all, it was shot straight on and very boringly. LOST looked way better and was much more interestingly photographed. As I was watching it I thought this is a very low budget film, maybe $30- $40 million. I thought this cos such little effort was put into it and the filming was so mundane. I thought OK, they had to rush, but when I found out the budget was $80 million I couldn't believe it. BTW....AMADEUS was shot for $18 million in about 1985 and looks tens times better. It worries me that the younger generation are growing up on such badly put together films.

"masteroftofu","2","24","40","28 March 2012"," This is a Rated R story that got turned into a pg13 movie
","First off id like to say that this story is a blatant ripoff of Arnold Schwarzenegger's 'the running man' cept nowhere near as good or entertaining. Save yourself the time and money seeing this and just rent that one unless of course you're 12, then this movie is for you. That said, this movies biggest problem is that its main focus is about killing, yet they skimp out on showing any actual killing. The opening scene of the battle shouldve been a bloodbath, but instead turns into a copout cutawayfest as the camera only shows people falling down dead after what we assume is being stabbed or whatnot. You cant make a movie about such dark themes and not have violence. its just absurd. they seem to have blurred out all the actual plot and violence, and focused on the fake relationship between the main actress and her peer(which is lackluster at best) to sell this movie to the tween audience <br/><br/>its clear that the movie industry was trying too hard to market this movie to tweens(apparently the adult and mature teen audience don't matter anymore), even despite the fact that they would have to sabotage the entire film to do so. so instead of having an intense thriller that leaves you at the edge of your seat, you find yourself shifting in your seat out of boredom. The character development is so poor that you don't really care if anyone dies either (accept for the black girl). I felt like massive chunks of plot were left out or something because there is a scene where people stand up and riot, but that cuts out after 5 seconds and is never shown again, and that seems like its a key piece of plot...especially if there are sequels. its sad when the entire time, all i could imagine was Jean Claude Van Damm running through the woods in 'Hard Target' as he was being hunted down. whats even sadder is that that movie had better acting and character development LOL!"
"rad88","2","24","40","26 March 2012"," Finally Hollywood found a way to stop pirating movies ;)
","The way simple: to produce such crappy movies that nobody would like to waste the bandwidth to download them.<br/><br/>And this movie is a perfect example. Moreover, that's also a way to steal some money from the actual movie lovers unaware what they are up to, when going to the theater. To sum it up: complete boringness making wanting you to leave the theater, utter non-sense plot, poor performance, bad editing and soundtrack. Maybe only people responsible for make-ups did a great job there. And of course marketing did a VERY GOOD job probably spending 90% of the funds to make every site including IMDb saying how good this thing is."
"extcontact","2","26","44","26 March 2012"," Not even vaguely in the same league a film as HP or Twilight
","As much as I love this director and loved Jenifer Lawrence, the film was a disaster from start to finish. It doesn't even get on the radar of the worst of the HP or Twilight series. Hopelessly without depth at every turn: ridiculous sets, garishly clownish costumes, and so lacking in character development as to be pointless. <br/><br/>One gathers from the heavily conservative budget the studio really wasn't a believer or really committed. I also suspect the very able Gary Ross had his hands tied at every turn and wasn't allowed much creative input into the translation to the screen - it had none of his character outside of the district scenes. <br/><br/>Who knows, maybe they'll do better next time now that they've been shown the money - but this one, pitiful."

","I'm 33 and had no intentions of watching this film until my 12 year old daughter begged me. First off what's up with the shaky camera, the thing was going all over the place and was making my dizzy, at one point i thought my coke a cola was spiked. I was busy glancing side to side to keep up with the screen. Action is blurred, not sure what's going on in the fight scenes maybe due to the PG-13. But don't expect any good action out of this. Character Development...non existent, okay who are these dozens of kids again. People will pop up randomly only to never be seen from again. What's the purpose, why is this world the way it is...i never discover that? Even though the following three films / shows aren't the best you are better off with them, as this is tailored to lower high school and below audiences....<br/><br/>Condemend - similar themed, more action, more purpose. a group of inmates are selected to duke it out on an island for a game show.<br/><br/>Cast Away - More development in Mr. Wilson the 4 year volleyball friend of Tom Hanks. Again no character development in the hunger, I'd rather watch Tom Hanks talk to his volleyball on an island for 2hrs, than to watch 23 teens randomly pop in frame then disappear. I don't know who to root for or why....and you know what i would root for Wilson hands down!!! Oh and also it seems like i'm only dealing with the main character throughout the story and everyone else is just a prop.<br/><br/>First Season of Lost - Why because you are completely lost with a lot of the unexplained events. Remember those deadly tornado death machine things....What's with the ""numbers"". Same thing here, also there are going to be a lot of random things that are conveniently written to move the story forward in the protagonists favor..ala lost.<br/><br/>Anyway I'm sure the books are better, this is just Hollywood using it's get rich quick formula...slap together a film based on a popular teen book (ala twilight) get some cool youngster eye candies on the screen for the boy and girl dreamers out there. throw in some romance to hook them and there you go 200 million in global sales, before the audience realizes they have been dupped. Slap in 80 million in bluray sales after about 3 months at the theaters."
"kaliningrad","4","11","16","6 April 2012"," Capitol - Washington - Versailles & the electoral campaign
","I am an Italian guy (so sorry for grammar) and have just seen it. This movie suffers several major defaults which in my opinion are not the cause of a mere poor execution but are the result of his propagandistic nature. Why? First: the stereotypes about poverty. Future is poverty, but not ANY poverty: a Great Depression style poverty. The poor in the future wears clothes which resembles those of the 20s, lives in houses like those of the 20s and works in 20s style conditions (and of course woman stops working and go back home while men become once again miners). This is a pure stereotype, developed in all the movies on the great depression and on poverty in general. But I think that it is meant to be the most stereotyped so as to ""speak"" to the most people; to make them fear what could happen in the future (does the city where the protagonist lives remind you of any recent political republican spot?).<br/><br/>Second: fault is of the government. The fault of that situation is of the government of the Capitol (Capitol is the Capital/the Capital is Capitol). The current capital of the USA, if I do not mistake, is Washington, were sieges the government. So in Washin... sorry, in the capital, there is a sort of Versailles style degenerated, luxurious and frankly effeminate aristocracy which concentrates the best of all stereotypes on aristocracy formulated since the French Revolution (they are fat, stupid, homosexuals and God know what else) in order to make them the most hateful as possible.<br/><br/>Third: very hateful bad-guys. For some sort of reason this people seems to believe that thieving children from the provinces of the empire, like once used to do vampires and monsters, and make them kill each other would help to maintain peace. I do not know who had this idea while writing the plot or if it was the writer of the book, but please! The basic principle of a dictatorship is to maintain social peace, to not stress too much the emotions of the people, and now those guys come and thieve (thieve!) children (children!) and kill them? Honestly, on ""How to cause a popular uprising"" manual this is step n° 1. But again, in my advice the purpose of this film is not to be realistic or even plausible. Its purpose is to instill fear and hate toward the elite who lives in the capital. But not TOO much hate, we don't want to make revolution no?<br/><br/>Fourth: very polite heroes. Apart of the fact that 90% of the characters in this movie are pure wasp race and of the only two black who appears, one is gay and the other gets killed quite uselessly, there is not a single real critic of the system. Yes the aristocracy is hateful, but the system does not get put into discussion. At the end of the film everybody is happy and get back to his house, evildoers are dead and the heroes are rewarded, none of them thinks even for a second to send everybody to hell and kill one of the aristocrats or the president; they all accept the system which after all leaves you a narrow possibility of escape. Again and again, this is republican propaganda: the ACTUAL government is a bunch of retarded and cruel homosexuals but you must not criticize the whole system, just the necessary to win next elections."

Night Shamylan (or whatever), this was far worse.<br/><br/>Suzanne Collins wrote a beautiful and elegant tale with vivid details and thorough character development that were entirely disregarded when adapting this film. Vital plot points were not included whatsoever or were butchered beyond recognition for anyone that read the trilogy. For those who have not read the series, the movie will make absolutely no sense as none of the characters are introduced or even remotely developed beyond a very shallow puddle of what would even be considered acceptable for a protagonist or lead character.<br/><br/>Rushed, bad camera angles, horrible graphics, very poorly adapted, deviates dramatically from the novels, annihilates the possibility for a continuation, invalid sequencing of events, contains spoilers of the second and third books, unnecessary and ridiculous additions, no emotional or mental insight to ANY of the characters, and removes all significance or meaning from the story. This can hardly even be called ""The Hunger Games"" for how horridly the story was followed as the only aspects that remain intact are the characters' names.<br/><br/>This is a mockery of the series and deserves absolutely no praise for even a single minute of the entire two and a half hour film."

I haven't read the books, but thought the story was interesting based on the one-line explanations I got from others.<br/><br/>I went into this film expecting to see something similar to the Twilight films (teen obsession over book turned film), but better.<br/><br/>What I got was much, much worse.<br/><br/>First off, I want to say that I thought the acting was great. The actors did a great job of portraying their characters.<br/><br/>What WASN'T so great was the lack of character development. The death scenes, even those meant to be emotional, didn't affect me at all. I am one who isn't afraid to cry like a baby at a movie, and I often do. But while the others around me were sobbing, I was just ready for the scene to be over with.<br/><br/>Another reason I strongly disliked this film, has to do with my title. It seems like 95% of the shots in this movie were closeup on the characters faces. These are fine, to an extent, but you begin to wonder after a while if the actors aren't all just bodiless floating heads. The fight scenes were quickly cut together, which could work, if you weren't zoomed in so much that you have no idea what was going on.<br/><br/>For a film with a supposed 100,000,000 dollar budget, this came across as a low-budget independent adaption of the book. They could have done so much more to improve the visual aspect of the film as well as make the characters more likable.<br/><br/>Overall, I would give this film 4 stars, mainly due to the great acting and costume design. Everything else, was horrible."

","The Hunger Games has been one of the most hyped up franchises from the last few years and i really cannot understand why it is.<br/><br/>The idea that characters are able to put their name in the raffle several times confuses me as it shows that characters are able to volunteer as tribute, so why do people not decide on who can volunteer earlier so more people can put their name in extra times and get more food. It can't be that everyone in district 12 is Malnourished to fight as characters like gale look like they are physically fit and do work out. <br/><br/>All the characters from the capitol are shown to be unrealistically evil as they all seem to enjoy the fact that they will be watching children (Even though most of them look like they are in their mid twenties) killing each other and none of them even try to hide it. In Battle Royale it makes sense why the government are making children kill each other as they are shown to be a small yet powerful dictatorship who are exercising their power over the common man and killing the people who try to get in their way, but as i said before the people in the hunger games are shown to just be doing it as they just enjoy it.<br/><br/>And while there are some good points in the film such as the social commentary (Even though that has been done in films before) none of them really can make me like the movie that much."

The storyline develops into a very slow climax. The film set is boring with very weak lighting. The camera is shaky to the extent that it can make you dizzy - a similar feeling to that when you take a ride on a bus that takes winding roads up and down a hillside. The female lead (Jennifer Lawrence) has acted well, though. For the first and last time, we got drawn into seeing the movie based on the marketing and hype that built up into a crescendo. I would not recommend seeing this movie in a theatre. Wait for the DVD copy or for the movie to be shown on TV maybe 6 months or a year down the line."
"jock75","3","20","33","25 March 2012"," Better than Twilight but still a load of rubbish
","Where to begin.. I did not have high expectations, but went to see the film yesterday, which was the opening weekend. Interestingly we had no trouble getting good seats at very short notice even though the media had hyped the film as being ""sold out"" all weekend.<br/><br/>First of all, any film about kids requires young actors and therefore the level of acting falls instantly - young people are often not great actors, generally speaking. Having said that, Jennifer Lawrence in the lead role of Katniss was excellent. It's a pity the rest of the film let her down. Like so many films these days, the PR and spin machine went into total overdrive in the weeks leading up the release - here in Australia, the trailer and PR blitz lead me to believe that Liam Hemsworth (Australian actor who plays Gale) was actually the star of the film! In reality, however, he had total screen time of about 6 minutes and was basically no more than a glorified extra - in fact, some extras had more screen time than him. But that is just typical of the media these days - they think that if they push the local talent people will flock to see it. Just as well we hardly saw him in the film because he was just terrible. He should really go back to his daytime soap job or maybe make another flop with Miley Cyrus.<br/><br/>But back to the film. technically it wasn't very good either. The visual effects ranged from OK to just embarrassing. Having worked in the industry for many years there several scenes where I just cringed at the sloppiness of some of the effects work - it looked as though they let some intern have a go on Final Cut Pro. Particularly the chariot scene when Katniss and co become engulfed in fire. Fail.<br/><br/>The films borrows extensive from other films (as many people have noted), and sometimes I forgot what I was actually watching - Minority Report? Bladerunner? The Truman Show? And a few times, when the CG was particularly fake looking, I was reminded of Star Wars Ep 1.<br/><br/>But back to the ""acting"", and I use the term very loosely. Fail. There will be no Oscar nominees from this bunch, I can tell you.<br/><br/>Was it the worst film I have ever seen? Definitely not. Did I want the 2.5 hrs of my life back? No. Was it worth $22 at the cinema? No. Was it better than Twilight? Yes, but that is a very low benchmark to compare against.<br/><br/>If I was to summarise it in one sentence, it would be like this: ""A forgettable teenage action/adventure with a few surprises and one noteworthy performance (Jennifer Lawrence) but overall lacking in substance and coherence and probably better left for viewing when it comes out on DVD""."

","Warning: I'm a German-Japanese / Poor English Abnormally, i'd generally like to experience remade flicks. More so the if i loved the original. I know there are extremely few which equals or excels to the original but it's not a big problem for me 'cause i don't even expect them to. It is to me like a bonus track of a beloved album, no more no less.<br/><br/>So i got no hesitation in checking Hunger Games as well (i was even excited actually) 'cause the original must be in my all-time best 10, but, oh my..<br/><br/>I won't say any more about this XEROX COPY crap. (copied on retarded machine, moreover) Nough said by nough people.<br/><br/>Now one thing i just can't believe is how this could be legal. As far as i've read on internet articles, Sanjay and his people haven't even paid a penny to the original Oldboy makers for doing this, which means Hunger Games is not an official remake of Battle royale.<br/><br/>Then what the h..! is Hunger Games's identity? Some's gonna say it's JUST BASED ON or INSPIRED thing but you know it's way beyond those kinds. Then what? Sort of Homage thing ? Yea possible, but Lionsgate and its company have hardly mentioned about the original on either official ads & reports or non-official comments. Instead, Liongate's kept saying he's got a bit INSPIRED ONLY and Battle Royale is totally different from THG or something like that. <br/><br/>Besides, more importantly, while shamelessly copying scenes-by-scenes from battle Royale, Lionsgate intentionally missed the KEY-POINT of Battle Royale's story for his own audiences' taste, for COMMERCIAL PURPOSE in other words. Then how can we call it Homage anyway ? My conclusion is : HG is not only a copy crap, it's rather A CRIME, LITERALLY. I don't understand why Oldboy makers let them make money with this stolen thing.<br/><br/>Am i disappointed ? No i'm fine i didn't even expect.

","Technically, this could have been a good movie though. Given it's many, well tried angles of looking at it. Like deadly, old Rome type spectacles being shifted into a futuristic setting. Or the 1984 kind of healthy rural vs. decadent urban life style antagonism. ""Apocalypto"" type human sacrifice ceremonies, to tame the gods. And even some fashionable media critique - ""it's only a TV show"". A colorful collage to start with indeed. And still failing.<br/><br/>Two major reasons: shallow actors, presumably meant to appeal to ""twilight"" type teenie audiences. And shoddy production, likely because they spent too much money on a plethora of big names for supporting roles and had to save it elsewhere.<br/><br/>Look e.g. at what could have been a highlight of this film, a feast for the eye: the dance in the flaming dress. They cut that short though, and had to. Because it obviously looked fake, CGI. And in a poor - shoddy - way.<br/><br/>Most of the above critique addresses just the first half of the film, the build up, anyway. Because once the kids are down in the woods hunting each other, the film becomes about as original as some boring TV episode about amazons hunting rabbits in a dumbed down fantasy environment. Serious yawner alert certainly applies there.<br/><br/>Still two things may be taken away: Miss Lawrence is an actress sporting womanly features, which is rare these days and much appreciated. And Woody's the tutor you want, in any kind of situation, even if suffering from the worst hairdo of his movie career.<br/><br/>Bottom line: if older than 16 better bring a cushion to rest your head on."

It's a minor relationship due to the male screen time and the relationship never gets resolved.<br/><br/>All in all, pretty disappointed in this movie after previous reviews, seems like the movie writers are muppets and it doesn't give me any motivation to read the book.

Here it's presented as though the main characters are completely ignorant of the central fact of their existence, an annual event that everyone watches. It's clumsy and annoying exposition, and it's the *best* written part of the film. From there it just gets worse, with contrived situations and deus ex machinas falling from the trees.<br/><br/>All this is set in a world that seems like a fifth-grader's concept of a centrally planned economy, a poorly conceived dystopia which makes no sense physically or economically. Nothing is ever fundamentally explained, except for an occasional ""Oh, by the way, we forgot to tell you this exists and there's conveniently one nearby, or we'll whip something up through apparently magic."" It's all frustrating and never coheres into anything resembling a believable world or society.<br/><br/>Worse yet, there's no story here. It's pure melodrama with a predetermined outcome. The cardboard characters have no arc, no growth, no anything but having survived. It's just an empty, morally repugnant spectacle, with no real point to any of it.<br/><br/>I imagine there are probably apologists who claim, much like the later Harry Potter films, that ""Well, you have to have read the book to fully understand everything."" If that's the case, then the film is still a failure. I shouldn't have to bring along supplementary material to fill in the gaps, inconsistencies, and just plain stupidity of a movie like this.<br/><br/>I gave three stars because the film was mostly professionally shot and produced.

This should have been a great movie, fans of the books talk about missing their favorite parts but that is to be expected, after all the movie is never as good as the book. That said, as a person who didn't read the book, I found the movie seriously lacking in key areas. The first area being the camera work, they didn't have to have the camera that close to the people. The extreme close ups and the shaky cam were a big turn off for me, and I couldn't stand it. <br/><br/>The next area was a total lack of connection with these people and what is going on. Believe me, you get it, they are a defeated people, punished every year to watch two of their children die in the games. This is the 74th game, so their numb to the experience now, but that numbness makes it hard to care about their blight. You see things just happen in this movie without a full understanding as to the why it is happening. For example, there is this salute they do in the movie, kissing three fingers and holding them up. You understand this was a sign of the failed rebellion, or something, a sign of respect between the districts, but you don't know exactly what it means and you don't care. The action is hollow and meaningless through the movie. <br/><br/>The actual game of the ""Hunger Games"" was just as hollow. Only one death meant anything and you didn't get introduced to anyone but Katniss and her inner circle. So when something happened to someone you only heard a cannon fired and that was it. <br/><br/>Now with all this complaining, praise. I don't know how Katniss was or wasn't supposed to be, she certainly wasn't hungry, that's for sure. However, I loved Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss, and her inner circle, they were awesome. I loved the actors!! They are the only reason to see this movie. Isabelle Fuhrman was the only villain worth noting and brought more to the table than anyone other bad guy because they weren't developed. <br/><br/>It is just so sad, when you think about the other movies that preceded this. ""The Running Man"", ""Death Race"", how could they fail to make us feeling anything for a movie about kids killing kids. It is the definition of disappointment, they had so much promise and the more I hear about the books the more I hate the movies because they left out so much and there was so much to put in."

Jeniffer Lawrence can be better if she can lost more weight since Katniss is supposed to be starved. They should put more contents in 140 minutes. 30 minutes after the beginning, they still don't have any meaningful conversation. The budget claims to be 100 million dollars. Except the cost to the stars, I don't see anything cost much. It shoot in a dull woods, just like one in a city park. Oh, they also have some future costume as you see in any sci-fi movies. Off course, there are some computer animation. That's it.<br/><br/>I went to the theater because it's rated 8.2/10 at IMDb. What a disappointment. I just don't get it. I created a account so that there can be some different views. My wife even left in the middle of the show."

","I like a lot of movies. I am in no way a movie snob. Not to say I love everything, but I'll try to find something good in most movies. I really struggled with Hunger Games. Like other reviewers have said, (and they are 100% on the mark) the camera work, the scene changes every .17 seconds, the shakiness, and the constant extreme closeups were beyond annoying and solidly detracted from the movie. I don't think the camera stayed fixed for over 2 seconds in the entire movie. This fact alone made the experience extremely unnerving and is a sure sign of a poorly made movie that is trying to compensate for a complete lack of substance. Which is really too bad because the premise at least sounded somewhat interesting, albeit slightly overused, and the books have sold like hotcakes so there must be some appeal to them. Towards the end the jittery/strobe-camera overpowered the value of the movie and I left when the parents started rioting. I believe this was the first time I've ever walked out of a movie, which was frustrating because I wanted to like it. Twilight and this turkey are aimed solidly at teens which is sad because it had the chance to be good, but is definitely not. Update 1-14-2015. After a second viewing I came to accept the camera shakiness. I stand by my review, but could have been a little more forgiving. 6 of 10 stars."

I do hope that the second movie rights the wrongs that were done by the screenwriters. If you never read the books, well then it was a great movie.

I'm not sure why Hollywood is so obsessed with this new style, but I find it incredibly annoying and sickening.

All in all a really bad movie I would say. Too many loopholes, bad direction, worse storyline (& very predictable) and one hour into the movie, you begin to wonder when its gonna get over!!!!

","I went to see the film based on a friend's status update. (we have a vested interest in fantasy books) Not having read the books, I thought I'd probably like the film more. It was awful. Zero character development, zero explanation of the settings. Dystopia? Really? Randomly show girl sitting in the rain and guy throws her stale bread and whoa we have dystopia. Show random people with grime on their face and in their skivvies while everyone elsewhere has the worst hair styles this side of Jersey Shore and presto! Dystopia. And zero physics (in this case the insanely enhanced technology in the dystopic world) explanation. Random dogs sprouting out of the ground? How? Also, fireballs? :/<br/><br/>I'm certain the books explain all this, flesh out the characters, instead of randomly developing rivalries despite not having shared even a couple of words on screen.<br/><br/>Hunger Games, (maybe an) awesome book. But appallingly bland film.<br/><br/>Hugo was only about 15 minutes longer than the Hunger Games. Both originate from YA books. Yet by the end of the Hugo film experience, I was already clamoring for a second watch. Now I'm wary about reading the Hunger Games books."

","The Hunger Games (movie) was pretty decent on it's own. Although there was little to no back story and not much focus on the supposed Katniss- Peeta romance. Compared to the book, it was the most god-awful film I have ever﻿ seen. The mutts were so obviously CG and they could have at least made them look like werewolves, not pit-bulls with gorilla faces. The cornucopia was the wrong colour, texture, and shape. Haymitch looked far too well-kept for an alcoholic, the prep team didn't talk enough, they were supposed to be bubbly, even with their disgust with Katniss' body. Cinna was absolutely perfect and Caesar was excellent. Peeta wasn't attractive enough, Gale was too attractive, Snow looked too old (I know he's supposed to look older than most Capitol citizens, but not much) Katniss didn't retrieve arrows, never counted them or was worried about how many she had in the slightest. She also always had a full quiver. Cato was supposed to fight the mutts﻿ for hours, not seconds. Buttercup was the wrong colour. Rue's death was wrong. Peeta's parents never spoke to Katniss about taking care of her family and never gave her a bag of cookies. The mayor's daughter (gives Katniss the mockingjay pin in the book) wasn't so much as mentioned, even though she plays a large role in the third book, Mockingjay. Foxface didn't look like a fox, and was only called that once (by Peeta, not Katniss who made the association between her and a fox in the first place). If you have not read the books, I would highly recommend it, if you have read the books, I would not. I would not have been as bothered by the changes if there wasn't so many of them. I also wouldn't have been as bothered by them if Suzanne Collins had not written the terrible screen adaptation of her own book.

"jja155","3","51","96","24 March 2012"," unwatchable
","Three major things wrong with this movie. And unlike every other bad review its not because something didn't match up with the book...<br/><br/>1: This should have been an adult rated film: and I'm not saying that because I'm against kids watching anything gory. I watched the shining when I was 6 (even though a theater filled with unsupervised teenyboppers was greatly annoying especially since they talk through every preview except that sparkling vampire crap)... I'm saying this because the movie needed a more realistic gore. Every time you are about to see any kind of physical damage it cuts out that angle. this brings me to my next point.<br/><br/>2: Who edited this movie?: From the very beginning of the movie to the bitter end there is senseless shaky-cam and 180 cuts, theirs even a cut just about every second and a half. This movie moves so fast it gives you a headache and I wish I was taking about the story line.<br/><br/>3: Combine my first two points into one whopping one: The worst part of this movie is that you wait sooo long for anything cool to happen, through the yawns you finally get to start seeing action, and then what happens? faster cuts and ten times the shaky cam. If you try and watch these scenes yer eyes would cross. That right there sums it up, you wait for a good scene then you cant even watch it...<br/><br/>(The only way this movie has gotten any good reviews is from the teenagers they decided to make this for.. Lets look at the kinds of cinematic expertise they have in there favorite selection: Twilight, high school musical, ... I'm sorry I don't know any teen spawned crap flics kinda happy I don't they give me a headache.)

","$155m on the opening weekend, a rating of more than 8 on IMDb and so many positive reviews on RT..I don't know if i am the lone ranger left in the movie watching society or there are some others that echo my opinion. I went to the movie watching the previews excited that the previews created pretty good build up to the real story but sadly for me the whole movie was just the set-up for greater things to come ..which never came. I sat through the whole movie expecting something exciting to start any moment..but that moment never came and i left disappointed in the end. <br/><br/>I have never written a review for a movie but this one just stirred me up a little. A movie these days runs on either CGI or an exceptional story or brilliant presentation. I found this one had none...the performances by the actors were not bad..but it was as monotonous as seeing someone running on the treadmill for an hour and a half. The movie promised some stellar action..but it had very run of the mill action sequences. This one reminded me of a movie 'the condemned' probably a little on the similar lines..i didn't like that movie when i saw it a few years ago, but this one makes it look better now...it at least had better action. CGI ..i don;t remember if they had to use any for this movie. Even the fighting was minimal and the action was left to the audience's imagination ( you will find out what i am saying when you watch the movie and IF you watch the movie ) <br/><br/>It makes me think how these days we are sold to what we see a hundred times a day and hear a hundred times a day and will find even sh** glamorous if a starlet is using it to brighten up her skin. This movie might not be bad overall , but it betrayed the audience ( at least me ) because it promised me a diamond ring in a shiny package but all i got was a well packaged empty box. And the diamond that i found was probably lying neglected in the dirt in the shape of ""the raid: redemption"".and what money it made ? $ 200,000 ! <br/><br/>I am giving it 2 points because i love all the movies and it's more like a ZERO for me."
"firephoenix712","5","61","117","24 March 2012"," A huge disappointment...
","**Contains spoilers** I was really disappointed with this movie. I was so excited for it before hand because there is a lot of action in the book that would be better seen on a screen. The book made the story exciting, intense, and it really drew the reader in. The movie was the complete opposite.<br/><br/>There was almost no character development. If I had never read the book, I feel that I would have left the theater asking who was Katniss, Peeta and everyone else. In, face this is what my boyfriend experienced. The script writers did not include any dialog that demonstrated the bonds that the characters shared such as the bond between Katniss and Peeta, between Katniss and Rue, and between Katniss and Cinna. For example, Rue's death was supposed to be a heart-wrenching moment and the events leading up to it happened so quickly, that I did not feel that Katniss felt anything for Rue. This made all of Katniss' actions after Rue's death seem superficial. Also, President Snow did not come off as dangerous and imposing as he did in the novel. There are many other examples that illustrate this point.<br/><br/>The dialog in general was very little and very lacking in sophistication and explanatory detail. I realize that the novel was narrated in first-person and thus there was not going to much dialog to begin with but they could have had better music to fill in all of the silences. In fact, because there was so little talking and music, I found the movie incredibly boring, something to book was definitely not. Maybe they should have had Katniss narrate some parts of the movie especially things that happened in the past, like her father's death and her family's struggle afterward. She could have been telling the audience the story as looking back on her experience. This would have been a huge change from the novel's present tense, but it would have provided the audience with more entertainment that just watching a camera follow people around the woods.<br/><br/>Also, people who did not read the novel, like my boyfriend, may be very confused about some parts of the film. The movie skimmed over many events that were very important to character development or the story. These include Katniss's father's death, her mother's depression, and Peeta's kindness when he gave Katniss a loaf of bread. I know that a lot happened in the novel and that a movie cannot show everything, but they glazed over too many important things that were needed to give background for the story and thus depth to the movie. This includes that everyone outside of the Capital were starving. I did not feel this or how hard everyone in the districts' lives were from the movie at all.<br/><br/>While there were some special effects, a lot more interesting things could have been done with the cinematography. Also, the shaky camera shots that were frequent at the beginning of the movie were distracting, unnecessary, and made the movie look poorly made.<br/><br/>The one and only thing that the movie brought that was a great addition to the book was the behind-the-scenes information provided by the commentators while the game aired, the gamemakers, and the scenes with the Head Gamemaker and President Snow. It was interesting to see why the things that happened to Katniss in the arena took place.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie lacked depth and intensity. This was primarily due to the serious lack of character and relationship development, the lack of dialog/good music, and the skimming over of major background story building. It was a poorly constructed movie that felt rushed 90% of the time and dragged on in unnecessary ways the other 10%. I would not recommend seeing it..."

","I read the Hunger Games books and was thrilled to see the on screen adaption of the story. I was very disappointed with this movie. I will keep this short, but here are my reasons.<br/><br/>The film feels like a synopsis of the book. So much of the story was cut out, the film is maybe 1/2 the content of the book. It was rushed so much so that the characters were not believable at all. The acting was good yes, but the characters were very poorly adapted to the screen. I felt no connection with the characters whatsoever.<br/><br/>The books are violent and bloody. The movie, not at all. The most violent death is near the end though nothing is shown. The most gory thing is a cut on one of the character's faces. It's just a line of syrup to give the impression of a cut.<br/><br/>The film felt low budget. It was shot guerrilla style. The camera was very shaky in some parts and the special effects were very poor. I feel like the film makers were simply trying to make a quick buck on a successful book.<br/><br/>Overall the movie was awful. The acting was great, don't get me wrong. But the telling of this amazing story was terrible. It was not believable in the slightest. The special effects were awkward and the characters were flat (at no fault of the actors). Don't waste your money. Go see something else."
"bbhegedus","3","86","170","23 March 2012"," Readers of the Book Beware
","The Hunger Games trilogy is without a doubt one of the best young adult novel series of all time. The Hunger Games movie is one of the worst book-to-film adaptations of all time.<br/><br/>The potential that this movie had is indescribable. I was ecstatic with anticipation for this book's adaptation, and to say that I was let down is the understatement of the year. It practically seems like the screenwriters just read the SparkNotes version of the book and decided to fill in the blanks themselves. Details seemed to be changed every where you look, and it's usually for the worse. <br/><br/>Despite the fact that the runtime of the movie is well over 2 hours, the characters are extremely poorly developed and important points of the plot are omitted every which way. Even as I sit here writing this review, myself and the people with whom I saw the midnight premiere with are coming up with more and more things from the book that were either altered, or omitted from the movie. Although I could sit here and list an endless number of erroneous plot points in the movie, I'll just say the single thing that ticked me off the most: THEY DIDN'T EVEN SHOW OR SAY ANYTHING ABOUT THE RED HAIRED AVOX GIRL FROM THE BOOK<br/><br/>The further I get into this review, the more infuriated I become. It just seems like everything is wrong. The ""muttations"" weren't ANYTHING remotely close to what they were described as in the book. The final action sequence was untrue to the book and – in my opinion – was boring and had no rising action. It just happened. No climax. No falling action. That's actually pretty much how the whole movie was. It was like a straight line from start to finish.<br/><br/>Personally, I love going to midnight premieres. The crowd is lively and hyped — ultimately creating an awesome viewing experience. The Hunger Games has been dubbed the new generation's Harry Potter, and if that's true, I fear for the new generation. If you've ever had the privilege to see a Harry Potter midnight premiere, you will know that there are innumerable times when the audience erupts in thunderous applause when a big plot point happens. That didn't happen with the Hunger Games. Not even once. <br/><br/>I'm beyond disappointed. I'm not entirely sure I want to see Catching Fire if they decide they was to do a movie for all three books. It is completely perplexing to me as to how a Harry Potter movie can be more true to the book in the same (or less) amount of time, regardless of having 400+ more pages. <br/><br/>The ending is completely baffling. What happened?! In the book, Peeta and Katniss are already growing distant and mistrusting of one another, yet in the movie it seems as if everything is peachy. The screenwriters actually screwed up the story to a point where I can only wonder how they will even attempt to transform Catching Fire into the big screen. In the end of this movie, Peeta and Katniss are all smiles so how are they supposed to turn to sudden conflict in the sequel? The Hunger Games prospective movie trilogy has only set itself up for failure in the future, if it hasn't failed already.<br/><br/>So often from people you will hear ""the book was better."" Usually, such people are just being snobby, but in this case it is true. Rarely, if ever does a movie exceed it's literary counterpart, but it should at least be considered a standard for a movie to be just about on par with the book in terms of quality. Thinking back on the movie now, just 30 minutes later, I am unable to recall a single memorable attribute.<br/><br/>This I recommend to you: read the book. Even if you have seen the movie, read the book. Let your own imagination create the scenes. Do not allow yourself to be let down as I was. I do not anticipate recommending this movie to any of my friends who have read the book. In the hearts and minds of so many, The Hunger Games books are sacred. This movie serves to tarnish the emotional connection one has with the book by simply providing images without emotion."

I went in thinking nothing. <br/><br/>First Impression: The movie had a really slow kick start... thats even if it had a kick start.. I know the director was probably trying to portray the sadness and poverty in the districts with the slow music, but it wasn't the music that got to me. Coming from a person who did not read the books (me) i found myself quite lost in the story. But i did some pre-reading before watching so I had already known what the storyline was. <br/><br/>HYPE!!: I kept waiting.... and waiting .... and waiting... for the action to kick in, for the action to explode into awesome action sequences!!. I was waiting for the music to LIFT!! To pick up the PACE!! but sadly.... it never came... It continued on from a sad poverty story... to a sad sympathetic story... to a sad Love Story.. It wasn't all sad to say the least. <br/><br/>There were action scene's, some well constructed ones. But for a movie that advertised itself so much, it failed to live up to the hype. Project X offered more action sequences than this did. At least it offered the other kind of ""action"" ... anyways. <br/><br/>Scenes that were meant to be romantic/sad ??? I don't know... whatever the scene was trying to convey it definitely wasn't suppose to be funny, cause I laughed and laughed at these scenes. <br/><br/>Special effects weren't great either. <br/><br/>Overall rating: 1 Star is given for the action, 1 Star is given out of my pocket for generosity. <br/><br/>Thats my review, the Opinion of a Random Guy in the crowd, who at ice cream, pop corn and drank coke while trying to enjoy the movie. <br/><br/>Hope you enjoy the movie, I really do. =)"

I also just noticed she is supposed to be 16... I don't think so sweetheart.<br/><br/>Believability/Technology. So you are telling me that they have thousands of rich people in this giant city that splurge on everything, yet there are a few hundred people in each district that live in poverty. That is a stretch, but still believable, until they show you that they have the technology to create beasts out of thin air that can destroy anything in sight. Yet they still require these outlying districts do farm and get food. You can't automate a farm? Really? You can launch fireballs through the sky by swiping on some giant computer, but you can't grow food without oppressed slave-type people? They broadcast in the sky! Automate a farm, that's all I'm saying...<br/><br/>Twilight Effect. Twilight had the vampire and the werewolf, and that was so popular that it actually created sects of fans that were either one or the other, so let's steal that idea because young teens are all about it. So they keep going between the guy she liked from back home and the guy that she was stuck with in the game. We've seen it before, but it will probably work, again and again, because teens and preteens are all about boyfriends and girlfriends and love and... Comic characters. Luckily they didn't go that far, it's not like they created suits that not only protect them from fire but also can create it by either spinning or being in a cart.<br/><br/>Thinking. It seemed like a lot of the characters seemed to know and react like they knew what other characters were thinking. When the guy from district 11 let Katniss (Hate that name by the way, makes me think Cat *iss) escape because of her friendship with the little girl from district 11, how did he know anything about their relationship? I understand he overheard the girl say she killed the little girl and maybe that the two of them had some sort of friendship, but to let her go, I feel he had to have known a lot more for him to realistically do that.<br/><br/>Pace. I felt the movie was very drawn out, yet anytime something important was happening it was rushed.<br/><br/>Woody. I actually thought he was a good actor. I didn't like that fact that he was a total drunk and wouldn't listen to them, then one scene later he was sober and doing everything he could to help. His transition felt rushed.<br/><br/>The Ending. Where the hell did those dogs come from? That felt very rushed. I would have liked a little more background. Maybe someone mentioning it earlier like ""Watch out at the end, after x amount of time they release the beast things"" Then the whole berry thing was a little lame. It's been 74 years running and they have never run into this issue before? The dual suicide? I find it hard to believe that this all powerful regime is going to change things to stop a revolt.<br/><br/>The Revolt. That's what it took? 74 years of sending 2 people down to get killed, knowing they will die, then when she is on a mission that she is lighting fires and using herself as bait she dies, and that is what it took for the district to fight back? They knew she was dead as soon as she left, just like the other 146 people before her. You figure this would have happened before that, 12 districts, 2 people, 74 years, so you are saying all these people sat through 1776 people dying over generations, but this is what caused an uprising? Costumes. I actually liked the costumes. It showed a good contrast between the rich and the poor. Very eye-catching and showed that they were all rich. I also liked the shape of the beard; it was very unique and helped the believability by showing that this wasn't earth or at least the earth that we know, so it makes sense that there are a lot of things that are different. Wait a second... I just read the IMDb and noticed that this is supposed to be North America in the not-so-distant future... I'm sorry but there is no way this is the not so distant future.<br/><br/>All in all. I think it was way over-hyped, but I never saw twilight and that made a ton of money and I am told was even more hyped and even worse. At least the acting in this, for the most part, was tolerable. They didn't have as much overacting as Twilight did (at least from the previews that I saw). I don't regret watching it, but I won't be standing in line to watch it again. At least they didn't make it 3D; I don't think I would have been able to stomach an $18 ticket."
"jimmietee","2","43","80","25 March 2012"," The movie destroyed the best part of the book
","Tight, well written action sequences was the best part of the book. The character of Katniss was not particularly likable (the author even went to great lengths to have Katniss state that herself a few times). The story line was a bit forced, but that is acceptable in a young adult title. It was a quick read overall, and that made the net gain (in the Hunger Games book) worth the time spent reading. A fast paced action story.<br/><br/>The movie decided it would use shaky cameras for dramatization. Not just when it might actually add drama (like when viewing the District 12 area for the first time) but throughout the entire movie. And I think the director might have ordered the cameraman to shake the camera particularly hard during major action sequences.<br/><br/>The net effect is, the action sequences are a huge blur, a moment of clarity, a huge blur, action done. Taking the action out of an action story pretty much misses the whole point.<br/><br/>If you read the books and enjoyed the well written action, don't bother with the movie."

The direction and camera-work was poorly executed, making me wonder if someone had a bad hangover and thought a hand-held camera was a good idea. No continuance in storyline, nor did the main characters exactly look starved...<br/><br/>I suppose for teenagers it will do, but to reach a wider audience perhaps a little bit more professionalism in script/editing/direction/production is required.

","The book was a lot more enjoyable and a much better story than the movie. Understandably, it is difficult to develop the characters and fully explain the story in a movie but this movie did the book a disservice. To the person who has not read the book the characters will seem confusing and shallow because little was done to explain their story and their relationship. Many major portions of the character development were left out. In particular the relationship between Primrose and Catniss and how that built on the relationship between Catniss and Rue. Additionally, the relationship between Catniss and Peeta and the complications and internal conflict it causes in Catniss is inadequate. Finally we get to Haymitch, the movie does his character wrong and he is a shadow of what he is in the book. There are many other things that I disliked about the movie, I only hope that the sequels can do a better job of developing the characters. I will likely wait until the sequels come out on DVD/blue-ray"

First of all they should have never have made it PG-13, the gory scenes would have made the film much better and not trying to make this a Disney movie. The Hunger Games film was so shallow, especially when it came to the characters. You didn't really get the story since there was no motivation for the characters, you didn't get there personalities well and there backgrounds.They only character that I related with was Cato from district 2.

","I did give it a 7 because I saw it twice this weekend. I went to the sold out Imax experience with friends on the 23rd and again the following morning alone to a regular showing. The 1st half I liked. It was the pre-arena. The characters were exacting what I imagined them from reading the book. I loved it. I put down my half eaten popcorn at this point and didn't touch it again. The 2nd half, the Arena. The camera was a little too shaky. I understand it was more really coming from right up close in the action. but there is a fine line between real fight and I shouldn't have eaten so much popcorn i'm a little nauseous. Katniss: I think she was perfect for this role. Some thing I would have changed. She is a strong woman. I understand she's gets a little fridged in front of a crowd, but she came off as total ditz compared to the kick-ass chick persona of the rest of the movie. <br/><br/>Peeta, This is exactly what I thought of as peeta, in looks. He was big and strong and played in love well. except in the arena. Arena Peeta was sooooo much more of a wimp than you could imagine by just reading hte books. the Peeta of the books was not a soft footed woodman like gale but he wasn't a total wimp. The wimpyness of peeta was a little too much and way too disappointing. I don't care how old you are, everyone loves peeta by the end of the book. Movie Peeta: I was surprised he made it to the river for Katniss to save him. <br/><br/>The good news is, there will be another one and hopefully Peeta will man up a little and katniss will loose the blank expression.

"Leofwine_draca","3","9","13","28 June 2014"," This film's popularity eludes me
","No, I'm not going to spend this review going on about how THE HUNGER GAMES is a clear rip-off of BATTLE ROYALE (even though it is, the subject's been done to death). Instead, I'm going to talk about the things I disliked, even though I went into this hoping to love it; after all, I invested two-and-a-half-hours of my life in this movie, so of course I was hoping I'd have a good time with it.<br/><br/>The first problem is with the pacing. It takes an hour and a half or so for the actual games (in which teenagers fight to the death) to begin. Until that time, there are endless attempts at needless characterisation, some training montages that go nowhere and add nothing to the overall effect, and lots of extraneous supporting characters. Some of these characters, particularly the likes of those played by Elizabeth Banks and Stanley Tucci, complete with stupid hairdos and costumes, look like they belong in a kid's film and the acting is horrendous. I felt embarrassed for them most of the time.<br/><br/>When we finally get to the games, they're equally disappointing. It's not just that they're not very violent (although the BBFC's decision to further tone down the violence is frustrating), it's that they're badly directed with stupid shaky-cam work by a director who doesn't understand how to utilise it properly. Jennifer Lawrence gives another bland and unlikeable turn as a stand-offish heroine and I didn't give a fig for any of the characters, good or bad. Instead I was just hoping for it to be over, and quickly, but THE HUNGER GAMES is one of those films that seems to go on forever. By the time some CGI creations are added into the mix (what, did the scriptwriters get bored with the storyline?) I realised that this is awful, awful stuff indeed. And even worse - they're making sequels?!"

","For those who have studied or read about the decline of the Roman Empire, you will feel like you are sitting in the Colliseum watching Gladiators fighting to death. Kill or get killed, that how this movie can be summarized.<br/><br/>After all the excitement I read about it, I decided to watch it. I am so disappointed to see our society back 2000 years ago when Romans would sit in an arena (now we sit in front of the TV), watch the Gladiators forced to fight and get excited every time one would fall. <br/><br/>The only reason I gave one star is that there was no possibility to give zero. The most worrying thing is to hear teens saying how cool the movie is. A similar movie that would tell the story of real Gladiators and their conditions would be much more entertaining yet informative. Oups! Did I say informative? Sorry, that was not the goal of the movie.<br/><br/>No story. No morale. Just cheap, cruel entertainment."
"bandw","3","9","13","12 April 2012"," Some good, more bad
","This story takes place in a post-apocalyptic North America where rich, elite, decadent power brokers, located in ""the Capitol,"" control twelve distinct oppressed districts.<br/><br/>There is a glimmer of substance as social satire, with the controlling government using the obsessive power of television to hold the populace in abeyance by offering them an annual event called ""The Hunger Games,"" where twenty-four teenagers are selected (two from each of the twelve districts) to be set loose in a large forested area to go after killing one another until a lone survivor wins the contest. There are TV cameras in every area of the forest so that the event, which is really but a variation on Roman gladiator confrontations, can be broadcast on national TV for viewers to witness the action. The emcee of the show (Stanley Tucci), encapsulates pretty much every disgusting quality in his delivery as any of the talk show or game show hosts that I have ever seen on TV. The irony is that the thing being satirized, the violence and inanity of much of what is offered on contemporary TV, is the very thing that this movie itself offers to its audience as a crowd pleaser--a game where teenagers try to kill each other. The fact that this movie is so popular only proves its satirical point.<br/><br/>The story is absurd and if an attempt at logical analysis is made, then a long list of plot holes can be compiled. What are the odds of two people who know each other being selected at random from the thousands in a single district? When the heroine is in ultimate distress, an unknown competitor comes out of nowhere to rescue her? The rules are changed in the middle of the game so that the two finalists, who have fallen for each other, can share the title? Then the rules are changed back? Then changed again? Is it reasonable to pit twelve year old girls against eighteen year old boys in this contest? Is there really delight to be had from seeing an eighteen year old boy kill a twelve year old girl? And so on. Perhaps it is best not to apply reasoning to this movie.<br/><br/>The main positive is the appearance of the promising young actress Jennifer Lawrence as the heroine. She plays the part of the tough minded and independent Katniss Everdeen to perfection. Her performance here is not dissimilar to her Oscar nominated performance in ""Winter's Bone."" I look forward to seeing more of her in better movies. Josh Hutcherson, as Lawrence's love interest, turns in a generic performance. Donald Sutherland is on hand as the president, I suppose to give a little gravitas to the proceedings. He offers a profundity from time to time such as, ""A little hope is effective, a lot of hope is dangerous."" Surely appearing in this has to be an embarrassment for him; I hope he was well paid.<br/><br/>There are some interesting visuals, but I don't think they make any advances in that area beyond what has been done in countless other recent films. In fact, the 1956 ""Forbidden Planet"" has more imaginative and enticing images.<br/><br/>The costuming is bizarre, ranging from 18th century French court to 1940s Hollywood. Wes Bentley, as the game-master, had such an intricately shaped beard that I hope his work was filmed in one day, since getting that thing right every day would be a pain. The government goons were dressed in accordance with commonly conceived stereotypes. This must have been a ripe plumb to land for costume designers, being called upon to implement such wild get-ups.<br/><br/>The one thing that drove me absolutely nuts, and almost made me sick, was the filming with a hand-held camera. The camera is in constant motion. I would frequently pray that the camera be held still for just a few seconds, but my prayers were not answered. I can maybe understand this technique where the attempt is to confuse and blur the action in some of the scenes of graphic violence, but the damn camera jerks even when there are just two people talking in close-up. I do not understand what the desired effect is in using this distracting technique. It is obviously willed, since it is not necessary in most scenes, and exaggerated in others.<br/><br/>In some ways this movie cheats the audience. Think seriously about this, the premise is grisly but the movie does not carry through on that. Most of the violence is done in rapid takes, blurred images, or off screen. Maybe this was done to preserve a PG rating, but if you are going to set up a horrifying theme, then it should not be covered up with a feel good rendering. The reaction to this movie is a sad commentary on our times. When Shirley Jackson's short story ""The Lottery"" appeared in 1948 (the ""winner"" is stoned to death), it created controversy and outrage. Now we have ""The Hunger Games"" where teenagers are selected by lottery to slaughter each other and there is only audience approval. People who are entertained by this are the same ones who would have been entertained by the gladiator contests in ancient Rome."

Moving on from the ridiculous, I can't go without mentioning the ""over the top"" costumes. It appears that the only one that got costuming time was Effie. The rest was a very weak attempt.

"jmzified08","2","25","44","28 March 2012"," Never read the books, but still found it painful.
","I never got into the books but when the film was announced I was told the general plot by a friend and it intrigued me to say the least. It sounded a lot like Battle Royale, but any movie that has that sort of 'last man standing... with kids!' Game employed would sound like Battle Royale. That movie was truly the first of its kind. After seeing the promos for this film my intrigue subsided slightly, as it looked like a child's film... Low and behold, it really was.<br/><br/>Firstly, I don't know why subject matter like that should be aimed at children as it's quite dark, so why attempt to make it a 'safe' film and torture mature audience members with things such as awfully obscure camera work (to hide the violence) and in whole, a watered down film?<br/><br/>Secondly, if the books were anything like the film then that's not a good reflection on society, as there is no way that these should become best sellers based on story telling (then again, Twilight and Fifty Shades of Grey became bestsellers). I doubt that the book and film had too much in common anyway. This movie contained a few too many plot holes that grinded on me (what happened to the 'sponsors'?) as well as some cringeworthy lead role acting, and did I mention the watered down plot?<br/><br/>Another thing that gets a notable mention is that the female protagonist doesn't do anything in the whole film without someone else's help! I found that rather annoying, as a good protagonist in a film like this I'd expect some sort of kick-assness about them.<br/><br/>To cut it short, I thought it was too long, too safe and way too commercial for it to be respected by cinema-goers. I wish Takashi Miike could get hold of something like this. This was way too mainstream for anything good to amount from it.<br/><br/>It gets 2 stars because of Woody Harrelson's performance keeping me awake."

Still, I can appreciate some of the attempts made like harry potter (good, but far from the book), and the girl with the dragon tattoo (very good the American version!). Althou I didn't find the harry potter movies nearly as good as the books I still think they did a good job with the time they had to tell the story of each book on the screen, was a good effort and the movie was good and entertaining.<br/><br/>Now ""The Hunger Games"", please how can this have 8.0 ? Even from people that have not read the book? The movie is so bad, bad acting, story is so compacted that I doubt someone can feel anything from the dramatic parts of the movie... Come on how could Suzane Collins let this get out to the public? Please do a Re-make before you launch the second movie! This one was really bad..."

","I feel like all of the reviewers and fans have gone insane. I can understand why someone who has not read the books might enjoy the movie. But I can't fathom why fans thought it was good. It's not about changing details. It's about changing the entire mood of the film.<br/><br/>It started out well, though the cinematography was overboard and a bit amateurish. We can connect to characters emotionally without having constant closeups and shakiness. They got the capital spot on however. This gave me high hopes.<br/><br/>The minute the game started it went downhill. The dramatic strength of this story is in the contrast between the lighthearted ignorant and almost satirical mood of the members of the capital and the brutal, totally unfunny mood of the games.<br/><br/>My complaints are best summed up by the careers. When they first see katniss in the river and skip along with an excited ""oh my god there she is!"" ""Lets get her"" I did a face-palm. So much smiling. They were jogging. The whole point of the hunger games is that it's not really a game. It's not fun. The careers smiled and joked like friends. They are supposed to have an alliance of convenience, barely tolerating each other and always having a plan to slit each other's throat. That tension is necessary to this story and it just makes no sense without it since everyone knows there must be one winner.<br/><br/>Also, they got the rue thing totally wrong. katniss initiates that alliance. Rue is scared and cautious. She would never have assumed katniss would want an alliance because she thinks no one values her as a combatant. Alright fine they got that wrong. Then they spend all of about 5 minutes developing their relationship. Then she dies and katniss mourns her for 10 minutes like she is her best friend. It makes sense in the book because of the nature of their relationship but it felt so forced in the movie. Since they shortened the time frame to fit it into the film she only knew rue for 1-2 days. And then she sobs nonstop.<br/><br/>Well there you go. My opinion. Way to happy and juvenile."

","If you've already seen movies like Predator, Running Man, Gamer, The Condemned, Gladiator/Spartacus shows, Deadman Wonderland etc about people pitted against each other for survival and only one can be the victor you got an idea what the movie Hunger Games is about. But not as good as I thought this movie would be with the hype.<br/><br/>I was skeptical because I felt originality was amiss and I don't want to watch a group of teens thrown in a melting pot with gore action. Which I heard Battle Royale was like. If this movie taught me anything is that authors like to throw in a Teenage-Romance in the midst of fighting for love to increase sales on books and movie adaptations. I went to watch this movie with an open mind an hr later it felt like watching the grammys with talk show hosts and fashion statements, another hour later footage of romance themes and cutshots/glimpses of action. Lots of plot holes, weak character development and weak story to begin with and to end with. Worse it's a trilogy it felt like Twilight.<br/><br/>What's weird was that the contestants didn't look hungry in the movie like they were starving for food in order to survive or cannibalize.

It seems that the story has been made in total of 4 minutes. There is no complexity and this movie is not trying to make you to use your brain at all. Everything is so predictable. The environment of the movie is so exaggerated. The styling, dresses, mood, everything. Someone is trying to be some kind of modern Tim Burton. And I wont even begin with these young actors, who are just not convincing at all. I guess the high ratings for this movie came from young teenagers.

The anticipation was tangible as they waited to see how faithful the book was going to be to the movie, and if Katniss and Peter were all they had imagined them to be. What they saw was hard core dehumanization. <br/><br/>The fact that we find teens killing each other in big-screen gladiatorial combat entertaining marks a new societal low. This is more than a movie, it is a desensitizing and trivializing of life and death as a form of twisted broadcast amusement.

"stern-benjamin","6","53","103","27 March 2012"," Critics missed the most salient failing of this film.
","When I read the first critic reviews that sprang up I didn't see anything out of the ordinary for a book to movie adaptation; Characters were omitted, characters weren't developed as well as the books, plot points were dropped, etc. <br/><br/>I knew this going in, and as I said fairly predictable for an adaption. However what most reviews missed, including the esteemed Ebert, was the I hope Zenith of what David Bordwell calls intensified continuity, a narrative trend towards quick cuts, hand-held cameras, and camera movement. A great example would be the third Bourne movie where there were reports of people throwing up in the theaters, with an average shot length of under 3s.<br/><br/>The Hunger Games lacks the clarity of the Bourne film in terms of framing though. As I said, expected the story to have trouble with fidelity, but I was always hopeful that at the very least I would be able to SEE a beloved series in live action.<br/><br/>Instead, all I can really remember were a few master shots, some blurry trees and Jennifer Laurence's face. They make up 90% of the 2,500 plus shots in the film. All the action, probably for PG-13 rating, is so closely framed and quickly cut that any comprehension of who is actually doing what to who is retarded. <br/><br/>I hear Ross is on for Part 2, so I just rented Battle Royale, and hopefully that can salvage my disappointment. I will say I thought the Trailer was really cool, and the few times you do see Panem, the costumes and make up were spot on. No real complaints with the actors either, they did the best with the screen time they had, even if most of their emotions are unjustifiable without having read the book because the film makes no effort to explain or validate whats going on."

The movie ended with the protagonist winning but the killings continued as the whole Hunger games TV show continued. To what level have we, as humans, not animals, have stooped to? Where we find teenagers killing each other for survival as a good film? Are we getting that desensitized to violence?<br/><br/>Yes, there was not too much gory visible violence but the implied violence was definitely there.<br/><br/>We ban pitbulls fights and cockfights but consider acceptable watching a movie about teenagers fighting in a forced manipulated ring for survival, not by their intelligence or ingenuity but by their ability to force them to use weapons and kill others?<br/><br/>Heres an idea, why not bring back bull fighting, yeah, lets allow that, its entertaining to see an animal slowly die. Better yet, how about bringing back the Roman Coliseum shows that were fought to the death. We could call it Extreme fighting, not ultimate fighting - hows that?

","The underlying themes of this movie appear to have been redemption, fighting oppression, determination and perhaps other positive ideas, but sadly and unfortunately these are buried deep beneath the violence and gore typical of the Hollywood shock value system that values shock factor above such notions. <br/><br/>What's more disturbing is that the trend in shock violence and gore for most films was confined for the most part to adult (R) rated films - not that this stops younger people from seeing them, but at least such classification prevents the implication of a gross societal acceptance for such graphic imagery to some extent.<br/><br/>Not so with this film - by allowing a rating of PG-13, not only has the MPAA grossly neglected their duties in classifying age appropriate material, but it has allowed for such abject violence to be viewed as ""acceptable"" - even more so than before (e.g. ridiculously graphic video games) - by the teen/young adult population, with potentially far-reaching repercussions on a large subset of our society already faced with the difficulties of understanding their place in the larger world around them.<br/><br/>It seems we are always wondering: where does so much violence in our society come from? We watch the news, constantly aghast as we see people, particularly young people, acting out in amazingly violent and shocking fashion - seemingly ""out of nowhere"".<br/><br/>Yet here we are, charged with shepherding our youth, but instead of giving the care and attention we should about what our kids and teens are exposed to, we are constantly allowing them access to violence, more so than even adults, in the form of movies like these, video games, etc. <br/><br/>We already know full well they are in such a hurry to grow up and that when we allow them to see this they think this kind of exposure and ideology is ""just part of growing up"". We know that they look to adults for guidance as young people - what exactly are we showing them with images of wanton butchering, lifeless children's eyes, etc.? <br/><br/>Do we really think that teens, who deal with so much already in learning to understand the world, will see past that so easily? Will a teen watching this really get the sense that this is ""really"" about how depraved society can be, or ""rising above oppression"", or any of that? Or are they more likely, especially younger teens, to be scared and shocked by the violence they see, and believe, at least to a certain extent, that there must be some basis for this kind of violence in the real world? <br/><br/>And does the fact that there is basis for this in the real world mean that it should be used for entertainment purposes and to enrich movie-makers at the cost of suppressing the true indignities and butchery that goes on in the world and that does involve children, teens and young adults?<br/><br/>Shouldn't we require a different venue, a more controlled way of introducing such things to our youth, if we feel that they in fact be introduced? Should they be introduced to a 15 year old? A 14 year old? A 13 year old??<br/><br/>Either way, is this kind of ""shock"" a good thing for kids & teens? How are we not concerned that this will so wrongly plant concepts of violence in them, especially for teens who already use violence to deal with problems or emotions they can't control well - which we know sadly is a large percentage? <br/><br/>Furthermore, we know that kids & teens especially tend to mimic and idolize what they see, especially when it's in a ""cool movie"" , or comes from a ""cool book"" that ""everybody"" likes. Unfortunately we know that many of them just haven't developed the ability to distinguish between ""fiction"" and ""reality"" enough - certainly not to the point where there wouldn't be at least some negative effects from this kind of imagery. <br/><br/>And isn't the movie, by the fact it is a big ""cool"" Hollywood movie, implying ""this violence is cool"" or ""it's cool to use weapons on each other"" or ""well killing is the only option if you have to survive"" etc.?<br/><br/>Try to think about this for a second: <br/><br/>IF THE MOVIE MAKERS OR AUTHOR CARED MOST ABOUT WHAT THE SUPPOSED ""MESSAGE"" OF THE FILM WAS - I.E. TO BE CAREFUL OF HOW SOCIETY CAN DETERIORATE TO OPPRESSION ETC. - THEN WHY WOULD THEY NEED THE ADDED VIOLENCE, BLOOD & GORE IMAGES?? <br/><br/>They could have easily show or depicted the death and drama indirectly, instead of visually showing it to the extent they did - just think of older Westerns or other ""action movies"" where people were shot and ""killed"" but without the added ""shock value"" of actually seeing all the blood and gore. <br/><br/>So clearly what they are really trying to do is shock the audience because that leaves more of an impression, regardless of whether it's a bad or damaging one, and that means better reviews, more of a following, and MORE $MONEY$. <br/><br/>Maybe what we should realize from all of this is that as long as we allow MONEY and GREED to rule our lives from politics to entertainment, we will continue to have major problems around the world that affect us all - which is ironically the only concept of the book that is worth understanding, but which is confused behind the unnecessary violence and gore which again wasn't really needed to get the point across, if it even does come across to the teens who are so shocked by what they see.<br/><br/>Maybe we should encourage all parents and young people to be honest and label these truly as attempts to create ""hype"", take advantage of teens and to make money for the movie studio (and the author by the way)."

Highly deriverative film ""borrows"" elements from ""The Most Dangerous Game"", ""Lord of the Flies"", ""Rollerball"" "", ""Battle Royal"" and last but not least ""The Runing Man The games themself are a cross between ""Gladiator"" , ""Fear Factor""and ""Survivor"", and are quite graphc as teen after teen is eliminated while a zombie like population is forced to watch. The set up takes about half the film's lenght to get there, and once the games begin, the violence starts. Film totally misses the mark because it takes itself way, way to seriously. It would have worked a lot better if it was made as a black comedy or a satire on the so called ""reality shows"" the author Suzanne Collins obviously based these books on, but no attempt is made to correlate the two. Jennifer Lawrence and the mostly no name cast is good, but they don't do very much other than act grim and self determined to succeed at their tasks. As I have already said ,what this film desperately needs is a tongue in cheek sense of humor to help the story move and lighten things up a bit, but the fimmakers totally blew it. I'm sure the 'tween age girl target audience this film is aimed at probably doesn't remember ""The Running Man"" with Schwarzenneger where condemned criminals had to compete on a game show to fight for their lives. What made that film work was the dead -on satire , a keen sense of humor, the brilliant and hilarious one liners and the utterly improbable scenario that the audience ""got"" not too long after the film started. This one uses the same premise, but makes very poor use of it. I'm sure it will do good at the box office with all the hype its been getting, but you will definitely leave the multiplex feeling ""hungry"" for something more satisfying Also, don't be too surprised if you soon start hearing names like Katniss and Peta becoming popular after the drones who watch this overrated piece of drek deciede to name their offsprings as such .Another P-U movie review from Lou!"

","***May contain spoilers, haven't decided yet.***<br/><br/>Quick summary : In post-apocalyptic America, the government dictates each District must provide via lottery-style drawing one boy and one girl between the ages of 12-18 to fight to the death for their viewing pleasure. Katniss Everdeen, a resident of poverty-stricken District 12, volunteers to go in after her sister's name is drawn and has to fight for survival in a whole new way against 23 others.<br/><br/>Let me just start by saying, the book made me cry. If you've read it, I'm sure you can figure out which scene it was, but the fact is that a book made me cry. As a result, I had ENORMOUS expectations for the emotional roller-coaster that the movie should be.<br/><br/>Key word there being ""should"". Director Gary Ross presents a future in which kids slaughter each other for the Capitol's jollies as if they're all just having a big ol' tea party. A book that left you feeling drained by its matter-of-fact telling of shocking horrors that children (yes, people, please do not let Hollywood make you forget that these are CHILDREN) must go through just to survive, was basically put forth in such a way that you're expected to cheer when a 16-year-old is hacked to bits. Oh, but don't worry - in spite of a truly gruesome novel, the movie kept it PG-13 in order to sell more tickets so you don't actually SEE any real violence.<br/><br/>Peeta has been dreadfully miscast, as the actor portraying him comes across something of a pansy. Jennifer Lawrence does what she can with a ridiculously amateurish script, but still, she ain't so great either. <br/><br/>There is ZERO character development - Cinna, Katniss' stylist, is portrayed as a slightly metro, rather flat dude that just sticks her in dresses and that's that. We all know he was a good deal more substantial in the book. Her prep team isn't mentioned at all, and considering the roles they have in the remainder of the trilogy, that strikes as a rather glaring omission. The Avoxes are left out completely, which considering book 3, is also another questionable decision filmmakers made. Clove is tiny, Jennifer Lawrence isn't exactly a shrinking violet, so their scene together is a bit...um...odd. Also done poorly, considering how the scene went in the book. They changed a number of other things for no reason that I could think of, except maybe they think their target audience is a bunch of utter morons that couldn't put 1 and 2 together without getting 5.<br/><br/>You're never, not in the slightest, given a reason to give a damn about Peeta one way or the other. There's no banter between the two, and the major plot point of feigning a relationship to provoke interest and thereby gain sponsors was for all intents and purposes ignored. Another horrendously botched relationship is what develops between Katniss and the little girl from District 11, Rue. The time with Rue is so abrupt and mishandled that you find yourself wondering why Katniss mourns her and THAT was where the film really started becoming unbearable.<br/><br/>Long story short: The film jumped from scene to scene in a way that felt rushed, was two and a half hours long without going deep into ANYTHING, and crucial plotpoints were left out completely. What should've left you emotionally drained and depleted instead left you wondering what the hell genre this pile of crap would be classified as. I thought after I read Mockingjay that I couldn't possibly be more disappointed in this trilogy. Way to prove me wrong, Hollywood."

","I went to see this movie by accident, so I had no preconceived idea nor did I have any idea this comes out from a book series.<br/><br/>Let's put it straight: As a standalone movie, this is ABYSMAL! Just when reading the other reviews, I learned that the movie is an adaptation of a trilogy of books (and even a bad one, apparently). That actually might explains why the movie made no sense at all to me.<br/><br/>The characters are the most shallow I have seen in years. The story is nothing original and looks like it could fit on a post-it. Filming is lackluster and special effects (if any) are no better than a standard TV show. Action is nearing zero and the ending is just plain ridiculous, even as a (non-)cliffhanger for further movies.<br/><br/>Apparently, A LOT of context was left out of the movie from the books, which is hardly excusable as the movie is long and slooowwww, so it can only be described as support material for the books, not as a standalone movie of any value.<br/><br/>Bottom line: If you didn't read the books, don't even consider going to see this ""thing""."
"ttaskinen","10","64","129","11 May 2012"," Emotionally touching journey for an open minded viewer
","First of all, let me say that I'm personally an avid movie and book fanatic. And by that I don't mean just The Hunger Games, but both books and films in overall. With that as my background, I can say I've seen awful a lot of movies and read just as many books. Good and bad. I guess it's also worth mentioning, that I've read all The Hunger Games books as well. Actually, I'm working in a library and therefore can say I've witnessed the sudden ""The Hunger Games"" hype probably from closer than most.<br/><br/>It's true that some of the most violent and disturbing parts of the book have taken a friendlier approach in the film. Is that absolutely a bad thing? If putting children to fight each other to death isn't horrible enough without showing bloody killing scenes and battles, there might be something wrong in your own perspective. What happened to you, book readers? Don't you have imagination at all to fill the missing spots or blank spaces?<br/><br/>Personally, I liked the book and I liked the movie. I liked the rest of the books as well. Suzanne Collins way of writing is very descriptive. She fills the book with detail, especially about how people act, react and feel. <br/><br/>I find it funny when people complain that the actors aren't believable enough in such a situation. How on earth could you know how human being would actually react under such a circumstances? People express emotions differently. <br/><br/>Of course the movie wasn't perfect either. It is a faithful adaption from the book, with some flaws here and there. But most importantly it managed to capture the feeling of the book, the emotions, despair and hope, love and hate between the characters. Towards each other and the Capitol.<br/><br/>Shooting, setting and music was excellent. Jennifer as Katniss was wonderful, Josh as Peeta was believable and Elizabeth Banks, Wes Bentley and especially Stanley Tucci were absolutely amazing. <br/><br/>This is definitely not a teen movie, nor are the books. I personally feel there was a marketing flaw that prevented The Hunger Games from being an masterpiece it could've been. Either as a book or a film. And that is not because of a friendlier approach on a horrible subject. It's because of the prejudice that ""a teen movie"" or ""a teen book"" can not be intelligent or tackle powerful subjects. <br/><br/>In my personal opinion The Hunger Games have a similar feel to one of the best books ever written: George Orwell's 1984. Especially the last book of the series. It's one of those books that leaves you wondering for a long.<br/><br/>A tip for all movie goers. If you're going to see movie looking flaws, you're not gonna see anything else at all. Finding flaws from an imperfect creation doesn't make you clever or witty. Go open minded and don't get stuck on details. Look for emotions and let your imagination fill the rest. Trust me, you'll be enjoying movies a lot more often.<br/><br/>Despite the differences with the book, I think the film deserves a solid or excellent rating. I gave 10 just to tackle the unfair 1-3 ratings that this movie by no yardstick could deserve."
"footballlufc","5","24","43","23 March 2012"," The Hunger Games
","For Anyone you hasn't read the Hunger Games book, i can see why they would enjoy this, but as a fan of the book i would have to say at best this film was average. There were so many flaws in this film and the directors/screenwriters changed too many bits in this film and the rushed through all the scenes in what i can only describe as an attempt to fit as much in as possible. I can understand that there is a time constraint and that they have to fit a whole book into just over 2 hours, but they should have chosen a scene or part of the film and emphasised that rather than rushing it. Here are some of the parts that they got completely wrong in the film; - Madge gives Katniss the Mockingjay pin, not Prim. - They only introduced Haymitch on the train and not at the reaping. - Katniss isn't visited by Peeta's Father. - Where at the opening ceremony, its Cinna that tells them to hold hands, in the film it is made to believe that Peeta comes up with the idea. - In the film, it only shows Glimmer killed by the tracker jackets, but in the book the girl from district 4 also dies. - When Katniss blows up all the supplies, in the film she only temporarily loses her hearing, whereas in the book she has lost in for the rest of the games. - In the book, in order to get Peeta his medicine she gives him a sleeping pill that haymitch sent in a parachute, but in the film she waits til he falls asleep and then sneaks off. - In the film, in never tells you how Katniss and Peeta think that the mutts resemble the dead tributes. - In the book, Cato is dying very slowly overnight before Katniss finally puts him out of his misery, whereas in the film she shoots her arrow straight away. - Also in the film, it shows once they are leaving the capitol to go back to district 12 that Peeta is fine, whereas in the book he loses his leg. <br/><br/>There are plenty more mistakes and i believe that they changed too much in this film to make it more appealing to people who haven't read the books."
"bobbybits","5","34","64","26 March 2012"," What a cop out
","This film is no Battle Royale or Lord of the Flies.<br/><br/>It is Hollywood who have really dumbed down the book taking away a lot of the critical elements in an attempt to sell it to to the masses. Effectively making a very mediocre 12A taking away from its cult status. This film lacks all the elements of horror and the fight for survival, also the struggles of the poor versus rich and the evil ruling elite from the book. Instead we see a lot of Hollywood stereotypes and tweenie wannabes. With their smiling faces and over dialogues and CGI special effects. Well I had real hope here because it had a great story, sadly it was a complete cop out and the on screen content was really lacking. Ultimately I am thankful though this film smashed the box office higher then Twilight, so at least this group of audience is starting to head on better themes. Although I am absolutely disappointed with this final product, it could have been a lot better instead of making it with such a puke factor. The smiling faces and massive dialogue and those oh wow special effects. In place of the horror and terror and gore, the evils of the ruling elite and the ultimate fight for survival. It should have been much better, staying in line with its cult status following alone the lines of Lord of the Flies or Battle Royale some of my all time favs.<br/><br/>5 out 10 a waste of time unless you know the tweenie bop"
"LSGPhoenix","4","23","41","23 March 2012"," Fire the director, and the DP
","The story, acting, and costuming were well done. It stops there. Despite the fact the movie will make hundreds of millions of dollars in the box office, the studio should fire the Director and the DP (director of photography). Nearly entirely shot ""hand-held"", and shaky at that, the film will give the strongest stomachs a run for their money. <br/><br/>I'll start by saying I've seen many films, I even make them, and i have a very sturdy stomach. But watching this movie set me off, giving me a full blown headache by minute 15, and making me nauseous by minute 30. I even had to get up and walk out for a few minutes to quell the vertigo. <br/><br/>FAR too many close ups, even more too many extreme close ups, and all with a shaky almost nervous hand. It got to the point where as a character was running all we see is quick, shaky, close up cuts of the feet, then head, then feet, then face, then feet... This does not create suspense! The story is suspenseful enough! What's more is nearly EVERY action shot is blurred by the terrible choice of camera movements so that the audience really doesn't see what's going on. What's more, simple shots of the characters doing mundane things are ALSO shot in this horrid manner. <br/><br/>Sadly I was not alone, as a dozen more people also left the theater to regain their equilibrium, some did not return. After the film many of us gathered in the lobby, all strangers, to openly complain about the films camera work. Several of those that left early demanded their money back. <br/><br/>I must also speak to the positives of the film. The acting was well done, particularly by the films lead, Jennifer Lawrence. She portrayed emotion and lack there of as it was called for. Completely believable as the character Katniss Everdeen. The pacing of the film lacked a bit in the beginning but picked up quickly. <br/><br/>My advice to future moviegoers: Sit in the top row. Distancing yourself from the screen may be the only method of effectively staving off the dizziness."
"caitlinsun","5","12","19","26 March 2012"," doesn't translate well to film
","I really liked the book, and because of that, I was able to enjoy seeing this movie in the theater. But this movie is way too rushed, and isn't able to stand very well on its own. In trying to please the fans by remaining faithful to the book's plot, they had to gut it of all character development. We only see a few brief moments of Katniss & Prim together before the lottery scene. There is no way to know the full extent of their relationship without reading the book. And because of that, the emotional impact of her friendship with Rue is lost as well. Likewise, there is next to nothing about Gale. The heart & soul of the book was in Katniss's thoughts, trying to overcome the emotional turmoil to survive in the arena, but all we really get in the movie is the arena...and only a summary at that."

","The book was awesome. The movie followed the book fairly well, but had to tame down the violence to keep it in the PG-13 rating. Acting was actually pretty good. I do wish they would have started the movie off with a quick overview of why they have the hunger games, but that can be easily forgiven.<br/><br/>What CANNOT be forgiven is the feeling of seasickness I had because of the horrible camera work. Every scene was shot from what seemed to be a camera set on top of a bucking bronco. This made it not only difficult to understand what was happening in the scenes, but actually made me dizzy and I left the theater feeling like I just stepped off of a roller coaster."

And, also, that Gary Ross dude should not be allowed to make any movies no more.<br/><br/>Cuz he kinda sucks. Dude can't help himself but to try and make every scene in the movie the most awesomely important moment in the history of the movies ever.<br/><br/>Basically he made the perfect movie to promote on the Jay Leno show. Because Jay Leno sorta blows in the same way that this movie does.<br/><br/>Did I mention it is too damn long? Oh I did? But it's still true so it's worth saying again. I heard that they got these people that work on movies that are supposed to edit them or whatever. Where was that guy on this movie? Did he go out for a bacon sandwich when he was supposed to be doing that? There's no way he was in that little room with a pair of scissors snipping up this movie because every scene went on forever.<br/><br/>Not that I care about it. It's not like I read these books and liked them. They are for teenagers so I didn't read them at all. Never read them straight through in like three nights. That's not my thing.<br/><br/>Oh. And one more thing...<br/><br/>Can people stop bringing little sick babies that cough and kids who are four years old to movies about teenagers who have to cut each other's heads off and stab each other and break each other's necks?<br/><br/>I only say this because I guess that message hadn't gone out before my showing of the movie."

I was not completely disappointed because the movie didn't not change anything major from the book except for one thing and that was the gore factor. The book had incredibly vivid and violent visualization which was not translated to this teenage pg-13 movie. <br/><br/>I feel like if someone who had never read the book were to watch the movie not enough would be explained for the viewer to follow the plot line or to have any cares or connection to the characters. After reading a few of the reviews from people who have not seen the movie I realize my suspicions are correct. The movie jumped from scene to scene so fast and with so little explanation you may as well be watching a series of trailers all pieced together or a montage of the book. <br/><br/>It was more disappointing than enjoyable and my favorite part about the movie was that Woody Harrelson was in it."

","Many have said this before, but I'm afraid I have to repeat the opinion on the account that a surprising many have decided that The Hunger Games is worth of anything more than 1 star in IMDb. The Hunger Games is a unscrupulous photocopy of the masterpiece BATTLE ROYALE, and should be avoided, if not boycotted.<br/><br/>Some will claim that The Hunger Games is a 'tribute' or a 'remake' of the BATTLE ROYALE. To them I ask one question: ""What kind of filmmakers make remakes of a movie when the original came out two years ago and has been selling DVDs very well internationally?"" It seems that this particular brand of Indian cinema has decided that it is quite content making money off of other people idea for free. And though it is impossible for the original filmmakers to sue the filmmakers of The Hunger Games (on the account that US copyright laws does not allow for such suit), The Hunger Games should be remembered as a true stain on the development of American Cinema.<br/><br/>Because it has photocopied a great movie, The Hunger Games avoids being an absolute terror of a movie. However, this does not excuse Gary Ross and the section of 'Bollywood' that has involved itself in The Hunger Games's production. Because of the blatant plagiarism, and the The Hunger Games's makers absolutely refusing to apologize and reimburse the original filmmakers, I must say The Hunger Games deserves 1 star, if not 0."

The love was completely underdeveloped as well as many of the characters (practically all of them). I found no depth to anyone even for Katniss which was shallow.

There is barely any aspects of the book in the movie. Why was no one hungry? They come from poverty rarely having a day that there hunger is satisfied. That was not evident in the movie, AT ALL. Katniss is supposed to be surprised at how easily food comes to the citizens of Panem and they are all supposed to devour there food. The mocking jay pin was supposed to be from Madge. At first I didn't see how it was relevant so I understood why they took it out. That was until I read the 2nd book again and realized that, the pin was given to Madge by her mother and given to her mother by her twin, maisley who died in Haymitches hunger games. Haymitch was not nearly as drunk as he should of been. There was no ""blood bath"". I'm sorry, not, but having a shaky camera, horrible angles and no real battle was waged. You saw nothing. It looked like they splattered paint on the screen. The movie is about kids killing each other for gods sake. It's supposed to be violent to convey the message the author wanted to portray. Katniss and peeta were a couple that was so unbelievable. They lacked chemistry. There relationship also lacked explanation. You should know why katniss acts the way she does, that she's doing it because she needs to keep up appearances and get sponsors. Plus, he's shorter then her. In the book he towers over her making her feel protected. The main leads were cast horribly. Katniss is supposed to be small, bony and with no curves. Jennifer Lawrence curvaceous and tall. Why was the cornucopia black? It's supposed to be gold. Why wasn't Cato wearing body armor in the last scene? That's what he was supposed to be getting! Rue's character was so under developed. When she died, I only cried because I knew the relationship she had with katniss because I read the book. In the movie, you didn't really get that katniss was reminded of her sister when she looked at rue. The scene where Peeta gives her the bread actually made me laugh, she's supposed to be 12 and since Lawrence is 21, it was laughable to say the least. One thing that I had wondered when I had heard that they were making the movie was how they were going to portray katniss's thoughts because most of the book is in her head. They could of done a voice over in silent scenes which they didn't. It was horrible because so much was missing. My mom was very confused about most parts because everything was so under developed. You would have had to read the books to understand what was going on. Lastly, I am going to see the 2nd one because the book series was fantastic and since there will be a new director, I have faith that the franchise can redeem itself from that horrible disappointment."
"jadearora","1","6","8","20 October 2012"," Bad Movie & Bad Books
","I was looking forward to seeing this movie after I read all three books, but when I saw it, I was very disappointed.<br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence does an okay job playing Katniss, Josh Hutcherson didn't really remind me of Peeta in the books, and Liam Hensworth as Gale? He really didn't cut it. Gale was described as looking like him, but not acting!! If you were looking at just Katniss, well first of all, I think she's much worse than Bella in Twilight. About one of the only good things is that she cares for her family (Reaping Scene). But she is confused, and I have no idea why she ever made it out of the first Hunger Games. She is also ridiculously cruel to Peeta. She can't seem to determine the difference between friend and boyfriend with Peeta and Gale until the third book.<br/><br/>I was on Team Peeta from the beginning, though. Gale and Katniss were not a very good couple in my opinion, so maybe I'm a little more biased about the movie, which did not portray anything like the book.<br/><br/>I would recommend renting or getting the DVD from a library, because right now it costs anywhere from $30 to $23 on DVD. Don't waste your money, because this is not a good movie.<br/><br/>At least it's realistic, though. Haymitch is always drunk; Katniss' family and her District is poor, and struggling because of poverty; dictatorship, need I explain more; and of course, love. At least Katniss loved her family, and Peeta.<br/><br/>Also, the ""shaky camera"" effect was totally un-called for, and not necessary. A lot of people do agree with me. Most scenes in the forest where Katniss looks afraid are very pointless and a waste of the movie. They shake the camera because there is nothing happening and the producers & directors probably think that will up the excitement. Fail, because it doesn't. Even adding music would be better."

","All in all a good excuse to watch again Battle Royale, the original and better version of this soulless clone, although its making came home for 1/20 of Hunger Games budget. Even poor Stanley Tucci, the only real actor (and what an actor he generally is) in this film, has a hard time standing out in this cliché imbued clone. Because this is not a sequel or a remake, it's a clone. Far from being terrible and telling as Battle Royale is (within the obvious limits of a film with imperfection and mistakes), Hunger Games turns an interesting politic-fi story into a twilight-like teen-oriented desperate quest for coolness, failing to deliver the real soul of the original idea.<br/><br/>Folks, I know despite sometimes stellar budgets, good movies are rare to come by, but you can always watch again some Kurosawa instead of hi- rating 142min commercials like this one just because ""it's still better than found footage lame horror crap, anyway"".<br/><br/>There are better options."

","I read all 3 books, now I wonder if the creator of this movie also did work around the whole thing, or just skinned through the pages?<br/><br/>The whole setup is messed up in the movie, so of course it will not let you feel much beside some confusion. It is very frustrating that I got worked up much more by how poor the transition from book to movie actually went, instead of being shocked by the hunger games visuals. <br/><br/>Without spoiling any plot line: The shown district is a very poor district. Their only export is coal, there is usually only enough food that people tend to gamble anything including their life just to get a chance for few bits of extra food. Hunting game is prohibited as well as most lines of work which are not in the mine. They are not allowed to leave the town unless the officials grant that permission. The mine ""gently"" covers parts of the town with coal dust, so why do the people living there have clean clothes virtually all the time? Where is the emotional landscape that leads to the point that there is even a need to change?<br/><br/>I know the author copied a lot from the Roman empire (bread and games) and Battle Royale, and at least the first book looked promising. If they continue to produce a second and third movie, it will be either adult only, or the very same sunny day, minor complains - so let's start something really dangerous just because well, eh what exact motivation do they actually believe to have?<br/><br/>I'm sorry for the actors, if you actually see how little help they had from the setup, you can certainly agree that some have even accomplished something. But they will utterly fail, if they try to convert book 3 (my least favorite, because here the author actually did not copy much, but instead choose to finish it herself and at least in my point of view, she didn't even know how some of her key characters actually think) There will be too much they have to fix to actually have a decent end to the series, not a totally senseless [***].<br/><br/>I strongly advice that the crew should not only read all 3 books (hopefully) again, but also that they at least try to get a feeling for the setting by for example watching similar works (the original Rollerball, Battle Royal) and actually learn something about the controversy motivations behind all leads. And then try again on the first part, especially because it is the best part of the trilogy.<br/><br/>And for the audience I would suggest to wait, until they have done their homework. Beside some fresh actors it has so little value that you would think of the motivation from the crew as: Girl needs a reason to fight ""beautifully"", so give her some and don't bother with authenticity or reasoning. It did work for Rambo as well, so why not try it again..."
"chris-j-stanton","4","6","8","9 April 2012"," Slow, tedious, predictable (and is the IMDb average rating rigged?)
","The main reason I'm writing this review is that I'm regular user of IMDb for assessing the quality of a movie before choosing to watch it. At the time of writing this review The Hunger Games had an average score of 7.7 from over 84,000 ""users"". I find this score of 7.7 hard to believe after watching the movie, and especially after reading other written IMDb user reviews which all seem to be negative (so is there a bot at work here or some other manipulation going on?). Generally in the past I've found the IMDb average rating a reliable indicator of the quality of a movie, but that is simply not the case for this movie. <br/><br/>I think I being generous in giving this movie a score of 4. This is a long tedious predictable bore of a movie. Sure, I'm 36 years old so perhaps I'm not the target demographic, but I am in no way a movie snob. I enjoy science fiction, but I came out of this movie feeling that this movie was a lost opportunity - it could of been so much better. I've never read the books, but after reading many of the user reviews here I plan to, as it sounds like the books treat this story with a lot more depth. Unfortunately I feel the movie is shallow, superficial and way too predictable."
"nrconza","4","21","37","24 March 2012"," Falls short
","I don't know what to say. You need to read the book to begin to understand what's going on, but reading the book will disappoint you, because then you realize how much was cut. I understand that they only have a certain amount of time to fit everything they want to, but this was like a really bad cliffs notes of the book. It all seemed so rushed. There was a severe lack of depth.<br/><br/>Let me start off with saying that the acting from the heavy hitters was great. Harrelson, Tucci, Banks, Sutherland. There just wasn't enough of it. I have to admit that I felt they nailed the chemistry between Katniss and Peeta (both actors were fantastic). Everything else just seemed too disjointed. <br/><br/>What annoyed me (just to name a few of the many things):<br/><br/>When Gale says that he has 40 entries for the reaping, unless you read the book, you wouldn't know why. <br/><br/>Prim isn't the one who gives Katniss the mockingjay pin. <br/><br/>The emotional connection between Katniss and Rue just isn't there for me. <br/><br/>Lenny Kravitz can't deliver a line without sounding stupid. Cinna seemed like he had more going of for him in the book. Jennifer Lawrence did an excellent job showing her connection with him, but you can only work with the clay you are given. Cinna/Kravitz didn't deliver. <br/><br/>Cinna's assistants did not have a presence. Much could have been done to use their personalities to reflect what was inherently wrong with the Capitol.<br/><br/>Katniss is supposed to be more confused than they portray her when she pulls out the nightlock berries. In the book, she actually uses them out of desperation, thinking that although it is a possibility that the Capitol might stop her, it is unlikely, and she is ready to die. In fact, she actually gets them in her mouth and almost swallows them. But in the movie, she tells Peeta to trust her, implying that she knows that the Capitol will not let them die. They never even reach her mouth. I don't think that this was an acting flaw, but rather a directing flaw.<br/><br/>The mutts at the end of the games are supposed to be more human like, with the feeling that they had the eyes of the dead tributes. Not just big dogs.<br/><br/>The last 5 minutes was a montage of useless clips. It was as if someone hit the FF button on the remote to 30XX.<br/><br/>Only 2 scenes from the entire movie moved me. When Katniss volunteered for Prim and when Rue's father started the uprising in District 11. I was struggling to connect with the rest. <br/><br/>Maybe 1st person stories can't be translated to 3rd person movies. If they can, this wasn't one of them. The whole appeal of the book was seeing things through Katniss's eyes.<br/><br/>Maybe I wasn't the target audience."

","I was actually very excited to watch this film and it was definitely not what I expected. The first half seemed to drag on so I waited anxiously for some action in the second which also followed with the same disappointment. Considering that this film was meant to be up there with the giants (Avatar etc), it doesn't even reluctantly meet that threshold!! It just lacked that 'wow' factor.. However, acting by the protagonist was absolutely brilliant, it was just the way to whole thing was put together. And those weird looking 'Vivienne Westwood-esqe' characters completely freaked me out. For me, this isn't one that will mark an era, it will be lost amongst movies like Stardust and The Chronicles of Narnia after the first one.. <br/><br/>What a waste of a Saturday evening!"
"geopartin","2","21","37","24 March 2012"," Reasons why The Hunger Games was an insult to the novel
","The Hunger Games is a novel written by Suzanne Collins where in the country of Panem every year one boy and one girl from each of the twelve districts is chosen to fight against each other until only one is left alive. The book has some dark themes (teenage violence, famine, and an oppressive government), but it also has a love story that creep up throughout the series. The characters are genuine, the tone serious, and the message powerful. Unfortunately the screenplay translated none of these to the big screen. This is how The Hunger Games completely missed the mark.<br/><br/>mocumentary style filming randomly.to make us feel like we are there..?<br/><br/>Katniss finds the Mockingjay pin at the trading area, completely eliminating the scene with Madge which would have showed the extreme wealth difference in the country. <br/><br/>Haymitch's drinking problem is non-existent<br/><br/>Little references to food and the lack there of, I thought it was supposed to be The Hunger Games..<br/><br/>The way Haymitch explains every detail about the games to Peeta and Katniss makes it seem like they have no idea what the games involve. <br/><br/>The flashbacks to Peeta giving Katniss bread looks like it could have been a week before the reaping<br/><br/>The male careers did not look like they had been training all their lives for a death tournament<br/><br/>Blurring out all the opening kills just to keep the pg-13 rating<br/><br/>Katniss finding water almost immediately, not bothering to purify it, made her look more lucky than intelligent<br/><br/>The careers found Katniss while SKIPPING and GIGGLING through the woods<br/><br/>Rue being the one to initiate the alliance with Katniss<br/><br/>Foxface<br/><br/>Katniss remained completely hidden next to the Cornucopia by one branch with barely any leaves<br/><br/>The Careers not seeing Katniss from twenty feet away after the food explosion<br/><br/>Peeta appeared to be acting in love and Katniss appeared to actually be in love (Reverse from the book)<br/><br/>Thresh's kill<br/><br/>Thresh getting killed by the dogs<br/><br/>The dogs<br/><br/>Peeta not getting hurt and losing his leg<br/><br/>Not revealing anything that the other tributes got in their special packs<br/><br/>When the announcement for one winner was made, both of them just standing there and immediately choosing the berries instead of the suspicion of one of them perhaps killing the other.<br/><br/>These are just a few of the things that I thought were complete misses on the big screen. Jennifer Lawrence did the best acting job she could with the screenplay she was given, but it was ruined by the poor acting of Josh Hutcherson completely failing to act the only was his character was written to act. In love. Katniss' character came off as a quiet unintelligent girl, who happened to know how to shoot a bow. Snow's additions helped strengthen his character and will definitely make him a formidable villain in the next movies. Overall though The Hunger Games missed the mark, obviously Katniss wasn't the one doing the shooting."

"the_reemster","3","21","37","23 March 2012"," A Big Slice of Swiss Cheese
","I want to firstly note that I am in No Way a wannabe movie buff who bashes movies to make me sound like I know a lot, in fact I love most movies and give them credit despite bad reviews.<br/><br/>I use the term ""Swiss Cheese"" to bring to light two things that were very apparent: The holes (plot and character), and the cheese (overly dramatic and cliché).<br/><br/>This review is directed to two audiences: 1. Those who watched the movie and thought it was good and; 2. Those who are thinking about watching the movie and don't care about a few spoilers in order to make a better decision whether to spend 15 bucks and three hours, or go out and ride a bike.<br/><br/>My review will contain only questions because that is all I was left with at the end of the movie. These questions contain spoilers.<br/><br/>1. I know ""shaky camera"" filming can sometimes be effective. But why does the director use it with extreme close-ups throughout the entire movie so that action sequences are blurred and confusing? When you see blood and hear someone dying, only after a couple minutes do you realize who it was when you finally see a body on the ground.<br/><br/>2. The ""Sponsors"" is an intriguing idea: impress certain people and they can send you useful items like medicine and weapons during the game. Who are the sponsors? Why is it so hard to get one? How much do they have to pay to send you an item? Are they individuals or corporations? Do they get recognition for sponsoring you? Why?<br/><br/>3. The whole ""teaming up"" kind of made sense for a little while: You have a better chance at winning if you team up and kill the other stragglers. But when do you turn on your partner? Why was everyone so friendly when the rules dictate only the last person standing can win? If I had to compete, I wouldn't just sleep so peacefully next to three other people who at any moment could try to kill me.<br/><br/>4. When Katniss teams up with the little girl who dies in her arms, why does she waste precious time looking for pretty white flowers to make a burial site for the girl while the others are trying to find and kill her? When the girl is dying, was it necessary for Katniss to start singing songs to her?<br/><br/>5. The training before the games was also very under developed. These kids can't just throw a couple spears and suddenly become killers. Why are there no trainers? Why don't they explain how they get better?<br/><br/>6. When Katniss goes in front of the judges to impress them, how does she miss so badly with her first arrow, then get a perfect bullseye, then shoot an impossible shot through the apple?<br/><br/>There are simply so many questions unanswered. I don't understand why it is so highly rated. Please. Someone Explain to me what I have missed."

Casual cinema lovers should watch something else.<br/><br/>The good: -Everything looks kinda pretty and colorful -The acting is very good -The special effects are OK -It has an interesting view on how future societies could be<br/><br/>The bad: It's retarded as hell -The premise of the movie is pretty dumb, and it would probably end in an uprising -You have cammo experts who don't wear cammo -People with bows that decide not to snipe anyone -Assassins that decide to give a 10 minute speech in the open -Stupid, forced plot twists, that twist back to normal -There is no true character development. Characters are remarkably untouched after being part of a horrible situation.<br/><br/>In other words, if you wanna see teenagers killing each other go watch Battle Royale.

There was no opportunity to explore this world with your own eyes...the director kept telling you exactly what you should be looking at...which was usually a close-up of someone talking. The movie had closeups of everything including the faces of horses followed by closeups of their feet trotting. Add a shaky camera and blurred out backgrounds and you have a movie made by an editor rather than a director that knows how to compose shots.<br/><br/>This world that this movie took place in looked fascinating, but each shot was only a few seconds long. There was no long shots so that I could study their clothes, hair, and how they moved. A very disappointing movie experience."
"chaz-28","5","17","29","26 March 2012"," Intriguing and creative material gets bogged down in underwritten script; however, Jennifer Lawrence shines
","I always wonder after seeing a movie where I have read the book beforehand, ""Would I have liked this better had I not read the book?"" Anybody who has read a book later turned into a film is naturally going to be biased concerning the story. They know how much deeper the material goes, the character back stories, and the scenes which did not make the final cut. They may still critique the filmmaking objectively, but not the story/plot.<br/><br/>I read The Hunger Games before seeing the movie. I know that in Panem, an all controlling fascist regime based out of the Capital controls 12 districts in an extremely oppresive manner. In District 12, the proletariat meagerly scrapes by through mining coal and make up for the rest of their harsh existence through scavenging and bartering. To atone for a previous rebellion, every year each District must send one male and female aged 12-18 to the Capital to fight each other to the death. These are the Hunger Games.<br/><br/>Katniss Eberwine (Jennifer Lawrence), at 16 years old, is her family's breadwinner. After her father was killed in a mining accident, her mother sunk into a sort of catatonic shock, so Katniss was forced to use her hunting and archery skills to eke out a minimal existence for her mother and her younger sister. It is technically illegal to hunt outside the District's wire perimeter, but Katniss is adept at evading the sensors and also has a partner in crime with her friend Gael (Liam Hemsworth).<br/><br/>On Hunger Games selection day, known as the Reaping, Katniss's small 12 year old sister, Primrose, is selected against all odds. In an act of selfless protection, Katniss jumps forward to volunteer in her place. Joining her on the stage as the male representative is Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson), the baker's son and somewhat of an acquaintance of Katniss. Also along for the ride is District 12's Capital representative Effie Trinket (Elizabeth Banks) and a drunken former Hunger Games winner, Haymitch (Woody Harrelson), who will serve as the mentor for Katniss and Peeta in the games.<br/><br/>This plot description sounds a bit thin but it is truly intriguing. The idea of 24 teenagers running around the woods spearing each other with swords, arrows, or even their bare hands has a particular voyeuristic element to it. Unfortunately, to make sure they wrenched all of the millions they could out of the audience, the filmmakers kept this at the PG-13 level. The violence and ensuing deaths just look silly at this sanitized level. Unlike the book, the dread is absent. Furthermore, the characters are stock and one-dimensional; yes, as opposed to the book.<br/><br/>In the novel, Peeta's motivations and back story concerning Katniss are finely woven into the story and given a lot of weight. However, in the film, you cannot guess if he is sincere or just trying to play the game. In the book, little Rue (Amandla Stenberg) is a very young and tiny waif from the agricultural district whose impact is deeply felt by the reader. In the movie, Rue fills her requisite squares, but fails to make anywhere near the same impact. I am not sure quite where to put my finger on it, but there is something really missing from this movie.<br/><br/>No character gets their due. What I mean is, the plot is faithfully followed, but there is no oomph, no driving force. Katniss comes the closest, but that is just because she is in almost every scene. Jennifer Lawrence has done a very good job here bringing Katniss to life and making her appear scared for her life, which she truly is. Just before her platform rises to begin the Hunger Games, she visibly shakes with fear. Lawrence was even better in Winter's Bone where she really turned in a mesmerizing performance. The biggest disappointments are Panem's dictator and Peeta. These two characters could have added so much depth to what is actually a very light and breezy Hunger Games. If you are familiar with this story, light and breezy should be the last two adjectives which come to mind.<br/><br/>A film should be judged on its own irrespective of whether or not you have read its original material. In that respect, The Hunger Games is a very creative story which is underserved by its meek script and borderline boring filmmaking. Material of this caliber (and budget) deserves so much more."

What happened to him? I wanted to see the moment when he broke, and realized he can not win. I wanted to see the moment which turned him.<br/><br/>2. Why did Katniss cried so much when Rua died? Seeing the movie this part wasn't that clear to me.<br/><br/>3. Although I know that Katniss is the main character I expected to see the others trying to survive in the Arena.<br/><br/>4. Why didn't the movie show what the audience's reaction were to the fights, and basically to everything that happened in there? I thought I could see how they were rooting for the tributes.<br/><br/>5. What about the sponsors? Have there been any? Because I haven't seen them. They emphasized in the beginning how important it was to get them. Only Katniss received sponsor gift parachutes? Nobody else? 6. Who is this Gale guy? Is it Katniss' boyfriend? Or a friend? Although I know the answer thanks to some of the book spoilers, in the movie it isn't clear. And I also don't know what's up with Peeta. Do they even know each other? Or what? I missed a little background story here.<br/><br/>So these are only a few things that really annoyed me during the movie. Maybe I just went to the theater with too high expectations. But it's because The Hunger Games was soooo hyped! People said it was going to be awesome. Maybe even the best movie this year. But it wasn't. So I'm disappointed. But I must admit even though this movie sucks the books must be really good."

","Took my girlfriend to see this movie, although neither of us has heard of the book or the film before. I saw a lot of merchandise in shops, and searched up the trailer, so I knew the main character is a tough and pretty girl and there is probably romance too. Sounds like the sort of thing she'd enjoy.<br/><br/>I thought this was a mostly boring movie and I just didn't understand a lot of the stuff having not read the book. What are they doing?! Why are they doing any of this?! Why does any of this matter?! It feels like a very cheap American imitation of ""Battle Royale"" made for cash.<br/><br/>However, my girlfriend liked it. She identified with the main character, laughed at the funny moments, jumped at the scary moments, and thought they did a good job with the costumes. She felt this was much better than BR and similar movies, because there is much less graphical violence, and a smaller caste of characters so they were characterized better.<br/><br/>So, is this a gender thing? Maybe I'm just not their target audience... ..."

","A few years ago I saw this in the theater with my brother, who thought it had promise because of its popularity. By the end we felt sick, and like we had narrowly escaped an involuntary lobotomy. The story steals the premise of ""Running Man"" and is told even less plausibly. At least 'Running man' tried not to take itself seriously!<br/><br/>The 'hero' Katness is set in an implausibly tyrannical world (all mankind would have to be made up of cowards for a situation like theirs to arise) and winds up a participant in a stupid contrived gladiatorial/survival Arena with Pita: a spineless effeminate eunuch that I'm told the writer tried to portray as her idea of the 'perfect guy'. God help us all if that's what women look for today, because I didn't see a real male protagonist the entire movie.<br/><br/>There at the games, Katness winds up spending the whole story doing what gets her popularity, feels good, and gives her a lead on her competition as she compromises every principle she has (Kinda like those A-crowd losers you knew in high school). Basically, the woman becomes a social prostitute for the spectators in a selfish urge to survive. In fact its the level of selfishness and self-deception that boggled my mind. Even the 'oh so selfless' act of going to the games in place of her little sister is done out of guilt, not love.<br/><br/>People tell me how 'its not like that in the book', and how 'you never see her struggling to decide', but the road to hell is paved with intentions like hers, and everyone I met ultimately admitted that she still makes all the same selfish decisions as the movie portrays.<br/><br/>For those who cannot see what I'm getting at, there will forever be a divide. They, like her, live by the jingle the hunger games has: ""May the odds be ever in your favor"", and will forever be at odds with Men like me who say ""Never tell me the odds!"""

","A big-budget Battle Royale remake film had all the chances of becoming a spectacular film that would be faithful to the original books written by Kousen Takami. Instead, what we get is mostly just the first third of the book expanded into an emoes-at-hogwarts film that is not entirely bad in its presentation inna TV-movie sort of way, but not what I would go to see this in the theaters for. The last tow thirds of Battle Royale's elements and characters are entirely left out, possibly for a sequel film but who knows, leaving us with a dumbed-down adaptation designed mostly to get people in the theater seats to watch it. The 2000 Toei version was much better at handling the entire story, compressed as it was for the amount of screen time the studio could afford to show it in. Let's hope and pray that this film succeeds at least enough to warrant a sequel where the rest of the Battle Royale saga gets properly introduced and we get to see stuff going down as in the original books."

There is a whole supporting cast of great character actors like Donald Sutherland and Stanley Tucci but unfortunately they are underused IMO.<br/><br/>I know I have to write 10 lines of text for a review, but IMO this movie wasn't interesting enough to warrant words beyond WARNING: Children being killed."
"vip-danii","1","7","10","20 April 2013"," No, It Wasn't *THAT* Good!
","So why is this movie so incredibly popular? Is it *that* good? <br/><br/>No, actually. Not at all.<br/><br/>First of all, this stuff is neither new, nor original. ""The Running Man"" has a similar concept, but it's actually more believable. ""Battle Royale"" is basically exactly the same movie, but it's also more realistic. This is some twisted interpretation of ""Big Brother"".<br/><br/>No, it wasn't *awful*, but, for such an over-hyped movie, with such a huge budget, and such a high rating... I did expect more.<br/><br/>Maybe you have to have read the book (which the movie is based on) to understand it properly, but, since I haven't, I didn't quite get the whole idea behind ""Hunger Games"". It is implied that the purpose of the show is to keep the slums (districts) intimidated, and to prevent rebellion. How does that work, exactly? If you think of it logically, having ""Hunger Games"" INCREASES the chances of rebellion e.g. families prepare their kids from a young age for the possibility that they might be chosen to enter the game at some point, so a large % of the districts' inhabitants are supposed to be good warriors, with solid survival skills, well prepared to kill and hunt. Not to mention the hatred they all seem to feel towards the organizers of the game. Does this not INCREASE the chances of rebellion instead of decreasing them??<br/><br/>And why couldn't these kids just refuse to ""play""? The spectators expect to see people kill each other, so what would happen if the kids just stuck together and didn't give those viewers what they wanted? They'd be forced to stop ""Hunger Games"" altogether if, season after season, people refused to ""play"".<br/><br/>And... erm, I didn't quite get the ""hunger"" reference anyway. There was no evidence of the supposed scarcity of food, and the characters didn't really seem like they were starving. And what exactly is the connection between ""hunger"" and children killing each other? <br/><br/>The ""future"" society looks like the 19th century, and they, most certainly, don't give out the impression of being capable to produce ""genetically engineered killer bees"", or medicine that can heal a deep wound in less than 8 hours. It was totally unrealistic. The so-called future looked more like the past. It was extremely primitive, actually. Didn't make any sense.<br/><br/>How is it possible to generate images of animals/trees on a computer screen and then instantly transfer them to a physical location as actual living objects (wild animals, burning trees). It would only be possible if the battleground was a simulated environment, which, as far as I'm aware, it wasn't in this case.<br/><br/>Character development was really, really sub-par. We know NOTHING about the lead male. No background on him whatsoever. Same goes for the antagonist. Not to mention the rest of the ""players"" -- we hardly see any of them, except for Rue (briefly), who, as a matter of fact, serves no purpose whatsoever, and adds nothing to the story. Elisabeth Banks is s***, as usual.<br/><br/>I didn't see the point in Liam Hemsworth's character? What purpose did he serve? <br/><br/>Why did the lead male side with the bad guys? Is isn't explained. And why did they actually accept him into their group -- knowing that he is romantically interested in the girl they're hunting down? <br/><br/>And why DID the ""bad guys"" form a group to begin with -- knowing that there can only be one survivor anyway? O.K., so there are 4 of them in this group, and they are hunting down the lead female. What happens after they kill her? They will still have to kill each other, so... what is the point forming a group to begin with? <br/><br/>The MOST unrealistic scene in the movie, was the one where the lead female climbs a tree and the bad guys decide to camp beneath her. They could've EASILY shot an arrow at her or set the tree on fire, but they decide to wait for her to come down. O.K., but, in that case, since there are 4 of them, they should've taken turns to watch her, but, instead, they all go to sleep (and wake up) at the same time. How dumb can they be? <br/><br/>And that love story between the lead characters was so incredibly lame... I do not want to see anymore of Twilight. That franchise is really getting on my last nerve, and it doesn't help that a lot of movies copy elements from it nowadays. Very disturbing!<br/><br/>Anyway...<br/><br/>The movie is watchable, but there are a few too many plot holes for my liking, which is really distracting and unsatisfying. I was waiting for some of the answer to be revealed throughout the movie, but... nothing.<br/><br/>It's just an extremely poorly pieced together story that, at times, is more frustrating than entertaining.<br/><br/>1 star to bring down the overall rating, which is currently much higher than the movie deserves. Otherwise would've rater 5-6."
"LilyDaleLady","1","7","10","25 March 2013"," Disappointing movie version of the book
","Even knowing quite a bit about the heavily hyped film before I saw it (on DVD), I was still very disappointed. This is a poorly made film, very lackluster and the only reason to rave over it is sheer ""fanboy-ism"" -- you just love the books so much, or the heroine Katniss, or the strikingly pretty actress Jennifer Lawrence, that you cannot view the film objectively.<br/><br/>It is boring, it is disjointed. If you go in to it, not knowing the story beforehand or having read the book (or trilogy of books), it would make little sense -- just a lot of carnage without much rational explanation.<br/><br/>Yes, the books were influenced by the Japanese ""Battle Royale"" and yes, some films like ""Running Man"" and others. That did not bother me. The first book of the trilogy is strongly written, with moving prose and a very appealing female heroine; it was nice to read a book for young adults (and it IS a book for teens, not adults) that is not all about ""who the female protagonist loves?"" and ""who will she choose?"" and/or the bitchiness of her teen female rivals.<br/><br/>Susanne Collins treated Katniss like a real heroine, whose journey was important than her romantic life, ergo this was a MUCH better book than ""Twilight"", with its weak, clumsy Bella Swan who just falls into romance with her sparkly vampire lover. I loved Katniss in the book, and wanted to read about her journey.<br/><br/>So that brings me to the biggest flaw of the film version: Jennifer Lawrence, gorgeous and sexy, is 100% wrong for this role. Darkening her hair and making it messy will not turn this stone fox into anything but what she is -- a super beautiful 21 year old woman. Katniss, on the other hand, is STARVING -- I repeat, STARVING -- skinny, underweight 16 year old, who the books say ""looks about 12"" due to malnutrition, who has short boyish hair and dark skin (it is implied she is of mixed race).<br/><br/>Lawrence was clearly picked because of her stunning debut in ""Winter's Bone"", and hey! that was set in the rural Ozarks, with her as a uneducated mountain girl. But the resemblance ends there; Ree Dolly was nothing like Katniss, except ""rural"".<br/><br/>Myself, I was rooting for Hailie Steinberg (""True Grit"") who was the right age and physical type for this part. But I am sure many young actresses might have done a good job. Lawrence, with her voluptuous body and sturdy frame, does not remotely convince us she's ever missed a snack, let alone a balanced 3 course meal, in her life.<br/><br/>Everyone else in the film is similar good looking, evoking a TV show with teen stars rather than Dorothy Lange photos of Depression-era Appalachia (which the book DOES evoke). These big strapping movie-star gorgeous actors don't look hungry; they don't even have a smear of dirt on their faces. None of them, including Lawrence, ever look remotely scared or worried, hungry or thirsty, angry or sad. It's like watching a cast of good looking robots beat each other up.<br/><br/>The violence, which in the book is quite upsetting, is blurred and subdued -- OK if your kids want to watch this, worthless as dramatic narrative. There is no sense of loss when anyone dies, not even cute tiny little Rue.<br/><br/>The movie costume crew had some fun dressing the citizens of The Capitol in over-the-top costumes -- kind of mash-up of ""The Fifth Element"" and the Court of the Sun King -- but the Lady Gaga-like results just look silly and not menacing. Much more effective if they looks banal, like our TV talk show hosts and politicians are nowadays. Blue wigs and hot pink makeup make them look like ineffectual clowns.<br/><br/>Of the 3 novels, this first one is by far the most affecting, serious and well-written; the sequels are quite weak. Lacking the big action set pieces and the fact that the heroine sleeps through most of them, I can't imagine where this is going. Jennifer Lawrence, though: she is going to be a BIG big star, that's already written in the cement.<br/><br/>In short: not recommended, especially for adults who will be bored."
"austin-takahashi","7","7","10","5 April 2012"," The Hunger Games - 3.5 Stars
","As the early minutes of the movie unfolded, it seemed to me that its principal premise was assembled by prominent ideas that came before it. When the story reveals to us that young men and women would have to slaughter each other for survival's sake, we cannot help but be reminded of the infamous Japanese cult classic, ""Battle Royale"". And later, when we learn that the bloodshed is to be controlled and televised by a game master, ""The Truman Show"" comes to mind. We can sit here and try to draw parallels between these different worlds, but no. Any discussions regarding the film's possible influences would end in useless futility. ""The Hunger Games"" is independent in its desires and ambitions. It has a life of its own.<br/><br/>This adaptation of Suzanne Collins's bestseller takes us to a dystopian future where the North America of today has become, in a word, kaput. Wars have destroyed democracy, and out of their wreckages the nation of Panem comes into being. The poor and powerless are distributed in the destitute 12 Districts while all the douchebags and oddballs can be found in the thriving, dominating Capitol. I like how the movie ignores the common vision of how people in the future dress in bland costumes. The citizens of Capitol have fascinating taste; their daily lives are spent with hairstyles and clothing that would startle cosplay addicts. The fashion trend there is so perplexing that if Lady Ga Ga lived during that era, she would easily blend in."

Adaptations are tough, but there were so many better ways to go about making Hunger Games a film. They paced the movie well. The visuals were solid, especially in Capitol. I don't know what else what was positive about the film. I didn't feel any of the tension between tributes that I felt in the book. Everyone seemed pretty well fed from start to finish. No lack of water. No feeling of fear of getting killed, you don't even see the deaths. And no backstory whatsoever. The backstory is the best part, and the best they can do is a predictably evil president. That being said, it's not the worse movie ever, but I'm in disbelief that it's still at a 7.8 here, and 85% fresh or RT. 4/10?"
"Pottsy0","4","7","10","30 March 2012"," Story too unrealistic
","The entire premise of the story is irrational. These ""games"" were created to punish the citizens of this society, yet they are honored and glorified as some form of entertainment. Are they a punishment or a form of entertainment? They can't be both, yet they are portrayed as both.<br/><br/>I can look past the fact that the premise doesn't make any sense, it's a fiction movie after all. But what I can't look past are the non sequitur scenes and plot connections: *The guy says you need to make sponsors ""like you"" in order for them to sponsor you. But the incentive for sponsors to sponsor is because they think a contestant will be ""entertaining"". Whether they like them has nothing to do with it. Being amiable is not the only way to get sponsors.<br/><br/>*When she's in the tree and the kids are waiting for Prin to come down. The girl shoots one arrow at Prin, BARELY misses. Then the guy shoots one, BARELY misses also. For some reason they then decide to just wait for her to come down? Why not just keep shooting arrows until you hit her.<br/><br/>*The kids actually go to sleep waiting for Prin to come down from the tree. They don't even have one kid on watch to make sure she doesn't try to escape or kill them. A 12 year old wouldn't be as naive.<br/><br/>*ALSO regarding the tree scene. Why does Prin chop off a wasp nest? Just climb down silently and slit their throats in their sleep? Why did this not even occur to her? It doesn't make sense...<br/><br/>*I would have found it much more plausible if maybe one of the kids in the alliance of ""bad"" kids betrayed the rest. There can only be ONE winner after all. The kids know this but they don't act like it. What in the world were they thinking forming an alliance and not betraying each other while in their sleep or something.<br/><br/>*There's too much running and avoiding other contestants for it to be realistic. When I say realistic I mean, how these kids would ACTUALLY act if these ""games"" actually did exist. There would be much more head on attacking, betraying, etc. For example, when they go blow up the bad alliance of kids' supplies, Prinn doesn't just simply shoot the one kid remaining on watch. Instead they draw him away, only to blow up the pile when he's not there. It's survival of the fittest, kill him with your bow Prinn. He was sitting still in a chair just relaxing, and instead you thought it best to draw him into the woods so you could shoot the pile of supplies? *The scene were they have the supplies for the remaining contestants which contain ""what they desperately need"". The kids are running to the packs, and only taking the pack with their district number on it. WHY, WHY, would you not take the other packs as well? Does Prin WANT the other kids to get their packs...? In addition to that, WHY did Prinn not take refuge by the trees and pick off kids trying to get their packs.<br/><br/>*Okay, back to the entire view of the games being ""entertaining"", and winning them to be an honorable feat. I refuse to believe that the citizens in the wealthier districts, who view the games as entertainment are so blind and ignorant. I don't like how they associate the ""wealthy"" (IE people in the lower districts) with the ignorant view of these games as entertainment. It just wouldn't be the case. There would be tons of people opposing the games, from all districts. They definitely would not be viewing them as a form of entertainment, that's for sure. And the way the celebritized the contestants. Is it a privilege to be a contestant or is a very unfortunate circumstance to be in? Whichever it is, the movie seems to flip back and forth. With Prin for some reason playing along when it is being portrayed as a privilege.<br/><br/>*So much of it just doesn't make sense. In reality it would be much more gruesome and the kids would not act like ignorant idiots. Prinn should have just hidden in the trees with her bow, and picked off kids at a distance. Not only does she NOT do this, she never picks off a kid with her bow, EVER! She only retaliates when she is being attacked.<br/><br/>*Another problem. The scene where Prin uses her arrow to make the mines go off, blowing up the other group of kids' stock of supplies. WHY in the world, would they set up mines, so that when they get activated, the mines BLOW up the supplies. The mines were planted to PROTECT the supplies from being stolen and make sure others cannot get to it. WHY wouldn't the kids just place the mines further back...<br/><br/>*In regards to all of the interviews: before the game, after the games are over, when they are presented at the capital for the first time: WHY are the contestants going along with this? It doesn't make sense. They should be refusing to do anything to do with the games, EXCEPT for what they are FORCED to do (IE Participate in the actual games). For example, I would have found it much more plausible if the kids were drugged unconscious, then woke up in the jungle and had to fight to survive.<br/><br/>I understand its a fiction story, but the events that take place throughout the movie wouldn't be likely to occur if the premise was actually true. The premise being that as a form of punishment, each district must offer up two kids in a fight to the death, etc."

Afterwards, when the games take place, there are some good actions scenes, but it is very predictable.<br/><br/>Finally, the end is not an end, and probably we'll have the second part soon, another sign that Hollywood is running out of ideas.

"dwightpsc","5","7","10","28 March 2012"," Movie falls far short of the book
","The movie falls far short of the book. It was good but not great. As with most first person narratives, the bulk of the story is told in the hero's head. Portraying the mood and the motivation of the hero on the screen without this internal dialogue is nearly impossible.<br/><br/>Katniss live a life without hope, she is defined by hunger and fear. Almost no one in district 12 is well fed and their lives are spent scrounging for food, staving off starvation one day at a time. Katniss is worse off than most because she has no father and her mother is a shell, destroyed by the death of her husband. It falls thus to Katniss to be provider for the family as well as surrogate mother to Prim. This is why Katniss hunts, the meager scraps she bring home helps keep the three of them alive.<br/><br/>Katniss' fear exists on many levels and is perhaps more pervasive than her hunger. She fears dying in the games of course and this fear increases each year that she is not chosen tribute as the odds increase each year that you will be chosen. She is doubly terrified this year because now Prim must join the lottery. Perhaps most of all she fears that if she is gone Prim and her mother will starve.<br/><br/>When Katniss volunteers as tribute she has no hope that she can win. In her own mind she is volunteering for her own execution. However, she cannot bear to lose Prim and this will exempt Prim from being chosen now and in the future. Her sacrifice is a truly epic moment that makes the story. Viewers completely miss the significance.<br/><br/>Read the Book!"

","I went to see this movie with a set of my friends on a little trip on the day it came out. I'm a person who, probably like the rest, read the book before I went to see the movie. I had read the book before I even knew there was a movie, and either because I was with my friends or I read the book, I found it to be a simply 'O.K.' title.<br/><br/>--BRIEF SUMMARY AND THOUGHTS-- Good parts; Actors of Katniss, Gale, and almost everyone except Peeta.<br/><br/>Bad parts; Shaky camera, creepy unrealistic scenes and reactions, bland ending, and a possible slap in the face to fans of the book. ---------End briefness------------------------------------------------- The issues, to begin with, are that some of the major details from the book are absent, which may be an issue for people who read the book.<br/><br/>Some of the scenes in the movie are just..unrealistic.!Spoiler! During a scene where the main character, Katniss, and Peeta are lying down in the cave, Peeta then goes on to say probably one of the creepiest, most ridiculous lines I've ever heard. ""I watched you walk home, every day."" Other then being freaked out by this new update about Peeta's mind, she finds it all right and simply decides to lie down on his chest.<br/><br/>Another scene, where Katniss ends up on the ground with a woman atop of her(Who's name still escapes me), is equally ridiculous. The woman is then picked up by another minor character and quickly pushed up against a wall twice. By simply being pushed up against a wall, the woman's neck miraculously snaps.!Spoiler End! Probably the biggest issue for me was the shaky camera constantly used to block and interrupt fighting scenes. !Minor spoiler! During the initial 'blood bath' of the movie where the fighting is probably at it's best, like someone had just decided to start filming the scene during the middle of an earthquake. For me, it constantly blocked out the action and was a simple agitation that came into the movie whenever any real action was taking place.<br/><br/>!BEGIN GOOD PARTS ABOUT THE MOVIE! The movies strong suit was much more in the beginning then anything else for me. Katniss and Gale are believable characters, played out very well and give you an idea of the pain they go through in a more realistic manner. Prim is also a wonderful, make you feel sad character. The only character I would have an issue is, is with Peeta. I find him as the forced love interest you have little to no interest in.<br/><br/>The action, if you can get past the constantly shaking camera man, is nice and entertaining.<br/><br/>To me, a reader and fan of the books, I found it to be a good movie, but not a good adaptation of the book. But, that's just me.<br/><br/>--End Review--"

","Saw The Hunger Games at 12:01 opening day and I had never been so disappointed and mad about a movie in my life. Saw it again on Saturday cause I didn't believe it could be so bad. I absolutely loved the book, amazingly written Suzanne Collins, don't want that to be confused. The movie has completely missed. The book was amazing in detail, I know a movie can not have the detail a book can do to time restraint and narration differences, but the most minor of details were thrown out in this movie. And all the people who are saying it depicts the book exactly, please re read the book, you're missing out badly. On the positive side, the movie gave a great depiction of scenery and character faces. Just fill it in to the imagination and you have an amazing movie. I cant wait to finish the last book but I really hope that the producers and writers can improve the next movie. Suzanne Collins deserves to have that in the movie.

","Okay, firstly I must say that I was recommended the book by a friend of mine; I had some good expectations since the plot seemed really interesting. Many people may find the book amazing, but I only found it really disappointing. I didn't like the way it was written and really, the author could make so much more from this plot. Anyway, so I didn't really have high expectations for the film when it came out. Parts of the film bored me and things just seemed to be rushed. I must say that it will be really hard to understand the film if you haven't read the book. Like, Katniss is crying when Rude dies, okay? She wasn't someone important right? You don't need to go crazy like that. The people that haven't read the book don't understand that Rue is important to Katniss because she reminds her of her sister. Things like that is really hard to understand for those people!! Come on director, you could've done so much better! Anyway, it is just the way the film was made â€“ don't misunderstand me, I think the actors had done great! All in all, it was good enough to watch just to kill some time"

There are many things in this movie without reason.. I just don't want to tell the plot.. but in my opinion even John Carter had more sense.. I mean because the introduction into the story was poor i was waiting for more info from the movie.

Hunger takes an interesting idea and it isn't long after the whistle sounds, with multiple kids getting killed right out of the starting block, they start banding together in an extremely inexplicable plot point - since all have to die but one - so why are they all buddy-buddying up to the bully of them all? WHY didn't the screenwriters have a bit of originality and having the weakest of those take out the big favorite and thereby create a great twist to the plot? Where was the fear of them losing their own lives around that small group banned together trying to take out Katniss? Just bad. And how do they keep changing the rules nearing the end, when the rules presumably had been the same, as they were instructed in the beginning -- for the past 74-freaken years! They grouped up together reminiscent to the 'Lord of the Flys'. This is an extremely ho-hum plot that will appeal to the high school kids who now will be caught up in the euphoria and the frenzy to see it twice, also picking up those more challenged, out-of-the-loop nerds and emo's from school who didn't go this weekend. I give it 4 out of the kindness of my heart and am so glad I saw it for free!"

","To start off let me just say that I really wanted to give this movie a great review. I haven't read the book because I wanted to see the movie first and not be tainted by the book.<br/><br/>With that said... The acting was great. I loved all the roles played and they were all very believable which is the main reason why I am giving it a higher rating than what I really think it should get.<br/><br/>The camera work was Awful...not just a little artist whatever, but I was actually getting a very bad headache and motion sickness. Serveral times I had to look away from the screen to get a grip. This is not what I came to the movie for.<br/><br/>The other big thing that I have a problem with: Very little character development. The beginning was not detailed enough.

","I confess that until this week, I was unaware of the anticipation over the release of this film. I had some time available and didn't want to things I should have been doing, so I saw it. After some research on it, I understood what the plot was about. I confess it sounded interesting. What I didn't understand until the movie laid it out, was the whole televised spectacle that was driving it. As soon as that was put forth, I thought ""oh, The Running Man from the 80's"". As it turns out it's a lot more boring. The plot often contradicts itself, the action is mostly filmed in shakeycam and the hackneyed concept of the 'good hero' not able to kill just sours it for me.

"andre-bed","4","25","47","26 March 2012"," An attempt to make an American Version of ""Battle Royale""
","This is almost a spin off from another movie. American audience is not familiar to ""Battle Royale"", a Japanese movie ( and ""manga"" 1999) made in 2000. What is this ""Hunger Games""? It's a movie that picked up characters, story, main sequence of events and all the atmosphere from this Japanese movie. The oriental production is far better than this American Version. Anyone who watches the original movie will agree to that. That said, It is important to remark that, in the end, the result of ""Hunger Games"" was not so bad. But it was not good either.. American Motion Industry has been ""copying"" movies for some time ( terror movies, for example ) and many of them are a terrible facsimiles from the original. This time the copy was not so bad. They changed a bit the story ( although the main plot is still there ) and adapted it to the American audience. The result is a teens movie that is possible to watch. Unfortunately, a lot of the emotion and originality from ""Battle Royale"" was lost. I was in a bit of doubt between ranking it 5 or 6. I decided for 5, because I would say this movie is ""as half as good"" as ""Battle Royale"". Not bad, not good. Interesting for teenagers and kids."
"shinyaustralia","4","25","47","26 March 2012"," Don't waste your time - just read the books
","I would have given this a 1 is Jennifer Lawrence hadn't managed to do such an amazing job with such horrible material.<br/><br/>I love the books. They are everything that Twilight isn't: well-written, emotionally deep, and able to withstand the test of time, which only makes me like them more. I cried, more than once, while reading them (also more than once).<br/><br/>That said, I have no idea how anyone who has read the books could possibly have enjoyed this film. There was no connection between the story taking place on screen and the audience. Shaky cam did NOT help.<br/><br/>I feel as though the director/screenwriter (even more shocking, because Suzanne Collins was apparently involved with writing the screenplay) had no concept of what the books were really about. There was zero sense of urgency about anything. Snow needed to be way creepier than he was. And there was no explanation of the salute, or the treachery and danger that Katniss faced in the Capitol and the ways that she had to lie to everyone around her to save her life and the lives of her friends and family. There was definitely no explanation or even allusion to the fact that her romance with Peeta is mostly acting. We don't see her irritation with him because of his lack of survival skills -- i.e., the noise he makes as he is walking through the Arena.<br/><br/>None of the tributes seemed hungry or angry enough to be in the positions that they were in. They barely developed Rue as a character, much less her relationship with Katniss, so when she dies, it's kind of sad that a little kid gets a spear through her chest, but you don't get the sense that this is kind of the last straw for Katniss. None of her actions come across as ""rebellious"" so there's no sense of imminent danger just from the choices she makes; the only danger comes from the other tributes. This is an important distinction because of what happens in the next books. Just from the events in the movie, I can't see why anyone would pick her to be the face of the rebellion. She doesn't seem to incite anyone to do anything.<br/><br/>None of this is Jennifer Lawrence's fault. I had reservations when they cast her, but I think she did a heck of a job with not much to go on. I think if the writing had been better, she could have made this a phenomenal movie. I also think that Josh Hutcherson did an excellent job as Peeta, although again, he didn't have a lot to work with. Liam Hemsworth as Gale didn't give me the sense of barely controlled rage and harsh practicality that his character displayed in the books, but he was OK as a placeholder I guess. Maybe he'll do better in the next 2? Elizabeth Banks, Lenny Kravitz and Stanley Tucci were awesome, not that I didn't expect that.<br/><br/>Here's hoping that they don't screw up when casting Finnick.<br/><br/>Also, I didn't think it was possible to mess up the flashback scene where Peeta burns the bread for Katniss, but they did. Oh they did."

","I do not mean to disrespect any of those who have already posted that the Hunger Games was a good movie put I have to state my opinion because it has been bothering me. That movie was sick and disgusting. I walked out of it because it made me feel horrible. Parents please pay attention to what your kids are watching and reading. Yes, I know it is just a movie, but the fake blood that was spurting out of a kid who was just hacked to death gleefully by another kid! The concept is sick and it is being served towards teens in an entertainment format. It is all sorts of wrong. For those who would say that I am immature or that ""bad things happen"". I know bad things happen, and if the author wanted to make people realize this and pay attention to the world or whatever their purpose was, then you put it in a mature format for mature audiences in a non entertainment venue. I do not mean to belittle the intelligence of teens, or their ability to handle mature ideas, but there is a way to go about it. A piece of fiction, meant for entertainment and as a love story is not that way. Movies and books teach things and affect all of us, whether we think that or not. I am sorry but I had to say something, somewhere."
"nmbarreda","7","24","45","23 March 2012"," NOT a good adaptation of the book - I am speechless.
","I saw the movie yesterday night and truly, now, the more reviews I read, the more sad and disappointed I feel. I had really HIGH expectations for the movie, given that I loved the books. Overall, if you haven't read the books, I guess it's an okay movie... entertaining enough to kill time. But given the fact that I did read the books and loved them, I don't know what to say. I feel like they left out so many small details that seemed so important and significant to me it's outstanding the shock I felt seating inside the cinema, watching the movie I had been waiting months to come out.<br/><br/>Number 1: The red-haired avox girl... I can't believe they left that out. The time inside the arena - it all went so much faster than in the book, like the cave scene... that was supposed to last days! The fact that they didn't work AT ALL with the starving and thirst that Katniss felt in district 12 and once again inside the arena. The medicine for Peeta! It was supposed to be an injection! A life-saving injection! Not a share-with-my-forehead-cut cream! The mutts - nowhere close to what the author described in the books. The last fighting scene - if I remember well, wasn't it during the day and didn't Cato have an armor and didn't the cornucopia burn with the sun!? And the injury in Peeta's leg - what he had in the movie was so freaking small and unreal to what the books said I wanted to kill myself right there. When I saw that, I said to myself: he's most definitely not losing his leg. And guess what? HE DIDN'T.<br/><br/>Number 2: The filming itself was awful! The camera shook so much it was hard to keep up with what was going on at some time. And the music... there were scenes where, to me, the music was so important and still, there was just empty silence. The only part that had a decent score what the mutt-fight, but after that, nothing else.<br/><br/>Number 3: I though the acting was great, especially Elizabeth Banks on Effie, but the portrayal of the characters was once again shallow and gave no insight to them. The dialogue had no depth and seemed hollow at some points even. And if that's supposed to be a drunken Haymitch... I have no idea what's so wrong with being drunk then.<br/><br/>Number 4: They left out some characters that I though gave the story a better shaping, like Madge, for example, and Peeta's father, and the cookies that Katniss was supposed to throw out the window!<br/><br/>The more time I spend thinking about the movie the more I realize that, in a way, Hollywood has once again taken an excellent story and plot from and excellent book and turned it into a movie that at the end, is just looking to make more bucks. No consideration to the message that it could have sent to the public, the same way the books did. I guess in part it's the PG13 rating that they had to work with, but, still, I'm just dumbfounded. Worst of all? I can't believe the movie turned out this way with Suzanne Collins working on the team and actually WRITING the screenplay."
"ntebyanian","5","16","28","24 March 2012"," Disappointed.....
","I recently read the Hunger Games and i automatically became hooked. The story,the characters,everything which gives the reader so much to think about.I was honestly pretty excited to see this movie,but i told myself not to have high expectations and in the end i'm glad i listened. Now i do have to say the first half starts out promising.We come across the character of Katniss Everdeen as she gets prepared for the yearly reaping of two children,a boy and a girl from each district to battle to the death. This half was good and i did fell tension between a lot of the characters and i liked that. But the second half when the games actually begin,i found myself starting to realize a lot of changes!They took out a lot of things i quickly noticed while i was watching.People said they made minor changes,but i think their were major changes.From taking a part out or just adding in an extra scene made me feel like it could have been executed better.Occasionally it worked but overall it kinda ruined it. So the bottom line is i give it a thumbs up to the look of the movie,which pretty much covers all the details in the book,capturing the capitol city wonderfully. Also a thumbs up to Jennifer Lawerence,Woody Harrelson and Stanley Tucci for their fine performances. Thumbs down for the lack of details i wanted to see,lack of acting for certain people (Josh Hutcherson) and the last half of the film which to me seemed kind of anti climatic. Also i didn't like Ross's camera work in this movie for one reason.The majority of fight scenes were all done hand held and it really ruins the action.<br/><br/>5 out of 10."

Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson both played parts excellently and I think it is one of best performances for both Jennifer and Josh, the other stars in the film also play well and give a superb finish to the cast.

Part way into the film i looked at the time hoping the film was coming to the end but it had dragged so long..only half an hour?! Please let this end! The death scenes were rushed and plain. Obviously didn't want to upset the 12/13 year olds watching this, as this is the age bracket its obviously made for. The budget for Battle Royale (from wikipedia) $4.5 million vs Hunger Games (from wikipedia) $78 million...wow. What a horrible waste of money.

"honkycat97","1","8","12","2 July 2013"," A Terrible Interpretation of What Was an Excellent Book
","First of all, whoever was in charge of casting should never work again. Just about everyone cast was wrong for the part--with the exceptions of Elizabeth Banks as Effie Trinket, Donald Suthlerland as President Snow, and Lenny Kravitz as Cinna. Josh Hutcherson as Peeta Mellark was all wrong. In the novel, Peeta was handsome, very blonde and blue-eyed. I am sure he was taller than Katniss, too. He was also brave, considerate, strong in deeds as well as heart. Hutcherson plays Peeta as a whiny little (and I mean ""little"") troll. Jennifer Lawrence was equally offensive as Katniss. Again, all wrong! Katniss was dark, mysterious, attractive, but hollowed from hunger. In fact, hunger seems to be present only in the title here, not in the story line. Why not just call it ""The Hollywood Games""?<br/><br/>Well, I thought that I could overlook the casting gaffes, and just watch the movie. ""Perhaps it will work anyway,"" I thought to myself. In this, I was the one who was all wrong. The movie missed all of the important aspects of the book, and dumbed it down drastically to reel in more moviegoers by giving it a PG-13 rating. The book was most definitely not for kids. What a terrible disappointment this movie was."

"karen-public","5","8","12","26 March 2012"," If they could hold the camera steady and shortened it by an hour, it would have been great.
","Another decent movie ruined by shaky cam and a cameraman who doesn't know how to focus his camera. I assume they were trying to make it seem more 'real' that way, but all it gave me was a headache.<br/><br/>I mean, seriously, you have children killing children. It doesn't get much more gritty and real than that. Let the story shine through, it doesn't need bad cinematography to get the point across.<br/><br/>Other than that, I would just call it okay. It felt much the same way as the Harry Potter movies did.. they expect that their watchers have read the books and therefore decide to show bits of scenes rather than show why they're important, assuming movie-goers will fill in the rest with their own already-obtained knowledge. Unfortunately, this isn't always the case. I had read the first book, but my boyfriend had not. After the movie I was explaining why scenes they showed snippets of were important.<br/><br/>I know that a movie can't contain everything in the book. There's not enough time, but I would prefer a scriptwriting team that chose a couple moments and really told you WHY they were important in the movie rather than expecting you to fill in your own blanks.<br/><br/>For one, I think that District 11 giving Rue's bread to Katniss was such a huge move, such a sign of the changing of times where the lower districts supported each other, but, instead we should an out of focus, badly filmed riot as a reaction to Rue's death. It was a whole different message. The Hunger Games were designed to keep people apart, keep them in fear... that moment was so huge. It banded the groups together in a way violence couldn't. Showing a scene of them gathering money for bread for Rue and how hard it was for them to scrape it together.. then, after her death, showing the container landing for Katniss, a note inside saying something like 'Win for Rue - District 11"" would have been far more moving.<br/><br/>I realize it's probably a hint at the rebellion that assuredly comes up (though I haven't read the last two books) but still. That was such a powerful moment for me.<br/><br/>I also think they spent too much time in the set up before the games. The thing about the book is you feel like it's a whirlwind of activity. The first hour and a half of the movie was so slow as they set up. They could have cut some bits and, with clever directing, they could have told so much more in a short amount of time.<br/><br/>The good things? I appreciated that Katniss was an athletically built girl who looked like she could do everything asked of her and not an emaciated waif who wouldn't have lasted an hour. I appreciated the casting in general.. I can't think of anyone who didn't pull their weight admirably on screen. I appreciate that they didn't shy away from the brutality of the games, that's part of the point.<br/><br/>The short of it? A picture may be worth a thousand words, but the book is worth a thousand of these movies (and less headache.) Without the shaky cam and having to explain what the deal was with the little bits they did show afterward? Definitely see it. The way it is now? Wait for rental."
"a-moroianu","4","15","26","26 March 2012"," Didn't know about the book until the movie...
","Hello, First off you have to take into account that before seeing this movie I didn't even know it was based on a book. So definitely I went in the theater with an open mind, being most of all attracted by the title. <br/><br/>Well, almost two and a half hours later I came out of said theater mostly disappointed. And here's why...<br/><br/>Let me first start with the good: I thought that some of the characters did do their job well, building on that sense that this futuristic society is of an Orwellian nature, creating repulsing characters, easily hate-able. In my opinion a negative character is well played by the actor when you, as audience would like to personally end their lives. And I felt this way with a lot of the characters in the movie - the show host, the recruiting lady, the show producer. On the other hand I didn't feel as sympathetic with the good guys in the movie, mostly - like someone before me showed - because they lacked depth. I did not feel their struggle was real enough. Furthermore I really enjoyed the costumes, makeup, overall sets. But that was about it. <br/><br/>I felt the movie had so many plot holes and inconsistencies I don't know where to start from. Firstly I didn't feel the ""hunger"" that haunted the characters in the movie. IMHO they felt pretty well fed. Someone being in a constant state of hunger could not easily overlook the abundance of food found in the train - just as the two tributes were leaving the village. A hungry person would surely dig in, even more so if they were about to die soon. I mean, what is there else to do? But that's just a small point. I didn't fully understand how the society works. Sure, there were some sort of guards in white uniforms, but it seemed that they carried no weapons of any sort. How was such an oppressive society enforcing its power. I mean I come from an oppressive society and even with all the fear and guns, people still rebelled because, well mostly, they were hungry - and the society won. So I must ask myself why did people so easily comply with this oppressive regime? There were no questions asked about the way that society worked. And I have one point I'd like to raise, mostly because I did not read the books.. did the fact that these games existed mean that there were no other crimes in that country? Because if so, then it would be a small price to pay for overall peace and safety. <br/><br/>Furthermore, if some of the resident were trained for this type of thing, why didn't everybody do it. I mean the guy who was in the urn 42 times, he knew his odds were high - why didn't he train in the art of survival all year long? And another question: these games only lasted for 4-5 days - what happened in the rest of the year?<br/><br/>And... if they were able to create all these elements in the game - at first I thought it was VR but then I saw they were real, if this sort of technology existed why wasn't it used to create food - since this was apparently the issue in that world. <br/><br/>What happened to the people rebelling in the 11th district? They seemed pretty successful at first. <br/><br/>If the games were rigged - and they were, and everybody could see that, why did the people still go there. I mean if I were in that position I'd rather die from the beginning then be someone's toy to throw around. I mean clearly the games were not fair. People should have rebelled seeing that the rules changed as the game progressed. <br/><br/>And now back to some more dedicated points: if the people trying to kill Katniss were trained soldiers - sort of, why did all of them go to sleep, under a BIG wasp nest without having guards for every two hours or so, thus preventing what happened later on. <br/><br/>Also, when you plant mines in a perimeter to defend a bunch of stuff, that stuff would no way in hell blow up if one of the mines was tripped. It just doesn't make sense. <br/><br/>Also, Katniss, after she got the bow, with her skills could easily do a divide et impera and slowly kill each adversaries form a distance. <br/><br/>I think I went on for too long, and maybe sometimes it didn't make sense, but I have to say I was less than impressed overall. But who's to say, maybe I don't see things straight.<br/><br/>Andrei"

","The movie The Hunger Games contains lots of exciting contents. But after reading the book The Hunger Games, I got disappointed by the movie. There are many details missing, and the romantic scenes and horrifying scenes in the book are very emotional, while in the movie, it doesn't gt very emotional. Except for one part... Many of the things that I imagined in the book isn't there, such as after The Reaping. It is the district 12 government's daughter giving her the Mockingjay pin, not Prim. Peeta's father had also visited her. And instead of five minutes per person, she get half an hour in the book. All in all, things that is important in the book doesn't appear to be important in the movie."

","I just got back from seeing The Hunger Games, I've been waiting for this film for weeks after reading the first two books and am currently reading the third one I would definitely consider myself caught up in the hype. I was so excited to see the movie and once I got there I found my self immediately disappointed. People keep on posting here how it's a great interpretation of the book and I completely disagree. The book was much much much better. There was so much left out of the movie that really helped to understand the story. I feel like they left out a lot of information that set the stage like information about the capital and katniss's relationships with her family, gale, and peeta. In the movie they made it seem like katniss had little to no relationship with peeta and was not close to him. Whereas in the book you see so much more chemistry between them that you want katniss to fall for him in the movie you barley get to know peeta's character. Its hard to judge the movie for people who have not read the books , you might really like it. My recommendation to the people who have not read the book read it and don't see the movie. or see the movie and then read the book. I also feel like the movie ended in such a way that it does not set it up properly for the next book/movie.

"Jokercrow","7","13","22","27 March 2012"," Reminds me of ""Battle Royal"" but still a great movie !
","I really liked ""Hunger Games"". Even tough it reminds me a lot of the Japanese 2000 Battle Royal, I feel like it used the idea in an interesting and different way. I don't know if ""Hunger Game"" is a rip off, and personally, I don't care. But I think it would be more fun for those of you who didn't see any of the two movies, to see, at least first, the one that suits your interest best. So I would like here to explain what makes those two so specials and unique.<br/><br/>First of all, both movies are set in a futurist society where a ""game"" happen in an isolated forest. A random group of adolescents have been chosen to fight to death until only one stay alive.<br/><br/>What makes ""Battle Royal"" so unique and so good is the fact that each character knows each others. It makes the killing much harder and much more personal. The movie is gory and you will feel the stress and the fear when a character have to kill or will get killed by someone he/she knows. Each character represent a different way of thinking and a different way of dealing with a problem. If you are more of an underground, bloody, but a more human movie, Battle Royal should be for you.<br/><br/>In ""Hunger Games"", the killing is shown in television. We spend a lot of time with the aristocrat that organized and look at the show. In this environment, everything looks, at first beautiful, but fake at the same time. In this mind set, the characters are also uni dimensional. They almost all look happy to go kill and get killed. The deepness and the interest of this movie does not comes from the battles, but from the sick organization and society that host the game and controls everything. It's a critics of the society and a critics of the way people often show an image of themselves that does not reflect who they really are. If you prefer a mainstream film with beautiful images, a critical political plot, ""Hunger Games"" suits you best.<br/><br/>So, whether you decide to see the sick emotional ""Battle Royal"" or the beautiful critical ""Hunger Games"" you should enjoy a good time. Then, if you like your experience, that does not stop you from seeing the other one after.<br/><br/>That been said, if I had seen ""Hunger Games"" first, I would have gave it a 8/10 instead of a 7/10. But since I felt a lot of ""Déjà-vu"" during the movie, the experience was not as good as it could have been. So make sure to see first the one that suits you best, and...<br/><br/>...Bon cinéma !<br/><br/>Joker"
"Bart_OP","4","12","20","27 March 2012"," Okay Adaptation of a Bad Children's Book
","I am decidedly NOT a fan of the Hunger Games. People my age may remember the Hunger Game's plot from a 1987 movie called 'The Running Man,' starring Arnold Schwarzenegger and Richard Dawson. I found myself squirming at the premise and really uncomfortable at the story. It is very transparent, I figured out virtually every important plot point very early in the movie. Plot devices like little parachutes delivering sponsored favors and controllers who can introduce forest fires and genetically-engineered Cujos into the arena do not make it more interesting, they make it even more ridiculous than it was to begin with. Katniss and Peeta are certainly ""redeemed"" characters and Peeta's desire to transcend the games certainly made it easy to figure out how the plot was going to wrap up. But even with these compelling heroes, the world is just as dark and hopeless at the end of the movie as it is at the beginning - in fact worse, because Katniss is pretending to be in love with Peeta. I know we are only a third way through the story, but still there should be triumph and hope. (Think about the end of Star Wars episode 4 or the Fellowship of the Rings - darkness still threatened in those stories, but hope was plentiful). So there is no redemption at the end of this very dark story. I have kept hearing about how it is ""poignant social commentary on American life."" The book may be, but the movie really misses the boat here too, making the movie even less relevant.<br/><br/>I thought the acting was good (Great to see Lenny Kravitz acting again. Loved him in 'Precious'). The cinematography, art direction, and and costumes were great. Since I have not read the books, I cannot comment on the adaptation. I saw the film with my friend Jennifer Serling, who had read the books and thought the adaptation was more than adequate. There are some cute little plot points that I thought were okay - e.g. the ""fire costumes"" and ""mocking jay"" calls.) I found the movie visually stunning. the costuming in the capital was interesting but derivative (did you see a little film from 1939 called 'the Wizard of Oz'?)<br/><br/>On the whole I think that the movie is a just okay adaptation of a children's story that is far too violent for children in both premise and story-telling. I won't be bothering to read the books and I could probably tell you the plot of the second book without much trying or thought...I was prepared to like it. I was hoping this second movie in one day would redeem another bad movie experience from earlier in the day (October Baby). Not so much. 4/10."
"StuntmanExtraordinaire","4","11","18","26 March 2012"," Half Rubbish/Decent
","The only shining light of this film was... Woody Harrelson. If not for him, The Hunger Games wouldn't have even achieved a barely mediocre 4/10 from me. Woody delivered a supporting role I expected from him. <br/><br/>The first half of the film was utter rubbish!... I'm not even British so when I say the term ""rubbish"", you know I am serious. Luckily, the second half wasn't all that bad, saving the film from a harsher rating. The action intensified and the plot gained some much needed momentum.<br/><br/>BUT!... The failure of this film critically comes down to the director and cinematographer. Seriously? I wonder if they have heard of throwing in a steady cam or wide shot here and there. The shaky camera works at times, but here it seemed to be used as an excuse for not being able to replicate the action on scene. An example of this would be... well, most of the film I suppose. And I understand the film wants to win an Oscar for cinematography, but that wont happen with 114 minutes of it being a portfolio of close up images. It is hard to tell the story to its full potential without ever stepping back to let the background play its role. Another thing that got to me was the lack of time spent on character development. My last note of criticism is the costumes of the futuristic people... My God! what were the filmmakers trying to achieve with those flamboyant abominations. I hope American fashion does not lead to that in the future or we are all doomed. Although, it could lead to a new series, The Fashion Games.<br/><br/>On a good note, the film did have its moments, predominately being in the second half and whenever Woody was on scene. The film had potential and a good plot, but was diminished by the filmmakers in this case.<br/><br/>By the way, where were the hungry children?"

","OK so let me start off by saying that, This movie was hyped beyond belief. It has been touted as the next twilight killer. Whilst I didn't really like Twighlight (because of the main girls wooden acting)it at least had interesting characters and focused on a war between vampires and wolves.<br/><br/>The Hunger Games starts off well enough and did present some cool characters (WOODY and BANKS) set in a depressing future world. However as I watched I soon realised that this movie was utter crap. The premise of a game show setting did not fit in with the depressing world on the outside. This is like a teenage friendly version of Arnold Shwarzeneggers Running Man! (Now that was an awesome movie!) The action was poor and the camera shook way too much. Seriously it was that bad. I almost fell asleep. The special effects are quite bad (those hounds at the end??? like 1990's FX) There was almost no suspense and the ending was anti-climatic at best. No twist or surprise at all.

"user-490-135372","1","4","5","26 April 2015"," In a word: ridiculous
","This is, without a doubt, one of the most ridiculous movies I have seen in a long time. <br/><br/>Let's start with the core subject: dystopian societies have been explored in many movies before, and this one does not add anything new of substance. In addition, the society depicted is thoroughly inconsistent internally - advanced technology, but still digging for coal? <br/><br/>The imagery: It's easy to believe that many members of a society are brainless and ridiculous, but assuming that they would control the society is preposterous. Not at all believable.<br/><br/>The dialog: Quite silly, especially at the beginning. <br/><br/>The naming scheme: Giving Roman empire names to bad guys comes across as juvenile and unsubtle. The names of the downtrodden masses are just silly. Peeta?<br/><br/>The camera: The director seems to be one of those under the impression that shaking the camera during action scenes contributes to realism. It does not. It just makes many in the public dizzy, gives them a headache, and makes the scenes confusing.<br/><br/>The script: Silly and discombobulated. <br/><br/>The underlying social critique: Come on! This has been done many times before, and far more competently. It's so transparent and obvious that ends up being - yes, ridiculous.<br/><br/>The acting, without being great, is acceptable. Miss Lawrence is fine, and, albeit pleasant to look at, she is not the beauty goddess that Hollywood has been peddling for the last three years. Alas, it is difficult to believe that she would become infatuated with the one-dimensional, boring and wimpish Peeta.<br/><br/>I imagine that, for the most part, this is a movie (like the book it is based on) addressed to naive, immature and shallow teenagers, who will probably leave the theater under the impression that they have watched a deep, life-changing movie. I'm sorry, but it is not. It's puerile, predictable and, mostly - ridiculous."
"jmcd2007","2","4","5","28 November 2014"," A Dull and Repetitive Film...
","This film felt really repetitive and, quite honestly, did not hold my interest at all. Being that I have never read the book series, I don't honestly have a clue if the writers managed to stay true to the book here. One would at least hope so. In any case, having 80-85% of the film have what felt like re-hashed fight scenes and death after death isn't my cup of tea. Mockingjay, Part 1 was a much better film in terms of an engaging story plot and more intense dialogue. I've also heard that Catching Fire was quite an improvement over this film as well, in which, yes, I'll admit, I have never seen yet. For now, this seems to be the only low point in what, undeniably, has been a very successful film series in Hollywood today."

Like Twilight it features pouty teenagers sighing over puppy love. <br/><br/>It starts out bleak enough with a tale of an uprising against a central government, punished by annual reminders in the form of young ""tributes"" that have to fight each other to the death to remind the various districts of their uprising and its consequences.

"rlggood","2","4","5","30 March 2013"," A Huge Disappointment! (Spoiler Alert)
","Before watching the movie The Hunger Games I had to read the book first. I knew the book was going to be good because of all the good things I heard from others and its enormous popularity. Although I do like to compare the book with its movie counterpart, I realize that not due to the length of books some parts have to be cut when translated into a film. However, I was completely shocked how little the movie contained. There is very little character development of any of the major characters, the dialogue between the characters is nonexistent and changes are made that would confuse anyone who did not read the book. Again I would like to restate that I understand parts of the book has to be sacrificed but the meat of the story is between the conversations of the characters. Going into the movie the relationships I thought the movie had to focus on was the relationship between Haymitch and his mentees, Katniss and Peeta, and the relationship between Katniss and Peeta. The movie did show that Haymitch concocted the love story between Katniss and Peeta but he did not share that with the Capitol. The fake relationship was something that was in place at the beginning but fleshed out in its entirety during the games. I will also say that in the movie the relationship between Katniss and Peeta was nonexistent. Not to ramble on and one I will end by saying The Hunger Games completely missed the mark, recreating scenes and story lines that compromises the integrity of the film. I was very disappointed!"
"jox-the-descendent","1","4","5","7 December 2012"," The book explains some things, but some are still terrible
","I expected much more tension and drama from this story. Some things are better explained in the book. Other things in the movie go exactly by the book, which is not so great itself, so I wasn't sure how to rate the movie.<br/><br/>Katniss doesn't look as she should. It is mentioned in the book several times that she is much lighter than the Career tributes, allowing her to climb trees and whatnot. In the movie, a girl who is smaller than her totally knocks her to the ground.<br/><br/>Katniss never has to fight a good kid. All the contestants she kills are blatantly evil. There are no moral choices, no drama. An exception to this is in the end, when she is left with Peeta. They pull something no one has thought of doing in 73 years and succeed, because the bloodthirsty audience loves a good love story.<br/><br/>Katniss, forced to climb a tree with 4 kids trying to kill her, conveniently encounters a nest of killer-wasps and knocks it down, conveniently killing the girl with the only bow in the arena, which happens to be Katniss's weapon of choice.<br/><br/>In the book, the way I understood it, Cato killed the boy who planted the mines *because* he messed up and set them too close to the equipment. They did not intend for the equipment to be destroyed. In the movie, it just looked stupid.<br/><br/>However, the idea of mines that can be activated by an apple falling from a small height is terrible. They work that way in the book, too. It is said that a girl once dropped a small wooden ball and was blown to bits. Wouldn't the bits then activate other mines, causing a chain explosion and killing more contestants? The mines were all around, preventing the children from moving or jumping in any direction. Even if the tributes were at a safe distance from one another, mines that can be activated by a passing squirrel sounds like a terrible idea.<br/><br/>In the arena where only one tribute can survive, there had to be a cliché scene in which a bad girl pins Katniss down and then talks what she'll do to her instead of killing her. When the boy showed up at the bad girl's back and said, ""Oh, really?"", I felt insulted and paused the movie in disbelief. Apparently, this boy did not want to team up with Rue, but he wanted to avenge her death *and* let the deadly ranger, Katniss, go. But it doesn't matter, he died off-screen, because Katniss never has to fight a good kid.<br/><br/>For those who haven't read the books, don't worry, the second part is even worse. Literally 3/4 of the book is village life, dresses and interviews.<br/><br/>Also, I was disappointed when I learned that the idea of children being thrown in an arena wasn't original and that it was already done in Battle Royale."
"dfiorentino415","1","4","5","26 August 2012"," never been this disappointed at a movie with such hype.
","what was the hype? shaky camera angles and horrible action sequences. i watched it with 5 people in the room and we all got headaches during every fight and action scene. just awful. i was so unbelievably disappointed and embarrassed i made everyone watch it. no character development whatsoever. the acting was OK i guess if we discredit it due to being victims of poor writing. this story was interesting but the execution was not there and it's because it was all bout getting the teeny bop-per crowd to jump on board cult style. there was no hunger, struggle, etc whatsoever. i watch something called the hunger games i expect there to be so thought provoking emotional strife struggle trails and tribulations. i cant even explain how bad it was. Jennifer Lawrence maybe a great actress but i could not take her serious in a role where the girl was to be tenacious. why not cast Ellen Paige instead. i feel the two main characters were casted due to supposive sex appeal and Hollywood standards and it had nothing to do with talent or actually being perfect for the role. Linda Hamilton in terminator is tenacious. i know shes not young but i feel Jennifer Lawrence never made me feel she was any bit tough or worthy of being this survivor. again she could just be a victim of the horrible character development and writing she was given along with the lack of portrayal of any hunger. this was really the most disappointed I've been watching a movie in a long time that had high expectations. good story that is poorly executed in PG 13 to make more money. I tried to say to myself is it good for a beginning of a series foot in the door? it really isn't. i never saw anything more clearly only about the money and appealing to the right target audience. this movie is not for anybody who knows anything about what makes a movie good. it isn't for any adults, young adults, critics, movie buffs, or even people who love the books that should just continue reading instead of watching movies. this m movie is purely for teenagers to do what they do best and follow something in pop culture."

","I am using a somewhat popular blogging platform (not google's) for workspace on a project I'm running on cinematic abstraction. I am not into the social aspect of it, though I have developed contacts. It just offers appealing options in the code. Now and then, as a kind of smoke break, I switch from personal work on my dashboard to the general stream of published content. I mostly filter for cinema, so suppose I am blocking out a lot of junk, but still, being able to tune in that channel of youthful stream-of-consciousness allows for some pretty cool observations.<br/><br/>The age of average user in that place seems to be below twenty. They blog and reblog like crazy, with new posts arriving every minute. The level is several notches above Twitter, and predominantly visual. It goes beyond 'liking' something, to putting together some attractive personality. Items that get a lot of traction, within what is filtered by me, include fashion, urban nightscape photography, Sofia Coppola, everything tagged Dali and surrealism. There is the occasional Walt Whitman quote followed by pictures of waffles or movie stars.<br/><br/>So, spending quite a bit of time with (partially) the target-group for this film, I have to report: a sizable portion of our youth is not dumb and desensitized, it seems to me, they may be melodramatic (youth seldom isn't), but they are curious, alert, visual creatures. They are looking for art that teases the imagination. In ten years time, some of them are going to be commendable artists. <br/><br/>So, if I'm being honest, I would be much, much more accepting of something like this, if it was a spontaneous, say collaborative project generated by teenagers from that community. The focus would have been largely the same, I'm sure: stifled passions, cruel , dystopic adult world. But the personality?<br/><br/>What we have here is that adults in the high corporate levels have made many of the same remarks, and here is the shrewd business plan: nicely package teenage dynamics inside the visual culture that consumes and defines them. It's a smart move, and this is the most acutely aware of the recent crop, so much so it makes (the first) Twilight seem naive and old Hollywood.<br/><br/>What does this mean? The film is made from a lot of spare parts, as though reblogged (Battle Royale is only the most recent and obvious). It is shot as a fast-moving stream of visual snippets that is not at all the Bourne effect: the idea here is less the first-person character experience, and more of a comfortable cognitive map for a young audience growing up on internet and instant interconnectivity. It takes place in a world that venerates spectacle and celebrity, with the Gamers paraded around 'tinseltown' like the hottest new MTV stars. The battleground arena is filmed by hundreds of cameras that instantly connect everywhere, including the skies.<br/><br/>So far so good, an effectively aligned version of contemporary pop culture. The action once it kicks in is formulaic, but that is because the guys running this have no imagination: you can observe the director of the Games and his team of assistants, every decision they make to affect the gameflow, instead of perhaps intelligently structuring the situation is absolutely contrived and geared for special-effects: most of all, nondescript monsters to speed-up the finale. The artistic personality, since every decision is of an artistic nature, is simply unappealing.<br/><br/>But, here's the catch that entirely sinks this: like a bunch of smarmy, Victorian-era schoolteachers, adults responsible for this - the 'sponsors' for the event - couldn't resist imposing on the teenage playground fun with a combination of finger-wagging, 1984-style fearmongering about the future, and sensationalized movie-treatment of suffering.<br/><br/>The film was designed in the vein of, hinges its entire appeal, and probably used every channel of that visual culture to access an audience, then turns around and claims that culture is decadent, exploits and degrades. <br/><br/>Moreover, it attempts, this multimillion dollar product, to remind us that outside of the comfortably-numb limits of reality TV and the internet, in the real world out there persists hunger, inequality, and poverty. The lead is played by a girl who two years ago in Winter's Bone had to eke out a miserable existence in southern Missouri, another clue of short-sighted imagination, casting her because she was good there. The downbeat scenario is replicated whole here, including the killing of squirrels for food.<br/><br/>In other words: ""sit down in the multiplex to have fun with this thing you have seen advertised on TV and across the internet, while we lecture with important statements on the state of the world.""<br/><br/>If I was sixteen now, maybe I wouldn't know it, but I believe that younger self would deserve much better. So if you are that age and looking for something that nourishes with rejection, I would turn you over to something like Godard's Breathless or Harmony Korine's Gummo: rebellious films made by young filmmakers in the effort to capture a little something of what it means to live in the world. Breathless (conventionally) popularized the jump-cut that is the main device here, but was using it as a breach with established ways of seeing. It was radical in its time, and you deserve something radical in yours.<br/><br/>This is the 'sponsored' version, where adults take your money while pretending to educate."

"cycloverid","1","4","5","11 August 2012"," Absurd Movie
","This is my first review, and I felt absolutely compelled to write it because the current score on this movie is way too high. It may be important for you to know that I never read the books.<br/><br/>I pride myself in being able to pinpoint bad movies just by watching the trailer. I avoided The Hunger Games in the theaters for this very reason. But recently, a friend of mine recommended the movie after he had watched it at home. This friend has recommended some fantastic movies over the years, so I gave it a shot - especially after seeing a decent review on IMDb. Well, this is the first time he let me down.<br/><br/>It didn't take long into watching it for me to realize that the Hunger Games is a movie aimed specifically at teenagers. It has that recognizable kind of plastic coating on it, with casting akin to daytime TV. You know, the one where the actors spend absolutely no effort in attempting to look their part. The teenagers look like they all come from elite genetic stock with premium health care, yet they are playing the role of a person living in the slums...<br/><br/>The protagonist comes from an impoverished family in a dystopian future, who is apparently a skilled hunter, with a dead-eye aim with a bow, and frequents the wilderness to exploit these talents. Somehow she does all of this and maintains her perfect complexion. And she has not a single convincing mannerism to suggest that she actually does what the story says. Her personality doesn't mesh with her harsh upbringing.<br/><br/>And then the movie shows us the easily despised upper class. They have loud, gaudy fashion sense, and the repulsiveness of their snobby attitudes is magnified by their bad physical features. This is a future where good genetics have conveniently sunk to the bottom of the social hierarchy. These unquestionably bad people want to kill off the healthy, modest, good-looking and socially aware lower class teens. We, the mindless viewers, can easily detest this obvious role-reversal - I mean tragedy!<br/><br/>Aside for some desensitized killings, the games play out like a day in a prestigious high school campus, complete with cliques and that first romance. The 'cool group' even affords a prissy girl to accompany the jock character.<br/><br/>The real story becomes nothing more than a petty backdrop and farce. There is little to suggest the actual hardship of living out in the woods for weeks, or the psychological affects of living in a battleground and having to kill other human beings or even think about killing other human beings. It's convenient that the cliques never have to battle amongst themselves - they are instead killed off in a crossfire. Also convenient is a sudden rule change to allow the two lovers to not have to deal with a potentially ghastly scenario.<br/><br/>So in summation, it was of the quality level of a day-time TV drama for teens that was stretched out for cinema. It was a complete waste of time, and had no intellectual value."

I felt I HAVE to level down the hype around this crap.<br/><br/>First, global plot is full of holes, non-sens and unbelievable pieces of junks. Everyone should agree on that instead of repeating useless excuses such as ""Oh the untold things are so much clearer in the books... it so much more believable in the books you should have read"".<br/><br/>There a tons of useless characters we don't care at all and that's not even because there is not time or place to develop their backgrounds or to build their ""feelings"" : lots of time is spend on useless things, even repeating obvious parts while ignoring large interesting spaces...<br/><br/>Everything feels wrong in this film. Bad photography, bad plot, bad rhythm, bad cut... Seriously... I don't understand how critics are so generous.<br/><br/>CONCLUSION : Bad in so many ways. Boring.

I think the movie really tries to be something way more than it is. In the end, it's a story that could be told in 10 or 15 minutes. The future is totally effed up, people are decadent and soulless beyond belief and so we've turned back the clock to the Roman Coliseum for our inspiration for entertainment and social control. It just strains credulity to the breaking point to believe that people would actually act in the manner that they do in the show.<br/><br/>Why would the participants form alliances? Why wouldn't they try to escape? Why wouldn't the populace rebel more than they do? And why would the supposed ""games"" take as much time as they do? I've got a hunch that in the real world such games would be over in a matter of minutes. But none of that is explored at all.

"emma-davies123","2","4","5","1 July 2012"," Not good...
","I've never reviewed a film before but after seeing this I couldn't help myself. I have read the books (and enjoyed each one thoroughly). The author managed to surprise and entice me throughout Katniss' experiences, making each chapter intensely thrilling. <br/><br/>The film leaves a lot to be desired. I personally do not think that Jennifer Lawrence makes a good Katniss (sorry Laurence fans), as she is too polished, too pretty and too old. Katniss is supposed to be sixteen and far more child like - and it would have been to the film's merit if they had cast someone younger. Peeta is awful too - although Collins states in the books that he and Gale are supposed to be good-looking, the filmmakers have made too much of this. Each character lacks any of the depth you get from reading the books, in particular Caesar Flickerman, who in the books was an approachable, uncle-type character, but lacks any sort of sympathy for the characters in the film.<br/><br/>A gut-wrenching moment in the book is the death of little Rue, however it is a mere inconvenience in the film and it continues with none of Katniss' regret or misery at having lost the life of the child. <br/><br/>The fight Katniss experiences to get food and water is completely ignored throughout the first part of the arena as well, negating The Hunger Games theme entirely. The books are also very brutal, explicitly describing the deaths in the arena - but the film has dumbed it down in order to make it a PG 13, and so the deaths in the arena are barely even noticeable despite the fact we are supposed to be outraged at the Capitol for having put the children there to die.<br/><br/>The film seemed eager to rush through the story, making it feel unfinished and shabby. <br/><br/>I could go on and on - needless to say, read the books because they are amazing...and if you have read the books, don't watch the film! Thanks for reading."

","OK. So without sounding too much like THAT GUY, the hunger games movie was BAD. Actually it was worse than that. Its pretty much a perfect example of how Hollywood ruins decent books. Clearly tailored to the tweens who will, without a doubt, go see it with their moms, who are in fact still high off their Twilight buzz. Personally, I love to hear the DIE HARD tween moms claim there is NO similarity between HUNGER GAMES and Twilight. The director, in his allotted 90 Hollywood minutes (hopefully his last), drain this movie of ALL of the passion the books contain. He surgically removed all evidence of the socioeconomic struggle the characters go through,which IS the point of the movie. I mean ITS THE TITLE of the book! Either this Director (I only call him this for lack of a better word) did not read the books, or failed every English class he ever took.

","I was really looking forward to this movie especially after reading the books, and I am not one of those delusional people who believe the movie will not change at all compared to the book. I usually like most movies when based on the book. But The hunger games movie didn't even try to retain some of the story, feelings, or anything else that made the books great. I believe the first Harry Potter film did better from book to the big screen than this. Heck, I disliked The Golden Compass movie (not because of the book, I never read it before seeing the movie) but I loved it compared to The Hunger Games. I was so disappointed that I actually left the theater mad.<br/><br/>Now the actors they chose were decent for the characters, except for Haymitch. At first I thought he would be an awesome choice, but he didn't even play into the character very well. He was supposed to be an a bit of a jerk and he was actually very nice... he wasn't supposed to be.<br/><br/>Lastly, the cinematography was like blair witch, clover, field... basically it was moving around so much It made me and most people in the theater dizzy."

","I loved it! Having not read the books, and not really knowing what the hell it was about, i dragged my man along and we both thought it was a great movie, me more than him I guess, but he still watched it with me again recently when it came out on DVD.<br/><br/>I read all 3 books after I first saw it, and yes there are some plot holes and unexplained things when looking back at the movie, but so what. You cannot possibly put everything from the book in the movie, it would end up being 5 hours long. The only thing that could have been done differently to fill some of the plot holes is made Katniss the narrator, but even after never having read the books before the movie I honestly didn't really get confused. The only thing that could have been explained a bit better was why Gales name was put in 42 times, and Prim's once. <br/><br/>The character of Katniss was perfectly cast. Which is just as well because her character was in almost every scene and it was essential that they found the right girl to play her. The haunted look in her eyes, I really believed every emotion she was feeling, and felt so sorry for her. I felt sorry for all the kids. What a horrible world where this is what provides entertainment to the rich folk. Kids killing kids, all for the joy and amusement of others. When they first went into the arena I thought it was going to be a small field and it would be all over in five minutes.<br/><br/>All of the actors were great though. I loved Josh Hutcherson is Bridge to Terabithia, but when he popped up on screen in the Hunger Games he was all grown up and a bit of a hottie. And after reading the books, he portrays Peeta perfectly.<br/><br/>I hated the characters from Districts 1 and 2, what horrible kids, did they realise only one person could survive in the end, they were acting like they were going to emerge as the final four.<br/><br/>Did anyone else think Prim looked like a young, blonde Winona Ryder?<br/><br/>Anyway, fantastic movie, and the camera jumping around didn't bother me in the slightest."
"aaronjbong","9","35","73","22 March 2012"," Happy Hunger Games - May the Odds Be Ever In Your Favor
","In the ruins of what once known was North America, lies the futuristic nation of Panem. In the center of the country is the wealthy Capitol, inhabited by lavish-clothed citizens. Surrounding the rich Capitol is twelve outlying districts, each having a different industry and supplying materials for the Capitol. Some of the districts are wealthy (District 1: Luxury, District 2: Masonry, District 4: Fishing), while some are dead-poor (District 11: Agriculture, District 12: Coal mining).<br/><br/>Before the film begins, the 13 districts fought with the Capitol, resulting in catastrophe, but eventually the Capitol won. The aftermath: the 12 districts were forced to annually give in a male and female between the ages of 12 and 18 to participate in the Hunger Games; the participants are called ""tributes"". The 13th District was, unfortunately, obliterated by the Capitol (sort of).<br/><br/>Our heroine is sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen who comes from the poor District 12. She's received tesserae to meet the needs of her suffering family, in exchange for getting her name added additional times for the ""Reaping"" (the time when the names of the participants are randomly picked). When her sister's, Primrose Everdeen, name is unexpectedly drawn during the reaping (despite the fact that her name was only there for once), Katniss volunteers to take her place and enter the Hunger Games, a TV show which forces 24 ""tributes"" to fight to the death as a reminder to the rebellion 74 years ago.<br/><br/>The heart of Panem, the Capitol is where the ""tributes"" undergo training (Katniss and Peeta have drunken Haymitch) and several interviews. Here, everything looks different from District 12. ""The showers are different"" (as Peeta says), the buildings are more colorful and the people there are lavishly-clothed. The citizens of the Capitol don't join the Games but they do are responsible for giving sponsors: some sort of gift received by the ""tribute"" during the Games. The sponsors depend on their opinions and these opinions usually depend on the ""tributes'"" scores given by the Gamemakers; each of the ""tributes"" are evaluated by the Gamemakers based on their skills and the higher the scores, the more likely chance they're going to get sponsors. After the evaluation, we get the interviews hosted by the eccentric Caesar Flickerman, and the Games begin in 3 ... 2 ... 1.<br/><br/>The 24 ""tributes"" run at once in different directions, some to the tempting backpacks filled with valuable items, some clashing to kill some ""tributes"", some escaping to the wild.<br/><br/>Pushing the PG-13 rating to its fullest, the Games do involve blood and some deadly kills. While Katniss and Peeta are relatively quiet, some of the Careers (""tributes"" who spent their entire lives practicing for the Games) are very brutal especially Cato of District 2. The Careers form a pack to kill the other ""tributes"" first before they kill each other until only one remains. <br/><br/>""The Hunger Games"" is often compared to the ""Twilight"" films. They may have a similarity (a love triangle which places Katniss in the middle of Gale and Peeta), but the main focus of the film is not the love triangle. Katniss originally loved Gale but because of the ""Reaping"", Katniss allied with Peeta Mellark. That's basically what the love triangle covers. The love triangle is only a piece in a larger plot set in the dystopian future surrounding the Hunger Games. <br/><br/>The film has an excellent cast. Putting Jennifer Lawrence as our heroine Katniss Everdeen is nothing but perfect. Coming off from an Oscar nomination two years ago, she's one to rise into super stardom. Her performance here is very convincing and very powerful that she deserves an Oscar right there on the spot. Her ability to show rage, nervousness, fear, determination, sadness, is just very spellbinding. John Hutcherson is also one not to be missed. His portrayal of Peeta Mellark is convincing also, being able to display nervousness, and fear. The others were also excellent: Alexander Ludwig plays Cato viciously, and brutally; Woody Harrelson plays the drunk Haymitch perfectly; Stanley Tucci portrays Caesar Flickman with charisma and style; Elizabeth Banks depicts Effie Trinket with meticulous details. <br/><br/>The action is another thing the movie excels in. Although there might have not been a lot of intense explosions or ""Kabooms!"", the moments that take place in the Arena are thrilling likewise. The fight is not about action but more about hunting and survival skills. Katniss is relatively quiet, unlike the Careers who are more excited about getting into a fight where they are able to snap people's necks. <br/><br/>The film is based on a novel, a novel I enjoyed immensely. With the author Suzanne Collins also playing a part in writing the screenplay, the movie is faithful to the book's contents. Although there are slight alterations, there are no major alterations that might change the course of the plot (such as ""Percy Jackson: The Lightning Thief""). Anyone who has read the books will be pleased with how Gary Ross transformed the book into this film. Not a fan of the books, no problem, you can still enjoy this film. In other words, anyone can enjoy the film. <br/><br/>Rating: 9/10<br/><br/>Final Verdict: ""The Hunger Games"" is an action-packed drama that lives up to its massive hype and can be enjoyed by anyone."
"Smells_Like_Cheese","8","22","43","22 April 2012"," I'm shocked! I loved it!
","First there was Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, then Twilight and now we have The Hunger Games. Let me start by saying much kudos to the film on being popular by word of the mouth because normally we are bombarded with crazy advertising for a film like this but instead I didn't see that much honestly. I think the film relied more on it's fan base than anything for the box office numbers and it really did pay off. My fiancé and I actually waited until this weekend to see The Hunger Games to see it with a not so crowded theater and still it was pretty packed. I didn't know what to expect and to be honest I thought I would never get into this film but I'm surprised to say that I really did like this movie and actually bought the book because of it. For a long time it felt like the teenager's intelligence was just being insulted with the bad writing with Twilight and I gave up hope for them. The Hunger Games is an intelligent well thought out story that has a clever take on our society and isn't afraid to tell you the truth.<br/><br/>The nation of Panem, formed from a post-apocalyptic North America, consists of a wealthy Capitol and twelve poorer surrounding districts. As a punishment for a previous rebellion against the Capitol by the districts, one boy and one girl between the ages of 12 and 18 from each district are selected by an annual lottery to participate in the Hunger Games, an event in which the ""tributes"" must fight in an arena controlled by the Capitol until there is only one victor. Katniss, a 16-year-old girl from District 12, volunteers for the Hunger Games in place of her younger sister. Peeta, a baker's son is also selected. Katniss and Peeta are taken to the Capitol, where their drunken mentor, former Games victor, instructs them to watch and learn the talents of the other tributes. They get to go on TV and get treated like celebrities until the games begin and now must face survival and death.<br/><br/>I thought the film was very clever on what would life be like if we were put into situations like this. I thought the ""tributes"" were treated more like American Idol contestants and that was very believable. I liked the characters and they were not only believable but they were likable. Jennifer Lawrence does a really good job as Katniss along with Woody Harrelson, Lenny Kravitz and Elizabeth Banks. The costumes were so creepy but believable that they would be considered the high fashions of the time. The action scenes were very exciting and also so sad and intense. These are kids who have to not only kill each other but face the possibility of dying before they can experience so much of what life has to offer. My only complaint of the film was the shaky cam effect. I don't mind when there's not much action going on in the movie, but when the action is happening, we couldn't tell who was getting killed and what was going on. Thank goodness this wasn't 3D because I would've had a big headache. Also I felt like the film cuts short on giving any of the other tributes any kind of character development that you really don't feel for them as much.<br/><br/>But I thought this was a great movie and a good start to the summer blockbuster films. I have to admit that I will probably buy this when it's released on blu ray and will read the books, it seems like a really interesting story. I'm looking forward to the sequels and most of all I'm just glad that we will have a franchise again where the story is just plain exciting and we're dying to see what happens to our hero's next. I would recommend for you to see this film before it leaves the theaters. It's one that should be experienced on the big screen because of the scope of the movie, the sets are great and it's a movie that you really could get into. Looking forward to seeing what Katniss will do next now that she's ticked off the rich.<br/><br/>8/10"

","This is definitely one of the worst and most ridiculous stories I have ever seen in a movie. Apparently the acting government demands a boy and girl between the ages of 12-18 from every district to duke it out with each other until the death. Oddly enough however, these are no ordinary 12-18 year old. As you will see, if you poorly choose to see this ludicrous excuse for a film, these kids are black hearted and bloodthirsty killers who each acquire years of training in weapons handling, stealth, and martial arts. These personae are completely inconsistent with the reluctant and frightened children who were lined up in rows upon the names selection for each contestant. Another thing that bothered me was the rebellion that took place after the black girl died. What did they expect? Why rebel then? Did they really think she would have made it out alive given that she is just one of some 26 contestants? <br/><br/>The idea for the movie is okay, but the delivery is simply a mess. Going into the film, I expected myself to sympathize with all of the kids since their totalitarian government is forcing them to slit each other's throat. It seems however that the majority of them like doing it, and are happy to be there. I kept asking myself throughout the movie, ""What in the world am I watching!?"" Very little of the characters are likable, which isn't always a bad thing, but in this case it is. The storyline would have had much more going for it if it had the audience holding feelings for the young kids, but instead, it seems like they just want the view to sit back, relax, and enjoy the onslaught as if it is a gladiator game in a coliseum. <br/><br/>The movie has some plus's worth mentioning. Obviously it does have a good cast of actors. Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson both add a lot of energy to their characters. The filming and cinematography are worth noting as well. The movie might pass as something to watch with a group of friends on a Friday night, but I have no other regards for the film. If you are looking for an interesting and exciting piece of work, you will not find it here. You can find more enjoying watching something happen under a rock."

","Honestly I started up the movie with no expectations, and it was really not that entertaining. It seemed like it was written by a twelve year old which is probably why it appeals to a lot of people. Nothing in this movie really stood out to me as exciting, and for the most part I found myself wondering when the movie was going to end. This is probably because it felt as there was no connection with the character at all which is really bad especially if you are trying to connect the audience emotionally with the characters. With that said if you want to watch people killing each other it would be better if you watched ""Battle Royale"" because that seems to be what ""The Hunger Games"" is based off of."

Yet the only horror here is that the film plays out like a shallow, run-of-the-mill Hollywood blockbuster complete with an obligatory love plot and green screens galore. <br/><br/>Seriously, talk about wasted potential. The source material is definitely there. The themes take nods from classics like George Orwell's 1984, William Golding's Lord of the Flies, and Kurt Vonnegut's Harrison Bergeron, laying the groundwork for a film that could've been a deep, disturbing philosophical examination of human nature and the dangers of government. I'm honestly upset that I didn't read the novel before seeing the film. In the hands of a capable and talented director, I truly feel that this story could've made for a fantastically effective, provocative film. <br/><br/>This is what ultimately makes the end result so frustrating to watch. It's basically like gearing up to lift an 800 lb dumbbell only to have your arms swing effortlessly upward as you realize the weights are made of Styrofoam. What should've been an excruciatingly weighty, stimulating affair ended up being about as heavy as a dollop of whipped cream, and just as sweet. And that is true hypocrisy of the film as well: we're supposed to be condemning of government and the characters that put on the Hunger Games, and yet the film itself falls into the same category of glamorizing and diluting what should be portrayed as an atrocity. The action is stylized, the grit and violence is subdued, the CG-sheen is blinding, and the love plot is ham-fisted. The true meat of this story, the implications of such a horrific form of entertainment and the underlying themes of how it could've come to be, are almost swept completely under the rug.<br/><br/>And don't get me wrong here. I'm not just condemning this movie because it wasn't what I thought it should've been. I love stylized action and I there's nothing wrong with an entertaining blockbuster. But the problem is this movie fails on that level as well. The action sequences are uninspired and just plain boring, which is probably a consequence of the fact that the movie never worked to make me emotionally invested. How can I possibly care about these kids fighting for their lives when 90% of them don't have more than four lines in the film and are portrayed as one-dimensional villains? To me, the majority of these characters were as expendable as they were to the citizens of the Capitol. They ended up feeling more like willing, eager participants than desperate, victimized innocents. <br/><br/>The bottom line here is a movie that could've been a deep, provocative, disturbing look at human nature ending up being a shallow Hollywood affair that barely scratched the surface of the underlying themes of its source material. The movie simply felt as manufactured as the Hunger Games themselves, directly catering to the audience rather than challenging it. If you like your government-sponsored child death- matches sugarcoated and served with a large bag of buttery popcorn, by all means. If you're looking for a film willing to dig a little deeper, search elsewhere."

","Having heard of the books for some time I decided to have a go at the trilogy. I'll admit, it was hard to stop reading once I got through the first couple of chapters but I won't praise the books too much though as I found the writing lacking in character and too teenager oriented which was a shame as I thought the plot made a worthy story; even for grown ups.. <br/><br/>Shortly after finishing the books, I turned to the movie and man.. what a waste! However much I may criticize the books I enjoyed them and thought that the colorful plot line and futuristic sets would turn out even better on screen. Unfortunately, that is not the case..... <br/><br/>One of the main issues I had a problem with were the actors. They are ill-fitted to their role, especially Lawrence and Hutcherson who make a very unconvincing couple (especially when you know that their going to end up together..) and barely credible tributes (why choose actors that scream Great health when we're meant to be dealing with citizens from a poverty stricken village who have never had enough to eat!) and Harrelson as Haymitch is laughable.. <br/><br/>I won't go on, I think all's been said already by others, I only hope that the next movies might take into account a few critics (that I'm not the only one to voice..)"
"pnyexprss","3","5","7","30 April 2013"," It wasn't enough..
","**This review contains SPOILERS**<br/><br/>When my sister told me about a book called The Hunger Games I just knew I had to read it. I bought it on my Kindle about three weeks before the movie was supposed to come out. I read it in an afternoon and fell in love. I liked it so much I bought the second and third books in the trilogy and read them right away. Suddenly, I was super excited for the movie to come out. I waited for the Blu-Ray release, because I rarely go to see movies in theaters anymore. I have to say, I was extremely disappointed...<br/><br/>It's not the shaky camera work, or the fact that they cast Josh Hutcherson as Peeta that let me down. I looked past all of that. It's the character development, or should I say LACK of character (and story) development. What the hell were they thinking? This is The Hunger Games and not one time did I believe that most of the citizens of the outlying Districts are supposed to be starving. The connection between Katniss and Peeta in the book is hardly touched on in the movie. The little snippet of Peeta tossing Katniss a burnt loaf of bread is just a joke. That piece of history between the two of them deserved a more in depth explanation than that! I love Effie, Elizabeth Banks did a wonderful job, as well as Woody Harrelson as Haymitch, but poor Cinna! Lenny Kravitz was a good choice to portray him, but he didn't really get an opportunity to shine like Cinna does in the book. He becomes important to Katniss, but you wouldn't know that if you just watched the movie. And don't even get me started on Rue. There was next to nothing as far as development between her and Katniss, which makes the scene of Rue's death seem sort of ridiculous to anyone who hasn't read the book. There was no discussion between them about the differences of their Districts, and we never see Rue's token. It's all just blah to me, which is disappointing. <br/><br/>Madge is left out completely. Buttercup is black and white. We never see Prim's goat, Lady. There are no night vision glasses. Haymitch sends notes with the parachutes. Katniss doesn't lose her hearing. There's no sleep syrup to knock out Peeta so Katniss can retrieve the medicine he needs to survive. I never felt that he was truly dying. The wolf mutts don't have the eyes of the dead tributes, or the collars with their district numbers. Katniss and Peeta don't actually put the Nightlock in their mouths. We don't see her freaking out over Peeta's surgery to give him an artificial leg, which he never gets. The blood and gore has been drastically cut down so they could fit this movie into a PG-13 rating. I don't understand how it could be that difficult to keep things the way they are in the book, at least to the best of the filmmakers ability.. which wasn't done. I understand that it's hard to fit everything in one movie, but at almost 2 and a half hours they could have done much better.<br/><br/>Basically, it was a let down for me. If you've never read the books you may very well enjoy this movie. But, if you have read them then you'll probably be disappointed like so many of us out there. I hope they do better with Catching Fire and Mockingjay, but I won't hold my breath."

","Mindset before movie: I was on a aeroplane heading back from PV, Mexico. I saw ""Hunger Games"" on the on-flight guide and I figured what have I got to lose? I'm stuck on a plane for the next 5 hours anyway. I never even heard of the books until my other half mentioned she read them, so I had no idea what it was about. All I knew was there was a huge buzz around it and the critics raved and blah, blah, blah... Despite all the hype, expectations were low.<br/><br/>Mindset after movie: Wait a minute... I've seen this before, except it was called ""The Running Man"", and instead of Jennifer Lawrence it had Arny. I like ""The Running Man"" more and it too wasn't nearly as good as the book(which was ghost written by Stephen King). In this version of ""The Running Man"" I felt very conflicted; I didn't want to root for the hero, Jennifer Lawrence, because it is what the rich people involved in this production (the kind of people loosely portrayed as the 'bad guys' in this movie) wanted me to do but, I felt I had to root for her because the character is probably gonna start a movement that will help the underdogs of the story take down the cash chuckers, you know what I mean? Beyond that, I see a bright future for Jennifer Lawrence as an actress, I will always love Stanley Tucci and Woody Harrelson no matter what they do. I honestly think the major killer of this movie was all the hype around it and that nobody seems to remember ""The Running Man"". They should have just remade that instead. With that said I can tell you that anybody who likes this movie is probably still in their teens and are more than likely rolling with the hype or they love the book series so much that it has subconsciously put them in a temporary state of denial.<br/><br/>If you're like me, have matured beyond your teenage years and have seen/read ""The Running Man"". This movie will make you angry because they just ripped off ""The Running Man"" while ignoring its existence instead of remaking it. However, if you're a pop-culture sheep who just likes everything that is hyped to death, like ""Twilight"" or Lady Gaga you'll probably like it. Oh ya, my girlfriend read these books and she hated this movie too...she also forgot that ""The Running Man"" existed...WHAT IS GOING ON IN SOCIETY THESE DAYS?"

The Hunger games pinged up on my ""looks rubbish"" radar as soon as i saw it advertised on the TV, pre release, so when i had to sit down and watch it last night I wasn't looking forward to it at all. I tried my hardest to settle down and get involved in the movie but it's just god-awful. The plot is slow, the action is 'few' and far between and plot holes are huge and numerous and the general story is (I'd love to use a swear) terrible.<br/><br/>I'm not quite sure who they're trying to appeal to here either. Seems too violent to be for below 15-16 year olds and is too childish for above 13 year olds, doesn't make sense to me.<br/><br/>When i sat down to watch the Twilight films I dreaded it, but i actually ended up really enjoying them, so it's not just me being a miserable, negative, hater, this film is just rubbish.<br/><br/>So, if you're thinking of buying/renting it and are reading this... for the love of God, don't.

","I had no interest in this movie, never read the books but I took my niece to the movie and within the first 30 min I had the feeling I've seen or read it somewhere before. Took me a while but I found the connection.<br/><br/>Shirley Jackson wrote a short story called the ""The Lottery"" in 1948. There are but a few minor difference but the story line (coal-mining town, lottery, sacrifice) is the same.<br/><br/>The Lottery / Hunger Games<br/><br/>Coal-mining town / Coal-mining District <br/><br/>Villages can communicate with other villages / Districts are isolated/restricted under Marshal Law<br/><br/>No reason is provided about why lottery and sacrifice must take place / A reason is provided <br/><br/>All participate in the lottery (very old and very young) / Age limit is set 12-18 <br/><br/>An old ritual hand salute is mentioned but not performed / The old ritual hand salute is performed for Katniss <br/><br/>Each village actually carries out the lottery and sacrifice / A Capitol Representative conducts the lottery and the actual sacrificing takes place among the ""tributes"" in another location – allowing one winner.<br/><br/>By creating a reason why the Lottery and sacrificing must take place, Suzanne Collins has simply expanded on an already existing story. Yes it is rather creative and entertaining but she should give credit where credit is due. I'm just surprised no one else has caught on to it!"
"riz_94","1","5","7","20 September 2012"," Whole film is just flawed...

I think Suzanne Collins and the filmmakers are actually mentally sick if they think this is something people would enjoy.

"thetruth45","3","5","7","9 September 2012"," Terrible
","How in the world was this movie so widely praised? This movie sucks. The acting is terrible, the idea is really not even that creative or original, and the storytelling is beyond awful.<br/><br/>I didn't read the book and I feel like you had to read the books in order to understand this movie. For example, the movie does absolutely nothing to explain why these hunger games are being carried out. This movie does nothing to explain who each of the characters are. This movie continually mentions the importance of sponsors and the importance of achieving a high fight rank/score, yet there is absolutely no explanation given as to what the sponsors or what the fight rank do. This movie does nothing to really do much of anything in filling us in on what we're watching.<br/><br/>The quality of the sets, special effects, and costumes was bordering on embarrassing. I felt like I was watching a Star Trek episode where Jean Luc Picard goes down to one of the alien planets and interacts with various people. Other comparable quality comparisons: Xena Warrior Princess, Power Rangers, and Smallville. In other words, the movie looked like it was using television special effects, set designs, and costumes.<br/><br/>There is one scene where the lead is being driven in on a chariot with fire and everyone is freaking out. That was the cheesiest/weakest fire chariots I could imagine. It was almost like the producers were presented with this sort of choice: Option 1, Bad ass, real-looking fire chariot, or Option 2, pretty sweet fire chariot, or Option 3, awful/terrible chariot but we'll save some money...and the producers go, ""We'll take option 3"" This sums up the entire movie--> it looks and feels cheap and like the producers were trying to make this for the lowest possible amount of money.<br/><br/>Other bad parts of the movie: (1) The love story: they try to force a love story between the two leads yet I found myself being disgusted by the love story because the lead character is cheating on her at-home boyfriend. Lame. It make me hate both of the leads. Also the chemistry between these two was like a lukewarm bowl of unsalted Matzo ball soup; the romance was totally forced and was like a piece of cardboard; (2) the length--> this is a two-and-a-half-hour movie and it didn't need to be longer than an hour and a half. Nothing happened...the scenes were long and drawn out for no reason; (3)the fighting--> beyond cheap...no sense of darkness, no sense of aloneness, no sense of desperation. The movie was too DisneyLike, totally killed the realism and reality of what it would be like to fight in a death match; (4) the fact that the game makers changed the rules to create suspense and then changed the rules back to create more suspense. Yet, no suspense was created. The decisions were done within seconds and there was no emotion freak out by the actors...it was just a matter of, ""oh okay so we have to kill each other, well we don't want to so we'll kill ourselves."" and then the game warden jumps in.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie was sloppy, poor executed, had terrible acting, and was essentially a failure at every single point of the movie. This movie just goes to show you that talent/skill are not required to make it big in show business."

Even stupid people think their right sometimes.<br/><br/>The actions scenes were too sporadic (scattered), too jerky/fast and way too dark where you could hardly tell what was actually going on.

","The Hunger Games was a very poor adaptation of an excellent young adult novel. Too many crucial plot elements were short cut or skipped entirely to make the movie a coherent representation. Most importantly, you don't understand WHY the districts hold still for having their children taken to the arena to be murdered, as the thirteenth district and its fate are skipped over, as it the detail that film of the rubble of 13 is shown every year at reaping. That is but one of the plot holes big enough to drive a train through that has been left in the adaptation from source material to film.<br/><br/>No time is devoted to the strong character development that the author included in her books. The characters on the screen are one dimensional shadows of the characters you got to know in the book, in particular, Peeta, who is far more nuanced than the marshmallow fluff boy they turn him into on screen, and Katniss, who is not represented particularly well physically by Jennifer Lawrence, nor played with the toughness and emotional damage present in the original written form of the character.<br/><br/>Important plot and character development that occurred on the train trip to the Capitol and during training was completely skipped over, and Katniss' prep team was practically non-existent in the film, as was the Avox. Considering the importance these characters will come to play, this lapse is a major flaw. Katniss and Peeta's reactions and relationship to the luscious and plentiful food is completely gone from the movie version, as is any real indications of the pinching hunger of the districts. An important scene that should have happened on the rooftop happens indoors, leaving us without explanation of the ""bounceback"" force field that again going to be a major flaw going forward in the series. It is really not possible to list completely the important information that they missed conveying to the audience in this film.<br/><br/>Katniss' exciting scene in which she gains the attention of the game maker and sponsors with her bow skills and cheek in shooting at them actually manages to come across as very boring, and with absolutely no pop at all on screen. I'm not sure how it was possible to make what should have been one of the most dramatic scenes in the movie fall so completely flat.<br/><br/>Good attention was spent on getting the backgrounds of District 12 and the Arena correct, but the Capitol, which came off as bland and gray, completely at odds with its portrayal in the original material.<br/><br/>I would have rated this movie even lower if it hadn't been for two standout performances, that must be particularly praised considering the poor script they had to work with, and the overall quality of the rest of the film. One is that of Stanly Tucci, who was pure perfection as Caesar Flickerman, and the other is Woody Harrelson as the cranky, sodden Haymitch Abernathy.<br/><br/>To wrap up how I felt about this movie in a few words, it was a poor adaptation, poorly cast, unsatisfying, and I'm extremely unlikely to bother going to see any more of the series."

In response to A) - I haven't read the books. I have nothing against them, they just haven't appealed to me but anything that gets teenagers reading is a-okay in my opinion. In response to B) - No. It's nothing like Battle Royale. Other than ""a bunch of kids kill each other"" there is literally nothing linking the brilliantly satirical, brutal, intelligent and groundbreaking Battle Royale with the half-hour nothingness that is The Hunger Games.<br/><br/>It's over two hours long and NOTHING happens in this movie. The director chose to focus entirely on the most boring character available as she passively refuses to do anything at all. If I remember correctly, she hates apples and is always trying to kill apples but other than that, she does nothing throughout the entire movie. It's not really her fault though, she isn't given a reason to do anything.<br/><br/>The movie's called The Hunger Games but she doesn't look particularly hungry. Nobody does. There is a totalitarian-lite government that forces teenagers to fight to the death, but in one scene, a bunch of supposedly starving miners decide to revolt and utterly destroy the soldiers that are meant to be keeping them in check. There is no reason for anyone to do anything in this movie. Nothing is explained, no motivations are presented and the section of the audience that hasn't read the books is left without any explanation as to why ANYTHING is happening at all.<br/><br/>It's a badly told story. Every character is forgettable and interchangeable. The CGI sucks balls and the subplot in which the games are to be ""rigged"" to ensure forgettable jerkwad A wins as opposed to forgettable jerkwad B feels tacked on and irrelevant.<br/><br/>I'm sure the answers to all my questions lie within the books, but if that's the ONLY way I can find out what's going on then I will read the books - which makes the actual film itself pointless and irrelevant. <br/><br/>Garbage."
"dreyblackmagic","2","6","9","20 March 2013"," Im gonna take 4 reviews and put them together to make my point. And there's about 470 bad reviews.
","First by me, the book cover would've made a better movie. I would rather go spend 15 dollars to sit in a theater and look at the book cover for 2hrs. The movie left a lot to be desired and did not do the book justice. Character development in the movie was weak and if a viewer has not read the book, the characters and their relationships with each other is shallow and confusing. This confusion is clear when reading reviews by people who admit to not reading the books. In particular the relationship between Catniss and her family needs to be expanded upon and built upon so we can understand the relationship between Rue and Catniss and the tragedy of the circumstances they are put into. The relationship between Peeta and Catniss is also confusing and shallow, sanitizing the internal conflict felt by them. And finally we get to Haymitch, who is a shadow of the character he was in the book. Having read the books numerous times, the movie is lacking is so many ways. Scenes were redacted which I understand you have to keep the film lengthen under consideration but do not add scenes that have no mention or relevance into the movie. Also, the time lines are important in this film. You are building up to something. When you leave so much out how do you have that reference for later films. You do not get to connect with Katniss and Peeta in the film like you do in the books. I blame the SIGNIFICANT shortening of the cave scenes. The whole last 30 minutes of the film was horrible. Adding the extra fighting in the last scene did not add any value but took away from the film. Had the last Cornucopia scene been left as originally written, it would have made for a much more dramatic conclusion and wrap of the film. This movie was absolutely horrible. No story, plot, character depth or development. Most of the actors looked as though they already knew the movie was bad and just phoned in their performances. Gary Ross should never be allowed to direct anything ever again. The camera work was so horrible I suffered dizziness and nausea through the entire film. Barely anything was explained in the movie, so if you never read the book, you were kept completely in the dark about what was supposed to be going on. Gary Ross only knows how to do 2 shots. Extreme unfocused closeup, and extreme focused closeup. All of the backdrops and costumes were completely wasted since you could never see a whole person. You were only allowed to see someone's eye here, or mouth there. The most baffling thing about this movie are all of the good reviews I see from the critics. But that just goes to show you that they are never right when it comes to judging a movie. This was the second movie I have ever walked out on (the first being Battlefield Earth) and demanded my money back. As long as teenage girls dominate the box office, we will be forced to see shallow, superficial, emotionless drivel. The movie was very superficial. Glossed over the backstory and pretty much all of the relationships in a rush to get to the games. Then much of the tension of the games was missing, too. Not sure I would have been able to follow if I hadn't read the book. Add the ""Blair Witch"" camera work, and the whole experience was disappointing."
"mitchmcc","3","6","9","6 November 2012"," a mess
","I wanted to like this movie, after having read about it being about resistance to a tyrannical government. After watching it, I can only assume this is one of those movies where if you have not read the book, it will not make sense.<br/><br/>Two examples.<br/><br/>1. The relationship between Katniss and the first boy we see, and her more intense relationship with her fellow tribute. Clearly both are in love with her, but there is no real resolution of what her feelings for them are. Not good movie-making.<br/><br/>2. There is, of course, one scene which appears to show some sort of uprising in her district, but it is very vague how it starts (because of the hand sign?) and there is no follow up or discussion of what it means and whether it is successful. In fact, not much is said at all about the exact nature of the government and whether people are chafing under it.<br/><br/>A final pet peeve. The idea that small girls like Rue and Katniss's sister would be pitted against some of the bloodthirsty tributes is simply ridiculous. And even the idea that Katniss could compete against them (without firearms) is a stupid Hollywood (liberal) wet-dream."
"amexspam","1","6","9","31 August 2012"," A Failed Attempt By The Director To Be Cutting-Edge
","Once again we have a director that instead of telling a story tries to show he is avant garde with quick cuts, extreme close-ups and hand-held cameras. The movie looks like one shot by a high schooler that just got their first camera. Back in the late '60s American filmmakers began to experiment. They adopted the use of the extreme close-ups, and in attempt to show they were ""fresh"" some would rapidly pan the camera from actor to actor, and quickly move from full frame to headshot and back. They were trying to show they were innovative, but what it really showed is they were bad directors, and by the early '70s this experiment had mercifully died out. Unfortunately, a quarter of a century later a trio of poor filmmakers resurrected this herky-jerky camera style with the Blair Witch Project, and ever since some bad directors have been copying this failed style of 50 years ago to show they are new and original. I wanted to like this movie. I liked Jennifer Lawrence in X Men, but because of bad filmmaking I couldn't watch her."

Also why are people saying this is really good when it really isn't! It is so rubbish!!! So don't even think of seeing this in the cinema. It is a waste of money!!!

","I was very disappointed with the movie. Having not read the books I do not know if the film follows the key moments in them. However my frustration grew more and more as the movie progressed as it was very illogical. For example the scene where the group had installed mines around and as it seemed under their food supplies. That seems ridiculous why would they place them in such way that if they blow up they would destroy the same thing they are protecting. Also when Katniss climbed a tree to escape the group why couldn't they just shoot her with an arrow - she didn't have much place to maneuver so it wouldn't seem as a difficult target. The film is filled with such moments. Furthermore the character development is really poor. The relationship between Katniss and Peeta came out of nowhere and Gale's appearance was pointless. The ending also did not seem legit. Overall a bad movie."

"bob the moo","Null","7","11","3 September 2012"," Surprisingly safe and sanitised – lacks the horror, satire and commentary it could and should have had
","There was a great deal of hype and fuss when The Hunger Games came out as a film and perhaps I should have known I was not target audience because up till then I had never heard of the book series (or indeed that a film was being made). Although with the usual hoopla that goes with any large film, quite a few critics I respect gave it surprisingly good reviews and I decided I would check it out at some point as it seemed to offer more than just a copy of Battle Royale for American teenagers. With all the fuss (and teenage audience) I was very happy to let it go by in the cinemas and instead I waited for the DVD.<br/><br/>The film offers a lot of potential and this potential is evident from the start because it sets out its stall to be many things. Firstly there is plenty of room for satire by virtue of this exaggerated futuristic world where this annual murder is presented as both entertainment and also as a way of punishing the masses and keeping them in their place while those with the power enjoy the best of life. Secondly there is the opportunity to draw the audience into being a viewer of this very thing and then confronting us with the horror of what it really means so that there is at least a part of us questioning what we're finding entertaining. I wasn't looking for this to be some incredibly dark film that spits out an audience full of self-loathing and introspection, but I did expect it to be intelligent and impacting on some level to make it stand out from being just a teen-friendly adventure story.<br/><br/>The film itself surprised me by falling far short of what it could have been and squandering or ignoring most of the things of the potential it had. In terms of the satire, it never convinced me of the world it had created – it seemed unnecessarily excessive and didn't have enough truth to it to make me believe. I got the impression that it wasn't particularly interested in making the world function as a real place either – just that it was on screen was enough. As a place for commentary or digs at real things, it wasn't that it picked easy targets or easy shots, it was more a matter of it not really having much interest in saying anything beyond a few very basic things. This is a problem not only because it wasted potential but also because the first hour or so of this film is entirely in this world.<br/><br/>The second hour is within the games itself and as such it does have dramatic moments as one would expect (it is after all, an expensive Hollywood thriller), however these are fewer than I would have liked and also a lot less impacting – I watched most of it with a removal that I shouldn't have had. The delivery of children violently murdering other is only horrifying in regards how sanitised and unhorrific it is. I wasn't looking for it to be really gory or to revel in the blood, but it certainly should not have been something that I watch without any reaction. This lack of horror (even just emotional horror) leaves the game as a rather hollow affair which eventually turns into a standard thriller where we root for the ""good"" kids over the ""bad"" kids, even though it would have been stronger to have not drawn that very easy line.<br/><br/>The performances are mostly solid even though the majority have little to work with. Lawrence is a good actress and she adds a weight to her character tat doesn't seem to come from anywhere but her. I liked her throughout – even terrible ""fire"" special effects seemed unable to make her look bad. The supporting cast aren't able to bring as much as her to the table – even though there are plenty of big names here. The majority of the other children are carefully cast and given exits from the story that befits the easy-road approach to the plot.<br/><br/>I wasn't sure what to expect from this film but I was surprised to find that the words sanitised, safe and standard were the ones that kept going through my mind considering I was watching a globally successful satire that uses the murder of children by other children as its core plot. As it is The Hunger Games comes off as a lot of ideas that have been done better elsewhere and any teeth it may have had are all smoothed down and buffed into a consumer friendly product that will undoubtedly become a smash franchise – my only hope is that the next film can deliver some of its promise and not just churn out something as safe, generic and frankly unmemorable as this one."
"Mightyzebra","5","7","11","7 April 2012"," Mixed feelings about this sick film.
","Firstly, I watched this film without having read the book and only having a vague idea of the plot. So I was not expecting the film to be quite as sick and twisted as it was. The fact that so many kids have to die in the film is sad and wrong. I cried when I saw one (really REALLY nice) character die. Also, the beginning, when all the kids aged 12-18 are forced to come up to risk their lives in the Hunger Games (although only two from each Province are randomly picked), made me feel very angry with the government and upper class people in the film, who are in charge of the cruel operation of the Hunger Games.<br/><br/>I saw it with a group of friends, including my sibling. My sibling told his best friend, who was with us, the basic plot of the film before we watched it. After we had all watched ""The Hunger Games"", my sibling's best friend told said that he had thought his plot synopsis was a joke. He had thought the basic plot, (kids being picked to kill each other) was a joke! This goes to show that even tough kids will be shocked by the premise of this film.<br/><br/>So, yes, the film has its moments. Call me cheesy, but I did enjoy the romance scenes, probably because they were some of the few scenes in the film where people show any degree of humanity or feeling. I also thought the acting, the character development, the designs and the costumes were brilliant. But most of the film just turned my stomach as they were so inhumane, barbaric and irritating, because of this."
"rronk4","5","7","11","1 April 2012"," Serious Disappointment
","From the start of the movie to the end they never built a single character. The building of plot, characters and action are mediocre at best.<br/><br/>1.A friend in the beginning has no bearing on the movie whatsoever but he arrives and gives advice. 2. The training for the games is horrible, no other characters are built during this process. 3. Signals for deaths in the game are random at best and never consistent. The mine explosion from shooting the apples was laughable and would have caused a hearing loss yet she can hear Rues whisper but not the cannons??? 4. Once in the games they start and a lot are killed only to see a pack of five running together. Three of which run at the start but somehow get teamed up. 5. They change YEARS of tradition in one sentence in the middle of the games that gives other players a huge advantage as some are dead and would not have a partner left from their zone. 6. Sponsors for the game are never seen or announced yet she gets help form them only at the times to change the outcome of the game. 7. Mocking birds used as a signal for Rue are a joke. Many other sounds are happening why are the birds not changing to those sounds? 8. A Love story emerges with absolutely no building of that huge plot point in the movie. 9. She cannot hit a running deer though somehow is capable of hitting a bird in flight.<br/><br/>There is so much more to type but this is already long enough. I was very disappointed in this movie. Wait for the DVD it is not worth your money."
"The_Film_Cricket","Null","7","11","26 March 2012"," Entertaining . . . but wow is it unpleasant!
","The Hunger Games presents a dystopia of the future filled with oppression and despair that is not likely to surprise anyone familiar with those presented in The Terminator, Mad Max, Gattaca, Metropolis, The Running Man, or Logan's Run. Movies rarely look into the future and portray how high man can reach. More frequently they are about how our governments and our technology will someday destroy us or turn us into slaves.<br/><br/>Mankind's future in The Hunger Games is pretty bleak. The government has withered into an entity called Panem that is so brutal and so totalitarian that the populaces in separate districts are forced, once a year, to give up a tribute to a vicious nationwide contest of kill or be killed. The names of the combatants, one girl and one boy that range in age from 12 to 18, are chosen – rather cold-heartedly - by names drawn out of a fishbowl.<br/><br/>The game is essentially a bloody government-run reality television program in which mass audiences watch 24 young people sent out in to the woods with whatever resources they can get their hands on and try to kill each other. Twenty-three contestants will never go home again. Our heroic focus falls on a pretty 16 year-old teenager, and convenient survivalist, named Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence), whose skills at the games are telegraphed from the moment we get information that she can shoot a squirrel in the eye with a bow and arrow. At the selection process called ""The Reaping"" (where the names are drawn), Katniss volunteers to take the place of her 12 year-old sister Prim (Willow Shields) whose name is initially drawn. Personally, I think it would have been much more suspenseful to follow someone less equipped for the games, but they didn't ask me.<br/><br/>The games are rather unpleasant. They involve teens running around a wooded area dispatching each other with swords, knives, arrows, anything they can, any way they can. The obvious question of fairness never comes up as to how a small 12 year-old girl is expected to do battle with a large 18 year-old boy. That question certainly never comes up from the nationwide audience who stands captivated in front of large screens that broadcast the event. These are meant to simultaneously entertain and to punish the population for the uprisings of the past. Not much information is given about what happens to the winner of this contest but I have a feeling that a rash of psychologists will be needed but never provided. Nor is there ever any voice from the outside to question these events. We see the audiences ravenous over the spectacle but never a reaction from anyone over the death of one of the contestants, except one that incites a very brief riot in one of the districts.<br/><br/>The Hunger Games is based on the phenomenally successful teen book by Suzanne Collins, which I've read and I had fundamental problems with both. I enjoyed them as entertainment, I was somewhat disturbed by its moral implications. When the contestants step off their starting pads and into the game, some are required to hack at one another with swords and knives. That image is disturbing and so are images of a girl eaten alive by wasps, a boy eaten alive by dogs, and one kid who has his neck snapped as punishment for his incompetence.<br/><br/>What works in The Hunger Games are the outward elements. The look of the film, especially the totalitarian Capitol from which the games are presented, has the look and scope of a vast landscape of the future. The interiors are intricately decorated down to the last detail so that we really feel as if we are peeking into the future. I was especially impressed with one effect involving something called ""synthetic flames"" that creates one dazzling special effect. I won't spoil it for you.<br/><br/>The cast is loaded with reliable actors – good ones – starting with Elizabeth Banks as the nauseatingly chipper Capitol emissary; Woody Harrelson as a drunken former Hunger Games champion; Donald Sutherland as the pompous president; Wes Bentley as the games-keeper whose look seems borrowed from Satan; Lenny Kravitz as Katniss' stylist; and Stanley Tucci as the game's purple-haired host. At the film's the center is Jennifer Lawrence who brings a lot of her Oscar nominated character Ree Dolly from Winter's Bone to this film. She has a focused gaze and a solid screen presence. She anchors the film, and her casting in this role was a masterstroke.<br/><br/>Director Gary Ross, whose work I have admired – he directed the Seabiscuit and Pleasantville – takes his first foray into action. The problem is that his action scenes are often confusing and disorganized. Two people roll on the ground fighting and the camera whips around and draws in so close that we can't tell we are looking at. Problematic as well is his insistence on the use of shaky-cam. The opening scenes employ the shaky-cam technique in an effort to establish a visual disorientation, but for me felt more like a distraction.<br/><br/>Those problems aside, I have to say that this is a very entertaining movie. My problem in reviewing this film is because I know I am watching three chapter story. Some elements are presented and never examined leaving me to wonder if they will be picked up in the subsequent installments. The film ends on an arbitrary note that should have come packaged with a note that it is ""to be continued"" so as to give viewers unfamiliar with the books a little more orientation.<br/><br/>Here, I find it to be a very entertaining film that I had extreme reservations about. I wish the film had expressed more that there are other parts of the story that are going to follow. Maybe when we get to Catching Fire next year some of the unexplained elements of this film will come to light."

","An unfortunate catalyst that propelled the trend of teenage protagonist led book adaptations, of dystopian futures. Divergent and Maze Runner followed, both failing to complete their respective stories. Perhaps that has tainted the memory of a satisfactory film, undefinable by genre.<br/><br/>It's easy to forget that way back in 2012 this was fresh and new, tonally dark cinema, aiming for the teenage demographic. Perhaps that's a large reason for the success of the franchise, it was new and interesting, everything since has just been a rehash, located in a different world.<br/><br/>Refreshingly dark and mature, visually graphic, The Hunger Games has a lot going for it, as a visual spectacle, not so much as an immersive and compelling story. Narratively it meanders, without intent, there's a station to arrive at but not the train track to get there. Tonally gloomy at times, balance is hard to find. Switches in mood make the texture of the atmosphere uneven, because changes are jarring and misplaced. The edit failed to maximise the potential seeping throughout. Scenes are drawn out and end on odd notes, something that could've been tightened up in post-production. Additionally more cuts to and through between the Games and the world at present would've helped to increase tension while the story pondered, the scale and public reaction isn't documented anywhere near enough, if at all. Personally I feel the editing really trips this film up, it's quite easily 10-15 minutes too long, feeling even longer due to the fact of how much sitting around there is.<br/><br/>Stretched so far it's see through, the ending is blatant from the get go, meaning there's not much to keep you interested after the half hour mark.<br/><br/>Gary Ross shows wonderful craft and delicacy when concerning the dark themes of oppressed society, life without choice and just how bleak living in a dictatorship is. In the first act he manages to craft a tone and atmosphere that reeks of desperation, fear, the empty void of hopelessness and life without control. Yet he lifts the mood with the slightest and smallest of scenes between Kat and Gale, serving as a reminder of humanity's ability to dream and aspire for a better world. Each shot set in District 12 is delightful, sombre chills run through every vein as you are enraptured in fear and anxiety. The build up to and throughout the reaping is tense and nauseating, interactions with Kat and her sister are filmed so preciously. Sound is well utilised through the overdrawn run-time, music is allowed to overrun and dominate, drowning out the world perfectly and symbolically. An example that comes to mind concerning the sound is when Kat offers herself up, her screaming juxtaposed against the silence sets her out from the rest, nailing her on as the protagonist we will all route for. Selfless.<br/><br/>This was Jennifer Lawrence's big break in the public eye, she left a good impression. Portrayed with care, Katniss is delicately played when is necessary but can easily surge with passion when needed. Reminiscent of an indie film portrayal, Jennifer showcases her range and hits all the marks, and you, in all the right places.<br/><br/>Hunger Games starts off brilliantly, it's exhilarating and tense, filled with subtlety. Has a terrific lead performance that powers you through. It's weighed down by an underwhelming narrative, that's evened out with an enjoyable character arc. Sadly it gets wrapped up in it itself, losing its awareness of how sick a situation this is, and rather than point it out, chooses to accept the societal issues, it so cleverly addressed in the beginning. We then drift and chunder toward the inevitable ending.<br/><br/>Nevertheless I'd quite happily re-watch the first act, but would have no qualms with skipping the rest.<br/><br/>It's a solid piece of film-making."

In addition to having to kill the other contestants off Katniss must survive in the wild and ally herself with the other contestants such as Rue(Amandla Stenberg) And Peeta(Josh Hutcherson) for a greater chance of winning.<br/><br/>What I like about this movie are the actors, cinematography, pacing and action. I think it's well done. The scene where Katniss has to survive a wildfire and later on detonate her rivals food supply was cool. My biggest gripe is that they shot some of the scenes differently than I felt they should've. The scene where the contestants start after the countdown could've been more epic. There could've been music instead of silence as well as more shots of the kids fighting each other more.<br/><br/>That's just a nitpick though. For what it is I think it's a great movie. Jennifer Lawrence And Josh Hutcherson are great as the leads. If you get the chance see for yourself."

"theresamgill","8","2","2","12 June 2018"," A solid book-to-screen adaptation
","Let's start with a positive: This cast is star-studded. Now, that doesn't necessarily mean the stars do a good job, but it's a start-- and luckily for us, they do a tremendous job. Jennifer Lawrence enters the celebrity life coming out of her role as Mystique from X-Men, and perhaps for another time to discuss, I hate that character. With that said, she was also coming from an Oscar nomination for Winter's Bone-- a lifeless film that nobody need bother to see unless you're just compelled enough for the one bright spot of the film which is her performance. And Jenny from the block is handed the role of Katniss Everdeen, a persistent heroine sure to have inspired girls everywhere. Needless to say, she had big shoes to fill, for everybody would be judging whether she fit the mold of the character envisioned from the book. And emphatically I will tell you that she succeeds. You root for the gender role breaking Katniss at every step. Perhaps even more impressive than Lawrence are the people she is surrounded by. The unrestrained costume designs for the Capitol work so well with Stanley Tucci and Elizabeth Bank's characters. But easily my favorites are the hilarious Woody Harrelson and Wes Bentley's beard.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Undoubtedly, you guys know the basis for The Hunger Games. Even so, it is important to at least talk about the structure. There are two distinct halves in the film: the ceremonies before the Games, and the Games themselves. And in the off chance that you have no idea what The Hunger Games is, I shall briefly clarify. A future dystopia consists of 12 districts. In order to keep the threats of revolt at ease, fear is struck by an event known as the Hunger Games that takes place annually. Everybody ages 12-18 have their names put in to be drawn at random with two tributes from the 12 districts, a male and female. And for those of you counting at home, that's 24 tributes every year.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Katniss lives in District 12 with her sister and mother. This district is mineral based, and thus, also hard-working and poor. To the credit of the film, lots of this can be inferred through visual context instead of pointless exposition. The film is 140 minutes, and even though I think that could have been reduced through some cuts, it reminds me of what happened with Jurassic Park. Just like author Suzanne Collins, Jurassic Park author Michael Crichton also had a hand in writing the screenplay for the film adaptation. And he explained what he did by saying that about 10% of the book made it to big screen, and this is simply because that's all that could be fit into it. Similarly, there's details I wished to have seen made it to the movie, but there's only so much that can be done. With all that they had, there's nothing huge that got excluded to cause any outrage.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Something becoming familiar ground is a love triangle in these dystopian teenage novels. And there's certainly glimpses of this in this film, but I'm glad we aren't swarmed by it (can't speak for the sequels). One of my negatives follows from this. I have been a fan of Josh Hutcherson, but to be a little hypocritical, he is not what one imagines as Peeta. The best way to describe his performance is just ""good,"" nothing more, and really nothing less. And completing the triangle is Katniss's childhood friend, Gale. And I'm not sure how much there is to think about for Katniss, for when I have the chance to pick either Josh Hutcherson or Liam Hemsworth, you know I'd take Liam any day... What, I'm getting off track? I do apologize.<br/><br/><br/><br/>As I said before, there are two halves to this film. And separately, they both work. And they are necessary together, but it is pacing that simply is designed better for a book. The ceremonies are fresh and entertaining, but it's a lot of build up for what will end up turning into another half of the film. And this again plays into my belief that ten minutes or so of run time could have been cut to flow everything better. In regards to the Games themselves, I think what was accomplished is pretty astounding. I was so curious how you transfer weeks of survival in the forest into an hour of action-packed fatal adventure. There's never a dull in the action, yet no scene is forced. And the brilliantly harrowing setup for Collins's plot is transferred to the screen by shaky cams that bring the audience to the arena while giving glimmers of wonderful nature in, ultimately, all that the Capitol and its citizens see, a reality show-like game. Gruesome? Absolutely. Stunning? Well, not on the same level of some beautiful films, but for the sake of compliments, yes, stunning.

","The Hunger Games, set in a future dytopian society where after a breakout of a rebellion, each year one boy and one girl from each district (there are twelve districts) must enter the hunger games. Each contestant must fight till the death in a huge arena. The main character is Katniss Everdeen who shows strong character and sparks a light in the darkness. The Hunger Games is a movie with suspense and thrills as the hunger games is not the end. The plot is a broad idea with great actors and thrilling events. I recommend the movie to those seeking a movie that will have them on the edge of their seats.<br/><br/>""No...

"DomDomBom","4","2","2","22 August 2012"," Not HORRIBLE, just overly hyped
","I think it wasn't that bad, just overly hyped. I took my dad to see this film because I read the book and figured it would have pretty good action and enough intensity to keep me fascinated. Unfortunately, my dad dosed off towards the end of the movie and the parts he was awake he was still bored. I couldn't really complain since at some sections of the movie I was more interested in looking at the bored people around me (who seemed to wish -- much like my father and I -- they were watching Chronicle that was showing next door). Don't get me wrong, the movie had some good parts, it's just that they seemed to be overshadowed by the more lackluster ones. I read the books, and yes I know what you're thinking -- another teen aged girl who compared the book to the movie. I can't say I didn't because that would be a lie, but I can say that the only thing I really remember about the book is that some kids go into some stadium-like thing and battle against each other to live a better life with their family in the Capital and away from their more poverty-like homes...or something like that. My point is, I barely remembered what happened, but I did remember that it was a pretty good book. When I heard the reviews from critics they said that it was AMAZING so I figured it would be alright. User reviews on IMDb begged to differ, but I chose to ignore them because I was dead set on enjoying this movie. Sadly, I should have listened to them and saved $10. Maybe the movie just wasn't for me. I guess if there was another director maybe the intensity in the book would have been better conveyed... I don't know. I do know that I had to apologize to my father about seeing the movie (on a rainy day in the morning -- maybe that had been a sign?). He forgave me but since then he doesn't really trust me on movies like he used to. I will say that the actors did a pretty good job and the movie wasn't HORRIBLE...it's just something I wish could have been better, or at least as great as they said it would be. Oh, well. You take what you get, I guess."

VERY slow moving, transparent plot and resolution, I just couldn't wait for it to be over. I actually got up and grabbed some popcorn in the middle just to make the time pass (something that I NEVER do).<br/><br/>I haven't read the books, and I may someday, but after seeing this movie, it just feels like the books would be the kind that would be full of a bunch of useless adjectives; heavy on description but REALLY light on story.<br/><br/>I am the guy that gets emotional when they bring family members onto Survivor island (still ticked Christina and Tarzan didn't get to go on reward), and for me NOT to get emotional about this idea of children killing other children says something.<br/><br/>It's a bland story, forgettable characters and overdrawn script.

","The Hunger Games is ought to be the next big thing like Harry Potter, except it already started in a darker and more serious tone than any other young adult fantasy book films. The film did a good job executing its grit and thrills. Decent directing and amazing performances. The filmmakers did a fantastic job bringing Suzanne Collins' book to life. It's not the usual kind of blockbuster that focuses to its loudness. It's a film with moving drama and has its suspense.<br/><br/>It's pretty easy to understand everything about this story and its world. We get to know most of it and the entire film is intriguing and undeniably entertaining. The cast brings most of it to life. Jennifer Lawrence is simply fantastic as Katniss. Josh Hutcherson is okay but does not tie with Lawrence. Woody Harrelson, Elizabeth Banks, Wes Bentley, Donald Sutherland, and Stanley Tucci didn't get a lot of screen time but they were good to their roles.<br/><br/>The movie is great in suspense and drama. It doesn't have a lot of score which makes it moving and compelling. The moments of Katniss in the arena are stirring. Thrilling music score is a great effect to these sequences. Unlike our blockbusters these days, the film doesn't focus too much to the CGI and the explosions. There isn't really much explosions here. Surprisingly, the filmmakers aren't lazy to create a non-CGI set(except the chariots). There is, of course, still CGI here but not as excessive as our modern blockbusters. The action is pretty good with the shaky camera. It's nicely shot gives enough momentum and excitement. Most people complain to that though. Lastly, the production design is beyond decent.<br/><br/>The Hunger Games is thrilling and solid enough. Decent filmmaking made it spectacular. It's amazing and intriguing enough to start a big series. It succeeds to become a solid and one and not a lackluster like Twilight or I Am Number Four. I don't know what else to say about it, but it's silent, gritty, and compelling."

"texanvkg","7","19","41","23 March 2012"," Enjoyable but very flawed
","Overall it is great to see the novel brought to life on the big-screen. First of all, kudos to the actors - each does a marvelous job with their roles. Harrelson, Lawrence, Hutchinson, Tucci, Banks and the rest of the cast - they all nail their characters and do them honor.<br/><br/>The heart of the story is intact, unfortunately there are many significant elements from the novel entirely missing, or changed to the point they lose the depth of meaning they were intended to have. Unlike some of the sub-plot and story elements left out of the Potter and LOTR series, these missing and adulterated items matter greatly, and lessen the quality of the movie. I will give the producers credit for building Seneca Crane's role in an effective way that answers many questions for those that have not read the books.<br/><br/>Finally - production values. You will suffer significant eyestrain after 2.5 hours of glaring close-ups. All of the action is shot so close and is so muddled it is almost impossible to determine what is happening. The chariot display is shown either to close or too far away, and in both cases so fast that the impact of the glorious entrance and introduction of the tributes is lost. The CG shots (thankfully there are few of them) look like leftovers from a Syfy channel production. This may be the worst big-budget production to hit the big screen in years. Although Ross worked well with the actors, he did not handle the action epic elements well at all. The cinematography is atrocious and the whole production looks cheap.<br/><br/>You will enjoy the movie, but you will also wish for the grand and respectful care-taking that was given the Potter and Lord of the Rings franchises."

I was left hanging when the games started, and even though the beginning was a little slow, it was very nice to see how Katniss changes throughout and how once quiet, now brave and strong. Jennifer Lawrence, Josh Hutcherson, Lenny Kravitz, Woody Harleson, Willow Shields, Liam Hensworth, Elizabeth Banks, Issabele Furman, Alexander Ludwig and the rest of the cast did an amazing job.

","no spoilers here just my opinion...Â… The movie was not bad just well the best way I could put it is lame. The main character played by Lawrance was the best part of this movie she was smart cool and all around bad ass she was believable aside from when they tried to make here seem like she cared about her (not really a spoiler) love interest Peeta played by some dude. That brings me to my next point Peeta this is the ""love interest"" in the movie along with the not so love interest/might be a love interest later character Gail. I haven't read the books I suppose I should have said this earlier but it seems in this movie there going for the team Edward/Jacob thing with Peeta and Gail this is lame because there is no competition for one Gail is far more attractive and way cool in my opinion were as Peeta as portrayed in the movie is well lame he doesn't seem cool he never seems strong or funny or anything he seemed like an after thought you don't really care for him or hope he falls in love with her or anything you felt more for some of the side characters that they only showed for a few minutes than you did for him. Lastly the way they made the capitol people look was super again yes lame they all had weird costumes on they could have done so much with this you didn't really hate them or like them or feel anything for them they were just there looking ridiculous. The final thing I will say is this movie should have been R and I'm not one of those people that are like it would have been better if I would have saw some kids heads cut off but the camera work sucked because of this so that they could kinda show you what happened without showing you what happened and they obviously only did it to make more money with a pg 13 rating by the way don't bring any children under the age of 14 I would say unless you want them to see some children kinda get slaughtered............ <br/><br/>this is my first review and just my opinion I'm sorry for poor punctuation or what ever I don't really care. the movie wasn't bad it just wasn't all that good either."
"davidjanuzbrown","10","15","31","20 August 2012"," Modern Classic
","""The Hunger Games"" is a film that I seem to have a higher opinion of than many people here. As a film buff (Particularly in the action and gangster genres), I am very familiar with quality chase films like ""Bullett"", ""North By Northwest"" and ""Westworld"" so I know a great chase when I see one. I really believe ""The Hunger Games"" is a modern classic that is well worth seeing. There are two things that really stand out to me. 1: Although the film (As well as the books, (That I did not read)), are targeted towards young adults, there are plenty of things in there (Fictional and non-fictional), that are very familiar to adults (Of which I am one). The fictional elements include: William Tell (The shooting of the apple in the pig's mouth), ""The Running Man"" (More on this later), ""The Most Dangerous Game"" (Particularly the scenes of Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence), having to live off the land and the sicking of dogs on her), ""The Lottery"" (The Shirley Jackson story is an obvious inspiration to the choosing of people from the various Districts to compete in ""The Hunger Games"", since with the exception of the overall winner, ""Winning"" the lottery is a negative,""Total Drama Island"" and Greek Mythology. The Non-Fiction parts include: Joan of Arc (Katniss), Christ, ""Survivor"", The Olympic Games, Ancient Rome, France at the time of Marie Antoinette and Louis XVI (Check out the costumes and gardens ""I remember seeing them in Mel Brooks ""History of The World Part I"")), and Nazi Germany. The other thing that stands out is the character of Katniss. There is a quote by Shakespeare: "" Be not afraid of greatness: some are born great, some achieve greatness, and some have greatness thrust upon them."" (12th Night). Katniss was born great (Unlike a lot of other teen heroes such as Peter Parker (Spiderman), or The ""Karate Kid"" who fit into those achievement or thrusting categories). Spoilers: If you go right to the beginning of the film, where she sneaks into another District to hunt, and where she becomes the 1st person in the 74 year History of ""The Hunger Games"" to volunteer after her sister Primrose (Willow Shields) was selected, you know she is someone to be reckoned with. As you learn about her, you see even more how special she is. For example: When she shot the apple in the mouth of a pig, when ""Judges"" were having a party and not paying attention to her (She got the highest grade (11 out of 12) from the judges), and when Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson), her co-competitor from District 12, says: ""My family said, we may finally having a winner from District 12, and it is not me, it is you."" Check out this great line from evil President Snow (Donald Sutherland):"" There are lots of underdogs in this world,"" he snaps, ""if you could really see them, you would not root for them either."" (He knew she was dangerous, and a threat to the state). A much different scenario then with Ben Richards (Arnold Schwarzenegger) in ""The Running Man."" (A film that had similar themes (A futuristic TV competition involving an innocent person and an oppressive government). Think about that: Arnie not considered as dangerous as a 16 year old girl? Well if you saw both films, you would know that Katniss had more obstacles to overcome then Ben ever did. Finally the scene with the flowers where she places them over Portia (Latarsha Rose) the little plant girl who saved her life, followed by the ""Love Sign"", shows compassion and decency, and the way she pays attention and learns things extremely quickly goes beyond what would expected from a 16th year old of her background (Which is in extreme poverty, and probably without an education). This is an extremely easy character to like, and to root for, and coupled with an intelligent script and lots of action, makes for a modern classic. 10/10 stars."

My grand-daughters 10 and 12 said that ""Hunger Games"" is what they wanted to see during Spring break. They have both read the book. They both liked the movie, but I feel that the theme of this movie is better for older teens and adults.<br/><br/>As for the acting, okay, but not outstanding.<br/><br/>I agree that the shaky hand-held camera is a terrible effect. I don't know who started the trend, but remember that Steven Spielberg used that technique in ""Saving Private Ryan"" and I did not like it then or any of the following movies I have seen where it is used The most recent James Bond movie was perhaps the worst for this technique."

"markdroulston","8","16","34","23 March 2012"," Family-friendly nastiness!
","When a massive movie franchise comes to a close, often a hole can develop in the highly competitive market of Hollywood blockbuster filmmaking. Perhaps never before has that hole been as large as the abyss left by the HARRY POTTER series, given the rapid release schedule of those films. It's 2012, and there's no new POTTER. Some might argue that the TWILIGHT series fills the void, yet not only is that franchise little more than a punchline to all but the hardcore fans, it too is set to (hopefully) wrap up this year. Enter THE HUNGER GAMES, seemingly a sure thing based on the POTTER formula: hugely successful series of young adult novels? Check. Talented cast of young leads and respected character actors as support? Naturally. Large scale production and, crucially, marketing budget? You bet. So is THE HUNGER GAMES worthy of taking up the POTTER mantle?<br/><br/>Amazingly, it might be even better.<br/><br/>While no-one would suggest that THE HUNGER GAMES is the most original new property coming from the Hollywood machine, Lionsgate and director Gary Ross adapt Suzanne Collins' source material in just the right ways, jettisoning un-cinematic elements and focusing on the meat of the story right from the opening frame. Rather than build the world of Panem through tedious exposition and backstory, Ross instead drops us directly into the grim life of Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) and her journey to the Hunger Games, a perverse spectacle inflicted annually on 24 unfortunate teens. While the POTTER series certainly headed in a darker direction as it went on, THE HUNGER GAMES is horrifically bleak right from the get go, and Ross' decision to show instead of tell, through the use of wonderfully expressive, fluid camera-work, paints an ugly picture indeed. There are so many refreshing elements at work here, with an active, independent, and strong female protagonist and a startling absence of overblown CGI, but it's the nastiness that makes this film unique. Delivering a family appropriate experience while retaining the majority of the violence and unpleasantness of the novel is a delicate proposition which Ross mostly pulls off, but one can't help wondering about the potential for a much harder, R-rated cut of the film. It's an understandable issue to be sure, but an issue nonetheless.<br/><br/>Where THE HUNGER GAMES perhaps doesn't fare so well is in the internal strife faced by Katniss, particularly in regards to potential love interests Gale (Liam Hemsworth) and Peeta (Josh Hutcherson). Collins' novel has much more freedom to explore, and even dwell on, Katniss' emotional state through inner monologue, but given the nature of film, particularly a mainstream blockbuster such as this, much less room is left for introspection, and some of the character dynamics and relationships suffer in comparison. Katniss' independence is unfortunately undercut by the franchise building mentality of the film, setting up an inevitable love triangle to be explored in two potential sequels. That said, she's still a much more positive, appropriate female role model than TWILIGHT's limp and passive Bella Swan, or indeed any young female character in recent memory. THE HUNGER GAMES is an important film at many levels, one which heralds the birth of the next big Hollywood franchise, and if the quality of the first installment is maintained then the sequels can't come soon enough.<br/><br/>tinribs27.wordpress.com"
"MartinHafer","8","12","24","27 May 2012"," I did NOT read the books and still enjoyed the film
","I should tell you right up front that I have never read ""The Hunter Games""--so this review is more for this group of folks than the die-hard book lovers. In many cases, I have no idea where the book and film differ and my expectations were quite different from my daughter--who has read the series. However, one this that DID bother me is that despite the film's title, no one appeared to be all that hungry in the film and the way food was used to manipulate and control the masses was not explained well. The only way I knew this was that my daughter sat next to me and explained this (and it helps that we both know sign language). But apart from that and the god-awful 'shaky cam"" (one of the WORST inventions in the history of filmmaking), the film was enjoyable and engrossing throughout. As I said, though, the shakiness of the film (especially at the beginning) was a problem--and I felt motion sick just watching the movie! The plot and movie have already been discussed in a bazillion reviews. The film has already been out about 45 days when I saw it tonight, so I don't want to give a lengthy review. Instead, I'll talk about what I liked. Foremost, the acting was really, really nice. I cared about the characters I was supposed to care about and it tore my guts out when one of them was killed in the film--showing what a nice job they did and how well the director elicited the performances. I liked the story a lot--especially since I love dystopian sci-fi films. In many ways it was like combining the original ""Rollerball"" and, perhaps, ""Gladiator""! It was truly original and kept me riveted. All in all, a terrific film--well worth your time provided you don't mind the violence necessary to convey the story. However, despite the books being very popular with kids, I would think twice about bringing any kids younger than about 12 or 13.]"
"mfrost71w","2","6","10","31 July 2014"," Did I miss something? Or was it a really bad film?
","I seem to be in a tiny minority who found not a single redeeming thing in the film. Perhaps I'm too old, seeing as the film was obviously aimed at little kids, although I didn't get this from the publicity.<br/><br/>I haven't read the books but the story on film is a poor re-hash of 'Battle Royale' with elements from 'Lord of the Flies' and a huge steal from Stephen King's (Bachman's) 'The Long Walk', with a bit of the flavour of the movie version of King's 'Running Man' as well - derivative hogwash. I think I could even see themes lifted direct from 'Rollerball'. Certainly 'The Long Walk' explores exactly the same themes as Hunger Games but achieves them far better. Probably wouldn't have been an exciting film though, seeing as the youths merely have to walk at a set speed until only one is left. <br/><br/>The acting and direction were poor. The special effects were feeble. The storyline was predictable and obvious. Character development was so poor you cared nothing for the life or death of any of the characters, including the heroine and the little girl. The love story was emotionless and unbelievable. The fight scenes were flat and unexciting. The bad guys and the 'grown-ups' were cartoonish and one-dimensional. <br/><br/>Poverty and desperation in the 'village' was conveyed by giving everybody 1940's clothes and haircuts, for some reason I haven't worked out yet - except for the heroine who, although poor and starving, seemed to put on a very expensive designer Italian leather jacket to go out hunting. All very bizarre.<br/><br/>It has obviously given rise to 'The 100', which has a similar feel of a derivative teen-angst story taken from far better 'dystopian future' novels and is another failed project of poor quality in writing and acting"

","I have not read the books. I went in with an open mind curious about the hype and smash sales.<br/><br/>Halfway through the movie I found myself bored. Nothing had really happened at all. It was all young girl fantasy: ""I come from the poor oppressed area and I am special and I am self conscious and people are forcing me to kill people because I bravely volunteered to save my sister's life and I have cute boys and I get to wear cute dresses and I am the hope of the whole galaxy!"" <br/><br/>The futuristic society is yet another futuristic society that could never happen...and this is probably why the story does not translate well from book to screen. In a book one can create a cool future world where all the failures of the cool world are not seen. On screen in a visual context these failures become warts seen by many. <br/><br/>All the people in the capital (no other major cities or countries evidently exist) wear colorful clothes and makeup...and do nothing but await The Hunger Games all year? Who makes these clothes? How does capitalistic behavior work in this socialist society? The capital is immaculately clean...not a single wastebasket is in place...is there no trash ever generated? And with all the spectacle of this no one has ever seen clothing that acts like it is ""fire lit""? What...they kept the fabric in hiding waiting for the heroine? <br/><br/>The place where the Hunger Games takes place is a domed world where there is a perimeter...yet they must create a firestorm to send the girlie back from the perimeter? Why, won't she run into a wall? Beasties can be CGI made to appear in a forest and to kill people...but isn't that concept in violation of the idea of The Hunger Games of having the contestants kill each other?<br/><br/>There are too many convenience that are told (the idea of a foreshadow is to ""show""; not ""tell""). ""Show them you are strong; throw this"" means this will occur later. ""I learned camouflage icing cakes in my Mom's bakery;"" a bakery that exists in District 12 where people are so hungry they beg for bread in rainy streets. Then the camouflaged person immaculately fits in to the scenery with a perfect face meld with a muddy area...despite the person having been gashed with a sword (if he was so injured did they let him go? He was a wimp, the idea is to kill the other contestants so why not slaughter him then?) The camouflage is perfect...even though there is no mirror to help make the face lines match perfect. Way too convenient.<br/><br/>The bullet train is cool looking. The engineering behind it is farcical. When is maintenance done? You built a vehicle that runs 200 mph over angles hundreds of feet above a tree canopy...but no one in District 12 has any electronics...except they all get to see The Hunger Games on TV? <br/><br/>Comments have been made about the struggle to move the book to screenplay. I can see why."
"aletoledo","5","6","10","24 March 2012"," Why is it called the Hunger Games?
","I went with several people that never read the books and none of them understood why it was called the Hunger Games. Didn't the creators kinda miss this major point or did they plan on only fans watching the movie? I suppose no movie is going to meet up to the expectations of the fans of the book, but this was a pretty big oversight.<br/><br/>Filming at the beginning was horrible. It's that shaky type of filming they do in TV police dramas. You know the kind, where you get dizzy and have to look away. I'm not sure what they were thinking, but thankfully they stopped this about 1/3 of the way through. Maybe the shakiness was supposed to represent hunger? <br/><br/>The acting was good and what special effects there were turned out nice as well. The quintessential moment of fire was thankfully not a disappointment.<br/><br/>I think the problem is that they needed the movie to be 3 hours to really convey more of the book's essence. Still everyone that read the books will have to see this. If you didn't read the books, judging by the people that went with me that didn't, you probably can wait till it comes out on DVD."
"ocacia","1","15","32","9 April 2012"," Running Man (2012) Amoral and poor
","It is hard to know what is more sickening, a film about beautiful children killing one another, or a film which is a terrible spin on the Running Man, or the fact that so many people missed these two major issues when they rated it so high. It must be a sign of our time when we have moved beyond the already excessive violence of man vs. man to now target our children and involve them as part of that horrible violence. It must be a first because the worse of the worse, the most violent Rambo IV still have some basic boundaries about children. This film slashes all of that.<br/><br/>Now between the direct copy of running man, didn't read the book so cant comment on that, the bad timing (taking how long to arch into a story?),only to find no story, no characters, weak unbelievable people hunting one another, the utter predictability, the false and contrived Romeo and Juliet scene, (that cute African American was inserted for one purpose only, to generate empathy, It didn't because by then I was disconnected because of the excessive violence) what was good? Did could have at least let Lenny Kravitz do the theme song. no luck there. So even without my primary complaint the film is utter garbage in the script and directing department. It is also horrible in the music department. And the lowest score is in the morality department, excessively violent cruel and unusually. Listening to a young boy be ripped apart by CGI dogs. And what was the message? They ""surprisingly"" thwarted the system-- Like Running Man. The difference is nothing changed; it just had some awkward pointless ending that was almost like the script writers ran out of stem and just were trying to figure out how to bring up the end credits."

Even some bits were funny that I genuinely laughed.It was captivating from page one. I felt like the author wanted to grab and keep our attention which she did remarkably well.

"johnstrash1","2","5","8","17 February 2013"," A cute little girl is put into a survival situation and comes out on top.
","The title for this review is exactly what I thought when I first saw the poster for this movie before ever seeing it. Hollywood's predictability did not leave much to the imagination and it turns out I was dead on target. The plot basically centers around a female descendant of Rambo who is put into a modified version of the Running Man games, but with a twist. In this version kids brutally slaughter each other for the enjoyment of the masses – including you the movie goer. Now that's entertainment! <br/><br/>The story starts off in some bizarre post apocalyptic future where the powers that be hold an annual contest that pits children of various ages against one another in a battle to the death. Many of them are violently killed right at the beginning with several being viciously beaten to death by their larger opponents. But being in Hollywood's era of girl-power, our pretty little protagonist makes her escape, at which point the rest of the competitors should have just given up. And despite being in the wilds for at least several days, she manages to never look more than a little tired and maintains her fragile beauty as if she just stepped out of a shower and dressed in clean, but wet clothes.<br/><br/>But nonetheless this movie is a blockbuster, mostly because male viewers are aroused by the main character and female viewers actually think that she is somehow a realistic vision of what girls can do. And for these reasons, audiences will ignore the fact that they are watching a story - with a rating that allows any age to see it - about children killing children and never once wonder why society is so screwed up today.<br/><br/>On a final note, I have to wonder how IMDb has such a high rating for this movie considering the staggering amount of negative reviews that have been posted. Unfortunately, I think the rating system here has become somewhat compromised as it seems pretty easy for anyone to stack the votes early on."
"xhidden99","4","5","8","30 November 2012"," Drags on and on and on and on and on
","It's a trick to fill out a 2 1/2 hour movie of teenagers. And The Hunger Games has pulled it off. Every scene every shot is painfully longer than it needs be. And scenes repeat themselves often throughout the movie. Girl meets obstacle, girl stares longingly into the distance or into someone's eyes, girl moves on to next obstacle and so on. And on. And on. So other than an endless series of self contained scenes strung together doing little to move the plot along, it limps every onward, punctuated by brief flashes of the poor miserable people back home. And some kind of vague jealousy back story that's never fleshed out. As a side note I've read that the director was quite proud of his extreme and somewhat random use of shaky cam in order to impress the audience with the 'urgency' of the situation. There is nothing urgent with this movie. If you watch it, feel free to get up at any time and make a snack, go to the bathroom, have a smoke, whatever. You won't miss anything and when you return it will be like you never left."

Second of all, it is because many of the things in the movie can not be understood completely without knowing the background stories. I was really disappointed to see that they changed so much, not just removing plots from the book, but also adding happenings that wasn't even in the book to begin with, and which didn't make any sense at all. What a disappointment! <br/><br/>I'm not a director, nor do I have any knowledge when it comes to film making..but I do know what makes a good movie, and considering the emotions I got from reading the book, it could have been made in a much better way. The movie didn't get any of that at all. It was like watching a recap of a movie, I bet you could tell a lot of things were missing even if you hadn't read the book. Why not just make two great movies instead of just one really bad? That's how they make money in the film industry now anyways. Oh well.. I'm not bitter. Not at all.

As far as who they picked to play the characters though they did a great job. The acting in itself is great. It was just everyone I talked to that watched the movie that hadn't read the book 1st was lost. They cut out or changed things they shouldn't have that just left them confused and asking questions. I was hoping that the people doing these movies would have learned after how badly they had screwed up the twilight saga.

","I can not understand how this can be a source of entertainment. In my opinion, the story is about a hypothetical society that discriminates and disgust against other human beings. The people is delighted watching on TV a bloody, morbid and perverse competition, where innocent children are forced to kill each other, to survive just one of them. The children reflect very well on their faces, own innocence of a child and the panic of knowing what is going to happen. I guess to direct a film where getting children to convey the panic on their faces, or the pleasure of being the winner of a bloodily competence, killing another, should at least have caused some bad dream to the director"
"gerbierg","10","14","30","14 June 2012"," The Hunger Games
","""The Hunger Games"" is brilliant story told through the eyes of 16 year old Katniss Everdeen. It's also based on a series of books by author Suzanne Collins. In this action packed Katniss is an independent girl who tries her best to care for her young sister and unstable mother. When her young sister Prim is chosen to take part in the deadly ""Hunger Games"", a fight to the death for safety, riches, fame, and freedom Katniss decides to take Prim's place to fight for her sister. The film takes place in the country of Panem which is a post apocalyptic North America. The acting was great. The cinematography was good also. The film was dramatic but not too over the top. It really showed the struggle that the characters faced throughout the film.<br/><br/>The country of Panem was divided into 13 districts. After an uprising The Capitol decided to destroy District 13, leaving the country with only 12 Districts. As a way to remember the lives lost during the rebellion that took place decades earlier the Capitol started ""The Hunger Games"". Two people (1 boy, 1 girl) from each of the 12 districts that North America is divided into after the uprising have to fight to the death. Only one is left standing. Fighting for her life, Katniss competes with 23 other people, Katniss and Peeta are representatives of District 12. They come from a dark depressing District full of coal miners. Peeta and Katniss soon find themselves working together to eliminate the other players. Soon a friendship forms between them that could kill them or save them both.<br/><br/>An aspect of the film that I really enjoyed was the acting; I loved it. The chemistry between the characters was believable. When the characters didn't particularly like it each other it was convincing. The style of acting in the movie went well with the plot. It wasn't too dramatic and it also wasn't depressing. The actors knew how to act in that moment. I especially thought Jennifer Lawrence did great in her portrayal of Katniss. If you've ever read the books Katniss seems to not care about anyone except her young sister and Jennifer really showed that in the film. The way Jennifer acted when her character didn't like someone was very believable. Katniss isn't very emotional or friendly, which is another thing Jeniffer portrayed well. I also enjoyed Josh Hutcherson's portrayal of Peeta. I believed the emotions being portrayed by the character. I believed when he was in love, angry sad etc Overall every person did a great job portraying their characters. The style of acting was good also. It went well with the film. They did not act like they were bored as a way to convey sadness. The actors really conveyed the sadness the characters were supposed to feel. <br/><br/>I also loved the cinematography used in the film. I thought when the camera shook really went well with the moments it was apart of. It heightened the sense of restlessness, hopelessness and chaos. It stuck with the movies theme of sacrifice, hopelessness and the need people have to survive. I loved when this particular use of the camera was used during moments of running because it really immersed me in the film. It made you feel like you were apart of the moment. The use of that type of cinematography also went well with fighting scenes in the movie, it really heightened the chaos that was going on in the scene. It also made the scenes more dramatic which is a good thing in a movie like this. <br/><br/>Overall I really enjoyed the movie. I've already seen it like three times and I would definitely watch it again. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone under the age of 12 because they might not be able to handle violence, but I recommend this movie to anyone who likes action drama and a little romance. Also to anyone who has read the series of books. They really keep true to the story except for a few changes, but the movie was great without them. ""The Hunger Games"" is a great movie that brought tears to my eyes and kept me at the edge of my seat. I truly enjoyed it, and I hope that more people see it because it is a great movie."
"profweberd","5","8","15","6 April 2012"," I still can't figure out why the games are the HUNGER Games
","Was looking forward to this movie because the trailer suggested it was a mash-up of two of my favorite movie genres: the ""most-dangerous-game"" movie, in which a human being is forced into becoming the prey of a human being who loves to hunt (Surviving the Game, released in the mid-1990s, would be one such movie); and the ""last-man-standing"" movie, in which only one person is allowed to prevail in some sort of violent contest that starts out with at least a few participants. Examples of this would be the Death Race (2008) and The Running Man (1987).<br/><br/>The Hunger Games IS that mash-up, along with a mixture of other genres and well established themes or plot lines: the teen romance (too many to name!); the swords-and-sandals epic (from the cheesy late-1950s Steve Reeves movies, to Gladiator, released in about 2000); movies about teens going all violent when they leave civilization (Lord of the Flies); movies about teen who become older but wiser after surviving a violent world made by adults (True Grit); films that remind us that Mother Nature is not our friend, especially when it's beautiful but manufactured by humans; plus a dash of Red Dawn (remade, and due for release in 2012), Deliverance (1970s) and The Blue Lagoon.<br/><br/>But it's a messed-up mash-up.<br/><br/>I haven't read the books (I'm pushing sixty years old!) but I can imagine that if you have, you would know some of the missing pieces that the movie doesn't really clear up. Like: Why HUNGER games? and what exactly is the purpose of them? And, what's the deal with Katniss and Gale...and what's the sex appeal of Peeta, compared to Gale, who appears to have a personality? <br/><br/>The director has elected to include shot after shot after shot after shot that is in very close range despite being in a larger setting of expansive space (forest, Nuremberg-style stadium, etc.). If he was trying to do that to express claustrophobic pressure on a character, that's now a movie cliché...surely there is another way to communicate that kind of emotional state.<br/><br/>Many of those shots were made with a shaky hand-held style that, because of its overuse, can literally nauseate you. If the director says, ""Yes, I want my viewers to get nauseated,"" he is a complete...Well, let's leave it at he's not my kind of director. Too bad because he also directed Seabiscuit, which I like a great deal.<br/><br/>The viewer gets to know almost none of the characters except Katniss and, to a lesser extent, Peeta. Much of the preparation the Tributes complete could be handled in montages, not a multitude of scenes with dialog. The screen time thereby saved could have shown, just for example, one other district team's prep, to serve as good or evil counterpoint to the District 12 team's.<br/><br/>I would have liked to see more of the actual violence of the skirmishes among the tributes. I mentioned Gladiator in an earlier paragraph...that is in my opinion a good example of how primal violence can be handled effectively without overdoing it (well, until the final scenes)...another such example is Braveheart, although some of that does get a bit too graphic.<br/><br/>The basic premise of the movie is unsettling--that kids must kill kids for bloodsport, entertainment or by government orders. But no character really inspects or explores this awfulness...the nightmare of the situation doesn't itself become a source of reflection, anger or regret. It's the old saying of the one-ton elephant in the room that everyone pretends to ignore.<br/><br/>Final verdict: I don't recommend The Hunger Games...maybe wait for it on DVD or Blu Ray but don't rush to see it in theaters."
"soul_scion","6","8","15","25 March 2012"," The Hunger Games misses the mark - on so many accounts
","*SPOILERS ALERT* Dare I say it, this relatively passage film was extremely lazily adapted from the book. It took too long to 'get to the good stuff' and there were some other obvious flaws that have nothing to do with flaws from the book itself - it's all down to the film-makers.<br/><br/>I kind of guessed at this the moment the film opened and we see Game-Maker, Seneca Crane talking to blue haired presenter (played solidly well by Stanley Tucci) - and it became a continual problem - removing us out of Katniss's POV and the games and into the 'behind-the-scenes' world of the Capitol. UGH. It completely leached the strength of menace that an antagonist has - seeing Presi Snow chatting to Crane on various occasions, I sat there trying to fathom why this was in the narrative at all. It's like seeing the most bad ass robot and then they take you to see it nuts and bolts - or find it works on water. Lame.<br/><br/>Another issues were Peeta and Katniss - it wasn't good chemistry between Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson, but Josh came across stronger in his performance as the 'boy with the bread'. Which also brings me to the 'bread' scene - why is it raining and why wasn't it made clear that Katniss was literally starving to death with nothing to take to her family? (she never looked like she ever struggled to get food). The flashbacks were lazy and confusing. If we knew she was at the end of her tether, that moment would have been more significant and so to, their relationship. Instead, when it's time for Katniss to turn on the 'charm', it's not even obvious that she has turned on anything. And then we kept cutting to see Gale in District 12, it was clear the filmmakers had NO flair. The scenes with Rue were rushed and void of depth. And if they'd done the bread scene properly, we'd have known that Katniss does whatever it takes to survive - she's survived near death before - this is her trait, her winning element - not the bow and arrow. And she isn't shown to change or evolve - she is as she started. MINUS 20 POINTS!<br/><br/>And if that wasn't bad enough, we had some weird cutaways to blue haired presenter and the other dude, 'info dumping' but it felt like those commentary scenes in Dodgeball - I expected them to say there would be a 'Half time show'. (How else would they have given us the info, I hear you ask. Well, a 1 min montage showing Peeta and Katniss viewing the previous Hunger Games tapes and picking up on various booby traps and format the games take). Again, it wasn't well integrated into the character development of Katniss - how amazing would it have been if the filmmakers had shot it so that it's as if we're the viewers of the The Hunger Games, not the viewers watching the viewers watching the games. Make sense? Then the Capitol would have come across as this unreachable, unseeable terrible master - and there would have been more suspense when the crazy dogs come, or whenever anything was 'dropped' into the world. Adaptation rule - keep it contained! And heck, if you want to break from Katniss's POV, why don't we get some of Peeta's POV? Furthermore, how the film portrayed the Capitol and its citizens was lacking. There was less impact of the 'us and them' mentality. Small scenes in the book like when Cinna (well played by Kravtiz) orders any food they want and then realises how 'disgusting' the Capitolians must appear to the District 12ers would have brought that home more. Also, Katniss's styling team wasn't there to show how they treat her like a pet - encapsulating the mental nature of the Capitol - how to them it's so harmless, which is to be pitied, whilst also being disgusting.<br/><br/>Otherwise, Katniss is disappointingly 'flat', though there are good moments. The thing that essentially killed it for me, was the climactic berry scene - when they both realise they have to kill one another, the conflict is supposed to be so high - and we see how Peeta is more 'the good one'. There is no time to properly show how Katniss comes to the realisation that the Capitol won't be happy if there isn't a victor. This is the MOMENT. Instead it's over in two seconds. I wanted to scream.<br/><br/>And DoP - we get the hand-held camera stuff/CUs are there to make us feel awkward and uncomfortable. Methinks it was overkill in trying to 'glean' over the initial Cornucopia scene where 11 die straight away. Again, it was obvious the filmmakers didn't want to show us the real state of this bloodthirsty situation. This was added to by the idea that it never really felt like any of the kids were fighting for their lives - Cato et al kept running around and whooping as if they were having a ball, when really there's supposed to be a sinister undertone to it all. It just WASN'T BADASS ENOUGH! You might be forgiven in thinking that I severely disliked this film but as it is, it wasn't terrible. But yet again, it fell far short of the mark in getting to greatness. And this is the best book of the series so *shrug* Finally, if you really want to see a damn good portrayal of teenagers in a fight to survive or be killed scenario, rent 'Battle Royale' where the insanely maddening stakes are given due respect and intelligence."

","I really liked this movie. Its stirs up a lot of emotions."
"blackwidowis7cool","10","3","4","19 August 2019"," A faithful (but somewhat more family friendly) adaption
","I finally sat down and watched the much-acclaimed adaption of Suzanne Collins hugely popular book The Hunger Games. And I must say I quite enjoyed it.
The movie starts with explaining straight away the situation in North America - where North America is divided into 12 Districts, which are all run by the Capitol. There used to be a thirteenth, but it rebelled and was nuked by the Capitol. To punish the rest of the districts, and to try and quell and other rebellious notions, the Capitol have instigated the Hunger Games - a game which is basically like the Coliseum in Rome where 24 teenagers (two from each district) are gathered together to fight to the death until there is only one still alive. The film then goes to the Reaping, where Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence), her best friend Gale Hawthorne (Liam Hemsworth), Katniss' sister Primrose (Willow Shields), Katniss and Prim's mother Mrs Everdeen (Paula Malcomson) and the rest of District 12's citizens all gather in the public square where their names are gathered together in two bowls - one for the females aged from 12-18 and the other for the males aged from 12-18 - and one is picked at random from each bowl by Citizen employee Effie Trinket.
Against Katniss' prayers, her little sister's name is picked, so she volunteers to take her place. Then the male tribute's name is picked and it's Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson). They are then taken to the Capitol where they begin training for the Hunger Games as well as sussing out the competition and trying to win sponsors that will provide them with supplies during the Games to have a better chance at staying alive. Once the Games start, it is a race for survival. (Sorry for the bad plot description).
While I am no way a purist when it comes to book-to-film adaptions and am generally not bothered by changes (big or small) in film adaptions of books I really love, I really did appreciate this time around how the film is overall the same as the book. There are, of course, some minor changes here and there, but not glaring or in any way bad. One of the changes I rather appreciated was Katniss' hallucination scene when she is stung by multiple Trackerjackers. In the book, she had some rather disturbing hallucinations, but in the movie they change it to memories of her father's death, which actually added a thoughtful touch to the movie. Another change the movie made is with the timing of something in the climax (which I will not spoil). Trust me, you will truly appreciate that change if you've read the book, but haven't yet seen the movie. It makes it MUCH more watchable and enjoyable.
The camera work was certainly different. They did quite a lot of it with hand-held camera or ""shaky"" camera work as some have put it. I have spent a lot of time thinking about this, and while at times it certainly was ""shaky"", there were quite a few times where this type of camera technique really works - for this film, anyway. It really works for the first-person perspective scenes and generally just makes it feel more fraught and real (in some cases, anyway).
I also really liked how they didn't show much with regards to violence, blood and guts. They kept most of it off-camera, though they showed a little bit to let the viewer get an idea of what's happening, though don't think too much about the glimpse you get, otherwise you could find it a bit disturbing.
Jennifer Lawrence delivers an absolutely solid, emotional performance as the film's main protagonist Katniss Everdeen. She really brings Katniss to life and brings strength and sophistication to the character. I really loved her. Just as Robert Downey Jr. is the Iron Man/Tony Stark and Harrison Ford is the Han Solo and Indiana Jones, Jennifer Lawrence is the Katniss Everdeen. A real top-notch actress. Very talented.
Josh Hutcherson is absolutely brilliant as Peeta Mellark, the other District 12 tribute. Very talented actor and a solid performance.
Donald Sutherland is absolutely fabulous as the Capitol's leader President Snow. A really, really great and evil villain. While the film certainly has other ""villains"" that it focuses on, if you think about it, Snow is the villain of the movie as he is the leader of the Capitol and controls all the Hunger Games. Pity we didn't see as much of him as I would have liked, but that wasn't the point or focus of this movie. He was great in all the scenes he was in (as few as they were). But hopefully, he'll have more screen time/focus in the sequels!
Woody Harrelson is great as the drunken District 12 mentor Haymitch Abernethy, who just can't help but love. He brings a lot of sass, wit, and a devil-may-care attitude to the role - and I truly loved every minute he was on screen.
There are others I could mention, but these are the most notable and suffice to say that everyone does a great job in their roles - even if some didn't get as much screen time and focus as they possibly should have (such as the other tributes).
This film doesn't have many special effects, but when it does, they are very good, though some could use a little more polishing up.
I liked how the movie stayed true to the book's core values, themes, and messages and how thought-provoking the movie was. I also really enjoyed how The Hunger Games movie focused more on plot and character than action, though there was some awesome action scenes. The ending might be somewhat underwhelming, but it sets things up for the sequels in an excellent and intriguing way.
The Hunger Games is a overall faithful adaption of Suzanne Collins epic novel and is an awesome and enjoyable movie. Looking forward to watching the sequels!"

"brianlombardi-19902","8","3","4","20 June 2019"," The books are better
","Everyone here is yapping about how this is a rip-off of some Japanese movie called Battle Royale. Is no one judging this movie based on just its connection to the book and it's performance? Because if you do, it's really good.<br/><br/>Suzanne Collins knew what she was doing when she wrote these books. You can feel the pain, relentless onslaught of grief, and choice throughout the book. I always could never put the book down. But when this was made into a movie, I was a bit suspicious. The story is meant to be in book form. But on closer inspection, I saw that this is a really good movie.<br/><br/>I'm satisfied with the pacing. It's made clear that our main characters are going to be the focus of the movie. We see Katniss' choice to volunteer to be tribute in order to protect her sister. We see her pain as she's sent to her inevitable doom. We see her anger with Haymitch and her troubles with Peeta (their ship name is PeeNiss). Plus, the characters are believable. Jennifer Lawrence is the best Katniss I could honestly ask for. You definitely see her trying her hardest to be a fierce, bold, daring girl that just wants to survive, which is more evident in later films. The big moment of the games beginning doesn't fail to deliver. It may not be the most entertaining, but as I said, the books are better. We can watch as Katniss struggles to survive with nothing but a backpack, some supplies, and her wits. We watch as Peeta makes the choice to save Katniss from death while taking a painful wound. We see Katniss forming a relationship with Rue and how Katniss sees her sister in Rue, which makes her death more meaningful. We watch as Katniss finds compassion to take care of Peeta. We watch as she embraces love and shows her feeings for Peeta. We get to see how human the tributes are, watching as Foxface does whatever she can to stay away, watching as Clove taunts Katniss for the cameras, watch as Thresh attacks Clove for being responsible for killing Rue, watching as Thresh let's Katniss live because of her acts of kindness to Rue, which makes the audience more emotional. The climax of the movie doesn't disappoint, either. The mutts are monsters, forcing the final three to battle for victory. We can see Cato trying his hardest to win. And finally, we see Katniss' will to live and keep her promise by standing up to the Capitol. Soon, the movie ends<br/><br/>All in all, it helps a lot if you read the books first before watching this movie. The books help you understand what Collins is trying to make you feel. Give this movie a chance instead of calling The Hunger Games, a concept that was creatively made by Suzanne Collins to show elements of survivial, pain, and choice, to some old Japanese movie about Battle Royale, a concept that which you can find in one of the most popular video games of this age: Fortnite.<br/><br/>May the odds be ever in your favor"

"terrildavis-44052","Null","3","4","14 February 2016"," Did they take the rights of the Japanese thriller 'BATTLE ROYALE' or just copied it shamelessly as per modern Hollywood's tradition?
","With The Hunger Games, the decade old tradition of Hollywood continues, taking it all (from the first frame to the last) from an engrossingly well made Japanese Thriller called ""BATTLE ROYALE"" released in 2000.<br/><br/>In short, the director and his writer take 90% ingredients for their over-cooked script from the Japanese Film. Then they add a love-sex angle to it as a mandatory clause of Twilightesque Film-making technique. To make it more spicier, they bring in some eunuch characters into the narration with the get-up earlier used in their own films. And further, sprinkling it with a few emotional sequences about some broken families, they are ready with their latest flick The Hunger Games, taking advantage of the brand name.<br/><br/>As I have realised, many of my reader friends here would like to say that, ""We don't really care if it's a copy or not, so cut out the allegation crap and just let us know whether the movie is good or bad and that's it."" In answer to that I would only like to say that The Hunger Games is an Open Creative Theft made by the Collis camp in this current age of world-wide- web. Now, a theft remains a theft, whether done carelessly or with utmost care and devotion. Even if it happens to be a too good movie (which fortunately it isn't), still it remains a Shameless Robbery of any other person's creative work and nothing else. And I am simply not interested in writing a detailed review of a copied movie.<br/><br/>However, for all my friendly readers, who are willing to know more about Cinema in details, I would like to present this movie as a fine lesson in learning few important things about Hollywood Film-making style.<br/><br/>1. Hollywood film-maker's biggest problem is that we still are not sure of what genre we are dealing in while making a film. The current The Hunger Games copies a fast paced cruel bloody Japanese thriller ""BATTLE ROYALE"" , it's a Bloody Suspense Thriller and it remains a bloody suspense thriller throughout.<br/><br/>But The Hunger Games not even remains a thriller in its more than 2 hours of duration. There is an added track in it of a beautiful model girl who is in love with the hero as Love essentially has to be there like sugar or salt in a dish. There are many unwanted eunuchs and unmoving stories of broken families inserted into it which were not required at all. The soundtrack has surprisingly all love songs in a SCIFI THRILLER movie like a variety served on the dinner table by its makers.<br/><br/>2. Secondly in this new age of fresh creative minds, we still follow double standards in showing the characters of our male and female leads. Now in the original flick the lead character or the hero is not a female. But in our Tweenie version the hero becomes a strong female character. So the writers give a certain amount of disrespect to the very source they are copying from directly.<br/><br/>But on the other hand The Hunger Games has a sexy-model beefcake characters played by eunuchs, who simply have no definite role in the movie but is added only to be exploited as a male butt rump.<br/><br/>That's the double standard mind-set Hollywood actually works in.<br/><br/>3. Thirdly after watching both the movies, you will have a clear idea of what it means by the term ""Added Sub Plots"" which in most of the cases ruin the real essence of a film. In this case too, where the original keeps walking on a single track and never gets distracted from its basic storyline of BATTLE ROYALE, its USA copy keeps wandering between its various added subplots which could have been easily avoided. Frankly speaking we can't even stick to a basic storyline even when its all copied from another brilliant source.<br/><br/>4. Lastly and more importantly, if you even copy the idea for the Poster of your film along with its script then I wonder what the whole team actually may have done as far as creativity is concerned in this project. Here the makers of The Hunger Games not only copy their whole film from the Japanese Original scene to scene, but they also copy their posters. Now that's really a great amount of research done by the team.<br/><br/>Summing up, with The Hunger Games, the Gary Ross camp continues to try for their next box office success in American Cinema by taking the credit of all the hard work done by someone else residing in a different part of the globe far awayand they have really mastered this shameful act of ""Art of Inspiration"" by now. (However, I would love to be surprised with the impossible news that they actually did buy the rights this time.)"

","Granted, I have not read the book so I can't comment on the book>movie translation - but this movie was absolutely predictable. OH! 2/3 of the way through the movie, the mascara-and-eye gloss liner-laden judges (or whatever they're called) change the rules so the lovers from the same district can survive?!! And then, when you least (or most) expect it, they change the rules again?!!!! Good heavens, what an unexpected plot change. Add this to characters that were seen for maybe 10 seconds in the first 1/3 of the movie showing up for another 10 seconds in the last 1/3 of the movie to save the 'hero/heroine'.

"sddavis63","3","3","4","11 November 2012"," It Struck Me As Little More Than ""Survivor: Extreme""
","Since ""The Hunger Games"" seems to have been pretty well received, I'm going to be going out on a limb here, but I just didn't care for it. I'll confess that I haven't read the book. Apparently some consider it a rip-off of a movie called ""Battle Royale"" - which I haven't seen. So I really didn't have any pre-conceived notions about this going in. I watched it because I had heard a lot of people liked it. So much for popular opinion.<br/><br/>I came out of this feeling as if I had just been subjected to almost two and a half hours of ""Survivor: Extreme."" In this case, it would be extreme because there's really only one survivor. In some future nightmare world, a government uses The Hunger Games as a punishment for a long ago uprising. Every year each of 12 Districts that rebelled has to send two young people (one male and one female) to do battle with one another and form alliances and kill each other off until only one is left. Meanwhile, this has become this society's version of reality TV, as the whole thing is televised, and the ""tributes"" (the young people in the battle) are interviewed. I suppose if you think about it, it's not actually a bad social commentary about our own society which gets so fixated on the drivel of our own reality TV. But I didn't find it entertaining. Somehow, watching a bunch of teenagers trying to kill each other didn't appeal to me all that much. There's also the fact that I really didn't care that much for any of the characters. Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) is a bit sympathetic, especially as she tends to young Rue (Amandla Stenberg) - and certainly, Katniss and Peeta Josh Hutcherson) are the only two characters (aside from Rue) that you really could root for, but I still didn't feel much for them.<br/><br/>I honestly didn't know what to expect coming into this. I had no idea what the movie was about. In the end, I can't say that watching this was a highlight for me. (3/10)"
"theleahmobile","3","3","4","6 October 2012"," Disappointment of the Century
","I can honestly say this movie was the biggest disappointment to me. Being a person who read the books the summer they were released, I had great expectations for the movie that I knew would follow in the next few years. The casting,costuming,scripting and most everything about this film was a let down. Let me start with casting. They producers of this film were clearly trying to introduce some fresh faces as the leads but it totally backfired. Somewhere around the twenty minute mark I realized that Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson had zero chemistry. While in the books their relationship was complicated and fresh, it translated as juvenile and blasé in the movie. Both actors had bizarre ups and downs throughout the performance that really makes one stop and say ""What in the hell is going on?"" Haymitch Abernathy was also a big yawn. His character in the book so poignantly portrayed the post hunger games victor. A man completely broken by these barbaric games whose last refuge was in his drink. His portayl in the movie however was barely recognizable. First and foremost, he was never actually drunk, which early on in the film formulated the opinion in my mind that the producers were trying to water down this very adult theme of the Hunger Games so little junior can go to the big kid movie. (More on that later)His delivery of lines, and the lines themselves, had a maddening humorous undertone. While in the books he was a mentor and a motivator for Katniss, in the movie he was sort of like everyones goofy uncle who gets drunk at the family thanksgiving. I could go on for pages about my criticisms with this piece of crap but I'll some up my major beefs with this movie.1. The beautiful and moving duologue from the books was almost non existent.2. The costumes were cheap and lame. 3. There was no violence to speak of, completely demolishing the element of terror that was so real in the book. 4. The careers weren't scary in the least. More like the group of rich kids who steals lunch money for kicks and giggles. 5. There was no prep team, amputation, hearing loss from blast or Madge. 6. Last but not least, there was no element of intimacy between Peeta and Katniss. Only one kiss does not count. Take my advice, watch this movie only in the hopes of having your perceptions of what is a fantastic book smashed in a grueling three and some odd hours."

The look of the movie has been worked upon carefully. This is a very interesting plot and will keep the audiences anticipating. Downsides are that the cast of the movie hasn't been used to their potential. You would expect a change in pace towards the end of the storyline however that doesn't happen. Considering the length of the movie and comparing it to movies with similar plots this is a let down for me. It could have been less predictable and more interesting if the story included a few twists and turns and an increase in pace toward the end."

"sathya100-459-13140","3","3","4","25 August 2012"," Reasons why this movie is horrible.
","I'm a really big fan of the trilogy, and had high expectations of the movie since I saw the trailers and how highly the main actors spoke about the director. I do believe they tried to make it look like it did justice to the book in the trailer, so people would actually watch it. I will list some things that really bothered me when I saw the movie<br/><br/>1. Katniss and Prim's relationship doesn't seem as important as in the books. If I didn't read the books, I would of thought it was nothing more than family love.<br/><br/>2. They didn't show what happened when Katniss father died,so you don't understand why she was starving at one point, and now she looks well feed, also because the actors obviously look the same. And because unless you read the books, you don't know Katniss mother was in deep depression when her husband died, you don't understand why Katniss is telling her to be there for Prim.<br/><br/>3. I know this movie had a high budget, so why couldn't they get grey contact lenses for Katniss and Gale and blue contact lenses for Peeta?! In the book we know how important the colour of their eyes is, because it's mentioned a lot. <br/><br/>4. What is it with the high tech projector thing in Katniss's home back in District 12? How hard could it be to get them an old TV like in the books. It's obvious District 12 is a poor district, so how can they afford those things? If anyone doesn't have a TV, they can watch the games in the big screens outside.<br/><br/>5. Buttercup's colour. How hard could it be to find an orange cat? Was everyone just really eager to finish the movie once for all, so they could go on holiday with all the money they just made?<br/><br/>6. Cato and Glimmer. Who the hell said that Glimmer and Cato were supposed to be together?! At least stay true to the book and make him be with Clove like it's supposed to be. It wouldn't make the movie any longer. <br/><br/>7. How Katniss woke up after the tracker jacker attack with leaves on her arm (clearly not chewed, like in the books) and then decides to team up with Rue. <br/><br/>8. How could it be that literally 2 minutes after they became allies, do they plan to blow up the Careers supplies? And how can Foxface just run in and take food from the pile even if there's someone there...<br/><br/>9. How can Katniss still hear after the explosion, and be so close to Cato and he doesn't see her... she clearly made a lot of noise stumbling through the woods... One of the Careers could of clearly heard her then. <br/><br/>10. Katniss reaction to Peeta being with the Careers. I was expecting her to be very alarmed, but it looked like it wasn't that big of a deal, when it was. <br/><br/>11. I think it was bad that Katniss reached Rue, and swiftly avoided the speer, but Rue gets speared. I think Rue should of stayed in the net and not dramatically take the speer out and fall. <br/><br/>12. The real Katniss would of been a quiet crier, not a really noisy one. In the books we don't read of her acting so dramatically... it was okay she shed some tears while singing to her, but a true Katniss wouldn't of done that.<br/><br/>13. Where was the bread sent from District 11? I think the uprising scene made up for it, because it was an act of bravery.<br/><br/>14. How can it be that one moment she's dramatically weeping, the next she's looking for Peeta and finds him really quick. Why couldn't he say ""Here to finish me off, sweetheart""??<br/><br/>-I will continue the list in another post-"

","Despite the hype associated with the release of this movie having settled down to watch it I can only say what a bitter disappointment it turned out to be and I can only hope they don't intend to make a follow up. What's wrong with it you may well ask? Well pretty much everything, the story has no depth, the political regime and the daily struggle of the characters who find themselves the focus of the story are superficial. The action scenes are reminiscent of low budget TV series in the 80's and the interaction between the characters is also lamentable. Don't get me wrong its not badly acted it is simply a bad adaptation of the a world in which the political oppression makes it necessary to have this charade of youngsters in their teens running around the some woods attempting to kill each other badly. Having watched this movie without the benefit of reading the novels which by all accounts appear to have some depth and colour the rental fee for the movie would be better spent on purchasing the e-books and reading them instead."

","This story has such potential to be an major contender for the 'Twilight' and 'Harry Potter' vehicles, yet falls on the sword of many movies.... Attempting to do too much in too little time. What we have here is a really long and disjointed movie that, in reality should have been set-up like a real trilogy in several offerings rather than what has been created.<br/><br/>I attempt to be diplomatic here because I truly believe that the books are masterful and has been cheapened by the product we see before us now. I suspect, but have no proof, that the author believed that she would make a quick buck by selling the rights to the books and then envisioned the 'professionals' would take it from there. <br/><br/>The Good: Casting in the form of Harrelson, Banks and Tucci, as all were masterful in their portrayals with what they were given for the script. I really like Harrelson, even if I always will think of him as Woody from Cheers. I do feel that he was not all that convincing compared to the character in the book. Banks, as in Jack's wife in 30-Rock was very Helen Bonham Carter- ish in her portrayal of Effie Trinket. Tucci.... this man would shine in anything that is given to him. <br/><br/>The Bad: The VERY disjointed story. Unless you're under 16-years of age or have little concept of truly feeling the character, this story is an act in futility. There is little to no back story for the characters, leaving this reviewer to not care if all or any of them got killed off. At one point, I was hoping they would ""just die already"" so I could leave. As I was not connected to the characters, I focused more on the plot holes and inconsistency with the book and then thinking ""Why did they cast (blank) in that role?"" <br/><br/>I've seen Hutcherson in quite a few roles when he was younger, all I have to say is that he must have a VERY good agent, and I hope that guy/gal gets paid allot! He was mis-cast for this role, but I suspect that was for the pre-teen girl audience with little consideration for anyone else. Lawerence is most likely a very good actress, but comes off as un-likable, pushy and ignorant in this part, instead of simply an intelligent and strong-willed young woman. <br/><br/>Finally, I agree with many reviewers that there were two other flaws here.... The shaky camera syndrome did not make it feel 'more real' to me and the choice to ""attempt"" to draw the viewer in with the muted portions and ear ringing in various scenes. Eventually, this was just a distraction/annoyance and I left the movie with a headache.<br/><br/>Ultimately, this is a good movie for the pre-teen set who will make it a financial success because they are taking their parents money and going in a horde of screaming pre-teen glory. There is little else to like as far as substance, but unfortunately we will be subject to a sequel because this one was a financial success, if not a story line failure."

","Yes, a comparison with Battle Royale is inevitable here. I guess this has been done to close the gap between two cultures (not that many people even know that B.R. even exists). It seems that the fiction in the background (did not read the book, btw.) has ""juice"" but the presentation form of this movie ruined it. Strange, though. Cast is good, performances also, even the direction (mostly). But the whole picture is simply bad. Unnecessary repeating of the parts of the movie (very poorly executed ""flashabcks""), fake emotions, tons of illogical and in essence futile parts (creating some sort of dogs from nothing? Ain't that a concept from Star Trek and Holodeck with safety protocols shut down?). I could not figure out who screwed up more: writers, producers, editors, even director? Anyway, this story could have been done incomparably better in someone else's hands (say, Wheddon?, Cameron?, Scott? or anybody who knows how to make a story consistent, logical and meaningful). This way the story has no beginning and no end. Just something vague in the middle. This movie is a miss. Bigtime. Pity."

At first I thought it would be a great movie. Well it turned out to be a great disappointment. Sure, there was a lot of violence and those who love violence-only movies will definitely love it, but, come on, how likely is it that you suggest this movie to someone? Even the love story wasn't good and the reason might be that the characters weren't well-constructed. There was no real feeling in the entire movie. Deaths of the characters weren't so emotional either. Only when that little kid dies you might feel a little sorry, but other than that nothing else affects you.

People in the movie are strange and very different from people around us. They enjoy watching kids killing each other and killers become celebrities. It's just stupid. Besides that, the movie doesn't have a message (or at least I couldn't grasp it). Doesn't value human values in the end, really. They just come back home, and hey, you killed a lot of people, congrats. (I was expecting to see at least how the rebellion went on in district 11.)<br/><br/>Except for the main character of the film, the other characters were not well developed. You get confused in the middle. Just you don't know how the always-drunk carefree mentor suddenly became all sober and helped the children. And the love story that happens, just seems fake. The boy wants to kill the girl and gives advice to others about catching the girl, and a few hours later they fall in love and sacrifice for each other.<br/><br/>To sum up, I think this movie had nothing to offer, no good story, no well-developed characters, no message, you get nothing out of it.

For example the scene in the end where Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark decide to die together like Romeo and Julieta because their love is impossible.<br/><br/>Moreover for action the movie is to slow and the hesitation in it can kill you. Some of the romantic scene are very trivial and are exactly for teenagers. So if you don't like Twilight don't watch this movie.<br/><br/>In the other hand the movie is based on a novel so I have to read first the books and then give more accurate rating. But what I had read about the adaptation of the book is that is not successful and the directors didn't succeed to create the atmosphere of the book.<br/><br/>I am giving credit to the idea of the book because I think that these districts are representing our society and how certain people are enjoying the pain of others and for them their life's are just a game."

","I've never read the books that this movie is based on so, I had no idea what to expect when I went into the cinema, but there has been a lot of hype around this movie and I thought it would be worth checking it out. It wasn't all that great, in fact it was terrible. <br/><br/>The movie never clearly describes to you exactly what is happening, so I found myself quite lost on the story-line, but it seems that there is a main city called Capital City which is surrounded by 12 districts. These districts live in poverty; mining, farming and pretty much doing all the hard labor for the Capital City, which is bathed in luxury, reaping the benefits of the districts resources.<br/><br/>Then every year the Capital citizens select two children (between the ages of 12 and 18) from each district and watch them kill each other in an arena, until only one child is left, they call this event The Hunger Games. The reason behind this because the districts had an uprising against the Capital City a number of years ago. Now I'm not one to get my knickers in a knot from a child dying in a movie, but an entire movie of children being murdered? It made the movie awful in my opinion, after all how many people want to watch children killing each other?<br/><br/>But let us say that you're okay with that, what is the rest of the movie like? Well for what is obviously intended to be a rather emotional movie, there is very little character development and although I felt sad that a child had died, I felt nothing about the characters death. Though the actors did a great job portraying their emotions, and a good thing too or else the movie would of been completely devoid of emotion.<br/><br/>Then there are the action scenes, I don't know if they were good to be honest I couldn't tell what was happening. It seems that when they wanted to shoot an action scene they told the camera man to zoom in as much as possible and then break dance in front of the actors with his/her camera. You can't see what is going on, you just hear screaming and fighting while watching the floor, sky and various body parts rapidly switch and then someone is lying on the floor dead.<br/><br/>In general an awful and incomplete story-line, shallow characters, unclear action scenes, but very good acting and some creative costumes. Perhaps this is a movie for those who have read the books, but after watching this, I don't want to read them."
"mocarne","4","3","4","10 May 2012"," Did not do justice to the book.
","OK I don't profess to be a movie reviewer but I have to say something about this movie.First of all by saying that I as a reader of the books, I was very disappointed by movie adaptation.<br/><br/>My main complaint with the movie being the cinematography and character development. It seemed to be a chronological list of things that happened. Like someone stalking Katnis and video taping her. Yes the story is based on her experience but that is not the story.<br/><br/>The camera work actually made my head hurt.I had a migraine after the movie. first time that has happened from watching a movie. Too many shots were zoomed in on faces, pointless things that had nothing to do with the story. Especially in the beginning when Katnis was being ushered around by Peacekeepers. I don't think they had room in their $78,000,000 budget for a TRIPOD! From what I saw, every shot was hand held and shaky to boot! It was so annoying to watch. The pace was too quick between shots. Its like they didn't feel the need for basic production planning, shot lists, story boards, beat scripts etc. It's funny, the pace between the actual shots and frames was quick but the actual progression of the plot was very slow.Painfully so.<br/><br/>I did not feel the angst Katnis is supposed feel, the utter hate she has for the Capitol. I would have loved to see more from Katnis. Don't get me wrong. I thought Jeniffer Lawrence played the part exceptionally. I just wish she would have had more emotional involvement. She came across as too hard and harsh. the Katnis I read about struggled emotionally and was challenged emotionally as well as physically. It seemed too easy for her to interact with Peeta, she was supposed to hate and have mixed feelings(I must sound like a total emo right now). It kind of made her look merciless, which would have been appropriate in some scenes but not the whole movie.<br/><br/>I went to the movie with friends. I told them the basic premise of the story before we watched it. I had to continually inform them on who each character was and their significance to the story. Even when the credits were rolling my friends were still asking me what had just happened. I was hoping that my friends would like the Hunger Games series as much as I do.<br/><br/>Did not do the story justice. I think I could have done a better job. Pretty presumptuous I know but the Hunger Games was so much better in My imagination. I just hope Francis Lawrence dose a better job in 2013 for Caching Fire."

","I read the first book didn't like it, so I knew I wasn't going to like the movie but I went to see only because it was a class trip. The movie is to over-hyped and won way to much money at the box office. It really wasn't that great of a movie. I am going to start with the first thing that I noticed was going to make the movie awful from the first scene was the shaky camera work. The entire movie had awful camera work, during the fight scenes which is supposed to be the whole point of the movie you could barley see what was happening because of the camera. Every review that I have read everyone is says that the acting was great, I didn't feel that way. Like most teenage actor/actress their acting really isn't that good and it was the same thing in this movie. There was no real emotion in any of the actor/actress voice, witch made the performance not believable. The dialogue was weak there was a lot of cheesy corny love lines, the movie is supposed to attract 10-13 year old kids and most kids don't want a movie filled with love lines. Another big problem with the movie was the character development, there was no connection with any of the characters and they didn't explain the characters well enough for any type of emotional connection when one of them would die. But I can't blame all of this on the filmmakers its mainly the authors fault because the book was made in 1st person the only character that we really know anything about is Katniss and to me that isn't good enough especially for a book where people are being killed. Finally the plot for the movie has been done to many time, Battle Royale is very similar to this movie, so because the plot has been done way to may times i felt that there was really nothing that was original in this movie/book. I recommend this for anyone who just wants to wast 2 hours, it nothing new nor special. I would wait for it to come out on redbox, netflix or when it is the $5 bin."

","Overall, this is a really boring and disappointing movie. Considering it lasted over 2 hours, I was surprised that the context was little if not explained at all; the characters are pretty flat and unappealing; and I really miss the point of the whole movie. Its a sort of Truman Show with some Running Man. I was hoping that the end would give some hint on the meaning of the whole plot. Sci-fi is always tricky, and most of the time you get pretty bad stories. This is one of them. Its a real pity considering the cast they put together. I haven't got much more to say except, avoid this movie if you don't want to waste your time. But if you really have nothing better to do, go see it just to have an idea of what a bad movie should be like. So my vote is 4/10, for the cast and the effort."

Part of this film reminded me of The Running Man from the 80's, part of it the TV show Survivor.<br/><br/>Despite the fact that the film lasted over 2 hours, as a viewer I had no real idea what the reason behind The Hunger Games was. There was very little character development done. There was very little building-up time to make you even vaguely interested in the characters or the main idea. We spend some time in the city before the main event but even that time is wasted. Nothing interesting happens here.<br/><br/>The last half of this film was people running around the woods while goofy looking technicians and even dumber looking aristocrat types watched. Clue- it helps if the Evil Guys look Evil and not Stupid. <br/><br/>I agree with some other reviews I have seen, this film looked like a Sci-Fi Channel movie. Where did the budget go?<br/><br/>Even worse, for a movie about a death sport, the movie was mostly pretty boring. You would get a little action and then back to boring dialog which itself did nothing to even help the plot. <br/><br/>If you've read the books you have something vested and a real background in this film already. I get it. You're probably going to like it for reasons other than what was on the screen. For those of us who watched without reading the book, let me tell you > not a good film."

","First of all the movie is quite brilliant made. Full of nice shots and angles. And nobody should complain about the actors expressions. But what really bothers me is a little conflict inside the movie. It is located where conflicts are allowed to be. It is direct interpretation. So to clear it up: What Katniss and her ""first"" friend are talking about is how bad these ""Hunger Games"" are. Forcing a nation to watch people fighting for their lives. It is presented similar to a gigantic version of the roman ancient Colosseum. So deeply wrong. Against every human right. Watching them fighting against each other. Building up groups, hunting the opposing ones down like animals. The audience immediately sympathizes with the protagonist, who only became part of the games to rescue her little sister. Everyone agrees in a minute that these games should not be supported. These games are bad. No-one of the (in film) audience should watch these bestiality games out of free will. But than again, it is exactly what the (cinema/tv) audience is likely to see most of the time. The kids fighting and killing. Hearing them yell and shout. Seeing them die. So my question is: how is this compatible? One the one hand saying it (the game) is bad and on the other hand showing the very same thing. Minute by minute that passes. Unbelievable and impossible to support or watch for the ""non-brain-damaged-or- limited-view-teenage-girly-girl"".

","The Hunger Games is a film about a dystopian society where the rich and powerful District One (victors in a world war) force kids from the poorer conquered districts into competing in the Hunger Games, where they must hunt and kill their fellow competitors until one remains. It is based on a book of the same name.<br/><br/>This is an idea that has been explored in various literature and films - most notably in the preceding Japanese film (and book) Battle Royale.<br/><br/>I happened to have read the book a week before seeing the film for the first time. The film's story follows the book exactly and that is it's biggest downfall. This results in the first hour of the film being simply exposition - it is slow and stealing time from what should have been the best part of the film - that is the games.<br/><br/>Which brings me to the biggest factor that ruined this movie is the PG-13 rating. The subject matter is about death and ultra-violence and it is artistically ridiculous that the producers go for this rating. There is nothing shocking about the violence and that should be the main emotional impact. Though obviously they have been very successful in grabbing a whole mountain of money for this franchise.<br/><br/>Despite a lot of exposition time, big problem with the movie (and the book for that matter) is the lack of character development from anyone other than the three or four main characters. There are 24 competitors, but we only really see two. People die, but you just don't care.<br/><br/>This is definitely one to go straight to the book for.

Vapid, unchallenging and oh-so safe with every punch tastefully pulled, every mock-emotional set-piece carefully orchestrated to tug the superficial heartstrings of the wannabe emo self-harmer brigade. Overlong. Really overlong. And it was tripe.<br/><br/>What this stuff needs is jet-black humour and vengeful rebellion to make it work. For the protagonists to win and turn on the architects of their plight with guns. cudgels and knives and pulverise their asses in a climax of violence, retribution and destruction.

That's not to say the movie is better or worse than the books, just that it is the story itself which is really really bad.<br/><br/>The basic plot about kids being picked to compete in a TV show and who then have to fight to the death is just mind numbingly dumb. Seriously if this is what teenagers think is great storytelling then the future of film and narrative is in serious trouble. The Hunger Games makes Twilight look like Shakespeare in comparison.<br/><br/>Set in a world where elites control all the food reserves and run the country of Panem by requiring each district to submit 2 of their children to compete in the annual hunger games, who therefore become submissive to the elites. Why this seems to work is never explained, in fact none of the reasons the masses seem to be complicit in the state sponsored killings of their offspring is ever really delved into which is a shame as you would think it to be of some importance.<br/><br/>The acting is pretty good in general and it's nice to see Woody Harrelson in a decent role again, Lenny Kravitz was pretty good too given the limited scope of his character. Unfortunately Donald Sutherland despite his Hollywood legendary status is just not heavyweight enough for this role I thought.

","A mediocre idea that could have been made into a good film - but this is not it.<br/><br/>Watching 'Hunger Games'. Pity about the Apple-loops excuse for music. Nice to have it all so predictable - perfect watching for Alzheimer's patients. <br/><br/>What a horrifying film, though, far, far, in the future and humanity hasn't evolved beyond 'reality' plebvision....<br/><br/>Isn't it fortunate that, as Yogi Berra pointed out, 'It's difficult to make predictions, particularly about the future'.<br/><br/>Pathetic, really. They don't even know what 'star crossed' means. How sad, they could have made an interesting film, instead of this tosh. <br/><br/>I thought, for a while, that it might be anti-fascism, instead it was a bad modern re-make of 'Triumph of the Will'. Yankland Ãœber alles in der Welt'. <br/><br/>Well, I suppose that you have to accept that it reflects the Zeitgeist. I think that Neitzche, if shorn of all his aesthetic sensibilities, might have liked it.<br/><br/>What is worst about the whole thing, really, is that such a badly made, fascist film is so popular - if it had just gone straight to DVD, where it belongs, it wouldn't be such a sad indictment on popular taste and popular sentiment (sentimentality, really). <br/><br/>I suppose that we have to accept that, like the depression in the 1930s, this depression has, almost inevitably, led to an adoption of fascist mawkishness. Wouldn't it be nice if humanity was capable of something better."

","Here we go again: Storytelling 101 - show your audience, don't TELL them.<br/><br/>The Hunger Games is a painful exercise in incessant exposition. For an action movie built upon the survival instincts of a young and humble warrior, the majority of the film is spent watching people explain things to the heroine and the audience, almost all of which is totally unnecessary. You don't really need to know about sponsors, apartments, blue hair or the repetitious ""Rules of the Game"" so to speak. It just ends up dragging what is essentially a 80- minute movie nearly an hour longer. Despite all the talk of myth that inspired the original novel, we've seen it all before in what is unambiguously adapted from the Most Dangerous Game. Once you get over the novelty of kids killing kids - which seems to be no novelty at all if you watch the news - there isn't much here to go on.<br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence has an honest face which owns every scene, but unfortunately Gary Ross gets it all wrong. Ross cuts to so many arbitrary setups, he seems lost on how to lens and frame this story and by consequence, who to connect with. You end up not caring who lives or dies in what SHOULD be a story of life and death. On the dramatic side, we spend more time hearing people jabber on about nonsense than see them act upon anything. Characters in The Hunger Games seemingly talk AT Katniss, never TO her and it all funnels into unmemorable noise. The empty dialog is shuttled around by lots of unmotivated shaky cam and quick cutting nonsense that doesn't edit. The movie just doesn't flow well and in the scenes where it finally does - always in action - it is short lived. At the end of every scene, I was awaiting the commercials because it feels like a hastily produced FOX show for Friday night.<br/><br/>I really just wanted to see the young and talented Jennifer Lawrence out in the wild tracking down Arnold Schwarzenegger from the Running Man. But instead we are held hostage by Gary Ross's witless direction and a dry talky script. This is a movie with a character but no story, a setup but no payoff. Lots of hunger and very little game.<br/><br/>Don't tell me I should read the book, because I'll just tell you to watch a movie like Hanna, instead."

","I think the book is great, but this is not the book! It's almost unwatchable, it's such a mess. They changed key factors for the movie, like where the mockingjay pin came from, and the meaning of it. They cut out all of the violence and nudity, as well as key scenes that developed the characters and their relationships, making this movie feel incomplete and jumbled together. I mean there was no back story for Haymitch, Gale,or any of the Tributes, other than a few lines. Imagine reading a book and stopping in the middle of a sentence and skipping every other line, and sometimes entire chapters! The movie feels completely rushed with no direction and horribly edited. The director should be shot. I've seen better direction on an episode of Jersey Shore! Though the actors do a great job with what pieces of the script weren't cut out. The entire movie I kept waiting for commercials to come on, like I was watching network TV. I'm not sure where the $78,000,000 went! If you've never read the book, it might not be too bad."

","Shortly after reading the books and I was excited when I discovered they were making a film adaptation of it considering how good the books were, but after watching the film I was very disappointed. In the movie there was very little introduction to the characters, you knew almost nothing about them which made Gales Character feel irrelevant and peters history with Katniss unclear. During the intense action scenes the Camera work was shaky and felt unprofessional but could of been forgivable but they failed to deliver on the epic death scenes cutting away just so the it could have a PG rating, it was these lackluster death scenes that made the real threat of the hunger games seem somewhat in-existent. Katniss's tree sleeping scenes were boring and much like many of the scenes where her life was in danger it lacked the suspense it should have got. Although there were some good things about the film, some actions scenes were decent for one but all in all it's very average."
"keith-774","4","4","6","27 April 2012"," Wow, slow
","I saw this movie a bit under duress. As I get older, I get much less tolerant of violence against children. While the brutality didn't warrant an R rating, it was over the top ... and children as young as six were watching the film at the time. It was frustrating that there was so little back story that it was really nothing more than a story about kids beating the snot (and the life) out of each other. But what really bothered me is that the movie is SLOW. Really, really, slow. So slow that my discontent with the violence against children was almost irrelevant. My wife agrees that the movie is slow, and my wife and mother both assure me that Twilight was worse, much worse, but it's hard to believe. Stan Tucci was good. Woody Harrelson was better. The children were OK, but it was hard to tell because the characters were so shallow! And the writing was predictable. When the ""scores"" for Peter and Katniss were announced, I turned before hand and told my wife what they'd be. I had a perfect score.<br/><br/>Like Twilight, fans of the book will freak out and love this show. For the rest of us... well... it's not going to win any academy awards."

","I have not read the books, but this sure comes across as a movie made purely to satisfy those fans. It's a long string of 'must see' scenes that book readers have probably dreamed about seeing on the big screen. While some of those scenes are impressive, and may satisfy on that level, it ignores everything else about a good movie. Characters are terribly developed, dialog is weak, storyline is predictable with way too many convenient developments. I even found the cinematography disturbing. Action/fighting movie fans will even be disappointed as those scenes are nothing but ordinary (except it's disturbingly all children, of course). Romance fans will be saddened at the cheap attempts to make us care about relationships. <br/><br/>But perhaps I could have overlooked all that if they had attempted to address the cultural issue (some may say disease) of reality TV in some cogent and meaningful way. All we get here in broad strokes is: ""It's bad"". Uhhhh thanks, yeah I kinda thought that."

It got to the point where I was just waiting and hoping for a 30 second time period with the camera holding still so I could recover. And I do not get motion sick anywhere... Terrible editing and directing.<br/><br/>It felt like 1/2 the shots in the first 30 minutes were focused so close on their face that you could only see from the eyebrow to the mouth... with a shaky camera and constant cuts and pans. Watch this movie to see what happens when you try to get 30 angles of every scene and then piece them all together.<br/><br/>Honestly, as you watch it count the seconds of continuous film until a new shot. I did this at the first of the film for about 5 minutes and on average it was about 5 seconds. Show this in film school for what not to do."

","NOT spoilers: The script had some potential for a good movie. The director did a good job on the movie overall, except for the fight scenes. The fight scenes were terrible, CAMERA SHAKE, CAMERA SHAKE and some more CAMERA SHAKE. It's like they wanted to make the movie appropriate for children, by not showing any fights. But this movie SHOULD have been cruel to watch because it is ""THE HUNGER GAMES"", not some romance between a gay Vampire and a catatonic teenager. Other than that, I got bored in the first 20 minutes of the movie waiting for something to happen. After the games started there was almost no action. We were watching the protagonist climb trees and sleeping.<br/><br/>SPOILER: Also, a very unrealistic scene was the where the boys and girls from the 1st ans 2nd District were chasing the girl to kill her, she climbed a tree and they just sat there doing nothing and then slept for the night. Do you seriously think that 4 people who are willing to kill you or they will be killed would just sit there and not get you out down from a 5 meter tree since they had arrows, swords or even rocks from the ground! That scene ruined the feeling of the whole movie.<br/><br/>SPOILER: The only scene I enjoyed was after the girl buried Rue and she waved at the camera, District 11, which was where the dead girl came from, started beating up cops."

I think the characters could have been developed more and more of the book included in the movie, other than that I would recommend this movie to anyone who is looking to watch a fun movie.

"phd_travel","2","22","53","23 March 2012"," Only for fans of the books or those who enjoy seeing teens fight to the death
","First of all, the premise of the story is unpleasant. What's so nice about watching teens fight to the death in some kind of survivor gladiator tournament? The plot is irritating and annoying. The changing of the rules back and forth is silly. The pageant like beginning of the competition is out of place. About 20 minutes could have been shaved. The jerky camera action wasn't necessary and gave me a headache.<br/><br/>The casting - apart from Jennifer the rest was hit and miss. Jennifer Lawrence is a believable and moving actress. She is good at looking like she is suffering and has the weight of the world on her shoulders. Her vulnerability and strength are touching. She manages tug some emotional strings as she did in Winter's Bone. But even she can't save material that is weak.<br/><br/>Josh Hutcherson isn't handsome enough for a romantic lead. Even if they didn't want a heartthrob they could have picked someone slightly better looking. The chemistry between them is lacking and the love story unconvincing. There isn't enough reason for her to love him so much. Liam Hemsworth's role isn't big but he looks more earnest. Woody Harrelson as the mentor is too goofy. Donald Sutherland as the President is a bit feeble and looks like he would rather be elsewhere. Wes Bentley is suitably deranged looking. Elizabeth Banks getup is silly.<br/><br/>There are very few good points besides Jennifer Lawrence. It isn't gory or too violent so the family can watch it if they want to. But careful about the message they might be getting. You do want to see how she survives. It is a bit touching in parts eg the initial parting.<br/><br/>Overall not even really worth one watch for all the hype. It wasn't enjoyable or romantic like Twilight. Won't want to watch it again. Please don't make this a box office sensation that smashes all records. It just isn't good. Even enjoyed John Carter more. I think this one is more for fans of the books. If you like the premise of the story then you will probably enjoy it. Otherwise you probably won't."

","Out of the loins of Suzanne Collins comes a movie that bit off more than it could chew. Despite the movie's multiple setbacks, however, the world that Collins created is utterly frightening and eerily familiar. As the hype for this movie increased in recent weeks, the headlines informed non-fans of the basic storyline: kids killing kids. The movie itselfâ€”although not shying away from deathâ€”allowed it to encompass so much more.<br/><br/>The core of this movie stands on the shoulders of Jennifer Lawrence. I've thought hard and cannot honestly think of a better Katniss Everdeen. Her complicated character has to pull off a ""Is this really happening"" look for nearly 40 minutes of screen time. She does it beautifully. Behind herâ€”everyone from Donald Sutherland to the girl who plays Primroseâ€”is a cast that holds its own weight (I'm still unsure about Galeâ€”but that will be decided in Catching Fire).<br/><br/>The main problems with this film derive from the Directorâ€”Gary Ross. Although this director is talented, he has never taken on a project of this size. That much is obvious. From the very start you will see the amateur mistakesâ€”from very poor editing to unfocused shots. The camera moved so much during the action scenes when a simple wide angle would have had more impact on the audience. Hopefully he'll have a handle on it by the second or third film.<br/><br/>As a fan, I feel a must attest to how the movie plays out compared to the book. I was quite surprised how well the movie followed the book. There were things that had to be cut outâ€”the Mockingjay pin coming from the mayor's daughter or eyes of the creatures at the end. Other than that, few changes were made. One problem the audience (and I) was clearly unhappy about was the symbol of the revolution being used in the first half hour of the first movie.<br/><br/>If you are a fan of the books, you should have seen it at midnight. If you haven't seen it, go see it now. If you are not a fan of the series, I have only one thing to say to you: go read the books. This movie is good, but the books will blow you away. If you are not much of a reader, this movie is still worth your time. It holds its own and will (mostly) make sense. As a fan of the series, I expected moreÂ…but was not disappointed.<br/><br/>reillyreviews.wordpress.com"

","I really wasn't sure if I wanted to see this movie as I am not a teenage girl, nor am I a reader of teen books or familiar with any of the actors in this film, but I hadn't had any popcorn for a while so I went with my too young adult daughters. The premise of course has been done before, several times i.e. running man, Logan's run and I think even an episode of star trek dealt with a similar theme. It started out pretty okay though I wish that Katniss' story had not been forced into flashbacks as it would have gave her and Peter a more sympathetic storyline. The movie was cinematically pretty and directed OK. But it got only five stars from me because the Games themselves were boring and the ending was completely unsatisfying. For a movie with such a strong heroine the audience should have been cheering in the end; but there was nothing but silence and a rush to leave the theater. Why? Because we were all stunned by the terrible last half and the completely 'this is all for nothing' ending. Too bad."

","Maybe if you read the books, or maybe if you love watching young people kill each other, or maybe if you like juxtaposing Alice in Wonderland with apocalyptic visions, or, as in this viewer's case, maybe you just want to see what all the commotion was about when this HUNGER GAMES hit the theaters and sold out for weeks...but seeing that there are at least four more sequels scheduled into production through 2015 means we all should know what young people are idolizing. This series is to killing fellow youngsters as the Twilight series is to vampires and werewolves - and we still have another episode in that blood bath to go.<br/><br/>Suzanne Collins wrote the book and contributed to the screenplay along with Billy Ray and director Gary Ross so the result must be satisfactory to those addicted to the concept of THE HUNGER GAMES. According to the brief synopsis (for those who have yet to submit to this 2 Â½ hours of mayhem, the story goes something like this: In a dystopian future, the totalitarian nation of Panem is divided between 12 districts and the Capitol. Each year two young representatives from each district are selected by lottery to participate in The Hunger Games. Part entertainment, part brutal retribution for a past rebellion, the televised games are broadcast throughout Panem. The 24 participants are forced to eliminate their competitors while the citizens of Panem are required to watch. When 16-year-old Katniss' young sister, Prim, is selected as District 12's female representative, Katniss volunteers to take her place. She and her male counterpart Peeta, are pitted against bigger, stronger representatives.'<br/><br/>The story inserts phrases like 'Hope, it is the only thing stronger than fear. A little hope is effective, a lot of hope is dangerous. A spark is fine, as long as it's contained' and 'They just want a good show' in order to make excuses for the wild concept of the movie. The cast includes Jennifer Lawrence, Stanley Tucci, Toby Jones, Donald Sutherland, Woody Harrelson (probably the best performance in the film, sleazy though his character is), Elizabeth Banks (her makeup and costumes are more ridiculous than any of her confrÃ¨res), Lenny Kravitz (the most sensitive of the crew), and hunks Liam Hemsworth and Josh Hutcherson in addition to a cast of thousands. They do with the script what they can.<br/><br/>Perhaps it Is the popularity of the mayhem of the current video games or perhaps it is facing the mess we adults have created of this globe, but it is worrisome that themes of films such as this (and the sequels to come) attract such a positive response form the young adults for whom the book was written and the movie was made. It is almost like we have sunk to the level of the gladiator games of ancient Rome or the cockfights still popular in the little towns of the Americas. Knowing that those who follow reviews of this film will shred it, this viewer has to rely on the oft-repeated phrase form the film, 'May the odds be ever in your favor.' <br/><br/>Grady Harp"

In this future there was once a war and now as some kind of (not quite fully explained) penance to make up for that old war. Each year each zone must pick two children age 12-18 to go to zone 1 and fight each other in a battle to the death. Yes, the children must kill each other. Our hero is a girl from zone 12 who volunteers to go in place of her younger sister who is picked to go, but would not make it five minutes in this battle. From the very beginning of the movie we get that awful, terrible, stupid (you think I don't like it?) documentary style shaking camera movement that persists at random throughout the movie. Cannot understand why this technique adds anything to the movie especially in drama scenes. It certainly makes it much harder to see what is going on.

","I've given it a 6/10 & that one extra star is only because of Jennifer Lawrence's performance, unfortunately for her its also her 1st bad film. I understand that a movie has to be different from the book, due to cinematic reasons, but not this much. Too predictable, lack of any tension, no character development, disjointed scenes, horrible acting from the rest of the cast (except Donald Sutherland - he's always good), repulsive cinematography and most of all, a failure to create any bond between the audience & the protagonists. Basically, it was exactly opposite of what the book was.<br/><br/>One other thing that is increasingly appalling nowadays, is that most mediocre adaptations of books are doing great business at the box-office, or is just the hype good books bring that is responsible for this (and I do not consider the 'Twilight Franchise' as good literature). Whatever it is, the general audience should at least be prudent and skeptical enough before queuing up for the even more lackluster sequels to the subsequent books.<br/><br/>We should comprehend that something is alarmingly wrong with the movie studios, when comic book characters are given superlative visual treatment (not that I'm complaining, I simply adore some superheroes & have grown up reading them), while great novels are dealt with mediocre standards with only well directed marketing and publicity gimmicks, to milk enough dough from the hype these novels generate."
"fogplaya","6","8","16","26 March 2012"," The Hum-Drum Games
","OK, firstly, I only jumped on board with the hype at the last minute, I read the first book about a week before the opening, and have yet to read the sequels and personally I do not care if adaptations stray from the source material. That's fine. It's good, it means that the script- writers, directors, actors etc. are not completely brain dead, so any review comparing the two materials is just redundant as literature and film are two different mediums that cannot be compared. <br/><br/>The film:<br/><br/>Acting: 7/10 I don't get the hype over Jennifer Lawrence. She was good, but not amazing. They could have done worse; she held her own over the show and I must admit she didn't screw up so credit is due there, most of the other actors were sub par, but again, didn't screw up too badly. Little Rue held her own and her death scene was quite powerful, but was ruined by the lack of violence (I'll explain my problem with the whole lack of violence on it's own later), Josh Hutcherson was alright. Not as strong as Jennifer, but not as weak as Liam Hemsworth. The adult actors were not dreadful; but not amazing enough for merit.<br/><br/>Story: 9/10 The film's story was interesting, especially how they managed to explain every aspect fully and successfully so the film was clear and well done. It's not an original story by far, but the plot is great and it's expressed in a very universal way. <br/><br/>Direction: 3/10 Awfully directed in my opinion. I hate hand held camera's and the shaky- cam in this film was over used to death. My biggest hang up of this film over all is the lack of violence. Yes, I understand that to appeal to the wider audience they had to cut back on the gore, violence etc. But in my opinion they went too far. Rue's death wasn't half as impacting as it should have been, neither Cloves', Cato's, Marvel's or even Peeta's injury. They held back and the film greatly suffered and lost the majority of it's impact, stunting the story and the cohesion of the film as a whole. The directing wasn't a one because when the directer finally put away the shaky-cam for a moment the shots were nice and decent, but most of the action, albeit had to be re framed made little or no sense- case in point- Clove tackling Katniss, the actress Jenifer Lawrence had a good six inches from the angle of the camera over Clove, and with the obnoxious unrelenting of the camera movement I can give no reasonable explanation to how that little girl over powered Katniss. And when Thresh killed Clove I had roll my eyes at the blatant awfulness of the death itself. I'm not a gore hound, I admit, I might be biased: I like violence, but this film's sequences are barely coherent and sadly really ruined the viewing experience. <br/><br/>Overall I give this a six. Not an awful film by any standards. And maybe a re-viewing of the film again with more attentiveness on my part it could be better, or it could just be the sheer audacity of the producers to cut away much of the impact of violence ( a huge theme, I might add) for more profit revenue. Thank you Hollywood. But hey, the sets were pretty and the effects were good, well, all except Katniss' barely flaming costume.<br/><br/>Over and out."

( i know there to make it feel like its real but now i just think it was to cover up bad effects!)<br/><br/>lovely story line. good acting but no chemistry between characters, no memorable characters.and thats what made twilight addictive was that chemistry the awkwardness the tension.i know its hard when people are hunting you but there was scene where they could have (cave scene) if its not a romance then don't cut out the killing! No build up to anything. and have to say disappointed with effects on the scary killing things that chased them.<br/><br/>love the sets though and costumes were interesting.<br/><br/>but yea unless there's a dramatic change wont be going to see 2nd installment (to be honest because of the bad screen play writing didn't really think there was a buildup for a second.)"
"tiffnguyen06","6","7","14","30 March 2012"," Disappointment sums it up
","WOW this was a complete disappoint from the book. It lacked emotional depth, character development, relationship dynamics, and meaning that the book strongly portrayed. Like many movies based off books, parts need to be cut out to meet time requirements i understand that but come on! The director took out a lot of the important parts, almost essential to making the movie more meaningful rather than just action-pack. A lot of good parts were taken out of the movie.<br/><br/>The one thing that bothers me most are the characters portrayal were flat not at all dynamic, there was no character development at all especially in Katniss and Peeta, his character seemed much less significant than in the book and overall appear weak. Their relationship on screen also lacked chemistry and gradual progression.<br/><br/>The whole point of hunger games is HUNGER, poverty, the rich ridding the poor districts through those games and keeping those districts in poverty. I don't think anything was mentioned about the origin or the ""real"" purpose of the games. Was there? Katniss was suppose to feel unfamiliar staying at the Capitol almost angry at the way they lived and behaved which didn't show and which I think is also important to the overall theme. AND oh yeah the wolves towards the end was a total disappointment. It was important to portray the Capitol as insensitive and inhumane by resembling the wolves as the tributes who died.<br/><br/>AND the camera technique/style was terrible. I was afraid I was gonna be nauseated during the movie when the camera kept moving. Kind of reminded me of the movie Cloverfield, worst movie ever by the way, I had to leave because I felt so nauseated. Director should not use that shooting style.<br/><br/>Movies based off of books are never up to par. They end up butchering great work. I blame the director not the actors. This movie was just okay. It had potential but failed to deliver."
"scotts22","5","7","14","29 March 2012"," Meh, it was okay.
","I agree with the reviewer who disliked the shaky camera work. I definitely felt nauseous and couldn't enjoy those scenes. I also don't approve of the subject matter (not that I'm some old stick in the mud) I just thought the idea of teen on teen murder for televised thrills is a little morbid and disturbing. Plus they gave no background as to why the city people were so different... i mean, what's with all the crazy outfits and makeup? I kept expecting SOMEONE (one of the kids) to stand up and say, ""Hey what's a matter with you people?! Does no one think that this is sick and depraved?"" What would happen if the kids refused to kill each other?"

","I went to a midnight screening of this movie having not read the books. I consider myself quite the movie critic and to be honest, it takes quite a lot to impress me these days.<br/><br/>I can understand that the books series is a fan favorite and that 50% of the positive reviews on this site will be from avid ""fanbois"" who can't see passed the fact that this movie is quite average fan fare at best. I'm assuming the other 50% are from either teeny bop teenagers who don't know any better or adults that probably don't have triple digit IQ's.<br/><br/>So I went into the midnight screening, blank slate, hoping to be wowed. I'll start by saying this - The first 1/3 - 1/2 of the movie, actually had me hooked for a little bit. Not knowing the background story of the world, I initially found myself craving more information about the plight of the people of district 12. Then after looking at the well rounded figured of the actress that plays Katniss.. I found myself thinking ""Hang on.. She doesn't look hungry at all..""...<br/><br/>The movie for me went downhill after the actual games start. This isn't because the movie shows not one drop of blood spilled or a death scene.. It was just because it was done so poorly. Shaky camera angles a good action scene do not make. I hate to point out the obvious comparison between this movie and Battle Royale, but come on... It's pretty much the exact same concept, except this is like the poor under aged mans Battle Royale.<br/><br/>There is literally no character development for any of the other tributes apart from Peeta and Katniss, and their love story seems forced and awkward. Are we supposed to like Peeta? He just comes off as a hopeless whining ****.<br/><br/>Oh well.. Nothing I can say can change the fact that you've probably seen/or will see this movie. Here's hoping for the sequel they actually capture some of this magic these ""best selling"" books are supposed to have."
"deacon_blues-3","4","5","9","22 September 2012"," Action for teen morons
","I can't decide which are more contrived and dishonest; the authorities conducting the Hunger Games within the film, or the authorities who made this film! I see little difference between the moronic Sector 1 audience in the film and the mentality of those who are fans of the film itself; both have been duped into obsessing over a contrived, shallow, sick story premise and an event that makes no sense from beginning to end. <br/><br/>First, the whole story premise is sick, and does not provide any sane justification for a rebel movement to sign a truce. If any real rebellion were offered the hunger games as terms of surrender, they would simply go on fighting to the last person rather than submit to such a monstrous compromise. <br/><br/>Second, if the event is really a fight to the death with only one victor, alliances are patently ridiculous, since this is not a season of the Survivor TV show where one person gets voted off and another gets immunity at the end of each episode; here all you have to do is quickly kill any of your fellow tributes when their back is turned, so there is no sane reason for any alliances. It would have to be every tribute for himself, exclusively.<br/><br/>Third, it is completely unrealistic to have the two victors at the end win without ever having actually killed anyone! How stupid! You could never finish such an event without having to kill at least one or two people on your own! When it's kill or be killed, you can't just hide until everyone else is dead and then claim victory. Once again, this is not Survivor! It's a fight to the death, not hide and seek! <br/><br/>But now all the shallow Sector 1 morons that liked this movie will be panting for the next one. They deserve to be put into the hunger games and experience it for themselves, thus ridding the world of a little more of it's ponderous moronic burden."

","There are no words to describe the feeling that has inhabited my chest. I am not entirely sure I can process what was shown before my very eyes. Was it the horrific terror that chilled my spine and paralyzed me to my seat? Was it the breathtakingly beautiful romantics? I'm not entirely sure, but I know my cheeks are still sticky from the constant run of tears.<br/><br/>From the obvious despair shown in the district, to the snarling mutated wolves, the movie was horrific. Beautiful, but terrifying. The Capitol citizens were...unbelievable. I had never even imagined such monstrosities on human beings. Comparing 12 to the Capitol, I could visually understand Katniss's dumbfounded transition from starving to starring-in a cruel reality television show, I mean. A wonderful movie all in all. Some parts may be a bit intense for really young kids, though. There were a couple 3rd graders in my theater, and they were jumping in their seats. Still a must-see. Suzanne Collins and Gary Ross (and all cast and crew, of course) really made a phenomenon."

But I am older, almost 50, and I almost fell asleep. To me, this movie was like a lame remake of The Running Man. Add the concept of the reluctant hero (like Rambo, who also happens to have a bow), and some really cute kids, and there you go! I also disliked the frequent use of jerky, hand-held camera.<br/><br/>The good?

","After reading these amazing books, my expectations were very high. I thought the movie stayed very true to the books and the essence of this story. The movie was, for me, a facilitator of the images I constructed in my head as I was reading the books. I HIGHLY recommend reading the books before watching the movies because most of the books are about Katniss' way of seeing things, how she felt, etc and of course, that's hard to catch in a movie so the books are helpful in many scenes where the things Katniss says are important to understand the full meaning of the scene. If I had to choose between the movie and the books, of course I'd choose the books but gladly, I don't have to choose and I can enjoy both masterpieces. Can't wait for Catching Fire!!!!!!!"

","I was very fortunate to get a ticket to the UK premiere of The Hunger Games in London, and it was an amazing experience.<br/><br/>I'm not completely sure what I was expecting with this movie, but I can definitely say that I was very impressed. It was never going to be an easy task to put these brilliant books and turn them into a successful movie franchise.<br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence's acting is absolutely superb, she outshone everyone in the movie. A few of her scenes were so intense that I felt myself on the verge of tears. Elizabeth Banks as Effie and Woody Harrelson as Haymitch also stood out for me. They were almost exactly how I pictured their characters to be and played them down to a tee. To be honest, I think everyone done a very good job.<br/><br/>Now for the movie itself. I think some of the die-hard book fans will have a few moans and groans about the changes that have been made for the movie. A few of the changes had me raising my eyebrows, but I can understand why these changes have had to be made, and they have done it very well. My personal favourite is the 'execution' of Seneca Crane. That was absolutely brilliantly done, I had to try not laugh at the genius of it. I won't say what happens, I don't want to spoil it for anyone, but I think it will definitely cause a few chuckles.<br/><br/>Although, there is a major change to a part at the end that I think a lot of people will not be happy with regarding Peeta. To be perfectly honest, this was the one change I was not very happy with. Such an important part of the book to be left out, although I can see why they have done it. Again, I am not going to spoil, I'll let everyone judge it for themselves.<br/><br/>I've also noticed how everyone is concerned about the violence... I'm not going to lie, it is quite brutal. Although you don't see a lot of the physical violence, some of the scenes were very difficult to watch (and I'm a 20 year old female who has seen her fair share of horrors). I think it's the brutality of watching children killing each other. The scene with Cato, Peeta and Katniss was particularly disturbing for me.<br/><br/>There's a few added scenes that gives us a little look into some of the Districts reactions to the games (watch out for District 11's, that really moved me). Also a look into the Gamemakers room and into President Snows character (Donald Sutherland is PERFECT in this role).<br/><br/>All in all, the movie was absolutely amazing, done quite well to stick to the book, but I think people should try to separate this movie from the book as much as possible to make it even more enjoyable.<br/><br/>I would give it a solid 9/10, and I look forward to Catching Fire!"

","Few people locked on an island (or in a game and) they need to kill each other till just one survivor is left. And this entire thing being televised to everyone. Does this plot ring any bell? If you have not seen ""The Condemned"", directed by Scott Wiper with Steve Austin, or ""The Tournament"", directed by Scott Mann with Robert Carlyle / Kelly Hu, or ""Death Race"", by Paul W. S. Anderson with Jason Statham, or ""DOA: Dead or Alive"", directed by Corey Yuen with Holly Valance, then the movie will be something completely new for you. <br/><br/>However, if you have seen any of those, then your mind unintentionally will go back to those movies and you'll find things very predictable. Need not to mention, this movie is a clear remake of Battle Royale – a Japanese movie of 2001. <br/><br/>In spite of all those odds against it, the movie does leave a mark on you. Director didn't make this with any sort of inspiration from its other siblings and you kind of find genuineness in the way it is made. You are not concerned much about other districts here except for Districts 12 whose pair are protagonists of the movie.<br/><br/>The movie doesn't look long or short and director concentrated in what he wanted to show, avoiding other distractions which could have easily happened in such a movie. There is not much of blood or gory scenes depicted on screen. Lot of things are indirectly told for you to understand. Enough time has been spent in showing the preparation of Hunger Games and the build up to it. <br/><br/>Acting by all is awesome and the dressing / makeup is stunning. Capital people look classy and everyone seemed to enjoy Hunger Games. Movie is a good watch, however I never felt that I am watching a masterpiece or something. I was surprised to see that it broke some record of highest weekend gross. I doubt it is that good. May be a one- time watch and then move on.<br/><br/>Summary : Watch it and you'll not regret your decision. If you have to pick between Hunger Games and Wrath of the Titan, pick Hunger Games, however don't go with sky high expectations."

","I had a chance to attend the premiere of The Hunger Games on 3/12/2012 in downtown LA. I read the entire book cover to cover the day before the premiere, so the book was very fresh in my mind when I watched. I was excited to see the movie, as I thought the book lent itself to amazing potential for a movie.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the movie was very disappointing on multiple levels. The character development was virtually non-existent. The movie felt rushed even though it was 140+ minutes long—they tried to stay too true to the book, but the problem with this was that they never went deep enough to address the major themes of the book.<br/><br/>Other than Jennifer Lawrence, the acting was not very memorable and probably best described as mediocre. The emotions expressed by the actors seemed very inconsistent with the horrifying experience they were purportedly living through. There was minimal development of the supporting cast.<br/><br/>While the movie had its flaws, it was pretty well made, well filmed and I think it probably stood on its own (although it's hard for me to assess that given that I read the book). The producers at Lionsgate clearly had an objective of dumbing this movie down and toning the violence down for commercialization purposes. The problem with this is that they deny Suzanne Collins and the readers of the book a quality movie."

"aussithepony","1","4","7","23 September 2012"," Amazing book, horrible movie.
","Basically, I hated the Hunger Games. Having read the book first (and adoring Thresh, the tribute from 11) I was expecting more bloodshed, gore, and maybe a bit more heartfelt words from Thresh, as there were in the book.<br/><br/>My biggest problem with all adaptations are when movies leave out the funnies to pt in the soppies. Harry Potter did the exact same to the point where one semi-main character was left out until the second from last movie, and another one wasn't there at all. However, The Hunger Games has even broken the chain, making Catching Fire movie needing lots of changes to fit in with both the book and the Hunger Games movie.<br/><br/>First part they left out which I loved in the book was Haymitch falling off the stage drunk. I mean, who didn't love that? They left it out of the movie however, and Haymitch wasn't nearly as drunk as I imagined him. Weird, but acceptable. Maybe having an alcoholic wasn't allowed for some daft movie reason.<br/><br/>The next part that got me annoyed (ad the part that is gonna be hard to fix) is Finnick Odair. If you haven't read Catching Fire you're gonna be really confused at that name. But here's the quick summary of him: He's handsome, he's a career, he's from 4, and he's handsome. Hansome doesn't mean too much to me (I still prefer Thresh) but it's a major point so I thought it should be put twice. In the movie when Haymitch is explaining career tributes he mentions they're the tributes from 1 and 2, but not 4. In the career pack, it's only the tributes from 1 and 2 (and Peeta and the boy from 3). So that's gonna be hard to get around.<br/><br/>Third part: Too much before games, too little during games. The games takes up 2/3s of the book, but only about 1/2 of the movie. Should be more. Less kissing, more killing I say.<br/><br/>Fourth part: Cato and Clove aren't in love?! Surely they are, they are in the book right? At least that's how I imagined them. And Clove seems a bit short for a supposed 18 year old (another problem as Finnick was 14).<br/><br/>Last problem: Where's Thresh's lines gone? In the movie, Thresh says little, but even then he's a major important character. Thresh captured my heart more in the book than in the movie (not due to the actor, he was pretty cute but due to script) and from about 2 pages of heart felt dialogs between him and Katniss to one line. Which is even cut from the original line. Seriously, they didn't even have his interview on.<br/><br/>Brilliant book, horrible movie. And that's why you shouldn't get it on DVD (there's no deleted scenes or goof ups either!)"
"davy007","1","4","7","19 September 2012"," Leaving me dissatisfied...
","For myself, this movie only left me feeling depressed that true justice was never achieved. People under complete rule of a dictatorship being forced into an arena of death for the enjoyment of others. How very sad true justice was never obtained by the throwing down of these leaders of tyranny. If this had in fact been achieved, I would have given it a slightly better rating but as it stands, it does not even merit a rating of 1 in my book.<br/><br/>I would like to pose this question to the creators of this film: Why wasn't justice served? At least in the movie ""Gladiator"", for all of its blood and gore, Maximus obtained justice by killing the evil Commodus.<br/><br/>I think perhaps all of the adults involved in the making of this movie should be placed into the arena and the last person left alive should have to spend the rest of his/her life in rehabilitation and Community Service.<br/><br/>If it's justice you seek, you won't find it here in ""The Hunger Games""."

The parts that were very stretched out and long in the books, didn't even seem that important in the movie. Like the cave part or the rue thing.<br/><br/>2.

","This review is from a 26 year old who has read the book.<br/><br/>I don't want to seem to jump on the band waggon of people who say's ""its not as good as the book"" as this was going to be guaranteed.<br/><br/>Therefore, I will start with the good. Well, one good point really. I think all the readers can agree that Katniss is a very complicated character to play, with multitude of emotions. And I think that Jennifer Lawrence did a good job, considering screenplay she had to work with. This is probably the main positive of the movie.<br/><br/>Now the negatives. For me (personally), the lack of gore and fighting (and hence making it a 12A instead of a 15) wasn't the problem. I didn't like the book because of the gore. I liked the book because it made me feel happy, sad, anger and compassion at different times. It made me care about the characters and what happened to them... how a good book should. This is where the movie failed for me. After asking my friends about the movie (who haven't read the book), they said that they found that they didn't care about the characters during the movie, whether if they died or survived. I think this hits the nail on the head. <br/><br/>A book can achieve a connection between the reader and the characters by creating depth to the characters and more importantly richness of the relationships between characters. By doing this, the reader can relate to the internal feelings of the characters at major situations throughout the book. Hence, the reader will find themselves wanting good things to happen to the main characters such as Katniss and Peeta, and feel emotional pain when bad things happen to them. But this takes pages and pages of emotive descriptions, which is hard to portray on screen. Therefore, the writers had to balance between the depths of characters/relationships with the breadth of storyline within the given time frame, which was probably by far the biggest hurdle. This is where I sympathise with the screen writers. The movie was already 2 hours and 20 minutes long. It would over have to be a lot longer to do achieve this balance. But, obviously that is way too long for a movie. Therefore, as a movie this was destined to fail... maybe as a TV series where there is more time to develop this connection with the characters could have worked better. Who knows?"

It kept drifting off into these scenic bits with soft music that didn't make any sense and it kept reminding you that you were watching a movie so you aren't held in and your brain starts picking at those threads.<br/><br/>it isn't terrible. It just doesn't really work."

","I must say I've read the books and I loved this movie. It is two and a half hours that goes by in the blink of an eye. If you've read the books and know the context surrounding everything that happens here, the movie flows smoothly, adheres to the books in MOST cases, and leaves little to be desired. If, however, you haven't read it, you won't like it as much. There are many things (won't get into specifics) that go unexplained or under-explained; stuff that is explained through the first person point of view in the book just can't be explained as thoroughly in the movie. If you've read the book, you know everything and you're a bystander watching the events unfold without the extra Katniss commentary. If you haven't read it, you will probably have a lot of questions. I think it's a movie that is obviously aimed at Hunger Games readers and it does an excellent job with that audience. It's still a good film for everyone else, it just isn't a ten, probably more of a 7."

","I love this movie, although parents may not be to fond of it. But otherwise the movie is great, thrilling, and addicting. I don't think I would ever get tired of it. But if you haven't read the book, I strongly recommend reading it, the movie was missing a lot of other details from the book. I do wish it had more details, the movie was really bland compared to the book. I was disappointed of the movie not having some stuff from the book. But in all the movie is great, I'm so glad they made a movie for it, it gives you the person to visualize while your reading and increases the great experience. Again read the book, you won't regret it, even if you hate reading, this book will make you love reading!"
"skb218","8","13","34","23 March 2012"," As good as it can get
","I read the books and absolutely loved them. When I saw the trailers for the movie, I got excited--I wanted to curb my excitement, though, and I'm glad I did. A word to anyone who read the books and wants to see the movie: the movie is NEVER as good. Keep that in mind.<br/><br/>However, this movie did a really good job of keeping the key components of the story in the movie and trying to explain them the best they could: I could only find about six small things that they changed from the book, which is amazing as far as book adaptations go. You have to realize, though--there's no way they can have the whole book in one two-hour movie.<br/><br/>So many people are complaining that the book was so vivid and so detailed. If you want a close to probably four hour movie or have it broken into two parts (which I'm sure everyone would hate as well), then be my guest. But honestly, if you just read the books, the movie is astounding.<br/><br/>There were minute details in the book that Collins spent chapters writing. And guess what? No physical action actually happened. So many thoughts and emotions that were drawn out in the book had to be broken down to a ten-second close-up on Jennifer Lawrence. There was simply no other way to do it . . . unless, of course, the whole movie was narrated or Katniss talked to herself incessantly (far worse alternatives in my opinion).<br/><br/>But enough about the adaptation. I was kind of thrown by some of the casting choices for awhile, but they did not disappoint. Jennifer Lawrence, Josh Hutcherson, and Lenny Kravitz did so well--Hutcherson in particular. I really liked the costumes for the Games themselves and the Capitol people. The District 12 costumes were bland and kind of ugly, but they were supposed to be, so no complaints there. The Arena was exactly how I pictured it.<br/><br/>Pretty much the only thing I didn't like about this movie was the camera work. The camera never stopped moving. I understand that it's an action movie, but we don't have to have action when everyone is just sitting around and talking. I really wish the director wouldn't have gone for that style. i don't know very many people who actually like it.<br/><br/>Another thing that I think they could have done to make the movie more enjoyable was to add in some more ""down time""--everything is super intense the whole movie, and it would have been nice to have a breather here and there. It worked how it was, but I think I would have liked it a little more.<br/><br/>All in all, this was a great adaptation from the book. But it's just that--an adaptation. If you haven't read the books, you're probably going to be confused and think it's a really shallow movie. If you have read the books, you can fill in the blanks for all their thoughts and the deeper meaning to it--just enjoy the Hunger Games coming to life."
"user-35583","8","5","10","15 September 2012"," Solid start for this trilogy
","Having read the books, I wasn't sure how they would capture this dystopian adventure on film. I was pleasantly surprised. This movie does a nice job of setting up the back-story and history leading up to the Hunger Games themselves. I thought that the casting was on the spot and Jennifer Lawrence captures the depth and strength of our heroine Katniss with aplomb. The book had a fairly dense storyline, so there are always sacrifices that must be made in bringing it to film. However, the story hits the high points well. While it's a little slow out of the gate, it finishes strong. If I had to offer a criticism, it would be the lack of emotional depth in some scenes, which too often was sacrificed to the momentum of the story. I expect that the coming 2nd film will be the real highlight of this series as the book was packed with action."
"imdb2-556-923983","6","5","10","8 April 2012"," A lot of things it is, but a good movie it is not
","Virtually all reviews I've read for ""The Hunger Games"" were favorable/unfavorable towards it based on the sole criterion of whether it was a faithful adaptation. Well, I haven't read the book and I don't care. A review is useful to me if it tells me whether this is a good movie. Likewise, I don't care whether it is a good setup for its two upcoming(?) sequels, only whether it stands on its own merit. So, with that in mind, here's my impression of it:<br/><br/>The first thirty minutes of it, or so, were a good setup for a movie that is an intelligent commentary about social polarization and the dehumanization of ""all who are not us"", as well as about the unreality of reality game shows (which, I must say, the entire movie depicts fairly accurately, with no exaggeration except in the most superficial dimension).<br/><br/>Sadly, after that, the movie loses its edge. Characterizations (of the dystopian world as well as its inhabitants) are done with a spatula rather than with a paintbrush, and are often too saccharine-filled to be believable in all but G-rated movies. Far more disturbingly, the characters, after speeches of ""I will make them remember me"" do nothing but play the game according to its own rules. There is no place where the movie extends, to any serious extent, beyond the reality of the game and its rules. What a shame. The opportunity was right there for the taking...<br/><br/>... and the movie hints that it will be taken in a sequel.<br/><br/>Well, I bought a ticket to see a movie, not a long trailer, and I don't think I'll buy a second ticket just to see another."
"Timeee","6","5","10","31 March 2012"," What am I missing here?
","I don't get what's the fuss about this film. <br/><br/>To me it seemed like an excuse for a straightforward action-flick from the very beginning. The basic idea- people killing each other as part of a show- dates back to Antiquity. We've seen it countless times, in all settings and styles imaginable. As far as original ideas are concerned, this film- or the book, for that matter- doesn't even qualify for the competition. <br/><br/>But that's OK. I like a straightforward action-flick. To be fair, it was a decently entertaining movie. But that's about the highest praise I can think of.<br/><br/>The whole idea of a tense, psychological manhunt, with believable scenes and a careful pacing- that I was sort of hoping for- quickly ended up as a B-movie for kids. I just couldn't take any of it seriously. The whole 'world' in which this story takes place is all-too-obviously artificial, built hastily in order to give some supposedly-needed context for the whole 'Hunger Games'. It doesn't have any depth, any identity or personality. I don't know about the books, but I have a feeling I wouldn't like the written background story very much either. It's like... would anyone give a s**t about the whole imagined universe, unless the Hunger Games? It's just a decorum, but one I couldn't care less about.<br/><br/>But that still would be OK. I just wanted a show. A cool manhunt, one where characters have to make tough decisions, where their true strengths and weaknesses come to light. Instead I was treated to the above mentioned kids movie. Genetically modified bees, gigantic dogs and godly f***ing firestorms coming out of nowhere, with no previous hint that they even exist. Rules randomly changed in the middle of the game. Characters eagerly conforming to their assigned unidimensional roles as 'arrogant bad guy' and 'nice kids who actually couldn't hurt a fly'. The nice kids are then conveniently killed off by bad guys or poison themselves only leaving the heroine the task to mourn them. Ridiculous, stupid tactics that no one would use, like placing all your belongings in the middle of a mine-field or sleeping like you're dead while the person you're trying to kill is camping on the tree... wtf was that?? All too often, the heroine was just saved by pure luck and lack of sense; I mean, seriously how far could she have wandered after being bitten by those bees? The others had all the time to arrange stuff around the mine-field, but not to walk like 100 meters further and kill one of their most dangerous opponents (supposedly). <br/><br/>Anyway, I'm not trying to be overparticular, but the originality and the story being clearly not worth for consideration, about the only criterion by which this movie could be worth something is how cool, ingenious and smart they made the manhunt. It seems to me that everyone just took the safe way and piled up a bunch of clichÃ©s and/or ultimately dull scenes. I mean were you once surprised by the turn of events? Do you remember thinking wow, I wouldn't have thought he/she/they would do that? What a surprise?<br/><br/>Ps. In spite of this all, Jennifer Lawrence rocks, I hope to see her in some cool movies over the next years. After she finishes this trilogy, I mean."

","I found this movie as, if not, more exiting than the book. There are a couple things Lionsgate could've done to make the movie better, such as gone more into the story at the beginning, when they just did a brief skim over important details. Such as the cat, and how Katniss met Gale.<br/><br/>The overall setup of the movie is fantastic, and it's obvious the director knew what he was doing with casting and shooting this film. Nothing really drags on, and goes on forever, unlike some movies I've seen.<br/><br/>I gave this movie an 8 out of 10 because I found it captivating right from the start."

","The Hunger Games, the first movie of the series to come.<br/><br/>I have not read the books yet, which two of my friends keep recommending me to do. I have asked one to lend me all the books, which I expect to enjoy a lot when reading. I can't say yet the books are better than the movies or vice versa unfortunately, but I hope they are on the same level. <br/><br/>I have always liked the concept of this movie, having thought of it before I knew the books even existed. I had never seen Jennifer Lawrence in a movie before so I was interested to see how it would work out. In the end, I think she did a good job. She's a good representation of a rebellious, young girl who doesn't want to go along with the system, but has to. I have seen Josh Hutcherson in multiple movies, movies in which I didn't like him. I did like him in this role and since seeing this movie I have seen him in another movie where I liked him(Bridge to Terabithia). I have always loved Woody Harrelson and although he only has a small role in this movie, I love his character. <br/><br/>The story itself is well-thought of. The concept, yet brutal, is very interesting. I would say it's quite predictable. Of course the main character lives to see another day, of course she ends up with Peeta. Nevertheless, the movie is exciting and fascinating. Good acting, a good story and a good outcome of the movie. I look forward to seeing the rest of the movies of this series."
"KostersK","8","8","19","24 March 2012"," Fantastic. No it is not Battle Royale, no it is not Twilight.
","Fantastic. No it is not Battle Royale, no it is not Twilight. Yes, I can see similarities to Battle Royal in how the competition is held, executed, and even the end result all together. However, Battle Royal is a Japanese film that has it's culture deeply embedded with in it, not to mention the heavy use of guns and other weapons not allowed or seen in The Hunger Games. Battle Royal is also incredibly gory and violent having no official rating in the US due to such factors. There is also the entire story surrounding the competitions which differ completely. There is no resemblance to Twilight other than that it will likely have a huge following, most of which will likely be the same age group and possibly even the same fans. Now that I have that out of the way, the film was very well done. The acting was very believable, which is important to note due to the huge science fiction or fantasy like culture that exists within the capitol when you have such derelict conditions within the districts. With this you have two very different cultures that make up the same nation-state. The filming in a few scenes could be described as shaky, which I know from past experience will bother those who are sensitive to such methods. However, I do not think most will notice it, and the majority of the movie was filmed quite well. The Hunger Games as a whole was all done very well, with the exception that the ending was rather anti-climatic. The ending truly just drifts off for the await of the next film in the series. I personally would have liked to have seen more violence and gore, but doing so would be unnecessary due to the context and target audience of the movie. Now that the movie is in full release I would highly recommend those reading this to go see it. I don't think you will be disappointed.<br/><br/>For my full review, visit http://visuallyimpairedreviews.blogspot.com/2012/03/hunger-games.html"
"gregeichelberger","6","8","19","22 March 2012"," 'Running Man' meets 'Survivor'
","With a built-in audience of mostly 14-17-year old girls, director Gary Ross (""Pleasantville,"" ""Seabiscuit"") puts together a rather faithful version of the best-selling Suzanne Collins' ""Hunger Games"" trilogy, telling the tale of a post-apocalyptic North America divided into 12 districts.<br/><br/>And while the film is definitely well-acted, decently-paced and competently-directed, the subject matter of children and young teenagers fighting one another to the death may lead some parents to think twice about bringing their own kids to the picture.<br/><br/>With the country having gone through a rebellion years before, the government has instituted a punishment of sorts to be inflicted on the the treasonous districts. This rather bizarre action includes taking a young male and female from each area and forcing all of them to fight to the death.<br/><br/>These Hunger Games, begun as punitive, have since turned into a media sensation, with celebrations and a highly-rated ""reality"" show to highlight the selections. Smarmy host, Caesar Flickerman (Stanley Tucci, ""The Lovely Bones""), even does Ryan Seacrest/Geraldo Rivera-type commentary and interviews with the selectees.<br/><br/>Coming out of the most remote district (No. 12) is super bow hunter Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence, Oscar-nominated for ""Winter's Bone"") and baker's apprentice Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson, ""Journey 2: Mysterious Island""). The movie informs us that Katniss volunteered for this punishment to protect her little sister, Primrose, who was originally chosen.<br/><br/>The movie also informs us that in the near future, names like Katniss, Peeta and Primrose, will become commonplace. In addition, despite an all-powerful police state dictatorship which can take rip young people from the arms of their families at will, the populace seems to take it all in stride and dresses like rejects from any city's Gay Pride parade, with hairdos similar to the Whos of Whoville.<br/><br/>One cannot help but weep for a fashion future that makes the 1970s look understated and conservative.<br/><br/>Katniss and Peeta are soon whisked off to the capital, where they meet their mentor, Haymitch Abernathy (Woody Harrelson), the overbearing chaperon Effie Trinket (Elizabeth Banks, ""Man On a Ledge"" and looking like Johnny Depp in drag on the set of ""Alice In Wonderland"") and clothing designer Cinna (singer Lenny Kravitz).<br/><br/>They are also introduced to the producer of the Hunger Games TV show, Seneca Crane (Wes Bentley, ""American Beauty,"" ""Ghost Rider""), as well as the other ""contestants,"" each with their own special survival and/or fighting skill.<br/><br/>About an hour into the movie, the games actually begin, with the kids going after one another with swords, axes, scimitars, bows and arrows, as well as other instruments of destruction. The quick-cut, hand-held ""Cloverfield""-type camera work here diffuses some of the gore in these sequences - a bit, but we still know what's going on.<br/><br/>Katniss, even though an expert archer who has spent most of her youth in the woods, nevertheless has difficulty adjusting, as some weird alliances are formed specifically against her (why some of the selectees would align themselves with anyone, though, since only one can survive, is a bit questionable).<br/><br/>The viewer will have to see for themselves what happens during these games, but a few unexpected twists make the conclusion a real surprise (unless of course, one has already read the book - which, thankfully I had not).<br/><br/>Top-notch acting, especially from Lawrence, Tucci, Banks and Harrelson, and surprisingly by Hutcherson and Kravitz, lift this genre over similar films such as the ""Narnia"" franchise, but below the ""Harry Potter"" and ""Lord Of the Rings"" series, however. Meanwhile, Tucci's running commentaries on the games brings to mind Richard Dawson in ""Running Man"" and Fred Willard in ""Best Of Show"" (although the latter two had much better one-liners).<br/><br/>Still, in these movie doldrum months, ""The Hunger Games,"" while not great, is certainly an effective and workmanlike effort and is sure to top the box office as well as produce a sequel or two in the future."

"chris-333-55821","10","7","16","24 June 2012"," Did the book Justice
","When I saw the first trailers for 'The Hunger Games' paid it no mind, especially after reading comments like the ones on this page stating it was 'Battle Royal with cheese' and 'like Twilight'. However, my wife after reading the books convinced me to do the same. As a 30 year old bloke I'm not ashamed to say the trilogy of books is outstanding, it is gripping, emotion filled, a riveting read from start to finish.<br/><br/>I finally got around to watching the film yesterday and after reading some of the criticisms here I felt compelled to address them.<br/><br/>1. Shaky cam: I've seen a few films where this technique is used to disastrous effect, the only point to it seems to be to make you feel sick. However, in The Hunger Games, the shaky cam is shot from eye level, often just behind the main characters head in a weird '3rd person' viewpoint that really, really works. I almost wept on a number of occasions as the emotions of the main characters hits you like a brick to the face. This is down to the amazing Directing skills of Gary Ross (I'll certainly be looking up more of his work).<br/><br/>2. 'It's just a rip off of Battle Royal': Please. Three prerequisites are required for anyone to come to this conclusion: i - You've watched Battle Royal ii - As it's a cult film, you feel smug and special because you've watched it and the 'idiot main stream audience' haven't. iii - You haven't bothered to watched 'The hunger games'.<br/><br/>Only on the internet, could this lazy opinion be allowed to propagate.<br/><br/>Seriously, saying ""its like battle royal"" because ""kids are forced to fight to the death"" in both? Oh great, well in that case Harry Potter is exactly the same as Buffy the Vampire Slayer because both ""involve school kids fighting monsters with 'magic'"". See, I can be intentionally misleading too. Granted, there are parallels that can be drawn between the two movies, well, one parallel, that's all in fact.<br/><br/>3. It's just another Twilight What? Because it supposedly involves a 'love triangle' between teenagers? Well, whoopdiedo, the internet guff is propagating again. Twilight is an awful movie, the direction is lazy, the plot is lazy, simple and dull, the only thing in the film is the love story. Though to be fair, there's not much you can do when you start with the premise 'Girl meets Vampire'. In contrast the love story in The Hunger Games barely registers, it's background, it's not what the film is about.<br/><br/>The only thing these two movies have in common is the amazing scenery and...OK, Joseph does look a bit like Gale.<br/><br/>4. It isn't true to the book. Yes it is, and where it deviates it does so for good reason, and it does so exceptionally well (either to simplify too-complex-for-screen issues, remove unnecessary characters, or to simply make the story better). This is the best book adaptation I have ever seen, and I include LotR in that."

","I loved this movie and saw it three times in the movie theaters. Yeah they didn't include some characters like the Mayors Daughter, or like how they cut out the part when Peeta lost his leg, but only because they where trying to keep the PG-13 rating, thank god, because I would not be able to see it if they didn't. Over all the casting was great, and it was not a waste of time. I'd see it a million times if I could! Gonna miss Gary Ross. There is blood though, of course, but it isn't bad. And warning there is that jump scene... and I just love how they ended it. They also explain most stuff so if you want to see this but you didn't read the book, it would be a good movie to see. P.S. In the book, Rue and Thresh were BOTH dark skinned, so don't say they aren't. Don't believe me, look it up."

Firstly, the book of Hunger Games to be printed 2008 but I read 2009 and I was very affected by the book. The story included both real parts and unreal parts. I think, this book's construct is very impressive. After I read the book, I watched the film and I found that, the film is very good. The characters of film's are related to book's of characters in view of my imagination. Actors' speaking, appearance, manners is very closed when it is comparing film and book. When I heard the bad critics about the film I shocked, because in my opinion the film has got very good construct and very good film player cadre. But I think that, who are doing bad critics, are not read the Hunger Games books. Because if one can not understand anything the film, I say only she/he didn't read the book or else certainly understand and admire the film. If I hadn't read this book, I wouldn't affected a lot. Because the book has got a lot of paper to giving a detail for reader, but the film is only showing two hours and only give specific points.

"ywriterct","6","7","16","23 March 2012"," Fine for young novel fanatics, but mediocre film
","Just returned from the theaters. Let me make this clear firsthand, I did *not* read the books. I wanted to see what the hype was about and entered the movies ready to judge the Hunger Games as a film rather than a realization of the books. I have to say I was disappointed. The movie unsuccessfully tried to cram what appeared to be highlights of the novel's plot into 2.5 hours, shifting awkwardly from one conflict to the next. The pacing of the movie was terrible, with the opening sequences rushed, shaky, and almost unbearable to watch. Flurries of shots wizzed across the screen, each held for 1-2 seconds, attempting to illustrate the helter skelter of the main character, ""Katniss."" The result was a ratchety relationship barely developed between ""Katniss,"" and what should be the driving force behind her efforts, her family. <br/><br/>Towards the second act of the film, I thought the movie would actually be OK; Katniss's character development improved and some intriguing conflicts arose posing potentially satisfying plot twists for her own journey. Yet none of these opportunities were maximized, and seemingly important developments were dropped for other conflicts that had no precursor whatsoever. There was honestly no tension anywhere else apart from the chase scenes of the movie, plus some awkward departure scenes in the beginning-- a style which I highly doubt dominated the novel. An earlier review noted how it seemed like the director just read the Sparknotes and crafted the movie-- a criticism which rings well with the movie's lack of meaningful development. The movie used the audience as a crutch, depicting events not as a means of solidifying the story,instead just paying small tributes (pun) to the novel.<br/><br/>The books sounds like it would be a much better read. Once established, the premise seemed extremely promising with a lot of potential. Throughout the movie, I heard the teenage groupies giggling at the jokes that were most likely funnier in the book, but carried off poorly on screen. I'm guessing the books weaved the dramatic elements together much better. The movie crossed the bare minimum for developing plot, and only managed to carry across the basic storyline of the book. Yet I did not feel anywhere as involved in the story as throughout the Harry Potter series, which I thought was a much better execution than Hunger Games. So go ahead, pay that $12 for the movie ticket, but don't expect anything beyond a weak slideshow of chapter summaries."
"a_clayman","5","7","16","23 March 2012"," Almost great.:o(
","Hunger Games was spot on with its screenplay,soundtrack, and art design. Being a true movie-lover (of 50+ years) I was anxiously awaiting its debut. How the heck did anyone in production let them use these cheap lenses, hand-held Cameras? A shaky hand-held scene does NOT a great movie make.Luckily there were a few cutaway shots that were big-screen worthy. Sometimes looking grainy, and way too many closeups, it needed more polish and grand scope like a Blade Runner. There were a number of times in the film where patrons got up in droves and left because it got too wordy and honest, (usually the emotion-laden portions as most young people like the drama of reality TV but not the deep inside kind that makes you feel human.) I did not read the books, so expected a grand movie experience using those great wide angle lenses.It looked small and crowded. The CGI was the only true sweeping moments and they were fleeting and not enough to make up for the hand held crap. I'm sure it will do well with the younger crowd, but in the end, when you list the criteria of great film-making (like Avatar or Hugo)..it's pretty mediocre."

","I was sort of obsessed with this movie when it came out. Watching it years later I still love it but can understand that I was a little infatuated. It's a solid flick and I think what makes it work so well is because of the smaller moments. The film is filled with brilliant performances from Woody Harrelson, Jennifer Lawrence, Elizabeth Banks and especially Josh Hutchinson. From the flashbacks to the revelations of his character he really nails. Also good are Wes Bentley with the coolest beard ever, Donald Sutherland and a surprisingly complex Alexander Ludwig. It's easy to write off Kato as one note. A hulking, looming privileged character but those moments he gives him towards the end really make a huge difference. Unfortunately the other love interest of sorts Liam Hemsworth is just eye candy. The movie is disturbing and well made but lacks the punch it really needs to drive the desperation and darkness of the material home. The end result is still an inspired piece of filmmaking that pushes its PG13 rating to the max with an independent, artistic flare. The costumes and set design are award worthy and the impact is still powerful"
"TheLittleSongbird","4","3","5","5 February 2017"," A lot of games, but not a whole lot of hunger
","The book is very detail rich and is not an easy one to adapt (true for any literature featuring dystopian/totalitarian societies), but it is a thrilling, scary and moving one too with fascinating characters and relationships.<br/><br/>As an adaptation, the film adaptation of 'The Hunger Games' is pretty poor. The basic details are there as is the basic story and crucial characters, but spirit-wise it feels very watered-down and tame with little of the book's atmosphere and the characters nowhere near as interesting. This said, 'The Hunger Games' also fares problematically on its own terms, a fairer way to judge an adaptation from personal opinion and that's how it will be judged here.<br/><br/>It is not all bad. Some of the acting is good, with the standouts being a magnetic Jennifer Lawrence, a deliciously smarmy Stanley Tucci, a splendid Elizabeth Banks and an effective Donald Sutherland. The dystopian setting is eerily evoked in the costumes and settings, and help the film start off well with a genuinely ominous depiction of District 12 which really give off a sense of dread. James Newton Howard's music score is thrilling and emotive.<br/><br/>Not all the acting is good however. Most of the cast actually don't really stand out all that much with underwritten characters and lacking dialogue. In the principal cast Josh Hutcheson (blaming the writing here because Hutcheson has shown, like in 'Bridge to Terabithia', that he can be good) gives a lifeless and charisma-free performance. Woody Harrelson is also too anaemic and somewhat annoying as a shady jaded sort of character which undermines any development or direction of the character, he tries to give a coolness but this feels completely wrong for the character.<br/><br/>Lack of character development and halfway-decent writing plays a large part here. The characters had a lot of meat to them before but here are pretty bland stereotypes with non-existent development or direction. Didn't find myself caring for the relationship between Katniss and Peeta, mainly because of Peeta being written and played so blandly but also the chemistry didn't seem to be there. The writing does feel under-cooked, with some cringe-worthy moments and lacks edge or any kind of emotion a lot of the time.<br/><br/>Was expecting the story to be much more compelling too. The District 12 stuff at the beginning sets a promising tone, but it takes forever to get to when anything properly happens after over an hour of suffering through under-baked, repetitious and sometimes unnecessary exposition that amounts to little. When it does finally get there, the scary intensity is still lacking, as well as any insight on social commentary or satirical edge, everything just feels rather tame and undernourished.<br/><br/>The action sequences are rushed through, lack tension and further spoilt by being shot and edited chaotically and incredibly fake looking effects. Visually, only the set design impresses, the rest is too sloppy and frenetic.<br/><br/>In summary, has its moments but very much lacking. 4/10 Bethany Cox"

","I loved this movie because the special effects were beautiful and the acting and directing were excellent. All of the actors performed well in this film. Before the Hunger Games, I did not know who Jennifer Lawrence really was. After the Hunger Games, I really discovered that I enjoyed her acting. She has a strong presence on film. The book was good and I think the film followed the story as good as possible. The action scenes were the best and I loved the costumes. This is a movie that does not make me feel like I am watching a movie. The dialogue does not seem forced and the settings are cool. I saw this movie on Netflix and I would recommend it to anyone who likes action movies. It's also good to see a strong leading woman in a role. Most action movies have the girl being a side character. 10/10"

","The dystopian genre is refreshing to me. It's hard to present that, especially for PG-13 movies. I love how ""The Hunger Games"" bring a satisfying dystopian sci-fi action adventure movie.<br/><br/>The story happens in the ruins of what once known as North America, called in their time as Panem. Its government the Capitol requires a girl and a boy, called Tributes, from each of the twelve districts to send to the Hunger Games, where only one will come out alive. Katniss Everdeen volunteers for her younger sister Primrose. She meets her co-tribute Peeta Mellark, who has saved her from hunger for giving her a piece of burnt bread.<br/><br/>I like how the movie deals with a totalitarian government. It's unusual for a teen movie to talk about it. The action scenes are okay, but mixed with drama. Children ages 12-18 are forced to fight against one another for survival, which includes killing. It also tackles entertainment, like reality TV. I just hate the shaky camera. It's dizzying. <br/><br/>There's a cliffhanger. So expect for a sequel, and I'll see it."

","The Hunger Games is a movie that appeared by Gary Ross in 2012. It is based on the books by Susan Collins. It has a huge cast with quite a few celebrities, e.g. Jennifer Lawrence, who plays Katniss, or Josh Hutcherson who plays Peeta. The movie also stars Liam Hemsworth, Lenny Kravitz, Elizabeth Banks and many others. The film is about a girl (Katniss) who is forced to compete in a tournament that is smiilar to the gladiator fights in ancient Rome. The movie is a dystopian film. The picture is very entertaining, exciting and incredible. It contains some violence but it isn't too brutal. The movie also has a little love and some fighting. Ther also negative points about the film: it is very monotonous and it can get very boring. Also, the picture is very cheap, they could have used a nicer and richer arena. Most of the time, it's unrealistic. In my opinion it is a film, that everyone should watch but it's not a picture that you buy DVD of and watch it a couple of times. One time is enough. The movie is made for everybody, because it contains some action and some love. So in conclusion in my opinion it is a film that no one should miss."

I knew nothing about this movie before watching it, except J-Law was in it.<br/><br/>The movie was a huge disappointment. It got a childish touch and lack depth, but most of all it was very predictable. I was quiet easy to predict the outcome in this movie, not just the whole story but even smaller actions that took place. When the movie finished my wife and I just looked at each other and agreed that we wont be seeing the sequel at the cinema. We have watch the other movies but then on streaming sites, paying 150kr (around 19 USD) for one ticket is just not worth it.<br/><br/>A lot of new movies with the same ""childish"" touch have bump the scene the last years and non of them appeal to me.

That's what this thing needed, something to really show how dangerous the Games are rather than just one quick scene of watered-down violence and some low-rent CGI beasts. There's also a lack of character development here and there's nothing to really make me root for Katniss during the long stretches of screen time where nothing's happening. That's what was really disappointing about the movie version: it's ridiculously slow.

"mithzelluque","4","3","5","29 May 2014"," Personal Opinion
","Let it be known that I have read the Hunger Games Trilogy and I loved every word written by Suzanne Collins. But I absolutely HATED the movie. <br/><br/>Sure, to a certain degree it followed the overall plot Suzanne had scaled out through out the books, but it fell short in so many different ways that, even if I had already read the books previously, left me craving for more- More information, more action and more character development.<br/><br/>Firstly, Garry failed to include important characters that were very important to the book. Like Madge, Katniss's friend who had, in the book, originally given her the Mockingjay pin (not Greasy Sae, the Hob's most popular cook) during her visiting hours before she was shipped to the Capital. He also forgot to include Flavius, Octavia and Venia who become a very important part in the third book (which I will not get into...). <br/><br/>Secondly, the movie failed to showcase the relationship and its development between Katniss and Haymitch, Peeta and Cinna. In the book, Katniss and Haymitch originally do not get along by any means but as the book continues you begin to see just how similar the two are to each other which ultimately helps Katniss connect with Haymitch during the games despite there being a lack of contact (hence why she understood the messages he'd send to her via gifts). Between Katniss and Cinna, their relationship was always successful, they clicked the moment they met, mostly because Cinna proved to be different than all the other Capital citizens because of his simplicity (which could be seen by his wardrobe). Ultimately, Cinna and Katniss become very close to each other. And then there was the relationship between Katniss and Peeta... Gosh, you have no idea how angry I was of seeing how little they showed of them. At first, Katniss is very awkward towards Peeta because she knows for a fact that there was a chance that she'd be forced to kill this boy, the boy that years ago saved her life without asking for anything in return. But as they begin spending time together in the training center, encouraging one another to show their true strengths and weaknesses they begin to develop a friendship which is later destroyed when Peeta requests to be trained separately from Katniss when she deems herself too powerful. But as they go into the arena and Peeta does the things he does, Katniss begins to see that Peeta has always been a friend, not a foe. So, when it's time for them to partner up, Katniss begins to treat him better, as a true friend and risks her life for him, like a true friend would do. But as they begin to spend more time together, Peeta's hidden feelings for her develop. But as a way to survive (adviced by Haymitch through one of the gifts) Katniss begins to think that Peeta is only acting and that his affection for her is false and so begins to play along, unknowingly giving Peeta false hopes of a relationship that could probably never exist. So when it's time to go home, after Peeta discovers that it was all an act, it becomes awkward once again because the feelings are no longer mutual, only one sided. <br/><br/>Thirdly, the total lack of character development from Peeta. Throughout the movie, the only thing Peeta symbolizes is a middle class citizen that only knows how to whine and stand there to look pretty. In comparison to the book character, Josh Hutcherson playing as Peeta and the original Peeta Mellark become two completely different people. They down play Peeta's character so much that he ultimately becomes irrelevant, when in fact HE CLEARLY ISN'T! They make him into this weak little boy that knows nothing of the outside world but to look pretty in it. When really Peeta Mellark was a strong boy with a very outgoing personality that captures the audience completely, and a boy capable of maintaining a life and the life of the one he loved. In the movie they make Katniss as Peeta's meaning of life, when really, Peeta ultimately becomes Katniss's.<br/><br/>Lastly, it was how they cut off so much action from the movie that it lessened the impact of the plot. For example, during the last fighting scene, when Katniss and Peeta are being chased down by the Capital Mutts and they reach the cornucopia and climb it to stay away from them, the director cut off a very important scene that affects the ending of the story entirely. Peeta, in the scene where the same leg that had been cut by Cato during their fight after the Gabbey's' attack was bitten by one of the mutts that ultimately causes Peeta to receive a prosthetic leg. This scene was ultimately essential given that it showcases the Captial's power and advanced technology, which ultimately affects the story later on in the books. Another scene that was completely cut off from the movie that was originally in the book was the scene after Peeta and Katniss win the Games and they are taken back into the hovercraft and Katniss completely breaks down when Peeta is taken into custody to repair his leg and save him from the immense loss of blood he suffered. This scene was essential given the fact that in this scene Suzanne Collins was able to completely explain the after effect of the games. <br/><br/>Ultimately, I believe that the movie was basically a cheap trailer that showcases enough of the book to interest the viewer to read the books. Sure the action was minimized to keep the movie PG-13 but you can only eliminate so much blood and gore before you ultimately suck the seriousness out of the situation and turn it into a stupid game.<br/><br/>I really think they could've done better without completely copyrighting the entire book, in my opinion."
"Alex_Hodgkinson","5","3","5","29 March 2014"," Could Have Been Better
","It could have been better. The Hunger Games was in no way a terrible film, it had its good sides, but it could have been much better. I'd say the entire thing felt bland and unreal. Everything happened to quickly and you never really cared if a character lived or died. Can you honestly say you cried when the twelve year old girl, Rue, died? No. I'm willing to bet most people hardly even cared.<br/><br/>The writing felt boring and bland. Everything happened to quickly and you never quite knew what was going on unless you read the book, as I and many others have. The writing was possibly the biggest problem behind this film. Whilst it was quite faithful to the book, which is a rare occasion, it was way to fast and didn't go into detail about anything.<br/><br/>The directing is my other biggest problem with the film. It, again, felt awfully bland. Yes, at times we had nice shots and the occasional good scene, but overall it was pretty terrible. It helped the writing go along at times when we didn't know what was going on, with nice shots of facial expressions which tells us the thoughts of the characters in situations, but other than that it was bad directing from Gary Ross, who also co-wrote the film.<br/><br/>The acting certainly didn't help the film either. From knowing about Jennifer Lawrence's outgoing personality and how much everybody loves her, I expected a great performance from her as the main protagonist, Katniss Everdeen. Sadly, I didn't really get this. Most of the film's acting felt either bland or over the top. I felt that Josh Hutcherson and Woody Harrelson gave the only great performances in the film. They felt real, unlike most of the two dimensional characters.<br/><br/>As an adaptation, The Hunger Games works well in some areas and badly in others. The same basic plot line is there, unlike most unlucky adaptations, but essential scenes were missing and the entire film felt rushed. The death scenes needed to be longer to have that lasting affect and some missing scenes were needed. It's in no way a bad adaptation, but it could have been much better.<br/><br/>I think what would have really helped this film is if it was made into two films, both of which being about two and a half/three hours. For this film to have had the impact it needed to have and feel real, it needed more time. We needed to see Katniss struggle to survive. We needed sad, long death scenes. We needed a growing Katniss/Peeta relationship. We needed explanations. We needed Madge. We needed so much that we didn't get to make this adaptation feel real and have the impact it needed.<br/><br/>Overall, I'd say that this was a bad film with some redeeming qualities, such as some of the shots and acting. In my opinion, the novel by Suzanne Collins was rather bland throughout, but this film made the book seem very real. I found this film enjoyable at times, but to be perfectly honest I was spending the entire two hours waiting for it to be over."

","The Hunger Games, both film and novel have garned massive attention and fandom, was it really worth it though? I think not. I understand movies are fun and adventurous, but they are also harrowing, emotional and riveting. What Hunger Games was supposed to be in the book, was not on the screen. The novel, also written for teens and an audience with a certain limited vocabulary, fell victim to plain and tasteless, everything. So was the Hunger Games doomed from the start? The idea, though used before, had a its own twist of use. <br/><br/>The Hunger Games is set in the near future in the Americas, now divided into poverty stricken nations where the right hand and flamboyant aristocrats of the Citedel nation act like baying Roman crowds and demand a yearly penance for the other nations uprising. The penance? Each nation selects 2 representatives in a cruel lottery of bloodsport, called The Reaping. The 'lucky' selectees are transported to the Citedal to represent their districts to fight each other to the death where one may only win. <br/><br/>Pretty cool idea but with poor penmanship and even worse directing the idea and the emotional drive was sapped of the film. We are offered completely useless scenes that could have only been supported by other plots and focus but were removed, forcing the film to its knees. Roo's death was useless and lacking complete emotion. The whole idea of starving, seething districts was made redundant with no screen time and the bittersweet romance between Katniss and Peta was superficial and cosmetic. I give The Hunger Games a 3/10 as it was faithless to the novel and as a film."
"martinjacob49","5","3","5","7 February 2014"," Very Disappointing!
","I was a huge fan of the book about a group of kids who are forced to kill each other in a death match, but after watching the movie, I was immensely disappointed with the final result. Jennifer Lawrence was extremely excellent as Katniss, and there were some other good, solid acting throughout the picture, but the issue I had with this movie was that it lacked suspense, especially scenes in the arena. Instead of making the moments of slaughter shocking and suspenseful, the use of the shaky cam only dumbs it down to the point where you have no clue what's going on, even if I had already read the book. While I was disappointed by this movie, I am more optimistic about the sequels as there's different direction and there's no shaky cam."
"justimagine93","5","3","5","6 December 2013"," A Little Dull
","The makeup was okay, but my main problem is that this movie just barely represents the first book. It is like putting pictures to the book. You would have to know what happened in the book to see anything valuable in this movie. The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins reminds me very much of 1984 by George Orwell. With that being said, this movie has captured emotion but doesn't really elaborate on why fighting in The Hunger Games is such a horrible thing. Jennifer Lawrence portrayed an excellent Katniss Everdeen, but on the downside she looks too old to be Katniss, because the Katniss in the books was very light footed and small. The Peeta in the book was actually bigger than her and very muscular, because he often needed to move around large sacks of flour for his family's bakery. Unfortunately, Josh Hutcherson looks small next to Jennifer Lawrence. So in result, Peeta and Katniss were not represented well physically in the movie. The movie could have been renamed: Katniss Everdeen: The Girl Who Was On Fire, because Katniss is the only main character in the movie. Everyone else seems like background noise. In the book, Katniss tells the story, but the book is called The Hunger Games, not Katniss Everdeen for a reason. The movie doesn't talk about or dwell upon other characters as much as it should."

","This is an enjoyable movie. It has all the elements you could ask for; Forbidden Love, oppression, government propaganda, social politics, raw emotion. It's a real coming of age tale oh yeah, and ritualistic brutal sport killing for a sloth of commercial onlookers cheering on the adolescent violence.<br/><br/>The story is basically this; the social order intimidates the masses by requiring they submit a young boy and girl to compete in the annual ""hunger games"" to project fear and power over the lower classes. Interestingly, this film only covers the first book and so the injustices are still very real at the end of this movie.<br/><br/>A strange characteristic of this movie is how deep and intense each characters emotions are. They have such strong feelings for one another even though they are all aware they will have to kill one another in the end.

Or there are too much Survivor fans, but this is definitely no survivor genre neither hunger at all, because there was no starvation. Also I have to notice that the idea of killing children is not so liked mostly by the audience (just killing is not the way to affect by using death). Also the main female character needs more accuracy and faster reflexes, something more like Clint Barton (Hawkeye) from The Avengers. The movie just desperately needs more action, martial arts and compassion! Also the way or representing the primitive and the basic in the human kind is not so obvious if that's what the movie crew wanted to achieve, because they supply them with surviving kits and weapons (lets not say even spoons)."
"dimplet","Null","3","5","3 September 2013"," 10 and out, but 10 and I'll try again
","What's with the unsteady cam? Heck, I can hold any camera steadier than the camera work in The Hunger Games, without image stabilization. Is the cinematographer drunk?<br/><br/>There's a place for hand-held cameras, and for the hand-held look, such as those faux crime scene TV shows. But at least they go for a Steadicam partially stabilized look. The scenes in The Hunger Games are deliberately jerked around. <br/><br/>It looks gimmicky, and I get real suspicious of gimmicky pictures. Plus, the wobbly image gave me a headache, along with the too loud piercing music score. The combined effect is that while you are trying to figure out what the heck is going on, you can't hear yourself think. <br/><br/>I figure the director needs to give me some reason to watch the movie within 10 minutes. I don't need to know everything, but I would at least like to see something interesting, and have the feeling the odds are better than 50-50 that I'm not going to be wasting my time. Is this too much to ask? Heck, most movies do this in five minutes. <br/><br/>I was looking at another movie recently, The King of Marvin Gardens. It might be a good movie, but the beginning turned me off so much that I probably will never find out. And I'm a Jack Nicholson fan. I like artsy movies. But I don't like pretentious ones. <br/><br/>I think the reviews also play a role. I can ignore a smattering of negative reviews and the usual stupid reviews. But there are also the glowing subsidized reviews, and the naive fawning reviews by people who have never seen a truly great picture, to discount. When what's left are people who say the movie is a waste of time, and the beginning is, indeed, a waste of time, not to mention highly unpleasant, why would I stay?<br/><br/>I generally avoid the latest hit movie, When I haven't, when I've gotten dragged in, all too often I've been miserable, and then you have to pretend you liked the movie to avoid hurting someone's feelings, even if the movie made no sense. Heck, I've sat through movies in theaters by myself, wanting to get up and walk out, but I spent my money, and surely it is going to get better, I kept telling myself every 10 minutes, but it never did get better, and when I finally walk back into the sunlight I feel like I've just spent two hours in a Dumpster. So it is a great joy, with the wonders of modern technology, to be able to just press a button and put an end to movie misery. <br/><br/>Gary Ross, you've made some truly great movies. I am all for experimentation, directors trying something new. I'm not going to write you off. But what I did see was awful.<br/><br/>Maybe I wasn't the target audience for this movie. When I was the age of this target audience, I saw some great movies -- A Clockwork Orange, Barbarella, Easy Rider, 2001, Blow Up, Zabriskie Point -- movies that squares and old folks just didn't understand. There was a certain perspective that viewers brought to movies back then. <br/><br/>Perhaps young people bring a certain perspective with them to movies these days. If they do, I wouldn't even know where to get it. But I still think those old movies are classics, viewed from the perspective of cold sober reality. <br/><br/>Another thought: Is this movie some indication of the deep seated fears of young people these days of the world to come? If so, I feel sad. I am very afraid we are headed toward a dystopian future, due to human-caused global warming. But these real fears seem here to be displaced into some weird dystopian teen-centered fantasy world. <br/><br/>And one last thought: This is the first time I have encountered a formal FAQ explainer of a movie on IMDb covering such questions as, ""What is 'Hunger Games' about?"" and ""What are 'Hunger Games'?"" If you need someone to explain these questions, apparently even after you've watched the movie, there is something wrong with the movie. I read the answers, and I still don't understand. Perhaps it is me. <br/><br/>I tell you what, though. If in 10 years the reviews of The Hunger Games have improved significantly, I will give another try making it past the first 10 minutes, if in the meantime global warming hasn't destroyed the environment, producing wildfires, droughts, floods, plagues of locusts and other insects, disease, famine, extreme weather, political insurrection, world war and the collapse of what we laughingly call civilization. I promise."

","I rarely write reviews - but this movie sort of made me want to write one. I just read the book and saw the movie a few days later. I thought the book was great and it was a very emotional read. I understand adapting a book like this to a movie is difficult, however the great directors find a way. When watching this movie, I got the feeling the director was just filming scenes in the book, rather than creating his own work. Cinema and books are a different medium and the major themes of the book have to be conveyed differently. A movie I like to compare book adaptations too is The Lord of the Rings. What Peter Jackson did with that was stunning and amazing. He made it his own and didn't just try to stay 100% faithful to the books and just film scenes from the book. He was creative and I think created an absolute masterpiece. This director failed miserably in conveying the major themes of the book - ie the relationship between Katniss and Peeta was awful and non existent in the movie. Rue had about 5 minutes of screen time and therefore the viewer was unable to connect to her death and why it was so devastating to Katniss. I could go on, but I think my point was made. I'm sure a lot of people will disagree with me, however I just did not feel any emotional connection to this movie as I did with the book. I was just very disappointed with this movie. I am now reading the second book and I hope they can make a movie worthy of it."

We live in a consumption-oriented society, but we don't analyze what we're consuming. Talking about messages is important because you ARE influenced by what you watch (and read), whether you realize it or not.<br/><br/>The underlying message of this film is extremely socialist, if not communist. The timing of its release is also very suspicious. Obama's entire campaign is based on the idea of the 1% (rich people) versus the 99% (the poor and starving). Interestingly enough, this is also (basically) the major underlying theme of this movie. This is a movie about CLASS WARFARE and socialist revolution. The actual premise could never happen in real life. The good guys are (of course) the poor and starving underclass; the bad guys are (of course) the evil rich class.<br/><br/>The film is trying to draw attention to the importance of helping those who are starving - but no such people actually exist in the United States. There are people who are much less wealthy than others and there are people who are on welfare and food stamps - but there is NOBODY in the US who is starving to death. If you want to see that kind of poverty you should visit some of the war-torn parts of Africa. But even in these places, the people manage to survive.<br/><br/>In any case, violence and social revolution are never the way to solve problems as complex as starvation and poverty, but that is exactly what this film is advocating (which you will see if you really take the time to analyze it)."

","With The Hunger Games being one of my favorite (young adult) books ever, I pretty much hesitated to go to the first screening of the movie. In the end curiosity won and I did go and regretted it.<br/><br/>It's not that The Hunger Games is a bad movie. It isn't. It's actually a good, exciting and very entertaining one. But the ending let me down in a big way. And that puts a big (negative) mark on the overall experience.<br/><br/>I think Lionsgate did almost everything right with this movie adaptation. I love Gary Ross as a filmmaker. He wrote Big, Pleasantville and Dave and directed two of them. I love Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss, Woody Harrelson as Haymitch, Lenny Kravitz as Cinna and especially Josh Hutcherson as Peeta. When I read the book I even had Hutcherson in mind for that role, so casting director: well done! To avoid an inconvenient rating Ross uses a lot of shaky camera-work. This gives you some headache in the beginning of the film but once the action moves to the arena it works out fine. You hardly see any violence but you know it's there. Smart move. Ross also makes more use of presenter Caesar Flickerman (than in the book). He watches the action in the arena and gives his comments. He also explains (to the viewer) why certain situations are dangerous for the Tributes, making the stakes more understandable. Unfortunately Ross uses this trick one or two times too many. Great use of music and the singing of the Mockingjay birds is also very well done. <br/><br/>Ross also uses some elements of books 2 and 3 to give the viewer a hint at what lays ahead. For instance there is more president Snow (Donald Sutherland) in the film than in the book. He sees that Katniss can be a thread. The reason why suddenly two Tributes are allowed to win The Hunger Games is even better explained in the movie than in the book. And we also see the first uprisings in district 12 after the death of one of Katniss's friends. That's a moving scene. For all this Ross uses a lot of screen time, more than two hours and twenty minutes, paying much respect to the book. Thanks for that!<br/><br/>So what really let me down is the ending. That could have been more dramatic. The way Katniss survives The Hunger Games could use a lot more suspense (""What the hell is she doing? What is she doing?!"") and the consequents that follow should have been more dark and menacing. That's a big miss. <br/><br/>With The Hunger Games Gary Ross delivered a solid, well made and very entertaining movie that hopefully rockets both Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson into stardom. But if you're a very very very big fan of the incredible first book – like me – you really should think twice before going. Because usually the best movie adaptations are made in your own mind.<br/><br/>8/10"
"kgprophet","6","8","20","23 March 2012"," Better than the Trite material deserves.
","Let's admit it, this franchise got the green light based upon the teenage vampire movie craze. It is soooo convenient that the ages of our teenage warriors are exactly the same age range (12-18) as the target demographic for said teenage vampire fans. The setup on paper sounds pretty contrived: a set of males & females from 12 regions must fight to the death. As an older adult, I have skipped all those Twilight films, and never would find myself interested in this film. So why am I recommending it? Because the filmmakers were able make the story transcend the genre. This is not an easy task, and my guess it must have taken many rewrites to find themes and subtlety for a subject matter that belongs as a TV show on the CW network. Let's begin with the actual action scenes where you witness the brutal hunting down and killing of fellow human beings. You won't really find them in this film. In fact, the focus on weapons and people's skill using them is also a very minor feature in this film. Instead, the majority of the journey our protagonists go on is about relationships. Relationships with sister, Mother, boyfriend, state, country, mentors, sponsors, and rulers. We even get to learn about the relationship between the TV show producer and the country's dictator. Then there is the theme about how the oppressed are reduced to TV show idols, and are forced to perform to the whimsy of the viewing masses. The movie ""The Truman Show"" went this direction and mostly failed in it's attempt to humanise it. Somehow, ""The Hunger Games"" pulls it off. The wealthy class were deliberately cast with people with strange faces, and painted up like clowns to make them more like monsters than human.<br/><br/>How does this film create believability? For one, the filmmakers completely immersed themselves in this alter-reality. Nothing is painted in broad strokes. Scenes of a poor community come to life through nice human moments, and keep the momentum going while making the best of exposition. Scenes requiring exposition in movies are very hard to make interesting. Again, credit goes to the screenwriters for approaching exposition in a creative way. Sometimes talking about the effect of an important plot point, leaving audiences briefly curious, then circling back and explaining why that effect happens. And how come this movie is 2 1/2 hours and doesn't contain much action? Because the filmmakers wisely avoided a cliché third act by avoiding predictability and keeping expectations fresh for the audience.<br/><br/>My only real complaint is that the film did not need to be 2 1/2 hours, even though I bet many character subplots were cut out of the final version to make this running time. The second act drags somewhat while our competitors go through the rituals leading up to the actual game. This is the period where the players train and are evaluated, but once again little of this is actually shown. Instead we spend even more time on, yes, relationships. One of the greatest achievements in this film is the editing. Through the power of editing, a great deal of story is told in a short period of time. A friendship between two characters is established with some body language, instead of clunky dialogue. The music avoids bombastic action beats and instead evokes a folky ""human"" tone, something right in the comfort zone for composer James Newton Howard. The special effects are a minor part of the movie and don't really stand out when briefly seen."

","Some time in the future in what was once America there has been an uprising; it was put down and now each year each of the twelve outlying districts must send two young people; one boy, one girl, to participate in the Hunger Games: here they must compete until only one is left alive. This year young Primrose Everdeen is selected in the ballot to represent District 12. She has little chance so her elder sister Katniss volunteers to take her place. She is skilled with a bow but the odds will still be stacked against her as some districts train people all of their lives for the games. Once selected, she is taken to the Capitol, along with Peeta Mellark the boy who will represent their district. Here they meet the other competitors and work to attract the sponsors who will be vital if one of them is to win. Once the games begin it is everybody for themselves although temporary alliances may form everybody knows only one of them can ultimately survive.<br/><br/>Watching this film I couldn't help but be struck by the number of elements that reminded me of other films; teenagers fighting to the death, 'Battle Royale'; slightly sleazy TV presenter, 'The Running Man' and the leader worried about a contestant becoming too popular, 'Rollerball' to name just three this doesn't mean I thought this was derivative though and it certainly wasn't just 'Battle Royale for Tweenies' as I'd heard some people suggest. The games don't actually start till the film is approaching its midpoint; this means the first half is spent effectively introducing the main characters and the world they live in. Jennifer Lawrence is the undisputed star of the film doing a brilliant job as Katniss; she made the character believable with enough vulnerability for us to worry about her even though it was highly unlikely that she'd be killed she is the heroine after all! Josh Hutcherson did a good enough job as Peeta although his character was obviously less interesting. There were also a few well known names amongst the supporting cast; Woody Harrelson put in a fun turn as their mentor, former District 2 winner, Haymitch Abernathy and Donald Sutherland was suitably sinister as President Snow. Shot in a stunning woodland setting the games are filmed in a way that makes the viewer feel part of the action in a way that was surprisingly tense for a twelve certificate film starring a young cast. I would certainly recommend this for others but think parents might want to watch it first as it might be too frightening for some children even those officially old enough to see it!"

","This movie was great. People put five stars for this movie, millions of people decided to read and watch the movie of The Hunger Games, and it was as great as it promised to be. This movie was based on the book by Suzanne Collins. However, this movie didn't completely follow the book. Some parts of the book were either discarded or replaced. Even though the movie did this, it was even better than the book itself. I do however warn all people who go to see this movie. Warning: There are no scary or disturbing images, but there are very scary parts in the movie where a person will die in a very cruel manner. But besides this the movie is awesome, and deserves all the wonderful praise it can get. There was no cussing at all, and there was no use of strong language either. Never underestimate the wonderful things of The Hunger Games. Another warning though, this is not for young children. There are moments of violence, and as I said before, very scary moments. There are also a small handful of sad parts. I prefer this movie for anyone ten years old or higher. Anyway this is a wonderful movie, and I hope that the sequel, Catching Fire, will come out in theaters soon. Can not wait to get on DVD. Happy hunger games!"

"vila-ddt","10","7","17","7 April 2012"," Waited weeks to review.... I am in love with the books and movie
","A few people are saying that this is nothing but a rip off of a Japanese film/story entitled ""Battle Royale"" While in fact it is very similar all in all The Hunger Games is a completely different concept/story. Although it does incorporate the same elements, it is a much more engaging story.<br/><br/>I read all 3 of the books in less then a week and I still read them over and over. I was nervous to see how the film adaptation would be cause I know I was always upset of what they cut out of the Harry Potter movies, but I was pleasantly surprised that hardly anything was taken out of the first book, and only minimal things were slightly altered. <br/><br/>I've seen this movie 7 times and each time I have taken a new person with me. Whether it be someone who has read the book or has never heard of it I have not heard one disappointed reaction....other then one of my friends who doesn't understand stories unless they're dumbed down like mirror mirror, but we forgive her cause she is slow.<br/><br/>I'm very impressed how they made this movie with such a low budget, and still it feels like a huge summer blockbuster. <br/><br/>I had the opportunity to experience the film in Dbox seats yesterday and I have to say.... That was incredible! It really made you feel like you were a part of the games and made it much more intense a viewing experience.<br/><br/>I am simply giving a review, so no spoilers here, but I think everyone is making WAY too big a deal about this being, ""The most gruesome PG-13 movie of all time."" In all honesty it got the rating it deserved, but it isn't the most gruesome I've ever seen. It is tastefully done without ruining any of the violence from the book surprisingly. <br/><br/>If you have not seen it yet.... GO! You will love it :)"
"DICK STEEL","8","7","17","30 March 2012"," A Nutshell Review: The Hunger Games
","I have to admit at first glance, going by the trailers that have been incessantly playing since late last year, that this was nothing more than a Battle Royale rip off, having teenagers put into an arena and fighting to the death. Such genre films have been done countless of time, from the days of Schwarzeneggar in his The Running Man, to even Stone Cold Steve Austin in The Condemned, where everyone becomes gladiators and essentially television content fodder, and The Hunger Games surely contained the exact same elements too. But what excelled and stood this film from its peers, boils back to Collins' superbly set up story, and in Gary Ross' focused direction that never leaves the film soulless, filling it with plenty of heart and got the audience to emotionally invest in its protagonist from the get go.<br/><br/>And that is something Gary Ross, going by his filmography such as Seabiscuit and Pleasantville, does quite effortlessly, with a story that's set in a fictional period where much of the known world is divided into districts to suppress an uprising decades ago, where each district, living in hunger and in fear, have to cough out a teenage boy and girl each between the ages of 12 to 18 every year as tribute to battle in The Hunger Games, a fight to the last, that is also broadcast live in a television show. The arena is at The Capitol where the elites live amongst armed protection, and the combatants duke it out in an arena of faux pas natural habitat that can be manipulated at will by designers.<br/><br/>What set this out from the rest is that it has a female protagonist who is not a useless, or whining damsel in distress. Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) is a hunter and provider for her family, volunteering as tribute in place of her sister Primrose (Willow Shields), and together with Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson), they become the tributes from District 12. We spend the first hour unhurried in painting the background set for the entire trilogy, so much so that not everything got explained, which was a sly move to leave out unessential details at this point for the other sequels to follow up on, especially the need to know more about the current state of the world. We're left to concentrate on a series of unfolding events around Katniss, as well as to get to know the reclusive girl who has to learn how to milk her popularity to increase her chances of survival.<br/><br/>While it's essentially Battle Royale, there are the necessary tweaks to the rules of the game to keep it unique, such as the introduction of sponsors and external assistance. Katniss also had to rely on a lot of luck, and isn't your superhero Rambo from the onset, making her believable, identifiable, and with qualities in a character that you would root for. Even her skill with the bow doesn't make her a deadly shot all the time, as things like anxiety and fear make her character all the more believable, and human. Pacing was kept just right especially after the hour mark when the games kick into gear, although one complaint will be that since this is a teenage flick, you do not get to see the gory details of teen killing teen, no thanks to the deliberate cinematography to keep thing shaky, out of focus and never within comfortable depth of field. After all, this is supposed to be PG-13 stuff for the mass market, so everything's kept at a level that Walt Disney himself will approve.<br/><br/>Still, it's not about the violence and the deaths, but a lot more about the theme of survival, with the story going a lot more for collaboration and cooperation, even amongst allies and alliances formed amongst the strong to pick on the meek. Subplots included in the film all hint at stories that the next two installments will pick up on, such as Katniss' growing popularity amongst the districts and her becoming the icon of rebellion that you'd know will be dealt with even without reading the books. Romance also finds time to creep into the storyline, especially since an engineered one starts to become a little bit more real, and setting up an uncomplicated love triangle between Katniss, Peeta and the former's best friend in Gale (Liam Hemsworth) who had sworn to protect and provide for her family while she's away competing to return home.<br/><br/>And the supporting ensemble cast consists of notables such as Elizabeth Banks, Lenny Kravitz and Woody Harrelson as pro-Katniss supporters, or at least those who have to stand at her corner during her preparation for the Games, and others such as Stanley Tucci and Toby Jones as television personalities, Wes Bentley as the primary gamemaster, and Donald Sutherland as President Snow, everyone veterans in their own right propping up the relative newcomers who take on primary roles in this expected franchise. Amongst those who stood out are Banks, almost unrecognizable in her makeup and costumes, and Tucci who hams it up as a television host.<br/><br/>The Hunger Games have got me hooked despite getting off on the wrong footing during its marketing, and I am as eager as many new found fans out there who are anticipating what's next in the story. It may be tame, but Katniss is a fresh female protagonist who will have you hooked to her cause, and that alone is this film's strength that it played up superbly. Recommended!"

"turtleD11","7","7","17","26 March 2012"," i'm speechless (not in a good way either)
","The books were amazing!! I loved how it was a mixture of so many Genres that I love so much: dystopian, romance, adventure, etc. Now in terms of liking the movie.....not so much...I was looking forward to this movie like so many other people were and i was really disappointed. I knew it wasn't going to be as good as the book because no matter how great you are at making movies, you are never going to turn a great book with so much depth into a two to two and a half hour movie. It's just not possible. And that's exactly what this movie was lacking, the depth. In the books, you really got to know the character's personalities and some of their background information also, which really made you feel for them with the times they were going through. Another thing was that a lot of good parts were left out and/or changed. Such as: 1) Madge (the mayor's daughter) gave Katniss the mockingjay pin, she didn't buy it from Greasy Sae. 2)Katniss lost her hearing in her left ear after blowing up the food, she didn't just hear ringing for a bit. 3) Peeta's cut is not even that deep, and in the book it says it's to the bone and later on he has to get a whole new leg. 4) It seemed like Katniss was kind of a wimp and hung out in a tree the whole time. I mean she did spend a lot of time in a tree in the book, but other times she was trying to find a place to get water or looking out for the other tributes and venturing farther into the arena. 5)There was a lot more of the need for food and how badly everyone needed it. That wasn't shown very much at all. 6)Peeta really loves Katniss and they didn't show the part where she tells him she was just playing along, listening to Haymitch. Peeta really thought she loved him when actually Katniss didn't know what she felt about him. There are many more that i can go on about but that would take too long.I felt that the movie went way too fast and if you blinked you would have missed it.Many of the characters traits were left out in the movie.Katniss did somewhat show that she was more the mom of her family and some of the stubborness she portrayed in the books.Peeta did work but kind of lost that big/strong comforting guy that Collins described in the book, but he still managed to work, i liked him. I liked how they would show Gale every time something would happen with Katniss or when Katniss and Peeta got romantic,it showed how much it must have hurt him, but they didn't really show much hatred he felt towards the capitol.I think Effie was perfectly played. I thought Haymitch should have been shown as more of a drunk because that's the way he is brought up in the book.I know it's PG-13 but i mean come on. And that's another thing i didn't like. How by trying to keep the PG-13 rate they had to make it less gory, less brutal, and water down many parts.I wish it would have been more adult-ish like the books. More mature and less cheesy in some parts.If I wouldn't have read the books, I probably would have thought it was better because i wouldn't have know what i was missing. I still am looking forward to ""Catching Fire"" and hoping that it will be much better. And I'm not just one of those teenage girls who read the books and only liked it for the romance. I'm one of the teenage girls who loved the books for all that they were and how much meaning and depth of emotion they had in them. I loved them for all the surprises Collins gave us, and how Katniss is so B.A. I love the rebellion and aggression. They are just amazing!! Books: 10 Movie: 6.5"
"Boba_Fett1138","7","7","17","26 March 2012"," It was simply entertaining.
","How you feel about this movie and rate it, is in my opinion very depended on the fact whether or not you had seen ""Battle Royale"" prior to this movie. If you have seen it, you will see this movie as a bit of a lesser version of basically the same concept but if you haven't, you'll probably be taken by this movie and it's daring and unusual concept.<br/><br/>Personally, I had seen ""Battle Royale"" and it's actually one of my favorite movies as well. So no, I'm not overpraising this movie for its originality but I also had some more general problems with it as well, which prevented me from seeing this movie as an absolutely perfect, or a must-see- for everyone.<br/><br/>Nothing wrong with its concept or overall story really but the storytelling was still a bit lacking at times. It doesn't always have a right balance of action, social commentary or drama in it, to make an effective enough impact with any of it. The first half of the movie is actually quite slow once you start thinking back about it and it takes a bit too long with its buildup. You could all 'blame' this really on the fact that this movie got based on a popular novel, by Suzanne Collins. Certain storytelling techniques make this apparent and it are little things like this that cause the movie too slow down a bit too much at times.<br/><br/>But obviously it didn't bother me all too much, since I still could enjoy the movie. I never really saw this movie as a deep or provoking one but it was one that was very entertaining to watch. It's a real good thing that lots of money get pumped into this movie, since it truly lifts it to greater heights. It uses good looking special effects (it's also a science-fiction movie after all) and some spectacular action.<br/><br/>You might be surprised at how violent this movie can be to watch at times. You might not expect this coming from a movie that features a couple of teens, as the movie its leads but that's actually what the whole movie is all about, with some bit more depth behind it but not all too much really. It doesn't ever delves deep enough into things or explains everything properly. You could complain about this, or you could simply take it and sit back and enjoy the ride, just as I did. <br/><br/>The movie also does a good job at creating a certain atmosphere. It's set in the future but not a too distant future. So basically that means that this isn't really a too futuristic looking movie and is easy to place yourself into. The look and settings do feel a bit odd at times but never in a too overdone or not realistic enough type of way.<br/><br/>It's certainly watchable as entertainment but I wouldn't exactly call it the movie of the year.<br/><br/>7/10 <br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

","Let me start by saying I never review anything. <br/><br/>I went into this movie wanting it to be more then it was. I wonder if it will take all three movies together to get some of the impact that came from the books? I left the book series with the hunger for the revolution. The revolution that improved the social injustices bestowed on the poor souls of Pannam. Feeling sad for how broken Kat and the others were etc. I left this first movie wanting the bathroom and that's about it. This movie lacked character development. People have defended this with statements like there just wasn't enough time. I don't buy that and here is an example of why. <br/><br/>If you saw the movie Star Ship Troopers a ""B"" movie if ever there was one you end up caring a little at least about what happens to some of the characters. <br/><br/>To be honest I really didn't care what happened to any of the charters in this movie. I might have cared about Peetta more if I could have stopped confusing him with Cato. I almost cared about Rue, I wanted to but it just never developed. <br/><br/>All in all this was just an OK post-apocalyptic movie somewhere in-between Mad Max and The Postman (another book the movie failed to translate). I hope they get another director for the Catching Fire because this story deserves a lot more effort. Some have said they enjoyed it much more the second time. I may put this to the test because I really wanted this movie to succeed."

No one is hungry, ever. I mean seriously, it should be Hunting Games, or Last One Standing, but hunger?? Didn't get it.<br/><br/>But the seriously disturbing part is...the plot is gruesome and violent and yet this movie does not convey any emotion to the viewer.<br/><br/>Katniss saves her sister, but you don't feel a connection between them. The sister is a whiny little fool who is 12 years old and can't even make a line. She shows nothing when her name comes up, it's like she doesn't even understand what's going on. We should feel sorry for the little girl, feel Katniss' desperation, but instead you almost want the sister to go and leave Katniss to enjoy her life with Gale!<br/><br/>Then the oppression the districts have to tolerate, and the sadistic rich people who use these poor kids as entertainment. It should make you angry, it should show the ridiculousness of it all, the violence, the ruthlessness of the privileged, how unfair and terrible. But it doesn't, it doesn't move anything inside the viewer. The movie ""In Time"" does this much better.<br/><br/>And the game itself. Man, 24 teens get locked up in a forest to kill each other. It's terrifying; hunted like prey, having to sneak and hide and kill other kids. It really gets on your nerves!!! But it's all too anesthetized. The kids die and no one cares about them, they don't have back stories, there's no character development, they are all extras!!! Even Rue, who I think touches Katniss' heart, is just another extra! You ask yourself why is Katniss so moved??<br/><br/>And the background love story...what love story??? Is she pretending so they'll win?? Does she eventually fall for real?? Did he really love her in the first place or he just said that to win sponsors? If they loved for real, you don't feel the love.<br/><br/>Things happen but you don't feel for them.

","Jennifer Lawrence's portrayal of Katniss Everdeen was a slight disappointment, and is also quite uneven. At one point, just before she was to go up and do the interview with Caesar Flickerman (Stanley Tucci) before the actual games, she was supposedly not paying attention to what he was saying, and as she goes up on the stage, experience confusion, and then to panic, as she realizes he had just asked her a question, according to the novel. However, in the film, Ms Lawrence somehow managed to hold the exact same expression throughout that entire scene. It was Josh Hutcherson who saved the film with a superb portrayal of Peeta Mellark.

","Suzanne Collins' bestselling young-adult novel is given a competent yet disappointing film adaptation, but that hardly matters; the film is a conversation piece to put alongside the book, and as such it serves its purpose. What has happened here is that the director and the scenarists have approached the book so literally--in the fear that stylishness or imagination might repel teenage fans--that the result has the reverential tone of the first two Chris Columbus-directed Harry Potter movies. This also means that the book's main flaw is duplicated in the movie; namely, that the intriguing setup is more compelling than the games themselves.<br/><br/>The first, briefly sketched scenes are good and tense and build up a suitable sense of dread; the reaping scene, with families lining up silently in an open field as if they were attending Shirley Jackson's lottery (in a sense, they are); the sudden arrival of manic Effie Trinket (Elizabeth Banks), who looks like an airport gift-shop doll painted by someone on LSD; the initial scenes in the Capitol with its prancing, primping residents who could be extras from ""Alice in Wonderland"" wandering through the ""Logan's Run"" sets. Jennifer Lawrence grounds these sequences; her sculpted face, which can turn steely or vulnerable at will, seems to have everything extra burned out of it except the sheer will to survive. Once the games begin, though, the blood drains out (in more ways than one.) The shaky-cam is a disastrous choice; we're all used to it by now, and it's all too transparent as a way to camouflage the underage violence. If the first shot of the tributes leaving their posts were shot smoothly at some distance, the contrast between the pastoral setting and the animalistic battles would be truly terrifying. As it is, the filmmakers have shown so little interest in the other tributes that we barely react when the camera drifts over the bodies of those lost in that first deadly rush. Are Ross and company afraid that if they gave the other players ""too much"" personality we'd stop sympathizing with Katniss when she fights them? They needn't have bothered, because the author has let her heroine out of any truly challenging moral decisions. She only kills in self-defense, or when someone is attacking a ""good"" character. When she teams up with spritely little Rue (Amanda Stenberg), we're meant to feel torn, but then Rue is murdered by another tribute, whom Katniss then shoots dead. The scene is affecting (without pushing it) but we can't help noticing that now Katniss won't have to face the question of when (or whether) to kill Rue. What would have happened if Rue, Katniss, and Peeta had ended up in the final three? Structurally, the movie is thuddingly obvious; we know damned well Peeta and Katniss will survive to the end (so there can be a big ""conflicted"" last scene). And we periodically waste time with scenes of President Snow (Donald Sutherland) loitering lovingly over his perfect rose garden as he drops bits of totalitarian wisdom to a reluctant subordinate (Wes Bentley); these serve no purpose except to be ""sinister"", and Sutherland has reached the point where he can't be anything else. (The film stops just short of giving him a white cat to stroke.) There is one genuine accomplishment, however--Jennifer Lawrence spends nearly the whole movie running through the forest from her would-be killers--and she never once trips and falls full-length. As far as I know, that's a movie first."

"bigbearvo","10","6","14","23 April 2012"," One Word - Extraordinary
","Having not yet read the book, I have to say this film comes along at a time when cinema is starving for epic storytelling, and riveting characters. This daring depiction of a country gone ""hungry"", for food, for games, for entertainment, and for the blood of its young, is simply too familiar, too close to disturbingly similar developments in recent years right here in the good old USA. That chill you feel down your spine is your conscience telling you to pay attention, and thanks to the skills and vision of both writer Suzanne Collins and Director Gary Ross, we have little choice but to pay attention. Judging by how hungry I am to experience the next chapter in this saga of a depressingly bleak future, where human beings are trapped in a frightening world of extreme poverty and horrifying opulence, unchecked greed, and an insatiable appetite for gratuitous mind-numbing and violent entertainment, there is little doubt Director Gary Ross has created the first installment in what portends to be one of Hollywood's most successful franchises of inspired filmmaking. For all that, The Hunger Games would have certainly earned at least 7+ stars, but one unexpected and inspired choice lifts this movie into the rarefied air of masterpiece, worth every bit the 10 star rating I believe it deserves. I'm talking about the choice to cast young Louisville actress Jennifer Lawrence in the role of Katniss Everdeen. Ms. Lawrence delivers an incredibly delicate, searing, Oscar-worthy portrayal of the film's reluctant heroine, who is forced to survive on wits, skill, and ultimately an indomitable will in a world gone mad. Reminiscent of her equally mesmerizing work in The Poker House and her Oscar-nominated performance in last year's ""Winter's Bone"", Jennifer Lawrence literally becomes one of recent popular literature's most admired and loved heroines. What this young actress can convey in her face and eyes is absolutely spellbinding, and this performance deserves all the praise it's now receiving, aptly embodied in one word by her Hunger Games co-star, Donald Sutherland, who described it as ""Extraordinary"". After casting Jennifer in her new movie ""Beaver"", Director Jodie Foster said of then 19 year old Ms. Lawrence, """"It's like she has tragedy etched in her face ...she has that thing in her face that's like she has been through something, you know she's been through something."" That quality, along with her ability to convince the viewer to buy into her character's story completely and want to know everything about her, establishes Jennifer Lawrence as a true star of the first order, whose performances compel us to watch, riveted by every moment she inhabits the screen. Director Gary Ross has said he would not have agreed to direct the Hunger Games had Jennifer Lawrence not been cast as Katniss. His reason? He said there was simply no other young actress who had the talent to pull it off so convincingly. Which is why I say - bring on the ""rest of the story"", Mr. Ross, Ms. Collins, and Ms. Lawrence. 18 months (till November 2013 when the next installment is scheduled for release), is an awfully long time to wait, but for Jennifer Lawrence and the team that created ""The Hunger Games"", I'll wait as long as it takes."
"filmchaser","5","6","14","4 April 2012"," Nobody seemed hungry
","I love movies, and was really looking forward to seeing the Hunger Games. I had seen all the trailers, all the interviews with the actors, and read most of the critic's reviews. I was so bored. Jennifer Lawrence is a good actress, and just comes across as likable and down to earth. She's also unusual looking and natural, so she's believable as Katniss Everdeen. Gale is just obviously so must better looking than Peeta, there is no competition and there was no chemistry between Katniss and Peeta whatsoever, or if there was I didn't sense it. Katniss seemed to pity Peeta, and it didn't help matters that Katniss was taller than Peeta, like a big sister and little brother. I loved watching Stanley Tucci more than any other actor. Donald Sutherland seemed barely awake. Wes Bentley was just pretty to look at...those EYES. Woody Harrelson as the tortured soul wore me out with his anger and disappointment. Elizabeth Banks was supposed to be annoying as Effie and she was. Casting could've been better. Too much time in the same place...the forest. I found myself looking at my watch and wishing it was over. And, though there were references to hunting for food, and 'make sure they don't starve,' nobody looked hungry or skinny or very concerned about food, event when there were tables full of lustrous desserts. Maybe my expectations were too high, but it just seems like the characters were one dimensional, the story wasn't explained very well, and the settings were without visual variance. The costumes were interesting...as if everyone was trying to out-weird each other. Then, in the next scene, they would dress Katniss in a traditional gown, minimal make up, elegant hair. So...not clear on what the fashion trends of the times were in this movie. The ""fire"" was genius, and I would've enjoyed seeing more of those types of visual effects. Maybe the sequel will be better. Maybe the books are better."

Jennifer Lawrence does the incredible job of actually bringing Katniss Everdeen alive on stage, and I have never seen Josh Hutcherson act like this before. They truly are the embodiment of their characters, and I don't think anyone else would have done a better job living the story. Wow..

Obviously you can't put a whole book into a reasonable amount of time for a movie, but I went and saw it yesterday and I was very impressed. It's not very often that there is a movie about teenagers that is not overwhelmingly full of love and crushes and lovely things of that sort but they kept that part toned way down.<br/><br/>There were some things that they changed that I was kind of sad about but they kept the suspense going very well. I personally liked the shaky cameras when they were running but sometimes the fights were hard to follow because they were so close up. <br/><br/>As for the actors,I thought they were amazing. I had never heard of Jennifer Lawrence until I heard about this movie being made but she was awesome.

Watching slave soldiers kill each other for the fun of the elite is not something I enjoyed paying for.<br/><br/>Thankfully this dystopian genre is not a popular one so I'll likely be safe for the foreseeable future - but the fact that this movie has been so popular is kind of a scary comment on American society.<br/><br/>I'm giving a 6 out of 10 because the acting was great and the effects and sound were great.

","In a dystopian future, the government picks youngsters to engage in a fight to death. The premise of the film and the source novel is repulsively ridiculous.

What kind of society gets its entertainment by watching children kill each other? What point is being made here? If one looks past the silly and disturbing premise, however, it is an entertaining action film for the most part. Lawrence is OK as the surly heroine, but all the characters are strictly one-dimensional. Tucci hams it up as the TV host of the games, unable to contain his glee over the violence, likely reflecting the view of the filmmakers."

","I can't say I had super high expectations for this film, as I'd never read the books. But I was hopeful that it would deliver on thrills/suspense, and in this regard, I was slightly disappointed. The idea of teenagers in a contest to the death, though repugnant, is ripe with suspense - a potential mix between Lord of the Flies and The Most Dangerous Game (the original versions). The fact that many of them possessed special skills (spear throwing, knife throwing, archery) and such diverse views of the contest (some predatory, others almost pacifist) should have resulted in many hair-raising life-and-death moments. But, instead, the film seemed to defuse many of these moments with a choppy, almost disjointed approach in places.<br/><br/>Add to this the over-the-top ruling society in which this takes place, thus straining the story's credibility, and I found myself having to suspend belief a few times too many, which is never good when the goal is to draw the audience in and bring them to the edge of their seats.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the two main teen characters - played by Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson - were a lot stronger than suspected, which at least gave me an emotional stake in the story, which frankly saved the film from being a much bigger disappointment.<br/><br/>All in all, I'd say that if you rent this to watch at home, you'll probably be satisfied, but if you like to save your movie theatre dollars for only top films, you're better off to wait for the DVD."

Now that I have, I have to say that I was spellbound by the whole thing! And megakudos to director Gary Ross for filming at such a compelling pace and giving lead Jennifer Lawrence great presence throughout. And having such supporting players like Stanley Tucci, Wes Bentley, Donald Sutherland, and especially Woody Harrelson add to something on screen when given their scenes. The inference about how violence involving 12 to 18-year-olds is used as merely entertainment for the rich masses in some unforeseen future really took me to someplace fascinating if maybe also a little frightening. In summary, I loved The Hunger Games and I can't wait for the sequels when they come!"
"wagnernogueira","10","2","3","9 September 2019"," Are you ready for the future ?
","The Hunger Games is a movie that you can see all the time and many times, because it´s really interesting and too much exciting. It´s a movie that was released in 2012, but I watch this movie every time I have opportunity to watch it. This is the first movie of a trilogy, and in the end of it you get so excited for the next chapter. Nowadays, you can see all of the chapter anywhere and anytime, because they are already released.
This movie is set in a horror and morbid future world and it discusses about the difference between social class. In one side, the poorest people that are divided in twelve districts, and they live in hard places that they don´t have almost anything to eat. In the other side, the Capital, the richest side that controls everything, like: the food, what they can do, time to sleep, work and other things. The Capital makes a game to ""control"" the poorest people, it calls ""THE HUNGER GAMES"". The game has this name because the winner can leave his/her district and move in to the Capital, the best place to live, and they win money to survive. The capital chooses one girl and one boy of each district to fight until the death and the other participants die. This is a grisly game, because just the last survivor can win the game and all the stewardship. Katniss Everdeen, Jennifer Lawrence, goes to the game with Peeta Mellark, Josh Hutcherson, and they both win it. There are many action and dramatic scene. Then, a romance of Peeta and Katniss goes to lands you away to another place, because it's a intense and a forbidden love."

","This is a good 'last one to survive' movie, similar to the game mode battle royale. The plot was good and was intriguing through out the whole movie. I like how it doesn't go straight to the action, rather it builds up to it which I liked. The action scenes were good, although I wish there was more, especially with the contestants fighting each other. One thing I didn't like about the movie is how the people in charge of the game were involved in the game itself and trying to manipulate how the game goes. Like starting a fire and unleashing beasts; what's that all about? I just wanted the contestants to fight without any help and influence from the people in charge. Other than that, the movie is pretty good and you should definitely watch it."

Maybe the bullet train advertisement or the Smartphone-like screens. The rest is just remake of a very very very old theme: a televised competition in which a group of people fight each other to the death. And why people is still flocking to the box office if they already have seen something pretty much like this before. Guess why: Because it is a televised competition in which a group of people fight each other to the death. Some people believe firmly that if you do the same thing over and over you may eventually come up with something different. So they go and see if their theory is right this time. This theme is so pathetically successful that they may even just change the title and keep the rest of the movie literally unchanged and they still will have a very good gross.

The amount of dragged out nonsense scenes are endless with dull and meaningless dialogue. At any point when some mildly interesting situation arises, it is instantly diminished by shocking camera work and almost infuriating plot development and yet more painful to watch character portrayal.<br/><br/>Anyways, I do understand that this picture is aimed at young girls and that it is a certificate PG-13 or something, but still, a poor piece of work.<br/><br/>And by the way, who the f* is Gary Ross?"
"alexander-thomas2210","3","2","3","1 March 2015"," Hunger Games become Slumber Games
","Having read the books by Suzanna Collins I was really disappointed by the Hunger Games film, directed by Gary Ross. The dystopian, science-fiction story is set in a post apocalyptic country called Panem. The ruling city 'Capitol' takes 24 children from 12 districts, places them in an arena and forces them kill each other until only one is left alive. These are 'The Hunger Games'. The film never comes close to the book except in its depiction of the poverty in District 12 and the gaudy decadence of the Capitol. It also criticises some aspects of modern society very clearly, such as the distribution of wealth. However the negative aspects of this film are far more numerous, for example you never feel properly connected to any of the characters, so you do not really care who lives and who dies. The director also fails to make the film in the least bit logical. A muscled young man dies instantly when hit by a arrow, but a tiny girl takes ages to die from a massive spear to the chest. The acting isn't great especially Josh Hutcherson, who plays Peeta, as he always comes over as whiny and pathetic. Jennifer Lawrence is adequate as Katniss but fails to make you relate to her. All in all I do not recommend you watch the film. Read the books, they are superior to the film in every way. I rate this film a 3 out of 10."
"rottninge","4","2","3","28 January 2015"," Y'all over 18! You agree on severe over-rating? (SPOILERS)
","Spoiler alert! From someone who have not read the books. Relevant: I'm 37, love movies, and consume them en masse.<br/><br/>I have avoided this series for years but now a good friend really wanted us to see the series so I took one for the team. Of course I realized the target audience has an average age of about 13,2 years. But not even that notion could save me. I've seen the Harry Potters and the Twilight Sagas and such, and I think I managed to put on a ""teen filter"" and could appreciate those products for what they were. But this. This is something else... What I thought of the characters? Were there characters in this movie? I only saw faces that spoke. I think some of them died. I'm not certain because nothing in this movie evoked any feelings in me except all over-the-top illogical things that made me doubt myself, thinking, ""That was so stupid I must be seeing things! I probably missed something here so I better shut up, because what just happened was so stupid it couldn't have happened"". The only ""character"" I could see on screen was delivered by Stanley Tucci. The Effie character had glimpses of actually being something of a person you could connect anything at all to. I actually think Mr Sutherland performed well (as always) but the movie just pooped on his performance, smothering it completely. The same goes for Mr Harrelson. Mr Kravitz!!?? No comment. Love his music though.<br/><br/>The whole art design and atmosphere had some sort of TV- production/documentary touch I couldn't really grasp. I guess I feel like it was presented to me like by a five year old presenting his/her drawings: ""Here is the poor, here is the rich, here is a forest, here is the city, here's a police man, here comes another one"". Jennifer Lawrence, Jennifer Lawrence, Jennifer Lawrence. She may be a lot of things, but she's NOT on fire in this movie (or the next one). This role is just not coming out right. Maybee it's even so that it's not in her pocket to play this kind of roles...<br/><br/>All stupidities that happened... Well I haven't read the book. Maybee it's all explained there. But it's not a pre-requisite to have read the book. There are so many things... But the major ones: It's never really explained how this gory TV-show is to hold a whole nation under control. Yes, they explain it by talking of fear and hope of different degrees and how to manipulate it and maintain control. But they fail to create a feeling of the situation and why this TV-show is needed. What's confusing is when you see the resources the upper class and government have, in the form of superior forces, technology and food and energy. Teaming up in a sole-survivor-kill-em-all competition is a good idea all of a sudden? This isn't some reality TV-show... you kill one and other here... I understand that the ones that doesn't want to murder team up by instinct. But the trained killers - why would they ever want to stay within proximity of the other trained killers??? Dog- monsters (this is actually part of the ""superior resources"" point) that are created out of thin air, becomes solid creatures that can tear humans apart. Isn't this a more efficient way to control the poor labour in the outer districts than some TV-show?<br/><br/>Final point is on the subject of how to point with a bow and arrow... I had to Google her technique because I got a funny feeling every time she was aiming at something. Modern bows with all the tech-stuff on them, you hold the way she does. With traditional ones, like the one in THG, you need to have the end of the arrow further up, closer to the eye, because the only thing to aim with is the arrow... Silly detail really. But if you ask me I say it's such a central detail it's mandatory to get right."

Here I will spoil about as much as you see in the trailer and some unimportant trivia. If this offends you stop reading now.<br/><br/>The book/plot starts with a fantastic setting of an post-apocalyptic world where the super high-tech capitol and surrounding colonies. It also contains a number of silly concepts - like a super high-tech capitol that can easily gather 100 000 people on a sporting event but still, for some reason, needs impoverished colonies of about 8000 people. Pretty much all of the characters (except for Katniss) are flat and easily summed up with one or two words. The story itself is as straight as a highway with pretty much nothing really surprising the reader. It's not hard to imagine what you average movie adaptation does with a start like this.<br/><br/>And it does exactly that. The characters are dumbed down your average Hollywood norm, and the plot is even more straightforward, since the only interesting parts (like Katniss' view on things) are lost.<br/><br/>The rest of the movie stuff: The acting was decent, the visual effects were OK, sound effects too. I was hoping for a decent song or two, but didn't get anything. The screenplay was using some plot devices only when it suited it and forgot about it after a while. Nothing else really left a lasting impression.<br/><br/>To sum up, this was pretty much the most mediocre film i've seen in a long time. Nothing was *bad* like The-Last-Airbender-bad, but nothing was good either. So if you're in for some brainless entertainment involving teenager killing each other or a fan of the book - go for it.

The other aspect that is a shortcoming is the production quality. It's high sheen and once again good concept but is lost on too much CGI , bad location choices, repetitive scenes, and not great camera work. Another movie relying on post-production enhancements. Oh and the sound is terrible. Parts with the bird calls are a joke sounds like reverberated overkill and muffled. And I watched the hi-def version with enhanced sound (so to speak) There are also plot problems like why would the little African girl even bother with an alliance with the main character when she was the most stealthy of them all and she takes a hit for the white girl that already had advantages given to her (sponsors) and writer implausibilities tacked on. There are also odd edits and a tameness in the whole flick that would have made this movie more suited for a TV mini series. But I go back the main concept and it's a good story and it could have been a classic if handled right, with it's future dystopian society that seems like a sub-story of Brave New World which unfolds outside two classes, one worker class that lives in the Re-wilds fringe and the other which is a mixture Elite with what looks to be Women ruling and Homosexual men interspersed.

I cant even begin to start on how bad the drama was portrayed. You feel about as much attachment to the other tributes as you might have to a rock.<br/><br/>The story depends on the capitol being the enemy and pitching all the districts against each other. This film completely retards any effect of the hunger games. The film misses little story from the book, but without this suspense and attachment, the death of each tribute means nothing. For example: The first tribute to die in the novel screams out in horror and pleads for her life as she is brutally killed :: In the film, all you hear(nothing is shown) is one scream ahhhh! then the canon shot signaling the death.... <br/><br/>In order to build the proper feelings of empathy for the tributes and anger for the capitol and the game makers, a measure of brutality is needed to build the proper depth of this film, but is missing. The tributes might as well be playing paint ball...."
"bayou_hannibal","4","2","3","27 August 2012"," A typical book-to-movie translation, but with terrible camera work too
","The Hunger Games movie is like a lot of book-to-movie translations. It is at least watchable, largely because of the quality of the source material. But, also like a lot of book-to-movie translations, it suffers badly from the need to take all of the background and story that you get from a novel and cram it into a movie of acceptable length. In this case, it has to be date movie length. The usual result is a mediocre effort where you can see the brilliance of the source material around the periphery, but which still makes major sacrifices out of necessity. The Hunger Games is a little worse than the usual result, because it also has possibly the worst camera work that I have ever seen in my life. I guess that's what happens when you hand the keys to the Hunger Games Ferrari to a director whose only accomplishments are Pleasantville and Seabiscuit.<br/><br/>I hadn't heard of the book series until the movie was about to come out, and then my wife told me the general outline. My reaction was ""Holy crap that sounds cool? Why didn't anyone tell me about this before?"" It is a futuristic, semi-post-apocalyptic story where an oppressive government stages a horrifying gladiator match between 24 children once per year. It is The Running Man, but this time with innocent kids, and it is much more disturbing. The best part about The Hunger Games is how unsettling it is. The movie gives you a brief background of how this came about – A few generations ago, some of the country rebelled against the government, resulting in a terrible Civil War. The rebels lost, and, as punishment, each district must now offer up two kids as ""tribute"" every year. You can tell while watching that the movie gives you the thumbnail version of this story. It's enough to make the movie work, however.<br/><br/>At every moment, regardless of what is happening on the screen, the movie's premise sits at the back of your mind. The kids are addressed as ""tributes"". The privileged elite take bets on the contestants and watch it like the Super Bowl. How could a society become so cruel? How can some parts of the population become so dehumanized that they delight in watching teenagers hunt each other like animals and slash each other with knives and swords? If you win, are you so scarred for life from having to kill other kids that you would have been better off losing? You might be asking yourself that after seeing Woody Harrelson's character. As the lone winner from District 12, he is famous and now part of the elite. So what does he spend the day doing? Drinking away his misery.<br/><br/>The movie works. That is about the best thing that I can say about it. The raw material is good enough to at least keep you from switching if off. Unfortunately, it doesn't work very well. The biggest problem with The Hunger Games is that the movie is completely unable to deliver its events with the emotional weight that they need. Characters follow their actions in the book, but they make no sense on the screen because we haven't been given adequate background. Characters die with sympathetic music and tears, but none of these deaths register with you, as the viewer. Why? Because everyone other than Katniss hardly gets any screen time. The actual death match only lasts about an hour on film. In that time, lots of people get killed, but none of them with enough buildup or suspense to pack a punch. We never get enough information to understand the dynamics between the contestants. Even when the movie's ""villain"" bites it, if you want to call him that, there's less of a feeling of relief, and more the feeling of ""eh, I guess this means the movie's over now?"" Time after time, I had to swallow something that seemed implausible at the time, thinking to myself ""the book probably explains this better"". According to my wife, it does.<br/><br/>A good director could have made this movie better. Unfortunately, the camera work in this movie is a disaster. I am flabbergasted by how bad it is. A major part of this movie, if not most of it, appears to have been shot with a hand-held camera. Unlike lots of other ""shaky cam"" movies though, it's not just the action scenes that will hurt your eyes. Dialog and exposition scenes also feature this terrible camera work. The camera constantly drifts or shakes. The angles are poor. You get close-ups when you want to see wider shots, and you get wider shots when you want close-ups. I don't go into movies looking for reasons not to like them, but five minutes into this one, I was already annoyed. By the halfway point, I wanted to punch the director in the face.<br/><br/>Is The Hunger Games worth watching? I guess so. I don't regret watching it, but I have little desire to see it again. What I really wish is that this book had been made into a TV series ala Game of Thrones. Then, it could have been given the time that it needed to better develop its characters and background. The Hunger Games movie feels a lot like the Cliffs Notes version of the novel."
"toprak_artu","5","2","3","21 August 2012"," Not good enough
","The biggest flaw of this movie is the way the contestants behave. Imagine being thrown away into a jungle arena in which 23 of the 24 people will certainly die. You would be paranoid, on the edge, aggressive. You would trust no one. Well, in this movie it's just the opposite: The contestants immediately make pacts that everyone takes for granted,nobody watches their back, they sleep like babies all together under a tree which their rival has climbed upon. They sit right in the middle of an evacuation area like a duck although their rivals have bows. It is as if these are not young people facing horrible ways to die, but contestants of a singer/dancer competition. There is no tension in the movie, which was the first thing to put in there in order to make it at least a little bit believable. Besides that, the control room interferes with the game bluntly and openly. People wouldn't like to watch that. It's like watching a quiz show although you know they give away the answers. The control room shoots fireballs at the contestants, imagine the rest!"

Maybe it has already with embedded journalists, appointed victims from the Dark House, (home made) video's with the most gruesome content leaping out of every laptop, etc. I try not to seek this part of civilization, being too aware it's there.<br/><br/>The first half our of the movie is bad. There is no character building and i was lost several times, having to ask my daughter what it was about. I guess they expect we all read the book first.<br/><br/>After that i sort of understood what was happening and it got predictable (i always amaze my daughter, telling her what comes next). There are some reality flaws in it, the purple fashion thing doesn't work and to be honest, if you make a movie like this, please don't mix in some very predictable romance angle, while you should have emphasized on the lust and decadence of the first district.

So sad even just watching this i wish i had a remote to click pause cause it gets boring. The story should have start on the FIGHT and SURVIVE, and introduce the main and other warrior characters which are unique only to them. I am just fond of shows and movies but this could have been so much better presented. Of course, the title itself says everything, HUNGER GAMES, so it's all about games where death, gore and contest are in it.<br/><br/>I have seen TV series with such quality of presentation and the casts isn't that high of a profile that would beat this one. I really love the casts but overrated. I have not read the book yet but they may have there own reason for why the movie was made like this.

"stevenmcl93","4","2","3","11 August 2012"," Book > Movie
","I bought the book on a train journey home one day and absolutely loved it - finishing it later that evening. I then decided to watch the film online to see if it lived up to the hype. In my view it didn't... and here's why:<br/><br/>1) Ending in the book: shocking and dramatic. In this: lazy and uninspiring. Obviously I won't go into detail to risk ruining it for others.<br/><br/>2) The characters in the book are depicted as 12-18 year-olds, yet the leads in the movie are all in their early 20's. This somehow makes me feel less sorry for the characters as the killing of annoying, talentless adults compared to teenagers is less shocking and doesn't help me imagine the book in a literal sense. Plus the acting from about 90% of the actors is god-awful.<br/><br/>3) Forgive me for sounding like a bit of a sadist, but those who have read the book will know there is a fair amount of gore described in the deaths of the characters. This, however, is a watered down version showing very little gore at all - obviously, to try and appeal to a younger teenage audience. This again takes away some of the sadness as the deaths seem quick and painless compared to the books gory depiction. Even the trailer describes it as a 'bloodbath', but I can assure you it's not. The most blood you will see in this movie is probably on the weapons themselves.<br/><br/>4) The directors have definitely focused on quantity rather than quality in this. Admittedly, they try their best to cram in as much of the story as they can, but the scenes they depict are very flat, dull, uninspiring and rushed. All of the best moments in the book are literally squashed into 2-3 minute segments leaving the audience to think ""was that it?"". All of this, of course, being shot by the worst cameraman in the world.. which brings me onto my fifth and most important point.<br/><br/>5) During the little action you see in the film, the camera is so unbelievably shaky that it is impossible to see what is going on. Whether or not this was intended, it simply doesn't work. And may leave some feeling a bit nauseated.<br/><br/>There are very few good points I could give without ruining the plot, not that there are many, but the depiction of Cinna by Lenny Kravitz was very very good admittedly.<br/><br/>Overall a BIG disappointment after the book."
"codydansher","4","2","3","12 July 2012"," Could have been great.
","I came into the crowded theater, hoping to see the movie live up to the book. I left disappointed. But it could have been worse.<br/><br/>First off, I loved the first book. I couldn't stop reading it until the final page was flipped. So my expectations for this movie were stacked pretty high. But I still think my expectations weren't met. The thing that killed the movie was it's PG-13 rating. The premise of the movie is kids killing other kids. And if there are no guns or bombs involved, then it must be very bloody. But it turns out to be bloodless. The action is destroyed... Wait for it... Through a shaky camera. Really? The inevitable action sequences are kept ""family friendly"" through a possibly drunken camera man. In fact, the shaking goes on through out the movie. Action-wise, it only is kept still when there is danger that doesn't actually kill anyone. Those that are killed, are either killed off screen, or through the sickening shaking of the camera. The action scenes are heavily cut, and seem obsolete to the result of the movie. All that's left to wonder about is the Relationship between Katniss, Rue, and Peeta. The movie is supposed to be a future government forcing kids to kill each other, not a future government forcing kids to make out with each other in caves, all while under the heavy watch of a shaky camera. It shouldn't even be in the Action/Adventure category. But it could have been worse.<br/><br/>The acting was great, and the effects were good. The locations were better than I expected them to be (Although, I couldn't fully enjoy all of them, thanks to a certain camera crew.) If the Directing and Camera crew were totally replaced, then the movie would be much better than it actually is.<br/><br/>Let's hope Catching Fire will be better. Although the 2nd book wasn't as good as the first, the casting of the new Director, and new actors, could be what is needed to save the trilogy. It would take major improvements, but it could be done. Time will only tell."
"abhirahul","5","2","3","30 May 2012"," Great Hype, Disappointing attempt
","The Hunger Games seemed a very exciting project to start with all the hype around its starcast, book trilogy and fast paced trailers. But the end result disappoints big time. There has been a lot of fuss around the fact that it's an excellent adaptation from the original books and that it has lots of similar moments to Battle Royale. Well coming from a person without any pre-conceived notions (neither watched the Battle royale nor read the books)this movie came across as a very poor attempt of film making as well as the story telling. <br/><br/>Performance:- Jennifer Lawrence is pleasing to the eyes and acts decently promising a good future, But Josh Hutcherson is a misfit. Liam Hemsworth's role is next to nothing. Woody Harrelson does provide some lighter moments though. <br/><br/>Cinematography:- The Shaky camera approach to almost every action scene takes the sting out of this so called action thriller. Where is the fun if you can't see what's happening. <br/><br/>Screenplay:- Unaware of the book details I would say the events unfolding in the movie are predictable to say the least. The struggle of the protagonist doesn't seem challenging or real enough and the cheesy end doesn't help its case either. <br/><br/>Direction:- One word - Poor.<br/><br/>The healthy premise of a promising subject was executed badly. Hope they improve over this ordinary effort in the sequels to come (which seems quite unlikely with the same technical team around and the amount of mad money the film has made) as I definitely felt my hard earned money was wasted in its ticket."

Another thing which stuck in my mind that how a group of kids made a group when they didn't know anyone.

"mnpollio","4","2","3","26 May 2012"," Plodding adaptation of a great bestseller
","Suzanne Collins' novel was a deserved bestseller because it was fast-paced and intelligent with a strong heroine at its core. Which is why it is so disappointing that the most accurate description of the film version is plodding.<br/><br/>Set in a repressive future, where twelve progressively poorer districts pay penance to a rich capital city by way of a lottery that forces a male and female teenage recruit from each district to participate in The Hunger Games, a yearly televised gladiator style competition played until only one survivor is left standing. When her innocent and vulnerable 12-year-old sister is selected against all odds, the resourceful Katniss Everdeen volunteers to take her place, and along with the male offering, Peeta, is whisked away to be trained for the deadly games.<br/><br/>The film is largely faithful to the novel, but feels compelled to tone certain aspects down to its detriment and add things that are unnecessary. Director Gary Ross provides by-the-numbers direction that is far more dull than inspired. His visions of this world are disappointing. The dirt poor District 12 looks like a set for denizens of Deliverance, except that Katniss, her sister and her friend Gale are entirely too well scrubbed for such a place. By contrast, the capital city and its citizens seem like they were snatched from one of the cheesier episodes of 1960s Star Trek.<br/><br/>The set up of the lottery, the trip to the city and the training seems to go on forever. Ross and company provide some very badly done flashbacks to fill in gaps in the narrative. For instance, Katniss is conflicted that Peeta has been chosen since he risked the wrath of his tyrant mother and showed her a kindness when her family was starving. The book told us in a couple of paragraphs. The film requires no less than three flashbacks so vague that those unfamiliar may think Peeta is being mean to her in them by throwing food to pigs.<br/><br/>Once the action moves to the Games, it doesn't get any better. The use of music (which can enhance suspense) is severely limited and Ross films the action with one of those jitter-cams, which often makes it near impossible to fathom what is going on. Worse, any time we start to become involved in the action in the forest, Ross and company segue to an added sequence featuring Donald Sutherland's icy president or Wes Bentley's calculating gamesmaster (a character not in the novel) or some other lackluster diversion.<br/><br/>The casting which sounds great on paper, turns out to be a mixed bag. Sutherland dusts off his glare as the predominant villain. Bentley is fine, but his role is excess baggage. Woody Harrelson is a great choice to play a former winner who functions as an adviser/agent to the the two main characters, but the script has reigned in or eliminated some of his best moments. Elizabeth Banks is little more than a buffoon as the ludicrous Effie Trinkett, while Lenny Kravitz manages to be sympathetic as a kind stylist.<br/><br/>In the core role, Jennifer Lawrence seemed to be a real coup for Katniss. Unfortunately, she comes off like a more mundane Helen Hunt. Katniss should be appealing and dynamic. On paper, she popped. On film, not so much. Part of the problem is that Katniss is conflicted about a number of things and Lawrence has confused conflicted with ambivalence. Instead of filling the gaps destined to happen in a film transfer, Lawrence keeps both the other characters and the viewer at arm's length. We believe she is tough and resourceful and can do miracles with a bow, but she is so aloof for the most part that we don't care. Instead of insight, we get far too many scenes of Lawrence either brooding or weeping as a substitute. When she develops a rapport with a young competitor, Lawrence fails to make us understand why or feel that it is anything other than a plot contrivance. We never feel any doubt in the film that she will triumph, so the film seems to be marching slowly to a preordained climax. Lawrence also shares no chemistry with co-star Josh Hutcherson, which mutes the later moments between them.<br/><br/>It is arguably a scripting and acting fault that Hutcherson, despite lack of chemistry with Lawrence, actually emerges as more sympathetic and whose character, whose future seems much murkier, elicits more concern. Hutcherson manages to take on a more passive role, and successfully elicit the sympathy that often and puzzlingly eludes the lead. Yet if Lawrence has no chemistry with Hutcherson, she has even less with Liam Hemsworth as Gale. The film takes a character whose appearance in the novel was basically as a bookend and tries to set the ground for some kind of Twilight-lite triangle. Hemsworth is entirely too clean for District 12, generates no heat with the leading lady and has the thankless task of being reduced to either smiling or pouting - the latter of which he does not do well. Too many segues from the action to Hemsworth looking angsty to remind us that he is in the film and supposed to be of some import become annoying quickly.<br/><br/>While not a total disaster by any means, the film truly misses the mark by a farther mile than many would have you believe. The film is neither suspenseful nor does it allow us to really get to know or root for the heroine, a character that jumped off the written page. The additions are ill-conceived and the workmanlike direction proves entirely unsuited for material that requires a surer, more inspired hand. And would someone please tell directors to stop shaking the camera all over the place in some misguided attempt to generate ""you are there"" excitement...it doesn't work."
"spudhalvorson","3","2","3","13 May 2012"," Minor Spoilers: Budgeting Cheats
","I saw the 1st adapted movie after reading the first Hunger Games book - they could have done better with this film. Many would interpret such this to mean I wanted more gore and death - but this is not the case. What was lacking from this the most was nudity (not sexuality per se) and a more sophisticated if not blasé attitude regarding life and life's value(including sexuality); the film needed a rawer, more somber tone. 3/10 is an extra-critical vote based on reducing a a pretty-good book to cinematic fluff.<br/><br/>The vexing teen angst that does bubble up from time to time in the Hunger Games book is thankfully overshadowed by a raw, pragmatic need for survival and all which that requires. The raw elements of illness and injury, and the sadness which accompanies the loss of loved ones through traumatic experience is refreshing. Ultimately the book is worth the read.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the need for box-office profits sets a stage for adaptations to be razed of their quintessential value until most of what remains is a flimsy, teenage adventure epic. PG-13 might bring in more viewers, but it reduces any adaptation to trite and forgettable.<br/><br/>As others have pointed out, the character building is weak. One central character is 'The Arena' itself (the place where the contestants are corralled to kill each other). Like in the book, the Arena contains a wooded forest environment, unlike in the book - the movie Arena is devoid of a grassland, devoid of rocky slopes (where our protagonists' cave should have been), devoid of sloping ravines where creeks should flow and supply fish (and are later completed drained and dried by the Arena's controllers) and devoid of an ever-changing climate (hot and freezing) which lends to our protagonists suffering/starving more easily in the book. Because the film producers chose to make the forest ubiquitous in the Arena and the forest temperate (not even a drop of rain - let alone torrential) our heroine doesn't need a sleeping bag for warmth, and they leave out that book element. The directors also leave out night-vision glasses (?). <br/><br/>The severity of injuries and all that intones is also marginalized. In the book, Peeta is dying of an infection and blood poisoning for which ointment and an antibiotic is needed: ergo, the director reduces the severity of the injury, no shot is needed (which Katniss stabs into her partner in the book), instead launching the viewer into the final trial without any delay.<br/><br/>Although many movies are far too long, the brevity of this film leads to two-dimensional heroes we feel little connection to. The film feels rushed. Incidentally, while ""The Games"" are supposedly drawn out over a two-week period, I felt as though maybe only 4-5 days had elapsed in the film. If this was a non-adapted screenplay I might have given it a four, but for the disappointment this 'adaptation' brings - I give it a three."

","I was expecting quite a movie. This whole concept of making a mortal game has been an exciting idea for me. Yet, it looked like a kid movie, in which all the necessary elements for this kind of a concept were eliminated. To me, it is normal to expect seeing some breath-taking gore and profanity, if the movie is grounded on a death game. <br/><br/>Still, the movie was watchable for the plot's sake, nonetheless the camera-work kicked in and ruined the joy. I don't know if they wanted to try out some new style or something but I found it rather annoying. The angle changed so sharply. And the first person takes, which took place quite a few times, almost made me feel dizzy. For instance at the part, where Katniss and the blade girl( i called her that way) were fighting, it was almost impossible to tell who was who. <br/><br/>For the next movies to come, I hope the producers will improves these downsides and will not try to hide the gore.

Damn goes the so called popularity..<br/><br/>It does not have any screenplay at all. The actors did fairly well. Actually, none other than the lead actress had anything challenging to do at all. Well, she was good, to be honest. And I guess the popularity credit goes largely to her. Moreover, the next-Megan-fox blah blah things turned up the meter as well. You might anticipate some actions. Nothing I got. The camera-work seemed horrible to me. No actions were perfectly screened. Its all just a somehow-finished-it stuff. The most important thing is, you have to have some tempo in an action movie. The movie was a disaster in this sense.<br/><br/>I'll sum up now. If you liked Godfather and all the IMDb top-listed mo0vies and the Oscar and Cannes winners, you got to stop yourself from watching the movie. If you are a cheap movie-lover and enjoy whatever they show you because you are completing your assignment while watching it, you are most welcome. To me, it was yet another I-don't-know-how-people-see-these movie type."
"knowyourmovie","5","2","3","13 April 2012"," The box office success does not make ""The Hunger Games"" less disappointing
","After I finished watching ""The Hunger Games"", it remained a profound mystery to me how such a mediocre movie could possibly have received so warm welcome from public and critics alike. That was something so surprising, so puzzling, and - let us face it – so annoying, that I decided to use the elimination technique to find out what exactly had made ""The Hunger Games"" so attractive to such a diverse audience.<br/><br/>It could not have possibly been the story – poorly written, shallow and strikingly unentertaining. While I have not read the book that served the basis for the movie, I am almost certain that the original story written by Suzanne Collins lost most of its depth, intrigue, and punch in the process of being adapted for the big screen. <br/><br/>As Samuel Goldwyn famously said, ""We want a story that starts out with an earthquake and works its way up to a climax."" ""The Hunger Games"" employs the opposite strategy - it starts quite lethargically and ends quite anticlimactically.<br/><br/>Specifically, the movie begins with the boring, barely watchable cliché that drags for quite some time until the main characters finally leave the coal-mining District 12 on the train that takes them the Capitol where the 74th Hunger Games take place. The travel on the train and the preparation for the games are a little livelier, mostly because of the excellent diverse set of the vivid supporting characters played by the battle-hardened, experienced acting crew (Stanley Tucci, Woody Harrelson, Donald Sutherland, Toby Jones) fittingly joined by Elizabeth Banks, Wes Bentley, and Lenny Kravitz. <br/><br/>The games themselves are suspenseful and engaging enough, but also a little dull, far from mind blowing. I am not even talking about such an extravagant luxury as character development: following the regrettable pattern from the preceding parts of the movie, the game scenes fail to demonstrate anything even remotely original or even slightly thought provoking. <br/><br/>The ending is almost unprofessionally weak and disappointing, especially taking into account that ""The Hunger Games"" is expected to have sequels. Not only there are no cliffhangers that would keep us wondering and almost no hints that would keep us intrigued, but there is also even no sense of completeness of the piece; the abrupt ending creates an impression of a semi-finished, half-done job. <br/><br/>If not the story, what could have possibly made ""The Hunger Games"" so dear to the hearts of the millions of the moviegoers? I doubt that it was special or visual effects, that happened to be mostly basic and unimaginative. If you do not believe me, simply try watching a movie with truly well done special effects (""The Lord of The Rings"", ""Pirates of the Caribbean"", ""Inception"", ""Avatar"", or even ""Hugo"") and then compare it with the undistinguished, unoriginal averageness of the effects in ""The Hunger Games"".<br/><br/>The directing, only slightly better than average, can easily be eliminated from list of the features that make the movie worth watching. It is not surprising therefore, that Gary Ross would not be directing the sequel of ""The Hunger Games"".<br/><br/>The acting on the other hand was mostly solid and convincing, although the poorly written story and dialogues did not leave the actors much room to express their talents. It was almost painful to watch the excellent performance of Jennifer Lawrence wasted on such an unworthy of her talent movie.<br/><br/>On the technical side, camera work and editing were quite unimpressive to say the least. Sometimes they were simply horrible. More than on one occasion the incessant wobbling of the camera combined with the frequent image flickering was physically painful to the eyes. At times, the picture on the screen was changing so rapidly that it made some scenes (including the final fight) hard to follow and almost confusing.<br/><br/>And yet, what is the secret of the popularity of ""The Hunger Games""?<br/><br/>I think that the answer is simple and complicated at the same time. Of course, we should not write off the popularity of the book, the exceptionally well-done trailer, and the skillful and highly effective marketing campaign.<br/><br/>The main reason, however, seems to be that the movie tells a basic, convenient, easily digestible story, preying on the unfortunate misconceptions, toxic stereotypes, naïve illusions, and hidden desires that rack the fragile souls of the teenagers, young adults, and even older and supposedly wiser generations of moviegoers. <br/><br/>Sadly, instead of stimulating independent thinking, so important for teenagers and young adults, ""The Hunger Games"" readily conforms to their stereotypical expectations and eagerly indulges their primitive fantasies. <br/><br/>That is what happens when authors too literally follow the famous (faulty) principle declared long time ago by Samuel Goldwyn: ""Pictures are for entertainment, messages should be delivered by Western Union.""<br/><br/>knowyourmovie.blogspot.com"

"renaissancewoman-34593","5","1","1","26 March 2020"," Decentish if you haven't read the books? Or possibly just confusing?
","Seems very shallow after the books; would have been better as a miniseries. The storytelling seemed choppy, and everything came off as too sudden because there wasn't enough time to provide setup that would have explained character motivations. Katniss' commentary was also lacking, of course, and it was hard to tell what was she was thinking. It's especially bad, I think, if you've read the books, because then you know just how much is going on in her head, and what you're missing out on! The movie gives little hint that a large part of Katniss' connection to Peeta is how she feels that she owes him for helping her. And the association with the dandelion---thus her ability to support self and family---is never mentioned at all! It feels like the human depth was stripped from the story for the movie, and the romance was played up a little too much as such. Did not accurately portray Katniss' conflicted state.<br/><br/>Interesting how Portia just suddenly appeared in the background. And I rather missed Venia, Octavia, and Flavius. And why did it almost seem like the mockingjay pin was contraband? In the book, they were all permitted to have an item from home, and hers was approved.<br/><br/>Overall, it wasn't horrible, but it certainly wasn't good."

","The Hunger Games takes place in what was once North America. Their Capital city of Panem maintains it's so called peace and security by forcing it's 12 districts to select a boy and a girl, called Tributes, to compete in a nationally televised event called the Hunger Games. Every person living in Panem must watch as the selected tributes fight to the death until only one remains. The winner of the games receives eternal freedom from the games and a life of luxury. However, the winner must become a mentor to the tributes selected from their district. District 12 Tribute, Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) struggles to survive in her poverty filled district. She relies on her hunting skills and sharp instincts to survive. When Katniss' sister Prim is selected to be a tribute, Katniss eagerly volunteers and takes her sister's place. A childhood friend from her past, Peeta Mellark, is selected as the male tribute. Katniss embarks on an unreal journey in preparation for the games. Katniss learns to fight for survival based on her superior skills with a bow and arrow and her animal- like instincts. While in the arena, she must weigh survival against love. I admire how the director of this movie was able to include most every detail from the book. It was very easy to follow and understand even for someone who had not previously read the book. The director's choice that stood out to me the most was the scene with the tracker jackers. Katniss knocks down a hive full of venomous tracker jacker bees and as Katniss is stung, the effect that the bees venom has on her is shown through through the film. The scene is shot through Katniss' eyes and you are able to see her blurry vision and the way she is struggling to move. You can hear the sound of the tracker jackers buzzing like they are in your ears. It is a very life-like scene and puts you in the position to see what it would be like to be stung by a tracker jacker. That effect is something that the movie could give the book couldn't.
Although this movie was a good interpretation of the book by Suzanne Collins, I thought that it seemed a bit rushed. There were many details that the movie missed that would have been helpful to aid in the overall understanding of the story. For someone who did not read the both before watching the movie, I'm sure they would've had some unanswered questions and been confused a few times. I do not necessarily think the movie should have been longer, but I think they could've shifted the amount of time they spent on certain parts in order to add extra details that they missed.
However, I appreciated the sound track and it fit the movie extremely well. It helped add to the suspenseful scenes and make the exciting ones that much more. The music also pulled at the audiences emotions.
Overall, the movie was an excellent coverage of the book and the the story itself. I would have liked to add some of the missing things from the book if time permitted but all in all a great film."
"Special-K88","Null","1","1","25 March 2019"," intriguing story and great cast make for a solid showing
","Survival of the fittest motion picture based on the novel by Suzanne Collins set in the dystopian, post-apocalyptic nation of Panem, which is divided between twelve working-class districts, and the corrupt, upper-class Capitol. To punish the districts for a past rebellion, each year the Capitol selects two tributes (one male, one female) between the ages of twelve and eighteen to compete in the Hunger Games, a televised fight to the death where there can only be one survivor. To protect her younger sister, sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen, a skilled archer from District 12, volunteers to join the games where she's forced to compete against the various tributes, among them fellow District 12 member Peeta Mellark. Intense and exciting with creative action scenes, a vivid portrait of this bleak world, and a well-chosen cast across the board with Lawrence compelling in the central role. The violence is clearly watered-down, and the story loses some of its thrust in the third act, but the overall results are still impressive. ***"
"maxim-delaet","7","1","1","11 February 2019"," Good story, Good acting, But way too rushed.
","I can write a whole book about this movie (no pun intended), but I will keep it short.<br/><br/>The book obviously deserves all the love it gets, setting an incredible storyline.<br/><br/>The movie is definitely not the worst filming a book can enjoy, but makes a big mistake when it starts rushing to the wonderful dramatic events that the book already created for it.
The acting was definitely alright, and this is indeed one of the movies where J Lawrence won my respect!"
"debbjorkdahl","7","1","1","7 January 2019"," Read the book first, please.
","This movie was in it's whole, better than I thought it would be. Making a book-to-movie adaptation can be very hard, especially when you have to try and find a way to portray a character as complex and analytical as Katniss. But I have to give kudos to Jennifer Lawrence for taking on that role, and playing her beautifully. I'll admit, she was a bit more agressive and impulsive than the book version, but it's easily forgivable considering Katniss's thought life being just as cynical and sometimes aggressive. I relate to her very much. She wasn't in it for the glory. She sacrificed herself for her sister and mother, and because she knew she had a better chance of surviving. She has a sense of duty stronger than most fictional characters I've read about.
To people who haven't read the book, I can understand if they don't like it. There are a lot of plot points that weren't explained properly, and for a person who's diving into this movie without having read the book, it can be very confusing, and honestly just unsatisfactory. So, if you want to understand the movie, and maybe enjoy it more, I highly reccommend reading the book."

"victory-34610","2","1","1","30 October 2015"," OK movie
","I loved Battle Royale for its roughness, political message and pure shock value. There is nothing like that, when there is the first combat scene, it fails miserably. You can basically see only shaking camera. Then there is another long boring part, then again some super short combat messed again by another shaky camera. Then some hallucinations, then some memories, then some other boring sequence. There is a lot of similar movies (TV show that will be survived only by the sole victor) and every single of them is more thrilling. The only thing that would make the movie even more unbearable would be Sandra Bullock in the leading role.<br/><br/>The Hunger Games is a joke, it is less thrilling that any Harry Potter movie. It is basically movie for kids dressed as a thriller. It is definitely not recommended for anyone ho seeks real thriller or really powerful movie. But again: If you are twelve it might be fine for you. The leading actress is pretty so you may be happy just to observe her in various dresses and enjoy when she runs around the woods. There is a bit of tears, flower gathering and shallow morale for these teenage girls who may like this Hunting Barbie kind of stuff. As a male I have suffered horribly however.<br/><br/>One extra point for silly costumes and crazy haircuts. This is probably the only shocking thing in the whole movie."
"Coventry","6","1","1","16 February 2015"," Big Cinema circus/hype that *almost* stilled my hunger
","I'm only in my early thirties, but extremely grumpy and old-fashioned for my age. I'm a giant admirer of classic horror/cult cinema and thus consequently a hater of everything that falls under the category of popular new teenage age trends, including remakes of classic horror movies and ridiculously over-hyped and phony franchises (like ""Twilight"", for instance). I automatically assumed that ""The Hunger Games"" would fall under this last subcategory and thus decided not to waste any time or money on it, but then it came on television and I had nothing better to watch, so what the hell. I must admit that I was quite entertained by this first movie in the franchise and – contrary to what I feared –compared to ""The Hunger Games"", any entry in the ""Twilight"" saga looks like an episode of the ""Teletubbies"". Obviously I still think this movie is tremendously overrated and I didn't like it enough in order to run out and immediately purchase all the other sequels right away, but at least I was pleasantly surprised by the overall grim & depressing atmosphere, the brutality of some of the death sequences and the execution of the basic story concept. Speaking of which, the plot is as old as cinema itself and absolutely doesn't anything original. Back in 1933 already, there was a fabulous movie that dealt about the hunting-humans formula – entitled ""The Most Dangerous Game"" – and since then there came copious of rip-offs, imitations or variants. Some of them are cheap and dull (""Bloodlust!""), some of them are sleazy (""The Women Hunt""), some of them are extremely violent (""Blood Camp Thatcher"") and some of them became legendary cult classics themselves (""Battle Royale""). Some of them already even integrated the sub plot of the hunting game being one giant reality TV show, like ""The Running Man"" and Lucio Fulci's obscure piece of Sci-Fi trash ""The New Gladiators"". Basically that's all ""The Hunger Games"" is; another umpteenth re-telling of ""The Most Dangerous Game"", except this time it's based on a novel that all teenagers across the world have read and loved, so they think it's unique and groundbreaking. It's definitely innovating at all, but I'm already glad that it became a thriller with a a reasonably disturbing dystopian setting, a fair amount of suspense, intense situations and above average acting performances. Somewhere in the (not too distant) future, the nation of Panem – which is whatever is left over from the United States – is divided into 12 districts, ranged from proud and powerful to pitiable and poor. Once per year, the authorial president Snow organizes the ""hunger games""; a big media circus in which 24 randomly selected participants, two from each district, and unleashed into a wilderness where they battle each other to the death. In District 12, Katniss Everdeen volunteered to take the place of her younger sister, and she also happens to be a cool chick and a brilliant archer. There's quite a lot of additional blah blah and uninteresting sub plots, but I will admit that ""The Hunger Games"" contains a handful of impressive action sequences in the jungle and even a few shocking moments in spite of its PG-13 rating. The apotheosis is utterly weak, which is inevitably I suppose, and the use of computer-engineered effects (the mutated dog- pack attack, for example) is terribly annoying, but perhaps this is all linked to me being a sourpuss. As for the remaining installments in the series, I will patiently wait until they get aired on TV as well."
"JimmyCollins","9","11","32","21 March 2012"," Jennifer Lawrence was born to play Katniss.
","When the wonderful Jennifer Lawrence was cast in the much coveted role of Katniss Everdeen there was a lot of uproar from devoted fans of the novels on which this film is based, I however think that she is perfectly cast. From the early images which surfaced online all the way to the trailer and the final poster I thought she looked the part, and after seeing the final film it's safe to say she nails every facet of this wonderful character. Miss Lawrence is a supremely talented young actress and it's great to see someone with mega talent being rewarded by getting the big roles. She just absolutely nails it as Katniss, from the emotional side to the violent tough side, she is the character.<br/><br/>The movie itself is a fine adaptation, all the best parts of the book are present and accounted for, a few bit and pieces have been omitted but it doesn't affect it majorly, the beginning of the story is set in a barren land known as district 12 and it is presented exactly how I imagined it, this chapter is only slight though which is really the only disappointment, i would have liked to see a bit more of that but oh well, the middle part of the story is hilarious with Stanley Tucci stealing every scene, again the eccentric Capitol is presented in great detail, again exactly the way I had imagined it while reading the books. And finally the third act, the one every has waited for is a truly action packed adventure, it's non stop action and you don't fare tear your eyes away even for a second.<br/><br/>The romance element is very very slight and not overdone thankfully, I'm glad they didn't over do that, the rest of the cast are mostly great, Josh Hutcherson is nice to watch and you care about him just as much as you do Katniss, and Elizabeth Banks like Stanley Tucci is a scene stealer and great comic relief.<br/><br/>All in all the film is excellent, a great book has been treated with care and it's paid off, fans of the book and just general movie goers will love it. Excellent excellent excellent."
"oneislandphotography","10","6","15","18 December 2012"," A dystopian science fiction drama set in a future where teenagers must fight to the death to survive.
","In a dystopian future that is neither so distant nor inconceivable, where marshal law is ever present within the confines of the ""Districts"" of Panem. Where the people are born in to casts and subjugated into slavery within the twelve ""Districts"". Subject to the laws laid down by the oppressive regime of The Capitol whom their ancestors of the ""Districts"" rebelled against a mere 74+ years ago. <br/><br/>With heavy influences from Richard Bachman's (Stephen King) The Running Man (1987) meets the surrealism of Mad Max mixed together with a similar eye candy of the Twilight fiasco and indeed of most films that are marketed towards the affluent tweens of today. Rather than a world burned by nuclear fire or natural catastrophe, as tends to be the setting for films of this type. One is treated to a vision that is both refreshing for this genre yet believable. Instead of a dark and oppressive mood the whole feel of the ""Districts"" is one of starkness and poverty of hopeless and helplessness, with an absence of colour or joy. <br/><br/>Scenes we can see now in this day and age if one looks close enough within our major cities. Although the length of time between the present day and when this film is set is never fully explained, I believe this is due to the fact that Panem is but a mere shadows width away. As it has been said that civilization is only two square meals away from barbarism. The most harrowing aspect of this movie is the fact that the general premise is one born not of fiction. Ancient Rome once held gladiatorial events just as deadly and just as applauded as The Hunger Games. <br/><br/>Is it a happy chance or purely deliberate of the author Suzanne Collins to name the Capitol of her universe Panem, deliciously acknowledging the Latin Panem et Circenses, (Bread and Circuses) which comes from the latter days of the Roman Empire, where Caesar would keep the masses subdued by providing violent and deadly entertainments within the great coliseum, which is rather fitting for the subject matter of the film. Jennifer Lawrence (Katniss Everdeen) plays her part in this film with all due care and attention, captivating us with an emotional detachment and a will to survive that is somewhat lacking in the Heroines of today.<br/><br/>Central to the whole point of the film are The Hunger Games themselves that were brought about to remind the ""Districts"" just who is in command, and to satiate the masses of the decadent Capitol with ""Quality reality television"" where there is no second place.<br/><br/>The tributes are chosen via a name out of a hat style lottery, one girl and one boy between the ages of 12 & 18, from each of the districts. When Katniss's younger sister Primrose Everdeen (Willow Shields) is called as the first tribute of district twelve by the Capitol's Marketing Director Effie Trinket (Elizabeth Banks), a bizarrely coloured and costumed character that believes wholeheartedly that what she is doing is right. Katniss then volunteers to take her sister's place as tribute, in a surprising turn beau Gale does not come forward as the male tribute. That honour is thrust upon Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson).<br/><br/>From the stark, barren, colourless wastelands of the districts we are hurtled, upon a high- speed hover-train towards the Capitol City of Panem. Where the general populace is more concerned with appearance than where their resources come from, which is what the districts supply.<br/><br/>The architecture of the Capitol is reminiscent of ancient Rome with vast open spaces and columns. However, for all it's splendour and decadency it does not take too long to see that this is just a sugar coating on a rotten core, a festering cancer that is joyously fed and worshiped by the baying hordes of cosmetically perfect swine. While the combatants are in training we are introduced to the surreal ""Games"" host Caesar Flickerman (Stanley Tucci), who reminds me of David Dickinson (Bargain Hunt) with that deep tan that is achieved for by long hard hours, working out doors and the rich spend millions attempting to emulate, and unnaturally white teeth. Once the games commence however, is really when one starts to question ones own moral fibre, to be thrust into a kill or be killed situation, also to be the spectator, if there is no audience then there is no show.<br/><br/>With the plethora of hidden cameras and other surveillance equipment within the arena that The Hunger Games take place in and is broadcast live 24hrs, and the people of the Capitol place bets on which one of the 24 candidates will survive or die. Essentially this film is a dark satire of the whole reality TV plague that is consuming the airwaves, stifling any and all original thought and creativity with weapons of mass distraction.<br/><br/>When one reads a news story about a man who was suicidal, threatening to jump off of a building, being encouraged to jump by the people watching at street level. It does not take to much imagination to wonder how long it will be until Takeshi's Castle start using real bullets, or when some one is voted off The X Factor they are executed live on air.<br/><br/>Gary Ross has done a wonderful job with this film, with such rich source material. I was concerned that the violent nature of the subject matter would be the driving force of the film and in so doing ruin the complicated structure that Suzanne Collins envisioned when she wrote the story.<br/><br/>With that said the violence is superbly choreographed, blood thirsty, and even heart wrenching at times. However, it is not the be all and end all of this story. This film will appeal to those that like a story with bloodshed instead of a story about bloodshed. Oh and keep an eye out for a spark of romance"

I loved the relationship between Katniss and her sister and also between Katniss and Rue.I like self deprecating/humorous characters. Pacey Witter is my favorite example of that. Twilight's Jacob has it, Damon from Vampire Dairies but for some reason it's not endearing with Peeta.

The alliance kids seemed more like a group of high school bullies than trained killers. I realize they were going for a PG-13 rating for the teenagers, but the violence just didn't feel real or potent. It's not about how much blood or gore you show, either. It's about how you shoot the scenes, and action scenes are clearly not Gary Ross's forte.<br/><br/>Ultimately, it all just seemed too easy for Katniss and Peeta to win. Which sadly ended up ruining the movie for me."
"notintheslightest","7","6","15","25 March 2012"," Just ehh.
","I walked into this movie ready to be WOWED. I absolutely fell in love with the books. I thought they were beautifully written, making the reader feel for all the characters, and become one with the book. Even the trailers, I thought, foreshadowed an amazing movie that stayed true to the book.<br/><br/>The actual movie, however, kind of weak. I feel like the depth to any of the characters wasn't there - everything was sort of flat. If you didn't read the book, I guess you could tie up the loose ends - but for those who did read, there were so many holes: <br/><br/>1. Katniss receiving the mockingjay pin. She received it from the mayor's daughter who plays a key role in the second book, but the directors cut her out completely. <br/><br/>2. Haymitch was portrayed in a drunken stoop throughout the book, barely being able to care for himself. But in the movie, he seemed fine - only having a few drinks.<br/><br/>3. The games themselves didn't seem true. What happened to the stormy nights? Or the days spent in the cave - almost starving to death? Or the bread from D11? Or even Katniss' messed up ear from the blast? And why was Haymitch able to send messages?<br/><br/>Although this movie was enjoyable in different aspects, there were far too many holes and cutouts that made me feel unsatisfied and want more."
"StevePulaski","6","6","15","24 March 2012"," Lacks the intensity and sting
","Suzanne Collins' novel The Hunger Games has been garnering a significant amount of fame with teenagers everywhere, and has a devoted legion of fans who have already seen this film at one of its notorious midnight showings. I have never read the novel, but knew much about it going in. Going out, I might've known less. If that's possible.<br/><br/>The film is simple, moderately effective entertainment, but slow, a tad incompetent, and a bit overblown in some areas. The film centers around the nation of Panem, which has replaced North America. It is a totalitarian nation, with its government inflicting harsh punishments and dictatorship this way and that. Every year, they hold an event called ""The Hunger Games,"" where two people, a male and a female from each of the twelve districts of Panem, battle to the death until one remains. It is done to further assure the Capitol has any and all authority, and that they can do what they want, when they want. No question.<br/><br/>The girl chosen from District 12 is Prim Everdeen (Shields), younger sister of sixteen year old Katniss (Lawrence) who volunteers to take her place. The boy chosen from the district is Peeta Mellark (Hutcherson), who has had a life-long crush on Katniss. Both are taken from the district to train relentlessly for the games, which involve mainly practicing their archery skills. By far the most entertaining character in the whole film is Haymitch, portrayed wonderfully by Woody Harrelson, the only living victor from District 12. He mentors both Katniss and Peeta as they enter the most grueling task of their life.<br/><br/>Let's start with the landscapes and the cinematography. When we see them, they are wonderful. Breathtaking and consuming. But director Gary Ross seems to enjoy seeing them through a shaky, indistinct position. It may not be his own fault, just his lack of credible experience. A good portion of the film and its battle scenes are captured with a shaky camera, possibly to add to the idea that the action is so fast-paced and non-linear the camera can't keep up. Even during some of the regular scenes the camera remains this way. It would've been nice if The Hunger Games could capture its battle scenes in a calm, collective, and controlled manner, but instead, it favors the route of incoherency and disjointedness.<br/><br/>From a stylistic approach, the film is rather nice to look at. We do get well-deserved backstory on how the country operates and functions, but we don't learn enough about our leads. Also, these characters are being grossly toyed with in this nation. Does anyone try to rebel or overthrow the government? Or are they so oblivious to the idea of dictatorship and develop a strong contentment for this world. It seems illogical, when you think about it.<br/><br/>The Hunger Games has its areas of strength. For one, its female leader is no priss. It's so rare to see women take charge in sci-fi adventure films, especially ones that follow this sort of formula. Jennifer Lawrence is strong and beyond capable as the role of a strong woman, victim to unfair circumstances, and manipulated by an unfair society. It's nice to see that the series looks at her as fearless and fit rather than a whiny, uninspired female caricature. Hutcherson, too, is very good and the two work together nicely when they can.<br/><br/>But this is pretty standard in the field of adventures, in areas excluding its plot and acting. It lacks any sort of commentary on totalitarian societies, and doesn't seem to break new ground with the material it has. I sat debating on why the series has reached such a rare level of popularity with the masses. Is this the groundbreaking, extra-special, page-gripping novel that everyone is reading? The book had to be more than predominant scenes of archery and hectic instances of action. There had to be more depth and attraction to a novel so popular. What we are left with is somewhat sufficient, but droning for a two and a half hour film, including tacked on, roughly seventy minutes of buildup to the games themselves. The Hunger Games isn't bad, but it's redundant and winded, with much of the end being rather quiet and seemingly void of progression. Audiences are likely to enjoy it, but I'm sure fan reception will be all over the place. The film just seems too basic and limp, considering the book was a smashing success.<br/><br/>Starring: Jennifer Lawrence, Josh Hutcherson, Liam Hemsworth, Woody Harrelson, Elizabeth Banks, Lenny Kravitz, Stanley Tucci, and Donald Sutherland. Directed by: Gary Ross."
"froochiz","7","6","15","23 March 2012"," Lazy and lacking emotionally
","Adapting a first-person story as a third-person film takes out a majority of the story. Katniss's thoughts are what drive her characterization and it's through her that we grow distaste for the Capitol/Panem. If you take out her thoughts, you may as well not bother making the film. Yes, having voice-overs in a movie becomes draining after a while, but not when those voice-overs actually link you emotionally to what's being depicted. Katniss's dialogue, (important when it comes to talking with Peeta) does not deliver enough during most other parts of the story. The Katniss on screen is just a shallow representation of the book's Katniss. Without her viewpoint, Prim, Rue, Cinna, Haymitch, and even Peeta are pointless. You just see people moving on screen.<br/><br/>I don't feel pity for the districts nor for the tributes. Death in the movie, in the end, is just death. But in the books, each death furthered hatred towards the Capitol and President Snow; you want to destroy them and you want Katniss to win. It was that desire that makes the series so endearing and addictive.<br/><br/>The visuals were okay, though. As was the acting. And the countdown was exciting. The costumes, however, were too bizarre without the explanation for them. And the climax was abysmal.<br/><br/>It was just lazy, and laziness is easy to spot in art."

","We tend to live in an era of special effects and CGI thanks to Industrial Light and Magic and few people will recall the original Logan's Run and The Running Man so this will seem novel when it isn't. The film is filled with great sets and attractive actors and will probably be a hit because of the books and a built in fan base. And there will be rave reviews but thankfully there can only be two sequels. I'm not suggesting this is a bad movie; it just doesn't offer anything really new. Rise of the Planet of the Apes was at least a clever manipulation of a story most in the audience knew well; this is a mid concept twist on The Most Dangerous Game."

I might be according to some people, but I have not experience any film that effects me this much for a long time. This is inspirational and powerful.

The actors are unforgettable, Jennifer Lawrence's performance will haunt me forever, in a good way of course. Through the whole movie, I cried, I laughed, I bite my nails and sit on the edge of my seat. Once again, it's powerful, so powerful it can literally change lives, mine for example and I know a lot more people will be like me.

"Turfseer","3","5","12","16 September 2012"," Survivor meets The Truman Show meets Demolition Man meets Marie Antoinette meets Winter's Bone meets Lord of the Flies
","'The Hunger Games' is an amalgamation of many films and TV shows we've seen before. For starters, the long-running reality show 'Survivor' comes to mind as a good part of the film is set in the forest where the characters must rely on survival skills to survive. The film's premise, in which children and teens between the ages of 12 and 18 must fight to the death as part of a televised spectacle, is reminiscent of 1998's 'The Truman Show', where Jim Carrey's entire life is put under the microscope of a reality show, broadcast to millions.<br/><br/>The setting of Hunger Games is a post-apocalyptic dystopian future similar to the 2010 British film, 'Never Let Me Go'. Both films posit a future where a society of mindless, brainwashed automatons are unable to rebel against a totalitarian system that calls for deathly self-sacrifice of the young. With all the characters adopting such a one note conformity, there's very little wiggle room for any kind of interesting drama in the film, which relies more on the cheap thrill of watching teenagers attempt to do themselves in vis-a-vis mortal combat.<br/><br/>The rulers of the post-apocalyptic country we're introduced to, 'Panem', are more like unpleasant fops from an 18th Century Louis VI French court than the ineffectual pacifists of the 1993 sci-fi satire, 'Demolition Man', starring Sandra Bullock. And our 'common folk' protagonists 'Katniss' and 'Peeta', from 'District 12', remind us of an Appalachian setting, similar to scenes from 'Winter's Bone', the same film in which the Hunger Games' star, Jennifer Lawrence, was nominated for a Best Actress Academy award.<br/><br/>The Hunger Games takes an interminably long time before we get to the meat of the story. The reason for this is that the film's scenarist, Suzanne Collins, seeks to extract as many tears as possible from her teenage audience, by dwelling on the victimization on the protagonist's younger sister, Primrose, and Katniss' sacrifice, when she volunteers to take her place as part of the Hunger Games. Can the cold-hearted leaders at the 'Capitol' be stand-ins for parents in general, as the 'kids' appear to be completely at the mercy of adults who hypocritically claim to be acting beneficently on their behalf.<br/><br/>The Hunger Games won't begin until we're treated to the next long-winded sequence where the principals are introduced to the public via the big media broadcast. The criticism of the media here seems to be all too obvious but Stanley Tucci is effective as the foppish master of ceremonies. Like many of the 'twists' throughout Hunger Games, Kantniss' dress catching on fire during her TV interview, hardly seems fantastic at all. If you want better 'magic', check out any Harry Potter flick instead! <br/><br/>Finally, we get to the meat and potatoes of the film--the fight to the death between the kids. One immediately thinks of a futuristic 'Lord of the Flies' here. Interestingly enough, director Gary Ross's herky-jerky style prevents us from really experiencing the full import of the violence. On one hand, that's commendable since the film's basic premise is wholly unappetizing. On the other hand, it prevents the film from being suspenseful, as the violence doesn't seem real, suggesting that these characters are also not real people.<br/><br/>Hunger Games finally morphs into a completely dopey and comical spectacle as the teenagers (aided by the surly establishment) attempt to do one another in. As the games begin, the kids begin hacking each other with machetes. The rest of it is completely derivative including a dull computer-generated fire, a wasp nest falling from a tree, booby-trap explosions, more computer-generated nonsense (a pack of gnarling hounds), poisonous berries and a fight to the death on top of a weird sculpture called 'Cornucopia'.<br/><br/>If this isn't ridiculous enough, at a certain point, the powers that be declare that there can now be two survivors, provided they're from the same district. This turns out to be a ruse and the new rule is rescinded which lead the protagonists to threaten mutual suicide. Although the bulk of the people are depicted as enjoying the spectacle of the mass killings at the beginning, the authorities now fear that a mutual suicide may cause unrest in the districts. Hence, the basic rules are changed, and now two are allowed to survive, instead of one.<br/><br/>As Jennifer Lawrence appears to have signed on for three more Hunger Games sequels, she'll probably be set financially for life. Whether her overall reputation will survive after acting in such drivel, remains to be seen.<br/><br/>The Hunger Games is really designed for young teenagers and older, less sophisticated teens who have little interest in reading anything resembling what any reasonably educated adult may refer to as 'literature'. It's a film that's mostly devoid of 'ideas' and appeals to devotees of soap operas, who always seem to end up entranced with one-dimensional villains and heroes or heroines, that inevitably end up on elevated pedestals!"

Due to the rapid camera motion and rapid shot changes It was difficult to focus my eyes. My date and I both were nauseous. I simply do not see the point of this type of camera work.

","Great casting and costumes!! By why, oh why, did the director jump the camera around so much!! It was almost a joke how much he did it. It ruined the movie experience for me. It brought it down from a 8/10 to a 6/10. And I like hand held camera movies when done right. I loved Cloverfield and Chronicle. This wasn't just a hand held shaking camera, it was out of focus at times, zooming in from all crazy angles, jumping around every second. The worst part is the director did it on purpose!!! Look at this quote from the director describing to Sodenberg, who was filming a sequence for him, on how to copy his style. <br/><br/>Transcription of secret tape of Ross explaining Hunger Games cinematography asethetic to Soderbergh: ""Just pretend that the camera is a bouncing rubber ball on LSD, and that you have this weird compulsion for closeups. You know what I mean? You're trying to follow the action and you do follow it but almost in an accidental, stumbling-around way. All you gotta remember is close-ups, close-ups and more close-ups. And constantly bouncy, bouncy, bouncy. Just keep bouncing, man...in fact, forget the rubber ball thing. Pretend that the camera is a f%ing basketball...okay? A f#%ing basketball with a obsession for closeups. Do that and you can't go wrong.""<br/><br/>You got to be kidding me.

","I've not read the books, so I don't know what all the fuss is about. The Hunger Games is okay, but without the violence, it's a ""young adults"" story. The point of that is I don't know why everyone thinks it's so great. It's certainly not worth 8.2/10.<br/><br/>EDIT: There's nothing wrong with young adult fiction, I'll add. It's just that it's a bit afternoon TV-ish for such a violent premise, and lacking real narrative bite.<br/><br/>Summary: Dystopian society where kids get selected to participate in a televised wilderness-arena fight to the death.<br/><br/>The story is okay, if a bit clichéd these days. The script is alright, but it's a bit light. During the actual tournament, it's not particularly tense. There's very little feeling of desperation, which one would think would be a prerequisite for a fight-to-the-death kill-fest. That's a failing of both the script and the director.<br/><br/>What really, REALLY annoyed me was the horrible camera work at the start. It's hideously shaky and painful to watch. Either I got used to it, or they realised what a dumb idea it was and stopped, but for the first 10-15 minutes it sucked. Cinematographers who think that shaky, hand-held camera work looks good should be slapped upside the head. It detracts from the story (which is the whole point of the film).<br/><br/>EDIT: The point isn't that shaky camera work necessarily looks bad. The problem is that the camera work is shaky whilst zipping around, which makes it hard to watch. Other films use this effect as well, but they tend to be shaky whilst focusing on only one image, which allows the eye to compensate.<br/><br/>It actually felt a lot like ""Tomorrow when the war began"" for some reason. It's violent (although you don't see much gore), and devoid of any real thematic point. The author claims to have come up with the idea while ""channel-surfing the TV where she saw people competing for some prize and then saw footage of the Iraq war. She describes how the two combined in an unsettling way"". Unfortunately, all that the author has done is create a story where we watch brutality for enjoyment. Maybe the rest of the series will discover some form of theme that contradicts this idea, but at the moment its a continuation of what it thinks it's parodying.<br/><br/>Despite all that, it's a breezy flick. Okay, not great. Not well written, but passable. Not holding my breath for the next two installments. 6 out of 10."

"metabol","5","4","9","29 March 2012"," Review from the movie perspective alone
","First let me say that I did not read the novel(s) so I am basing this on seeing the movie without any predisposed ideas.<br/><br/>My first impression was that the camera work was horrendous. I realize that at times a hand-held shot that shakes is used for giving that 'real' look but it was used way too much in this movie. Additionally there were fast scene cuts that, combined with the shakiness of the camera, started to give me a headache. This is a trick that is sometimes used when bad footage is taken. If you shake and move the video and cut away real fast you can get away with showing almost anything. Anyway, I'd give the camera work a 3 tops.<br/><br/>Regardless of what is in the novel, I did not like the look of the colored hair, tribal cut facial hair and outlandish dress of wealthy people. Coming from a point of not having read the novels and looking for that, it looks ridiculous.<br/><br/>The acting overall was very good, however, is it me or should Donald Sutherland just stop. He has had such a great career but his acting lately is wooden, unnatural and degrading to those in his scenes. Luckily, the idea of the movie and some of the acting saved this from being a total disappointment.<br/><br/>The movie should have done more with the history and setting up the audience than a couple of screens to read to begin the movie. If it weren't for everyone else in my house having read the book and explaining it to me ahead of time, I don't think I would have understood it enough from the movie alone.<br/><br/>Between the sets, make-up, costumes, camera work and seemingly cheap budget this movie seems like it was made by the SyFy channel."
"anarresa","6","4","9","27 March 2012"," Hoping for action? Bit of a disappointment.
","I read the Hunger Games for a book group and thought it was a good teen novel, light entertainment for adults and mediocre dystopian literature. I was intrigued by the arena and the future technology employed in the fight to the death, though (I was a fan of The Running Man back in the 80s as well.) So I made the comment the story would work well as an action movie. I was told it was going to be a movie, and now it is.<br/><br/>Alas, as a teen novel it had to be made PG-13 and to keep that rating the children-killing-children aspect had to be toned down. It was handled by jerky, out-of-focus shots of the actual murders, with clear visuals of either the dead bodies or of the splash of blood or sometimes just an eerie scream. Intense for younger children, appropriate for the target audience, somewhat dull for my bloody taste. I went on a bargain evening though, so for $7 I'm actually satisfied.<br/><br/>It's not a cheesy Twilight-like teen romance. The main subject (beyond the story of the central character, Katniss) seems to be the carefully planned violence and tribute ""storylines"" of the ""reality"" broadcasts. It not-so-subtly parallels our own viewing habits and personally I enjoyed the irony. A love story does play a small role, about equal to that of the emotional toll on the children being forced to kill-or-be-killed. Worth a viewing if you have any interest."

"classicalsteve","10","3","6","26 March 2017"," A Cross Between ""Roller Ball"", ""1984"" and ""The Lottery"" Make for Fascinating Sci-Fi Drama
","In Shirley Jackson's ""The Lottery"" (1948), regarded as one of the most famous short stories in American literature, someone in a small rural town is selected by lottery to engage in the center of a yearly ritual which will cleanse the town of its sins. ""The Hunger Games"" presents a similar compelling premise. In the world of Panem, there is one Capitol and 12 districts. Before the events of the story, there were 13 districts which eventually rose up in rebellion, led by District 13. The Capitol was able to put down the rebellion, and District 13 was razed to the ground. However, the rebellion was not the end of the story, and the current dictator of Panem upholds a yearly tradition to remind the remaining districts of their violent past, called ""the Dark Days"".<br/><br/>As punishment for the rebellion and as a reminder of who's ""in charge"", the Capitol hosts a violent pageant every year. Twenty-four young people of pre-college age are chosen by lottery to participate in the pageant; one boy and one girl from each district. The plot is a dark take on reality television contests: the pageant, called ""The Hunger Games"", requires the 24 tributes (they're not called contestants) engage in a fight-to-the-death contest in a wilderness-like arena controlled by unseen technicians in a war room of sorts. Only one tribute can be declared the winner at the end of the games, essentially requiring the other 23 tributes to perish. The games are broadcast on large screens so members of each district can watch the fates of their representatives. The event is hosted by a television game-show host/MC, Claudius Templesmith (Stanley Tucci), who makes Richard Dawson (of Family Feud fame) seem like a high-cultured gentleman. ""And may the odds be ever in your favor!"" is the motto of the Games.<br/><br/>Of the 12 remaining districts, District 12 is the poorest, made up of primarily miners and other blood-and-sweat workers. Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) is a teen girl who has self-taught herself to use the bow to hunt for game and sell in the town. On Tribute Day, all the youth from age 12 to 18 are brought to the town square where Effie Trinket (Elizabeth Banks), a resident of the Capitol who, like many of her colleagues, enjoys wearing garish and flamboyant outfits, hosts the lottery ceremony. She picks Primrose Everdeen (Willow Shields), Katniss' sister to participate. Katniss, stunned, offers to volunteer for the Games in her sister's stead. Since this is the first time someone has ever volunteered, the proposition is accepted by the State. The other tribute from District 9 is Peeta Mallark (Josh Hutcherson).<br/><br/>Katniss and Peeta are chaperoned by Effie Trinket to the Capitol on a bullet train. There they meet their mentor, Haymitch Abernathy (Woody Harrelson), a winner of the Hunger Games many years previously. He is there to help train and instruct Katniss and Peeta, but his highest priority seems to be drinking and snoozing. Eventually, Katniss and Peeta with interesting finesse convince Abernathy that they are worth helping.<br/><br/>Once at the Capitol, they are paraded in front of the elite residents who cheer and decide which tributes they wish to root for. The tributes are then brought to a training facility, being told not to ""hurt"" any of the other tributes. They say there will be plenty of time for violent engagement relatively soon! They are treated like celebrities about to embark on a fashion pageant, being given beautiful outfits to wear during interviews. Of course, everyone knows the outcome of the pageant means 23 of the 24 tributes will not survive. Eventually, on the fateful day, the 24 tributes are transported to the arena-wilderness area where food and weapons are strewn about which can be used to better someone's chances. We also learn that the game is also ""rigged"". The control room doesn't just monitor the tributes but has power to influence situations. There are also ""sponsors"", Capitol residents, who can aid tributes they like. This story has become more relevant with the rise of ""fake news"" and distrust of television journalism with distorted media.<br/><br/>Overall, a well-done and impassioned view of a bleak future which rings of Orwell's ""1984"" and the 1970's cult classic ""Roller Ball"". In ""Roller Ball"" two teams donning skates battle each other on a rink. In the final game, players can only leave the game if they're killed, which is essentially the same idea as ""The Hunger Games"". The film finds a good balance between the heartlessness of the competition (if competition it can be called) and the emotions of the characters. At one point, Katniss befriends a young African-American girl, Rue (Amandla Stenberg), who is obviously too young to be part of the games. They become allies to help each other defend against another ""gang"" who desires to kill them. One of the most touching and poignant moments of the film is their friendship and Rue's fate."

"Jerominator","4","3","6","17 June 2013"," Dystopic Disney Gladiators
","I've not read the book so I can only say what I thought of the film.<br/><br/>The story takes place in a future, post-apocalyptic version of the USA, where the ruling classes live in a plush central district which brutally dominates 11 satellite districts. Every year a gladiatorial games is held where 2 children from each district fight to the death until just one victor emerges. This seems to be a punitive measure for some past episode of civil disobedience.<br/><br/>Selected from a lottery, the children are taken into the central district, groomed and sent out into a giant outdoor woodland arena to do combat while the public vicariously follows their progress via a sick reality TV spectacle akin to ""Big Brother"". A central stash of weapons and supplies is provided to fuel the bloodbath. If the contestants are lucky enough to have courted the favour of sponsors during their grooming period, they may receive additional ad hoc supplies from them throughout the contest.<br/><br/>There's *boatloads* of potential for an interesting story given the initial setup. What I had a problem with here was the cowardly way in which this was handled - wanting to appall us with a deeply shocking idea but lacking the courage to follow through with the required delivery.<br/><br/>Instead we're served up all the usual clichés. e.g. the central righteous character doesn't have to partake in any of the vicious butchery, trickery or deception that would normally be required for her to win such a contest. Instead serendipity seems to blissfully watch over her throughout. She's even allowed to play big sister to a little kid that under normal circumstances she'd eventually have to murder or be murdered by, but of course that problem, along with just about every other unsavoury permutation, is conveniently magicked away by the Hollywood fairies so that she remains a whiter-than-white beacon of virtue, and nothing too unpleasant happens to spoil our entertainment or derail the good versus bad morality tale.<br/><br/>I do give them points for making her vulnerable and not some karate-kicking amazonian warrior, but her luck was just too good to be true, and events just too unbelievably convenient. This killed off any empathy or belief in the possibility of realism and transformed the whole thing into a cartoon action movie.<br/><br/>Many of the usual sex/race stereotypes are played out. I won't expound on that as I have a 1000 word limit here but I think it's pretty obvious.<br/><br/>One of the more unbelievable aspects was the kids from the central district who we are to believe have spent all their lives preparing for this contest. However their attitudes and demeanour didn't reflect that at all. For starters I would've thought tracking would be high on the curriculum for anyone preparing for this contest given the terrain over which it takes place. Yet they seemed to be blindly fumbling around for most of the contest, quite unable to locate our heroine who was able to hide, recuperate, wander around freely for the most part. The one time they did bump into her, instead of going for the quick, low energy, low risk kill, they hesitate for some reason and proceed to take all kinds of unnecessary risks, eventually leading to the injury and death of some in their group. Again, no signs of any kind of training. Just clumsy, clueless raging idiots.<br/><br/>It's hard to believe that after so many annual games, this is the first time someone volunteered to replace somebody else - so no older brothers or sisters for *all* those young kiddies who were chosen then? Tough to imagine.<br/><br/>The use of repeated scenes was poor in my opinion. I'm not averse to that mechanism in movies but here it seemed to serve absolutely no purpose whatsoever, but instead broke up the flow and left you trying to figure out what the hell that was all about while you missed what came next.<br/><br/>I quite liked the reality-TV-meets-roman-games kind of take on the whole thing. That part was sickeningly believable and disturbing.<br/><br/>I also liked some of the styling of the movie - the vulgar hi-tec opulence of the hegemonical central district versus the antiquated penury of its satellite districts. Nice touches on the fashion as well.<br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence was pretty good in the main role - she was well cast. Josh Hutcherson was OK but his character wasn't interesting - he just filled a space. Woody Harrelson's character was an oddity - a mocking amoral drunken slob laughing in the faces of the 2 kids he was supposed to be mentoring at the beginning. Then for no apparent reason he morphs into a socially conscious protective sage. Bad writing.<br/><br/>I thought Donald Sutherland and Wes Bentley were wasted as clichéd villains but I guess someone had to play those parts.<br/><br/>All things considered, this was well-made and well-acted with some very memorable scenes, so it could well be that my problem here is either with the source material or the screen re-write. As I've not read the book I'm simply not in a position to say, so for that reason I've given it a higher mark. If there was no book though I'd happily give it a 2 instead.<br/><br/>Overall, this was a weak film that completely failed to capitalise on a powerful central premise, badly attempting to complement shocking spectacle with unrealistic stereotypes and offensive fantasy morality that belongs in a fairy tale story, not a story that's supposed to be about making children fight to the death for survival."

"thomastownend","6","3","6","18 July 2012"," Mediocre in every sense of the word
","Before I went too see this film I had these rave reviews calling it the ""film for our generation"" and ""best of the decade"" and the huge amount of buzz circulating the film led me to think I was going to see something special.How wrong I was this film is your average blockbuster that seems to be borrowing elements from lots of different films so I really don't see the striking bold originality everyone's being raving about. First off the acting is monotone, there's no character development, Jennifer Lawrence is the epitome of un-engaging and the film has nothing special about it everything is average, the directing- average,the dialogue-average, the sets-average and the soundtrack-.... you guessed it AVERAGE. Imagine this a dumbed down blockbuster version of BATTLE ROYALE with a Truman show undertone, then sprinkle a bit of harry potter and the goblet of fire on top then steal the fith element wardrobe and bang you have the hunger games. Now don't get me wrong I'm not just jumping on the anti hunger games band wagon I wanted to like this film its directed by Gary Ross who brought us ""sea biscuit"" and ""pleasentville"" two great movies (a younger Toby.M would have made a good peter right?)but this film is recycling a point we've seen done better in battle royale. The editing is okay at first it worked in the action since the shaky cam made it seem fast and frantic and it coincided with the brutality but too keep it a lower age rating they had to take this too an extreme to a point the action is impossible to follow and hence forth boring.Did I mention all the meaningless and unanswered back story's and sub plots that never get answered. The film has neither style nor substance.And I haven't even mentioned the lame ending,the half baked romance and the laughable special effects and fx (THE Fire).However I did like the character of Peter he was interesting and Josh.h played him well I wanted to see more of him, I also felt the film was paced well.<br/><br/>So in conclusion The Hunger Games is decent and you will be entertained but after the initial thrill you will realise it was just a mediocre film.<br/><br/>p.s. I have read the book and it is better than the film, it also solves some of my gripes but its still not amazing its a good book but it is pretty over hyped."
"TheSquiss","6","3","6","17 June 2012"," Entertaining but shallow & you'll need to have read the book to fill in the gaps.
","Late last year I was handed a free book at the cinema as part of a promotion. I read the back, dismissed it as a teen book and plonked it on the bookcase for a day of lazy reading sometime in the future. A couple of weeks ago I saw the trailer for The Hunger Games and dismissed it as a watered down, sanitized version of Battle Royale. Then I noticed the logo and recognized it from the afore mentioned book. Intrigued, I set aside an hour that Sunday to read the first couple of chapters to see if it would be worth watching the film and promptly devoured the book in a single sitting.<br/><br/>Whilst it will never go down in history as a literary classic and will be forgotten in twenty years, unlike the Lord of the Rings or even Harry Potter volumes, The Hunger Games trilogy is a stomping good read and perfectly fits the overused cliché of 'page-turner.' Though a couple of hundred pages away from the end, I'm loving it. It's easy, gripping, highly entertaining, disposable fun. That said, I've read Catch 22 more times than I have fingers on one-and-a-half hands and look what they did to that on film. And Captain Corelli's Mandolin. And For those without a clue, Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) and Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) are selected for the Hunger Games, a barbaric, televised show in which 'Tributes' are taken from each of twelve districts of a futuristic, dystopian America (now known as Panem) to enter a vast, synthetic arena and kill each other until only one remains. There's more to it than that but if you're familiar with the likes of Battle Royale, Rollerball and The Running Man you'll know where it's heading.<br/><br/>So, what did they do to The Hunger Games? Well, they cut it. They had to, because it would have been at least a four hour film. Being written largely in the first person, there were no subplots with peripheral characters to excise and so the editing had to come through losing detail with the result that the film lacks depth. I took a friend who hadn't read the books and afterwards I needed to explain some of the exchanged glances between protagonists Katniss and Peeta and fill in the gaps for him. Gary Ross has directed it with the aim of satisfying the vast army of readers whilst hoping not to ostracize those who enter the cinema without background knowledge of the film. Unfortunately he doesn't quite satisfy either camp.<br/><br/>Katniss' thoughts, the reason we understand and identify with her so completely, have been lost. Her relationships with both Peeta and her lifelong friend, Gale, are shallow and we are not given enough time with their team in the Capitol to really appreciate the mind games, the relationships and the characters. This is a rare example when a film just shy of two-and-a-half hours needs to be at least thirty minutes longer! Too much is compressed and it feels choked of the life that flowed rapidly through the book. From the film I don't know much about Katniss and couldn't warm to her while, in the book, she is flawed, driven, angry, hopeful and a multi-faceted character I both liked and could respect.<br/><br/>The 'game' is all too brief. We actually see very little of the killing and know comparatively little of the battles between the twenty-four adolescents that must dwindle to one. The violence has been virtually eradicated to the point where only a Daily Mail reader could be shocked and the beasts in the final act are completely wasted and the reason for them all but lost in clumsy CGI not at all befitting the $78m budget. More frustrating is the complete redesign of the cornucopia in the arena that is very pointedly described as gold throughout the books and conjures an image of a vast, ornate horn. Instead it more closely resembles an unpainted, bastardized Batmobile stolen from Christian Bale.<br/><br/>Is it as good as Battle Royale? Hmmm, probably not in the case of the film. But, particularly with the book, it's different and equally as valid. See the film. It is very entertaining, but read the trilogy first so that you can fill in the gaps as they pass across the screen.<br/><br/>Another film review from The Squiss.

","Warning Spoilers I finished the book 30 mins. before seeing the movie so it was really fresh in my mind.<br/><br/>I thought the actors did a good job portraying the characters.<br/><br/>Camera: Will someone please fire that camera guy. I just got done eating before the movie and it almost made me sick. I understand they wanted you to feel like you were running with them but not done very well. If you want a good example watch Last of the Mohicans great camera work.<br/><br/>Plot: They did have lot of the books but they seemed to keep out key points. When Karniss and Peeta meet for the first time they are 11 not 15 or 16 makes for a much more dramatic scene knowing he risked so much to help her. They added too many shot from the command center which are not in the book. Could have let those out and put in more scenes from the book. What happened to the bread from district 11 to thank her for what she did when Rue died? What happened to the sleeping meds for Peeta since he would not let Karniss go to the feast? Where was the break up/fight scene at the end of the book. I guess they wanted to end on a happy note.<br/><br/>I was disappointed. I know book adaptations cannot be just like the book but still the things they left out and added were really obvious unlike other adaptations where you really don't see them unless you are really looking for them."
"caseymoviemania","4","3","6","10 April 2012"," CASEY'S MOVE MANIA: The Hunger Games (2012) review
","RATING: 2/5 With the highly-lucrative HARRY POTTER franchise already ended last summer, and THE TWILIGHT SAGA quadrilogy is nearing its end this coming November, Hollywood is looking for the next big thing in turning another popular young-adult novel into successful movie franchise. That adaptation turns out to be the first novel in Suzanne Collins' best-selling trilogy called THE HUNGER GAMES (the other two are CATCHING FIRE and MOCKINGJAY). Described as a teenage version of THE RUNNING MAN (1987) meets BATTLE ROYALE (2000), THE HUNGER GAMES has been generating a lot of strong buzz even before its initial release. However, I hate to say that this so-called ""one of the most anticipated movie events of the year"" is hugely overrated.<br/><br/>Set in the post-apocalyptic nation of Panem divided into 12 districts, the movie begins at the poorer society of District 12 where we are first introduced to 16-year-old Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) who spends her days hunting with 18-year-old best friend Gale (Liam Hemsworth). She lives with her widowed mother (Paula Malcomson) and her 12-year-old sister Prim (Willow Shields). One day the government arrives at District 12 to announce the citizens for the annual televised death match called ""The Hunger Games"". Two ""tributes"" from each district -- a boy and a girl -- must participate in this fight-to-the-death match where only one survivor will emerged as a winner. During the lucky draw selection by the escort named Effie Trinket (Elizabeth Banks), Prim is being chosen to fight for her life in the match. But upon hearing the name, Katniss immediately steps out to volunteer in her place. However, she is shocked to hear when the male ""tribute"" happens to be a baker's son named Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson), who has once saved her life years before.<br/><br/>After the selection, they board on a train to the luxurious city of Capitol where they and the other 22 other opponents will undergoes a series of makeovers. Before ""The Hunger Games"" begin, they will be mentored by Haymitch Abernathy (Woody Harrelson), an alcoholic and the only living winner from District 12. Then a stylist named Cinna (singer Lenny Kravitz) and Effie Trinket are there to help them make good impression with potential sponsors. Once they have endured a series of training sessions, they will be ready for the main event as they are sent into a thick-forested arena, rigged with enough hidden cameras for nationwide coverage. Can Katniss survives the game? The good news is, the filmmakers behind THE HUNGER GAMES has made a smart choice casting Jennifer Lawrence as the main protagonist, Katniss Everdeen. She is simply perfect for the role -- both emotionally and physically convincing, while her expressive acting is particularly top-notch. However, the same cannot be said for the rest of the supporting cast. Josh Hutcherson, who supposedly plays a pivotal role as Katniss's love interest, fails to make his character worthwhile and his acting is disappointingly wooden throughout the movie. Liam Hemsworth fares even worst as Katniss's best friend, who delivers a thankless role as Gale. Others including Elizabeth Banks, Lenny Kravitz, Woody Harrelson, Wes Bentley and Donald Sutherland are just so-so, while I must say only Stanley Tucci makes the best of his limited screen time as the flamboyant television host Caesar Flickerman.<br/><br/>Director Gary Ross, who hasn't been directed a movie since 2003's SEABISCUIT, is an odd choice directing this kind of movie. But one can't deny it's also interesting to see him what unique flair he can bring to translate the source material into the big screen. While he does quite a decent job fleshing out some of the ingredients from the book (particularly during the first hour), Ross and his team of screenwriters including Suzanne Collins herself and Billy Ray, fails to capture the very essence of the game itself. Blame it on the PG-13 rating, where everything here -- especially the violence -- are disappointingly toned down it's hard to feel the grittiness of the setting. Ross is also considerably weak as a visual stylist, who made a fatal mistake opting hand-held camera-work to capture all the action during the game scene. It is understandable that he chooses cinema verite style to evoke the certain sense of you-are-there realism but try hard as he might, he is no Paul Greengrass. As a result, the much-awaited ""game"" scene during the second half after a full one-hour of buildup storyline is disappointingly non-event and also very frustrating to watch for.<br/><br/>Clocking at a 142 minutes, THE HUNGER GAMES is also terribly overlong since most of the executions here are cinematically lackluster. There's nary a single memorable moment worth mentioning here, and even the big-budget production values (at a cost of $100 million) are just average-looking at best. The only worthwhile technical credit here is T-Bone Bunnett and James Newton Howard's rousing score.<br/><br/>With two more books to go (provided if this movie made a lot of money), I seriously hope the filmmakers can improve upon their mistake in the subsequent series. As for now, THE HUNGER GAMES is a huge waste of opportunity to turn this into a memorable cinematic experience."
"Intenselan","6","3","6","2 April 2012"," The Nausea Games
","This movie would have been really great had it not been for the WAY over-excessive use of the shaky cam for every single shot in the movie. There's nothing that ruins the experience more than some kid whose father rushes him to the emergency exit during an action scene to go throw up his popcorn just outside the door for all of us to see.<br/><br/>For example...***SPOILER ALERT***...<br/><br/>Every time the mockingjays mimicked the whistle signal, the idiot behind the camera would point up and shake the crap out of the shot. It felt like a 4-year old son of the director was handed a camera and told to ""shoot the sky"". <br/><br/>***END SPOILER ALERT***<br/><br/>Seriously. The use of the shaky cam just about ruined it for me. It's like when a singer uses so many vocal runs in a song that the melody is all but unintelligible. Likewise, this movie had emotion, a good plot, an engaging story, and good actors. Too bad we were all focused on the kid puking and trying to keep our eyes unfocused enough during the 2 hour shaky-cam fest to not join him ourselves.<br/><br/>DO NOT DO THAT IN THE SEQUEL! I came to see a movie, not ride the Tilt- a-Whirl."

","The Hunger Games is a masterpiece and I loved it so much that I call it my 3rd favorite movie. Everything was perfectly well achieved and I think Suzanne Colins created a perfect world with excellent characters and she showed that it's possible to write a bestseller that doesn't involve melancholic teenagers, pallid girls and shirtless wear wolves. I just loved it and I highly recommend it, I would like to start off saying that Gary Ross' work was spectacular, he shakes the camera all the time, making us feel thrilled, he zooms in lots of times and I think he had an unforgettable ""relationship"" with the camera. Jennifer Lawrence tacked the lead, she was fantastic as always, I just loved her performance and I think she was the best choice they could have make for the leading role. The soundtrack was excellent, they composed so many excellent themes and I just enjoyed to hear them all.<br/><br/>Overall, I think you should go watch The Hunger Games if you haven't, I mean, it's at the top of the Box Office for almost a month and it's the movie that made the most money. Thousands and thousands of people and I'm proud of being one of those people and I think you should be one of those people, every one should be, cause watching The Hunger Games at a theater or anywhere, it's a fantastic experiment, hearing the sounds and being thrilled during a two hour fantastic ride. I was completely entertained and I loved everything and by the way, The Hunger Games is a movie that I'll just never forget, so as the movie's countdown to the beginning of The Hunger Games. I think this movie gets a lot of Oscars next year, if I was charge of the Oscars, I would make sure The Hunger Games would win an Oscar for Best Directing (Gary Ross), Best Performance in a Leading Role (Jennifer Lawrence), Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Soundtrack and obviously, the Oscar for Best Picture. The Hunger Games is one of the best movies I've ever seen, well, let me cut the chase, it's the 3rd best movie I have ever seen and watching it have might been my year's best decision. I'll never forget this amazing survival dramatic thriller. Every minute of it was a perfect experiment. The Hunger Games is a perfect movie, it's a masterpiece and it's my 3rd favorite movie. There's no way of someone consider it a bad movie."

"iheart_ny","10","6","16","4 April 2012"," A successful adaptation in every way possible...
","The very point of young adult literature is to give the few young individuals with an interest in reading, a world to immerse themselves in, and a character or two to root for, who will hopefully teach them a thing or two about the world they live in, and hopefully, about themselves. Such a character should be a role model for these young people. In 2012, we are left with no more ""Harry Potter"" films to be made. The ""Twilight"" series, which has albeit made a great deal of money, doesn't quite cut it for those of us who expect something more from our movie-going experience.<br/><br/>""The Hunger Games"" has it all: a wonderful slew of characters, an unfamiliar and interesting world, real problems to overcome, not to mention a star-making performance by Jennifer Lawrence. One major problem that I find in the ""Twilight"" series lies in the lack of role models for young women reading them. Bella Swan is an idiot. She relies on men for every single thing she does, and doesn't change and become her own person over the course of the four books, ultimately becoming the epitome of anti-feminism, in this viewer's eyes. <br/><br/>Having said that, ""The Hunger Games"" is something of a godsend. Katniss Everdeen is headstrong, brutal, resourceful, witty, uncannily smart and a truly original personality. She knows when to back down, yet she knows when to take charge. She is an ideal role model for young people who will undoubtedly approach the film. <br/><br/>""The Hunger Games"" takes place in the post-apocalyptic region of Panem, divided into twelve ""districts"". Once a year, an Olympics-style event takes place where one young man and woman from each of the twelve districts is forced to take part in a fight to the death on national television, where only one contestant can survive. A member of working- class District 12, Katniss Everdeen (Lawrence) takes her young sister's place after she has somehow been chosen in her first year of eligibility. Katniss has essentially raised her sister, with a mother who has been useless ever since the father's death. She learns to put her knowledge to good use, becomes something of a badass in her quest to above all else, stay alive.<br/><br/>Like I mentioned, Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss, is a revelation. She clearly knew the character she was playing. While her performance is strong and ever-commanding, the character of Katniss was never permitted to let her true emotions show, and Lawrence obviously understood that. She couldn't have been better. Josh Hutcherson does a good enough job as Peeta, the other contestant from District 12, who becomes a good friend to Katniss; and possibly a love interest? We'll let the next film in the trilogy tackle that.<br/><br/>The film has a tremendous supporting cast, including Woody Harrelson as Haymitch, the often-inebriated mentor to Katniss and Peeta, ""30 Rock""'s Elizabeth Banks as the loud and flamboyant Effie, Donald Sutherland as the country's president, and the always-great Stanley Tucci, as Caesar.<br/><br/>My only gripe lies with director Gary Ross, who has previously directed ""Seabiscuit"" and ""Pleasantville"". His shaky camera-work works in scenes where we're seeing events from a character's perspective, especially when the ""games"", themselves, begin. However, shaky hand-held camera- work is present, even in scenes where only two characters are having a conversation. Why? It's distracting, and should have been done differently.<br/><br/>However, Ross did a well enough job interpreting this novel, which I believe many other directors could have screwed up. He made a sensitive, yet not-for-the-faint-of-heart film out of a novel that felt exactly the same way. Like the ""Twilight"" series, there is a love story in ""The Hunger Games"", but it's not the most important thing going on. The film could stand as simply an adaptation of a novel, or could be interpreted as social commentary, with obvious hints being made about the Occupy Wall Street movement, as well as the grim picture it paints of what our society could one day become. Yet it's quality entertainment that even the least discerning film-goer can appreciate. Bring on ""Catching Fire"".<br/><br/>Grade: A"

","Hello ! :3 The Hunger Games (the book) is an amazing thing and there is not one person I know who hasn't loved them. You just cant put the book down, and when finished, you just feel the need to read them again. Like all the other fans of the book; I was super excited to see the movie, and I loved it! But! If you want to see the movie, you should defiantly read the books first, you will understand the costumes, sets (background),characters and dialogue more if you do, otherwise it may not make a lot of sense. The 'Shaky camera' was just to create the illusion that you are running, in the arena, with Katniss. When we are running, does our vision stay perfect? This movie (and the book) is raw; it faces the facts about reality TV, and poor human treatment. The cast is perfect. Jennifer Lawrence does a fantastic job at bringing Katniss to the big screen; opposite other skilled actors and actresses. Even the youngest of the cast; Amandla Stenberg, and Willow Sheilds do a great job in this movie. I thoroughly enjoyed watching the Hunger Games, and am thankful that it is very true to the book! Read the books THEN see the movie; trust me!You will love and enjoy the movie more if you have the knowledge from the books. And now! I must be off! May the odds be EVER in you favour. and remember!

But seriously, even though I haven't read the book, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to know how it's going to end since sequels had been made/planned. I really did like Jennifer Lawrence it in and am amazed how she and the rest of the cast look nothing like their characters. I hope fans won't be disappointed.

"3xHCCH","8","9","28","21 March 2012"," Practically How I Envisioned the Book (Except Probably Cinna and the Cornucopia)
","Just came home from watching ""The Hunger Games."" I have read all three books by Suzanne Collins several months before, so I know what will happen already. Despite this knowledge, I remained excited and riveted by how the details of the story had been translated on screen by writer- director Gary Ross.<br/><br/>The first hour was dedicated to the events preceding the games, as the last hour and a half depicted the games themselves. This movie was the story of a future world, in a country with 12 districts controlled a central Capitol. Every year, they would commemorate the revolution by staging a ""Hunger Games"", where two tributes from each district would fight to the death until only one remains the victor. On this the 74th Games, the tributes of outlying District 12 would be Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutchinson) and the central heroine of the series, Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence).<br/><br/>I could say really that this movie was practically how I imagined the book while I was reading it. I guess you can also say that Suzanne Collins' description of this non-existent world was so vividly cinematic to begin with. First rate special effects were used to bring essential highlights of the book, such as the ""girl on fire"" costume and the control room of game-master, Seneca Crane (Wes Bentley). However, credit should also be given the intimate scenes that did not rely on any special effect, but the sensitivity of the actors themselves. These were also well-executed, albeit sometimes bordering on cheesy (although that was how they really were described in the book!). <br/><br/>Overall, I would say this movie achieved that rare balance between book and film interpretation. Fans of the book and those who never read the books both would appreciate the characters, story-telling, the set design, art direction and visual effects. This is a must-see, and sets up the upcoming sequels as there is no doubt they will also produce the next two books, ""Catching Fire"" and ""Mockingjay"". Well-recommended!"
"Chalice_Of_Evil","7","9","28","21 March 2012"," Jennifer Lawrence is the Girl on Fire...
","The best thing about this movie is Jennifer Lawrence and her performance. All doubters & naysayers should eat their words, as Lawrence proves more than up to the task of completely embodying the character of Katniss Everdeen. She's every bit as intelligent, fierce, vulnerable, resourceful as the character requires and more. The majority of the film rests on Lawrence's shoulders, and if she hadn't been up to the task, everything would have fallen apart. You have to believe/care about this girl, Katniss, and her portrayer ensures that you certainly do. Her scenes of sorrow are very heart-wrenching, it must be said. Initially someone who would rather stay hidden in trees than kill, she eventually reaches the point where she has to kill or be killed. She doesn't outright kill people at first, but rather does things which lead to people's deaths (if not at her hand directly). Inevitably, though, she does wind up getting her hands dirty in the end. <br/><br/>Also important is the character of Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) and his friendship with Katniss. Through minimal flashbacks, we see how they met and why they are what they are to each other. Hutcherson fits the role of the likable guy, capturing that fear and despair upon being selected, then later the determination to rebel against what's expected of him. This relationship proves pivotal to the story and both actors absolutely bring it, having the right chemistry required. Not sure why such a big deal was made out of Gale (Liam Hemsworth, who has yet to prove himself to be up to the same standard of acting as his brother, Chris), friend of Katniss, having his role expanded in the film - he's barely in it. He shares two scenes with Katniss, and the rest is longing looks.<br/><br/>Elizabeth Banks is great in the role of eccentric and slightly scary-looking Effie Trinket. She's virtually unrecognizable in her first scene, but slightly less so in subsequent scenes. She provides the main source of what little humour is in the film. Woody Harrelson, as Games survivor Haymitch, starts out as the stereotypical drunkard, but becomes more interesting as he helps out both Katniss & Peeta with how they can ensure the odds are indeed ever in their favour. The unexpected casting of Lenny Kravitz as stylist Cinna turns out to have been a good choice. With what little screen time he has, he believably forms an attachment to Katniss and ensures she looks fabulous (which ends up being rather important). I enjoyed the scenes with these characters.<br/><br/>Somewhat wasted are Wes Bentley as Seneca Crane and Donald Sutherland as President Snow. They're in a few scenes, but don't really leave THAT much of an impression (not nearly as much as Bentley's weird facial hair does anyway). And while Stanley Tucci was very good in the role of Caesar, he wound up being mainly exposition guy (explaining stuff we already knew or could figure out ourselves). Not faring much better are the various other Tributes - most of whom are of the 'everyone for himself/herself' mentality (even when they seemingly team up). It's certainly cutthroat, sometimes literally. People get slashed, stabbed, their necks broken, shot with arrows and stung by horrible wasp things called Tracker Jackers, which turn you all gnarly and swollen. The frustrating shaky cam is WAY overdone at times, even when people are just simply walking (the Reaping scene), but particularly later on when they're fighting and killing (the Cornucopia scenes). Due to the camera's wild shaking, the scenes of violence are not really that detailed and the fighting is at times hard to follow. Kills are either done quickly/not lingered upon or they are edited around. It'll be a question of whether this bothers you/how much you *let* it bother you that determines whether you come away satisfied or annoyed with how the brutality in the film is portrayed on screen. Is it enough that you get the gist of the horrible murders being committed, or do you need to SEE them in explicit detail? Having said that, it's not like there's a complete absence of blood or anything. There is a fair amount, it's just not especially gory/gratuitous. One Tribute who does leave some actual impact is Rue (Amandla Stenberg). This young actress proves herself a natural in her role. Thanks to the actors playing them, Katniss and Rue are able to form a believable alliance/friendship, despite being given very little time to do it in (and, in Stenberg's case, very little dialogue). It's quite remarkable how quickly you come to care about the two of them as a team, which makes what comes later actually effective/have weight and depth. The Mockingjay call they whistle to each other is quite haunting, as is Lawrence's singing.<br/><br/>The costumes are stunning...if a little frightening, the sets and scenery are luscious, and the CGI is fairly good (though there are some questionable giant wolf-like creatures at one point). The pacing of the film is...well...I'm not sure how it is in the book, but things did seem to drag here and there at several points (and the ending was rather lacklustre). I'm surprised people were worried the runtime wouldn't be long enough, as I felt it was more than sufficient. I haven't read the books, but knew the gist of what this film was about, so I elected to go into the movie not having read the novels so that I could enjoy the film based solely on its own merits. Perhaps readers of the book will be more satisfied, as they will appreciate the little or 'slower' parts more than non-readers. I think upon re-watching the film, I might appreciate them more too. I can't rate it as an adaptation, but I can say that, as it stands, this is a pretty decent introductory film for those who haven't read the books - being one myself. Here's hoping for even greater things from the next movie."

","Being a phenomenon among teens and tweens can guarantee your box office success, no matter how bad is your production. But to guarantee you increase beyond your target audience you need to smart up. Where Twilight sets the bar, you expect others to follow suit. You hire bunch of good looking dudes & girls (who happen to be extremely talented) and dumb them down until you think they are just sticks in good looking clothes. But little did we know, some of them were taking notes of the mistakes Twilight series committed and made sure there movie version of another book phenomenon does not make the audiences roll their eyes over and over again.<br/><br/>How good was Hunger Games can be measured by the audience reaction to the anticipated scene they had read in the book and yet gasp on every scene that struck a chord by its penchant melodrama between all the bloodshed. Truth to be told, the bloodshed was minimal in the movie version compared to all the gory details of each death in the book. This was still a packaged product to attract young to very young audience and would not expect 'Battle Royale' kind of gore. But the movie still packs a punch amid all the melodrama.<br/><br/>Even if you are not interested in the teen love triangle being played out, you would find the politics interesting. It's pretty amusing how the pundits from Left and right of American political spectrum came to the conclusion that the movie justifies their political stand against one another. All in all, an entertaining movie that provided something for everyone to enjoy. That said the success does make the maker's task easier and provides a loyal audience for its following sequels. One hopes they do not just concentrate on marketing and focus on keeping the quality of their product consistently good."
"dragos_f","10","5","13","2 September 2012"," A great adaptation of a first-person narrative
","The Hunger Games is a sci-fi/adventure/fantasy film, an adaptation of the first book in a popular trilogy of adult dystopian novels written by author Suzanne Collins.<br/><br/>In the post-apocalyptic future, in the ruins of a place once known as North America lies the nation of Panem, a shining Capitol surrounded by twelve outlying districts. The Capitol is governed by an authoritarian regime that keeps the districts in line by forcing each of them to send one buy and girl between the ages of twelve and eighteen to participate in a gladiator-style survival game known as the Annual Hunger Games, brought upon Panem as punishment for the rebellion that happened 74 years ago, a period known as the Dark Days. Everything is broadcast live on television as entertainment for the residents of the Capitol and a reminder to the Districts of the government's ultimate power.<br/><br/>Sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen, a girl who lives in District Twelve together with her mother and twelve-year-old sister, is the protagonist of the story. The film follows her physical and emotional struggles as she steps forward to take her sister's place in the Games. After the death of her father in an explosion in the mines, Katniss is steps up and becomes her family's main supporter. She takes care of her family by hunting animals in the forest outside the district, together with her friend and partner, Gale Hawthorne, which gives her an edge due to her bow-and-arrow shooting skills.<br/><br/>She says her goodbyes and proceeds towards the Capitol, together with her co-tribute, Peeta Mellark. They are paraded to the audience, given a few days to learn some survival skills, their skills are evaluated and then they are interviewed for the purpose of entertainment. Their mentor, winner of a previous edition of the Games, Haymitch Abernathy, instructs them to maintain a facade for the audience in order to give them an advantage in the Games. After all the pre-battle entertainment, they are thrown into the arena. Katniss is just trying to survive initially, but after a turn of events, without meaning to, she becomes a contender. But if she is to win, she will have to start making choices that weigh survival against humanity and life against love. Some of her actions are rebellious in nature and by the end she becomes an enemy to the Capitol. At the end of the 74th Hunger Games, Katniss realizes that it's not over. On the contrary, the struggle has just begun.<br/><br/>There are many things the movie did right, such as the scenes of Katniss running through the woods (both in the beginning and in the arena) or the scenes in the Capitol. There are other scenes which seemed rushed, such as Rue's last scene or Katniss' meeting with Thresh. All in all, it was a great adaptation of the book it is based on, with only a few flaws, considering the difficulty of adapting a first-person narrative to a film.<br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence was an astonishingly good Katniss and it's hard to imagine anyone else playing her. Her performance was flawless, perfect casting right here. Woody Harrelson and Stanley Tucci are two other very stunning performances. They managed to embody the characters in a way I never thought possible. These three are the ones who stood out for me. Josh Hutcherson did a good job, albeit not as impressive as the three I mentioned above.<br/><br/>My vote is a 9. I liked the movie very much, but as a book reader, I am disappointed that some scenes from the book did not make it while others who are not as important did. Aside from that, there is not much I can find wrong with the movie.<br/><br/>There is the issue of the shaky camera that some haters brought up, but to be honest I never even noticed it. I don't think someone who watches this movie with an open mind will find this to be a bad movie. The people who think it's a bad movie are haters who watch the movie with the sole purpose of finding flaws and plot holes which would not be there, had they paid attention to the actual movie. Or the people who expected a teen slasher movie, which this obviously is not. Saying a movie is bad just because it did not meet their expectations, is dishonesty at its finest.<br/><br/>If you like this movie, I wholeheartedly recommend reading the books."

","This is an excellent satire in the style of Fahrenheit 451. I watched this movie keeping in mind what a friend, who recommended the movie, told me that this what can happen to the USA in the future if Romney and the Republicans get their way. Hell! We already have the Hunger games they are called the Iraq and Afghanistan War. The acting was well done and the cinematography could have been better. I didn't mind the wobbly camera action. The movie did hold my attention the hold time. Stanley Tucci was cool, sort of reminded me of The Fifth Element. Woody Harrelson and Donald Sutherland were quite believable a usual.

I was on the edge of my seat for the movie, and I never wanted it to end. It really portrayed the book, everything about it was great. The camera-work, acting skills and the atmosphere.<br/><br/>The only thing I could possibly argue about is that Katniss did not quite look how I imagined her to look, but how she portrayed the character really made up for it. And Peeta was too handsome- how could anyone not love a face like that? Some scenes really touched me, I won't name them as I don't want to spoil. Either way, I found it impossible to look away.

","The Hunger Games was everything I expected, but not more than that. I am a huge fan of the series, having read all the books months ago, but I've avoided the movie until all the hype died down, so that I could give an honest opinion, and here it is. The film was terrific, one of the best adaptation of a book I've read. Jennifer Lawrence was absolutely perfect as Katniss and if she doesn't get a ton of awards for the role, there is no justice in Hollywood. That's the good news, however the movie was far from perfect. Friends who went with me and had never read the books, found it to be slow, and didn't understand certain things. At times, I could see their point. Several major things were rushed or just left out of the film. This led to some confusion, and then there's Peeta. I love Josh Hutcherson and thought he was terrific, but the portrayal of Peeta wasn't accurate. He was nowhere near as likable as he is in the books and he comes off looking like kind of a pussy. The end of the games was also problematic, as they changed a key point that I thought was pivotal going into Catching Fire. It will be interesting to see what they do to fix that before the next film. Overall I loved the movie and thought it was awesome, but if you didn't read the books, you might be a little confused by parts of it and see it as slow. Parts of the film that dragged on were explained through thoughts in Katniss's head during the book. Without knowing what was going on at those points, I could see how some audience members may have been bored with it. The movie and especially the books live up to all the hype and are well worth your time, The Hunger Games is something you are not going to want to miss."

","I heard people speaking frequently about ""The Hunger Games"" books but i thought it was yet another ""Twilight"" series. I disregarded the entire thing yet when i saw the movie trailer, it caught my interest. I regret I never tried this earlier(though not reading the book allows me to not compare both movie and book but rather critically view just the way the movie was made).<br/><br/>The idea was quite unique and in my opinion, sometimes seeing something visually has greater effects. This movie has succeeded there, with scenes able to truly portray the feelings of that part. The sound is also quite satisfying. <br/><br/>I liked the acting and the actors who portrayed the characters as they gave it a realistic touch,albeit some of the actors may not have really shown vivid feelings.Also,some parts of the movie left you hanging, wondering what certain things meant and some characters were shallow in that we never really learn anything about them, especially those who may have been crucial in our understanding of the story's background.<br/><br/>Overall, it was an excellent film(for someone who never read the book and did not expect it)."
"roberthelminiak","10","5","13","9 April 2012"," Hunger Games: Winning at the Box Office
","The Hunger Games was a terrific movie, and probably the best ""action"" type movie since District 9. This is more of a character driven personal story than an action thriller, though it certainly has enough action and thrills.<br/><br/>The acting carries this film. Hutcherson does an admirable job of conveying the shift in the character from a gross lack of confidence, to competitor, to lover? Well, maybe lover, as the director does a terrific job of blending the competitors fake affection for actual affection brought on by the intensity of the setting. Hemsworth's small role seemed to be a teaser as Thor's little brother is expected to play a much larger role in the sequel. Finally, Jennifer Lawrence is terrific in her role without using a ton of dialogue. She delivers powerful emotion without speaking, which is a bit reminiscent of Clint Eastwood.<br/><br/>This more than compensates for a handful of flat, underdeveloped and ""evil"" characters. There were numerous other actors and actresses that delivered in the final product including Woody Harelson, Elizabeth Banks, the always terrific Stanley Tucci, Wes Bentley, Donald Southerland, and an amazing though short lived performance by Amandla Stenberg.<br/><br/>Gary Ross perfectly blended all the elements of action, suspense, and even some lovey dovey moments. The beginning of the movie had several nice touches including the split screen and polyvision which amplified the crushing presence of government and the poverty of the people. The costumes, specifically those of the ""peace keepers"", were terrific and gave a feel of 70s and 80s science fiction.<br/><br/>The bottom line is that Lion's Gate hit it out of the park, and unless Batman can rise to the challenge this could be 2012s top grossing film."
"Homersan","7","5","13","24 March 2012"," Good, because we've seen it already, otherwise it'd be great!
","OK, There was a potential 9 out of 10 here, but because I had a déjà vu feeling the entire movie I had to make it a 7. Which is still pretty good. First things first, Hunger games. I haven't read the books and tried to not let myself get ""captured"" by the hype, as it mostly works negatively rather than positively imo. But the basic premise of the story, already dampened my anxiety. Drop people in a cage and the sole survivor wins. Battle royal anyone?? Don't know why no one made this comparison, because it's exactly the same...<br/><br/>OK, I'll admit that this movie has more depth... but you can't deny that the killin' in battle was more awesome. Anywho, it's been done before basically. Also, the feeling of oppression, the underdog, the poor ghetto districts vs the rich and famous,... almost everything felt really familiar. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it isn't good either. Another thing was the shaky camera in the beginning...Don't know the meaning of this, because normally you start a scene with a wide shot and then, you do the close-up etc. You don't shake your way through everything, hoping the audience feels like it's 'into' the movie more. The entire beginning up until the reaping was just one long headache to me. What I did like was the heartfelt acting involved. Have to give it up for the casting department here, because (almost) everyone was perfect. My only casting criticism was our president snow or what's he called? Mr. Donald Sutherland. Very fine actor, but what was he doing in here?? Looked like he was about the fall asleep. Which saddens me, because he got a good surrounding cast to work with. Give it up for Jennifer Lawrence who gives the performance of a lifetime. My favorite movie moment was a certain burial scene when the games are well on their way, and afterwards she gives their district's salute to the entire world, and by doing so, give the nudge to her people to fight for their own. Wow, I was just mesmerized by that. <br/><br/>OK, the guys involved..Hutchersons, Ludwig and Hemsworth are also very fine actors and hold their own. I was even fine with Woody Harrelson, and that's saying something!!<br/><br/>I hope that this movie get's the praise it deserves, as it is soooo much better than a certain other book/movie franchise that's going around, intended for the same age group....<br/><br/>Here's hoping for 2 more movies and here's looking at Jennifer Lawrence!<br/><br/>Raf"
"mnoraznan","6","5","13","25 March 2012"," Lazy adaptation
","One Word: Rushed<br/><br/>I had high hopes for this movie. It could've been much better. Instead, it is just a normal popcorn flick that takes its source material for granted. <br/><br/>Some important scenes doesn't have a proper lead-in to explain the action. Some were left out entirely. This makes some of them have less impact than what they were gunning for, instead, it induces awkwardness, even if one knows the reason for the scene. I'm not even talking about the symbol of the story that have been reduced to mere trinket. <br/><br/>So, my advice is, go and see the movie with your hopes dialed down. This is not a faithful adaptation, even the casting is way off. Its a shame really, such misstep is truly unexpected. <br/><br/>It could've trumped Twilight and takes its place as the leader in teen movie franchises. Instead, it happily place itself in the middle of the pack. <br/><br/>I guess, THE ODDS IS NOT IN YOUR FAVOR, THG."
"mattrifley","6","5","13","24 March 2012"," OK at best
","This could have been an AMAZING movie, but the cinematography was so jittery and unstable that I found myself being completely pulled out of the story to hate the experience. Steady-cam or Warp Stabilizer would have done wonders for this film, but half the movie was either out of focus or all over the place. Especially the ending battle scene- we couldn't make out who was who, or even if it was a person involved in the fight.<br/><br/>I live for the movie experience - and I knew in the first 20 minutes I would not be buying this to add to my library (and I have almost 2,000 titles).<br/><br/>Maybe the next one will be shot better."

","I think that given the time restraints of feature films this adaptation fairly communicated one of the most interesting YA books I've read in years. That said, a very large part of this movie was shot using hand- held cameras to up the topsy-turvy emotional ride that the characters were on. As a person who truly believes that is an actor's job and also a person who suffers terribly from motion sickness I thought this was a terrible injustice to the story and actors assembled to bring this feature to life. I truly hope that sequels will be shot with stable cameras so that the players can bring the emotions to life and those of us in the audience with motion sickness issues can enjoy the movie, too.

","Directors who film using shaky-cam should be taken out and publicly horsewhipped. There is a reason steady-cam was invented, you morons!! <br/><br/>I would have given this movie a 10 if it weren't for the fact that I couldn't watch half of it. I had to look at the back of the seat in front of me during the shaky-cam scenes, and of course, those were the best ones. As far as I could tell from what I could watch and from the dialog, the movie is quite true to the novel and the acting is very good. The scenery is quite lovely, as well - turns out it was shot in North Carolina, which means that's Appalachian country.<br/><br/>Did I mention the director should be flogged for using shaky-cam?"
"DonFishies","8","8","26","21 March 2012"," The odds are in favour of the first must-see film of the year
","After months of endless hype and speculation, The Hunger Games are finally upon us. With fan anticipation running high, I managed to check out the Canadian premiere of the film a few days early. And I must say, I came out significantly more impressed than I ever imagined.<br/><br/>Set in an unspecified future, one boy and one girl are randomly selected as tributes from each of the ""Districts"" that make up the country known as Panem to take part in The Hunger Games – a televised battle to the death. Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) of District 12 volunteers in place of her younger sister to take part in the games. But survival will not come easy, especially when she faces 23 other individuals.<br/><br/>I will confess, I initially thought The Hunger Games would be nothing more than a dolled up, Americanized version of the absolutely brilliant Battle Royale. Thankfully, it was everything but that. For Gary Ross has helped create a film that goes above and beyond a simple adaptation. This is a living, breathing, full blown phenomenon just waiting to break out. He hits the ground running after a brief explanation of the titular games, and makes the film more and more interesting as it trucks along. I hate that I will compare this film to Harry Potter and Twilight so often, but it does so much right that the first films in these franchises did wrong that you begin to wonder whether it is because of the source material, or because they just found the right filmmaker from the on-set to bring this epic story to life.<br/><br/>Lawrence, an Oscar-nominee for Winter's Bone, proves her worth and undeniable talent as Katniss. She carries the film on her shoulders from the moment she enters the frame, and never looks back. You feel every breath, every tear, every ounce of struggle she goes through. We already knew she was an exceptional talent before, now we know she is a star and this was the role she was born to play. She is very in tune with this character, and never wavers; staying strong from beginning to end. While the young cast of Harry Potter and Twilight took 2-3 films to really find themselves, Lawrence already knows who this character is and how to play it. Granted she stays focused through the next two films, this could go down as one of the best character portrayals in film history. Whether she is on her own or interacting with the rest of the cast, you simply cannot take your eyes off her. <br/><br/>Josh Hutcherson as Peeta, the other half of District 12, does a fairly good job supporting Lawrence. There is a lot left unsaid about his character (although significantly more than Liam Hemsworth's Gale, who spends all too much of his screen time brooding and looking longingly into the distance), but he is more than up to the task of showing off the skills he has been praying would make him a star for the better part of the decade. He does a lot of the emotional lifting in the film, giving his best work to date. He even helps make the more love-centric aspects of the story not feel nearly as dragged out as they seem to be. <br/><br/>While the young leads are all great, I found myself most fascinated by the supporting cast of adult character actors like Elizabeth Banks, Woody Harrelson, Donald Sutherland, Wes Bentley, and especially Stanley Tucci. All of them are sadly underused, but are all incredible additions when they do pop on screen. I just wish it was more often.<br/><br/>But what holds The Hunger Games back from perfection is its distinct lack of flavor or personality. The film moves at a wildly chaotic pace, barely slowing down for character or story development. It just moves from beat to beat, to the point where you can sense the end of one chapter and the beginning of another. And in this chaos, you never get a sense of what style Ross wants to infuse the film with. It has all the elements it needs to be a dystopian masterpiece or even a poignant and subtle social satire (ideas I already know will be developed in the future films), but it never quite gels together the way it should. It thrills you, but at the same time leaves you incredibly empty. I am not sure if this is how the book reads, or even if this was Ross' intention. Is he holding back on purpose, or is someone pulling strings to make sure the film does not truly become its own thing? <br/><br/>I feel like I may be getting to the point of nitpicking (I will leave out my reservations about how shoddy some of the shots involving fire looked), but days later, I still feel like the film is missing that one crucial element that separates it from being a simply book-to-film adaptation and the truly wonderful epic it should rightfully be. <br/><br/>While it may not be perfect, I cannot help but applaud The Hunger Games. This is the best first book-to-film adaptation since The Fellowship of the Ring, and did exactly what I secretly hoped it would – made me want to read the books as fast as humanly possible to find out what happens next. While it hints at oh so much of more, the film gives you just enough to stay riveting throughout. Lawrence cements her status as someone to watch out for, while Hutcherson and Hemsworth should brace for stardom. With Harry Potter an all but distant memory, and Twilight hopefully fading into obscurity, it's nice to know we have a series we can actually look forward to continuing. Bring on Catching Fire!<br/><br/>8/10."
"kalenawald","10","7","22","24 March 2012"," I and my kids LOVED this movie!
","I took my 15 year old son and 11 year old daughter to see this movie. My daughter and I had read the book, my son had not. All three of us LOVED it, and plan to see it again. And again. And again. And buy the DVD. It followed the book very closely, was riveting and exciting. To address some of the common complaints: <br/><br/>1. This is a 2 hour/22 minute movie. There is not enough time to put every single thing from the book into the movie. Character and storyline development was as good as it could possibly be without making the pre-Games half 3 hours long. The character development was good enough that several adults in the theater started crying at one point during the Games...<br/><br/>2. ""The Hunger Games"" is considered a young adult/teen book, and the movie is rated PG-13, which stays in line with the book's intended audience. So don't expect it to be all blood and gore. There was enough blood to make it believable, but not so much as to offend or nauseate anyone. While the book focuses a lot on the violence, there are other important issues: reality TV, totalitarian government, class-separation...<br/><br/>3. A lot of people don't like the ""shaky-cam"", and I can understand that. It doesn't bother me. It gives the feeling of disorientation and anxiety - what the Tributes were feeling - and also helps convey the bloody scenes - you only get snippets of the violent attacks and blood. Honestly, as I read the book, I was wondering how in the world they were going to show violent deaths of children to an audience of tweens, teens and parents. I think they did a good job.<br/><br/>As I said, my kids and I loved the movie. It's a good idea to read all the reviews and consider the things you do or don't like in a movie. Does a ""shaky-cam"" bother you? Do you prefer to see lots of blood and gore? Do you need a lot of in-depth background and character development to feel an attachment to the characters? If yes, then you may not enjoy this movie. Regardless - if you are at all curious about the movie - GO SEE IT!!! You might regret having missed it on the big screen!"
"haichgee","10","7","22","24 March 2012"," The best I could've ever hoped for
","I read the Hunger Games about 2 years ago, and since then I have been obsessed with both them and the idea of the film. After reading other people's reviews and knowing the talented actors who were featuring in this film, I couldn't help but have very high expectations of it. It was even better than I expected. The acting of Jennifer Lawrence was amazing, she managed to keep all the parts of Katniss I loved, especially her fierce protectiveness over Prim and Rue. Josh's portrayal of Peeta was also good, although Peeta's charming character struggled to come through, though I think that was a problem with timing rather than Josh's acting. Other notable mentions are Lenny, Woody, Elizabeth and Liam, who were all great at their roles. Throughout the movie, I kept thinking of all the things that were missing, for example the Avox and Madge, but had to then keep reminding myself that it was a movie, and of course they couldn't fit every single part of the book into a 142 minute film, so if you think of it that way then you shouldn't be too disappointed. I hope in Catching Fire they find time to show Peeta's character a bit more, and explain about the Mockingjay's significance, but I think it did a great job at capturing the essence of the book. We weren't just shown scenes of Katniss and Peeta kissing, it had much more depth than I could have hoped. I felt the anger at the Capitol with Katniss, and the fear before the Games began, and have not been able to stop thinking about the Hunger Games since seeing it last night, and I think that is the important thing. Whether you've read the books or not, I'm sure you won't be disappointed with this film."

Some people accuse this movie, because of the shaky cam it has, but I liked that effect. It lets you know that wherever Katniss is, things could always go wrong. I really enjoyed this movie. I was amazed. It was astonishing and excellent. Jennifer Lawrence does a fantastic job of Katniss Everdeen, a teen who supports a lot for her family since her father died. Josh Hutcherson does great as Peeta, a teen who is a kind hearted boy who's parents own a bakery. He saves Katniss from starvation once. Here is a plot summary of the movie, In the near future, the government lost a bet for a failed rebellion so now in Panem, every year there must be a televised death match and one female and male tribute will be chosen by a lottery draw. There are 12 districts which means that there will be 23 teenagers dead and one still standing. From district 12, Katniss Everdeen lives with her sister Primrose and her mother. Her father tragically dies in a mine explosion. When the tributes are chosen by Effie Trinket , Prim gets chosen and Katniss being a caring older sister takes Prim's place. The male tribute is Peeta Mellark. Katniss and Peeta have to go to a parade, have an interview with Caesar Flickerman and get prompted by there mentor Haymitch Abernathy. She must train while Seneca Crane and the other Game Makers watch. When the games start Katniss hides in fear that someone will try to kill her. She meets a girl from district 11 named Rue who is just like Prim, and makes her a friend but Katniss makes enemies with Cato and Clove, the tributes from district 2. Katniss must find a way to survive all the knives and arrows and try to win, for her sister. This movie truly shows the horror of starvation and hunger. It also shows how bad some governments are. In this, the government is very cruel, and forces people to participate in a death match. Gary Ross did a great job. I am looking forward to the sequel, called Catching fire. A fabulous film. A."

Peeta being a naturally welcoming person doesn't find it hard to fit in with the Capitol and being the heart throb of the lot, he manages to wriggle himself in to Katniss' life and when Katniss realizes what is valuable to her, she is left to depend on him."

","The Hunger Games (2012) <br/><br/>*** (out of 4)<br/><br/>Good adaptation of Suzanne Collins' novel is part THE RUNNING MAN, part THE MOST DANGEROUS GAME and part BATTLE ROYALE. Set in the future, each year twelve colonies must send a boy and girl to participate in the sport known as The Hunger Games. The battle to the death will allow for one winner who will get to take food back to her people but this year there's a twist as the two contestants from twelve (Jennifer Lawrence, Josh Hutcherson) begin to have feelings for each other. I'm probably one of the very few that hasn't read the novel so I have no way to compare the two and I can't say what the book got right or wrong. For the most part I thought this was pretty entertaining from start to finish even though there are some flaws in the film. I think one of the biggest flaws isn't really the fault of the film but when you know sequels are coming it's pretty hard not to know what's going to happen at the end of this film. The one other problem might get me killed by some but I found there to be very little passion between the two leads and I thought the love story was the weakest thing even though this obviously plays a very big part in the film. With that said, the rest of the film was highly entertaining and I was pleasantly surprised to see how effective the film was even with its PG-13 rating. The hunt sequences are actually pretty intense and there are some gripping moments during the deadly games. I also thought the entire opening bit was quite good and really helped build up the hype for the game that was to follow. It also didn't hurt that the cast were so good. Lawrence turns in another winning performance and she's so good here that it's nearly impossible to take your eyes off of her. I also thought the supporting players were great including Donald Sutherland, Woody Harrelson, Wes Brently, Lenny Kravitz and Elizabeth Banks. THE HUNGER GAMES also benefits from some beautiful scenery even if some of the CGI looks incredibly fake. Again, I'm not sure how this differs from the novel but as someone unfamiliar with the story I must admit that the movie is extremely well made, gripping and delivers some fine performance all of which makes it worth viewing."

","I will admit that I was apprehensive about seeing the film after truly loving the books.Movies based on popular novels tend to ruin the franchise for me.However, I think that the Hunger Games film truly does the book justice. You can't get every exact detail into the film, otherwise the movie would be 4 hours long but I felt that the film was very much in the spirit of the book.The cinematography was beautiful and evocative. The casting choices were wonderful. I was very thoroughly impressed with this film.It was thrilling and appropriately poignant. For once, I am actually looking forward to the sequel.I highly recommend this movie (if you can bring yourself to consider the spirit of the film rather than being a stickler for details)."
"darkraven_109","5","5","14","8 April 2012"," Overrated Below Average Stuff
","First off, let me start by admitting that I've never read the source materials for this movie; I just watched it with a few friends to kill some boredom so I'll be talking about how good or bad I found THE HUNGER GAMES as a movie, not as an adaptation. And yes, I saw BATTLE ROYALE and while there ARE some similar plot details, I won't rant about how ""X is such a copy of Y."" I'm fine with similar plots as nothing tends to be original these days.<br/><br/>Prior to watching the movie, I've read reviews online mentioning that this was a great watch. IMDb gave it a score in the range of 7 to 8 on its opening days before settling down at the range of 7.7 when I last checked, which is pretty high. So I went into the cinema not expecting a masterpiece but something entertaining at the least; that's all I wanted. I just wanted to kill a boring weekend.<br/><br/>And kill a boring weekend it did, but that's about all it accomplished. THE HUNGER GAMES may have been a good time waster but it's only a below average movie that got too much hype.<br/><br/>On the good side, THE HUNGER GAMES does manage to have a compelling first half. Prior to the titular ""Hunger Games,"" we get to spend nearly half the movie's running time with the heroine Katniss, who is a good protagonist at that. In a time where story is forgotten in favor of CGI and crappy action, an entire first half devoted to characters is something I more than welcome. This is not bad since we get to spend some time with our heroine and see what's become of society at this point. The setting of the story is also interesting enough to draw some attention; while not the most original in recent memory it still serves its purpose of justifying the injustices going on in the story.<br/><br/>Problem is beyond those, I don't really see how this movie was described as ""the best movie of 2012 so far."" The camera-work is just bad; at this point in time I'm really sick and tired of ""shaky-cam"" movies or whatever the hell you call it. I don't want to watch a documentary or some indie cinema crap full of ""realism,"" I want a MOVIE where the camera doesn't look like it's having a seizure every 5 seconds. There was also no tension anywhere in the movie. The premise is enough to convince someone that this would be a thrilling ride at the least but all we get are forced romance scenes and bad ""action."" The good build-up of the first half (the introduction to the training) was wasted in the titular games since it ended up being more of a drag than a thrill. The only emotions I could get from the characters was either romance or joy in killing. There was no sense of fear or dread or desperation; just a naive sense of good guys and bad guys.<br/><br/>The dialogue is as predictable as one could expect from a young adult story. Most of the lines that are full of profound messages (especially in the climax of the titular games) seem weird coming from Katniss who's supposed to be a teenager. Maybe it's the actress' fault for not delivering them well or maybe it's the script's fault for being too preoccupied with making things deeper than they have to be but either way, most of the lines didn't work. Also the love aspect of the movie wasn't done well; it seemed forced into the story simply because of obligation. Out of the blue a story of survival became a romantic one. The transition could've been done well but like most of the movie, it seemed rushed.<br/><br/>The worst part of the film are the characters. The morality of the story is too black and white to be believable. The people of the Capitol and the contestants who got too into the games are, well, the bad guys. Never do they get justifications for their motives nor do they get any redeeming qualities; all they do is sneer and jeer at the heroes, kill for the fun of it and be a hindrance to the romance. Examples are that girl who just had to have a speech of how fun killing an innocent and peaceful girl was and the exaggerated obliviousness of the Capitol's people that drove this point in. The morality could've been improved to make things more emotional and engaging for the movie but then again, everything was dumbed down for the target audience.<br/><br/>Overall THE HUNGER GAMES is a movie for the young adults bracket of the audiences. It's full of the things that apparently make a movie good these days: shaky-cam, theme song from a famous pop band, romance, young stars, etc. But for everyone else I'd suggest waiting for something else to come out. There's no tension here and everything else seems forced. Maybe if you were a teenager this thing would be as thrilling as advertised. While THE HUNGER GAMES is definitely NOT the worst movie, there are other movies that pulled off the same plot but in a better and more entertaining way."
"Hollywoodrulez","8","5","14","5 April 2012"," A decent ride
","I don't know how being a super critic works but I do know one thing. This movie has not been reviewed fairly at all. You gotta look past the book okay movies that are based on book are going to be different from the film always because books are a bundle of words on a page. Unless your running time is 7 hours for the film naturally you have to cut and paste all I am saying to you hardcore book fans out there is be aware of that. Films and books are two completely different mediums. As for some reviews on this film I failed to see the Blair witch camera work relations at all. The movie was shot quite decently there it's an action film the camera needs to move around in order to bring the audience in if the camera just sat on a tripod you'd complain that the action got away from you. Great fight choreography well written story with some good direction. The cast was wonderful in their performances the only two thing that bugged me were the fact that glimmer died at all and the starship flying over head in the forest. All in all a decent ride."
"patrick5-810-337920","6","5","14","24 March 2012"," Mixed reviews depending knowledge of the story
","My family went to see the movie yesterday and came home with mixed reviews. Of the five of us, three have read the books, one is reading them and one has no interest in reading them. Accordingly, those of us who have read/are reading the books, understood the movie. The one who has no frame of reference for the story, hated the movie. He found it choppy, disjointed, shallow and had a hard time following the storyline. And the extreme use of the hand held/shaky camera style gave him a headache. <br/><br/>For myself, I enjoyed the books but found the movie to be unsatisfying...which is no shock. It's usually that way when they take a well known story and make it into a movie. Especially one told in the first person. Without knowing what was going on in her mind (despite Jennifer Lawrence trying to convey as much as possible with her eyes/facial expressions) it's difficult to fully understand the storyline. My personal issue was that it made Katniss look as though she just jumped from one guy to the other...kind of made her seem skanky & shallow. <br/><br/>The timing also felt a bit off...like the first 2/3 of the movie was leading up to the arena and then the rest was really rushed. There is no time given to the cave and all that happens in that part of the story. I agree with the other reviewer who felt that the movie was basically a synopsis of the book...it was like watching a really shaky Cliff Notes.<br/><br/>I think Jennifer Lawrence carries the movie as the acting by the two male leads wasn't that great. Woody Harrelson is great as Haymitch but its written as such a small role."
"brittyleigh","6","5","14","23 March 2012"," Filmmakers were keen on getting everything right.
","First off, I think this is a good interpretation of the book. While the filmmakers were trying to hit every mark in the novel, they lost the magic and emotion between the characters on screen. I believe this rooted from the loss of explaining Katniss's background, where she came from, and how she got to where she is now. All of Katniss's past is only hinted at in the movie, making the audience piece it together. The problem with filling in those blanks is that those who have not read the book are missing vital information that tell us about the motivations and drives of Katniss. With such little information given to the audience, Jennifer Lawrence does an amazing job portraying the emotion and strength of the character so that the audience feels connected to her. I am not sure I would have felt so connected to Katniss if it weren't for her great acting skills.<br/><br/>Also, I went to see the movie with my friend who had not read the books, and he asked at the end, ""What was that bread thing between Katniss and Peeta?"" (Referring to the flashbacks where Katniss and Peeta first met). I realized that they never explained why Peeta threw the bread out to her. There was no hinting at her starving... just that she was there, he saw her, and threw the bread out to her.<br/><br/>My thoughts are that the filmmakers needed to cut out a lot of the Capitol scenes and increase scenes about the main character's backgrounds just so we can understand our main characters more, feel attached to them, and root for them at the end. Towards the end of the movie, I felt deflated and somewhat disappointed in the lack of character development.<br/><br/>While the movie was beautiful and the vision of the world an interesting one, I feel that it lost the magic of why Katniss and Peeta are important. I hope the filmmakers learn from their missteps in The Hunger Games and develop characters more deeply in the next installment, Catching Fire."
"rick-295-344015","6","5","14","23 March 2012"," Weak story if you haven't read the book first (and maybe if you have)
","If you've already read the books, you'll probably be able to fill in the gaps in the film and enjoy it to some degree. If not, I can see how some people might be confused or disappointed; some key elements of the plot are missing.<br/><br/>I really disliked the shaky / blurred camera work and lack of sound in some key action scenes. Fundamentally, the Hunger Games books are about the effect of violence on young people and those around them. That aspect of the story is almost completely lost in the movie. It feels like it was censored by the Capitol to avoid disturbing us in the Districts.<br/><br/>I didn't care for the way the Katniss and Peeta characters were directed in many scenes. They were so flat and down that the movie has a bit of a depressing feel to it. The depth and range of emotions that comes through in the book was completely lost. The supporting cast did better, but even there, depth was missing. In fact, the whole movie generally felt flat.<br/><br/>Character development was weak all around, but especially with the tributes. CGI was weak, and particularly bad with the muttations at the end (missing the huge shock factor for Katniss), and the ""girl on fire"" could have been much more dramatic. They should have skipped all of the game control room scenes, and Seneca should have had a much smaller role (as in the book).<br/><br/>There were a couple of good, powerful scenes (such as the three-finger salutes). But in the end, I left the theater feeling somewhat let down."
"ironhorse_iv","7","3","7","15 February 2013"," I'm still hungry, feed me more, movie!
","Hunger Games only feed my interesting even more, but this Gary Ross movie fails to make me full. The movie is based on the 2008 science fiction novel by Suzanne Collin, telling the story of teenager Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) who lives in a post-apocalyptic nation of Panem AKA North America where The Capital, a highly advanced metropolis, exercises political control over the rest of the nation by having The Hunger Games, an annual event in which one boy and one girl aged 12â€“18 from each of the twelve districts surrounding the Capitol are selected by lottery to compete in a televised battle to the death. You probably asking why don't they rebel against this cruel matter. They can't kill everyone, they rebelled in the past, why not now. That is the idea. By the capital killing their children without remorse or second thought. They demoralize the districts and keep them down. Africa is absolutely ridden with child soldiers, so it's somewhat possible. I know it's bit unbelievable, but just go with it. The movie fails to also mention Avoxes from the novel, the people who rebel against the Capital anyways. I imagine District 9 would be frequent winners of these games. They have illegal aliens. Just joking. Jennifer Lawrence is great as Katnis, but she does have some lacking values such as Lawerence gives near emotionless deliver of lines. Well that technique is commonly used to show uneasiness, tension, and stress. Sort of like from Katniss' POV, it's just not well-delivered. Not only that, but its hard to buy the fact that she is supposely 16, when she already start in more adult roles before this film. It's seem out of place. Katnis is chosen for Hunger Games with little to no training against well career tributes whom districts with a better economy since they had resources to train for the hunger games. She isn't going alone, she is follow by Peeta Mallark (Josh Hutcherson) a short, boring one-dimension boy character. To make them have a chance of surviving, alcoholic trainer Haymitch Abernathy (Woody Harrison) is wanted them to fall in love, so they can get sponsors to help them with the game. What is missing the movie is Katniss's inner monologue wrestling with the fact that she doesn't love Peeta, but has to. To show young love to become a audience favorite. The fumbled romance can actually be contextualized as two people being manipulated into this awkward thing they think is romantic love but really isn't, because it's what fans both in the novel and outside the novel want. It hurts the film. The story, especially the movie, works best as a scathing satire of reality television, but the absurdly shaky camera, especially in the fight scenes was annoying as hell. If they're trying to set a frenetic tone to simulate actual fighting their doing it wrong. The movie does a fantastic job of depicting the ignorant high classes with the capital civilians with awful clothing. The people of the capital see these children as characters on a screen and even when they don't they won't blame the government for bringing them there, they will blame the other child for killing him/her. It's interesting in a way, because in real life, people pay to see movie just with the fact that children are killing other children. We don't blame society, we blame the child. Truly eye opening subject here. Another thing, Hunger Games fail to show us hunger. It's not presented in the movie well enough. Most of the actors looks well-fed. In a world, where they can create animals like wolf mutts, why couldn't they create animals to be eaten? Doesn't matter anyways, cause the bad CGI makes them look fake, even the fire dress looks fake. The music by Taylor Swift 'Safe and Sound' and the soundtrack by James Newton Howard is amazing. The PG-13 rating didn't really hurt the film, as most of the death were pretty gruesome, and some of them were really emotional such as the death of a member of District 11. I hated the fact that the movie wrote out several really important plot points like Katniss having to adapt to going deaf halfway through and Peeta thinking his leg might be cut off. I think it's importation to the plot. Also, part of the appeal with the world building was the inter-district politics which play such a huge role in the sequels missing here.The books are original enough that you don't notice how the basic story structure is shamelessly pillaged from Running Man and Battle Royale. Everyone is saying it's a copy of Battle Royal, what about ""Knights of forty islands"". The first novel by Sergey Lukianenko in 1990? 6 Years before, Battle Royale was finish. The story is very similar. Just because something came out second doesn't always mean its a rip off. Similar ideas are always going to be around. Besides, the Hunger Games focuses more the the 'glamorized' idea of the games. The author took the premise of our reality TV shows and went far right with it. Never really got why the Hunger Games seemed to be linked to Twilight. Other than the love triangle and conflicting emotions of a female main character, there were no real similarities and let's be honest here: the Hunger Games was just better than that pathetic portrayal of vampires in all aspects. At less here, the female lead is a free independent string woman unlike Bella. The movie is not as good as the book, but that's because the book is written in first person, with a lot of detail and plot points derived from Katniss' personal thoughts. This could not be translated into a movie seriously (I would have hated hearing her narrate it) so other methods had to be used. The movie work as what it can do, and that's really good enough."
"christine_198","10","7","23","23 March 2012"," Really good movie
","Okay let make things clear. First of all, I really enjoyed this movie it was so well done! Everything that was important was here. But there were also things that made me a little bit sad but I totally understand why they changed things.<br/><br/>Second, after seeing this movie, I have to say to those people who didn't read the books, it will be a little bit hard to understand. I don't think I would of understand it clearly if I didn't read the book seriously. And I also have to admit that the shaky camera was a little bit annoying in the beginning but then it was less shaky. Still, they did a wonderful job and stayed true to the books.<br/><br/>Then, even if there were changes, I don't think there would be any better way to do it. If you really didn't like the changes, than tell me how would you do this? It's not that easy at all. Plus, since the book is written in Katniss' point of view it is harder to ""convert"" it into a movie. So, they made it perfectly and there were scenes that I imagined the way they did it.<br/><br/>Finally, The Hunger Games movie is an amazing movie, it has a little bit of all. Even if this movie doesn't look like a funny movie, they did have a little bit funny scenes with Haymitch. And there is also violence but they tried to not put too much blood in it. Well, I really enjoyed this movie and even wish it was a longer..."

"Watcherette","10","6","19","26 March 2012"," Great augmentation of the book
","Folks, viewing this movie MUST be preceded by the reading of the book. I noticed that the vast majority of the negative votes comes from people who explain that they have not yet read the book. <br/><br/>The book, however, is so complex that there was no way the film -- even with a length of 2.5 hrs. -- could do it justice. There are several rich themes explored in the book (trust; brutal abuse of political power; moral barbarism; empathy; love grown through similarity and familiarity versus love won through suffering and appreciation; the need for social intelligence; loneliness; subversion of a nearly absolute power; addiction to violence-seeking voyeurism) that had to be dropped or condensed, making the film concentrate on only one topic: hope. As a fan of the HG books, I loved seeing the things that I had to imagine while reading the text: Gale's reaction to the on-screen kisses, the mechanics of the arena, president Snow's reasoning about the ultimate goal of the Hunger Games, Haymitch's attempts to get sponsors."
"hammomoe82","10","5","15","24 April 2012"," Best movie I have ever seen!
","This film is truly amazing- with its deep, well thought out plot, brilliant characters and breathtaking sets, The Hunger Games is not a movie you are likely to forget. It has strong morals behind it- making people realise the cruelty of humans through deeply emotive scenes. The screenplay is riveting- every second counts; although it is quite a lengthy film, I simply did not want it to end! This promises to be an outstanding new series of films (with 3 more on the way), that although quite dark in context, is suitable for a wide audience. And for people who are worried about it being aimed at teenagers too much, (what with the love interest of the main character, Katniss) they do not need to worry- it is portrayed perfectly and not in any way overdone- the story is believable and it all plays a part in a much deeper plot, that will leave you ruminating about this fantastic movie for days after you have seen it. A perfect adaptation of the book."

","I saw this movie about 3 weeks ago and I have to say that I loved this movie. I haven't finished the whole first book, but I actually liked the movie better than the book so far. Before I got into the theater, I thought to my self ""OMG this is going to be really long"", but I was enjoying myself so much that it went to quick and I think that if you are enjoying a movie, then it will go very quick.<br/><br/>But anyhow I think the people here that didn't like it did not give it a chance. I also believe that people should be more respectful on what goes into a movie. People that make these movies have done the best job that they can to make a movie but on the other hand sometimes they don't work out that way. But this movie was just wonderful. It is a must-see, but if you haven't read all of the books yet, then I would recommend you read the books before you see the movie. <br/><br/>I thought that Jennifer Lawrence was very good in it too. She is a very pretty girl and I am sure she is proud on what she has done to make this movie a big success...well in my opinion."

","First of all, when I got to see the movie, I was aware that there was only one book out. You understand why the main character has a strong caliber to be able to go into a huge challenge and come out strong. <br/><br/>There is a need to probably watch this movie more than once. This is because the first time, you get involved but there are probably more details which one can ignore. It keeps you glued to the screen, there are good things overall. The only thing, which probably sets it apart, is the reality adaptation of the violent nature of human beings.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this movie if you've nothing to do.

","I haven't read the books before I went in to see this movie. I didn't expect much, as I believed it to be yet another boring action movie. Well, I suppose it is an action movie (quite brutal at some stages - do not bring your kids!).... but it is so, so much more! I was glued on my seat the whole time. Partly because I was trying to understand what the hell was going on, how did something like this ever happen!!! The story line is beautiful, in a very sad and brutal kind of way. The acting is excellent, absolutely fantastic! After the movies, I went home at 10pm, and I started to download the kindle version of the second book straight away. I could not wait, I NEEDED to know what would happen next. I finished the book around 5 am. Went to bed, woke up at 8am to download the third book from amazon. I finished the third book the same day. I was still flabbergasted by the story line. I went to the cinema the next day again.... I am not sure if I can describe the heart ache I felt watching the story.<br/><br/>I just finished the first book. I was surprised to see that the movie was SO close to the written story... like they just took all of the conversations word to word from the book! The love story is a little different in the book than it is in the movie. Honestly, the dude who plays Peeta - he acted so incredibly well, my heat aches thinking about his eyes when he looks at Katniss. How did he do this? I am still not sure what the books actually stirred in my. But 4 days later, I can still not shake it off... I would have enjoyed the movie more, if it would have been less brutal - but it would not have been the same! Also at first, I felt like some characters were somehow ""fake"", take Cato for example. I thought... he was somehow unbelievable, there was nothing human left in him. I changed my mind in the finale... he looked scared.<br/><br/>I rambling. But this is, because I still have not wrapped my mind around this movie/story line. Go, watch it. (and read the books, they are beautiful!)"

","Unlike some of the reviewers that read the book and were unhappy with the film adaptation, I felt the movie did the book great justice. You can't expect the film to be exactly like the book and if they included everything in the book it would end up being a 5 hour film. Having read the book, I can tell you that some of the things that were omitted from the book were mainly due to having to keep the film at an acceptable length. The film even got the thumbs up from the author herself, which I think says a lot right there. I thought all the actors did a fantastic job....especially the wonderful Jennifer Lawrence. She is a rising star and for good reason. For a film that is over 2 hours, you will find that it flows easily and keeps your attention. I know many people that have already seen it 2 or 3 times. I strongly recommend this film!"
"PJGuitar","8","5","15","1 April 2012"," Not your usual teen film based off a best selling book but one that is full of satire and violence but has a very potent emotional bite
","OK first of this film doesn't deserve a 10, 8 or 9 tops, but I was disappointed to see that the film had lost its 8 rating and i wish to help it. <br/><br/>As we know this film is based off the books by Suzanne Collins. Whilst there have been cuts from the book it is only because that particular part was unnecessary, books always have more than films get over it. What they have kept is the important story telling parts.<br/><br/>The film itself is more intelligent than people seem to be giving it credit, its full of satire and most importantly Jennifer Lawrence's Katniss is a strong, likable female protagonist! There are moments in this film where you will be heart broken over what has happened to her character. <br/><br/>Violence, yes it's violent and the majority of it is brutal especially when the ones being murdered are about 12. No it isn't as violent as the book, but have you read them recently? If you have you'll know that to make them that violent is to make a film with an 18 rating, one of the characters practically disintegrates in the book. <br/><br/>The casting is superb as I have already mentioned in the case of Katniss, Jennifer Lawrence gives an incredibly strong performance and she is supported by a tremendous supporting cast, such as Woody Harrelson, Stanley Tucci and of course Josh Hutcherson and Liam Hemsworth.<br/><br/>Yes there are problems such as the shaky cam, but it's not that bad and you can still see what's happening."
"wbhs","6","5","15","27 March 2012"," Disappointing
","On the whole the film is fairly predictable and tends to be quite slow in parts. Having not read the books, certain scenes seem unexplained and don't fit in the storyline. The major thing that ruined it for me was the incessant shaky camera and panning shots in particular throughout the early part of the movie. Why do directors want us to have the impression that the story is being filmed by someone with a camcorder? When projected onto the big screen this is both irritating and annoying and personally I find it very off putting. Weren't steadicams beyond the budget because too much was spent on hairstyles and costumes? The movie generally seemed a bit disappointing given the hype leading up to its release. I would only recommend it to someone if there was nothing better to see on the day they decide to go to the cinema.<br/><br/>Negative Points: 1. Shaky Camera and over use of panning. 2. Overly long build up to the 'games' part of the story. 3. Predictable and a version of In Time meets Logan's Run, Gladiator and Running Man. 4.Story not even logical, (why on earth would a young girl of about 10 be entered into a gladiator style tournament against a 20 year old man?) 5. Poor casting. 6. Bad ending (obviously Hollywood preparing for Hunger Games II). 7 It's 2 hours and 22 minutes long.<br/><br/>Plus Points None that I can think of but it might encourage more people to read the book instead."
"moviewizguy","8","5","15","24 March 2012"," Happy Hunger Games and May the Odds be EVER in Your Favor
","Every year in the ruins of what was once North America, the evil Capitol of the nation of Panem forces each of its twelve districts to send a teenage boy and girl to compete in the Hunger Games. A twisted punishment for a past uprising and an ongoing government intimidation tactic, The Hunger Games are a nationally televised event in which ""Tributes"" must fight with one another until one survivor remains. Pitted against highly-trained Tributes who have prepared for these Games their entire lives, Katniss is forced to rely upon her sharp instincts as well as the mentorship of drunken former victor Haymitch Abernathy. If she's ever to return home to District 12, Katniss must make impossible choices in the arena that weigh survival against humanity and life against love. -- (C) Lionsgate<br/><br/>As someone who has read the novel, I must say now that THG is not a perfect adaptation. After all, when do you ever see a novel be perfectly translated to the big screen? Saying that, THG is an incredibly solid and strong effort that should please the fans of the series as well as those who are curious to see what the hype surrounding the film is. If I were to compare this to the Harry Potter and Twilight series, which, of course, is inevitable, you'll be happy when I say that it's a lot closer to the quality of Harry Potter than that of Twilight. I'd also like to end the issue of THG ""ripping off"" Battle Royale. Let's be honest here: Those who say THG is a ripoff of BR either haven't read THG or seen BR. While the two both revolve around the same concept, the executions are vastly different. THG and BR both deal with different issues and themes, and therefore, the comparison ends there. Additionally, there is no reason why you should like one and not the other.<br/><br/>Getting all that out of the way, here are some issues I had with the film: Even with a long running time of 142 minutes, THG condenses a lot of events that play out in the novel and glosses over some details that I would have liked for the filmmakers to focus more on. The condensing of the material cuts a bit of characterization and makes emotional scenes feel rushed, and the glossing over of some details may make it difficult for someone who has not read the novel to understand what's going on. Furthermore, some of the CGI were a bit cartoonish, especially with the use of fire. Let's hope that the next film will get a bigger budget to improve on some of these effects.<br/><br/>However, there are some great additions that came with the film too. Since the novel is written in Katniss' first-person perspective, we only get to know about what she sees and thinks. The film takes advantage of its format and adds some third-person scenes that ingeniously expand the world already created by author Suzanne Collins. As a result, some secondary characters that didn't have much presence in the novel have a lot more screen time in the film, including President Snow, Seneca Crane, and Haymitch. In particular, we get to see the behind-the-scenes of the Hunger Games in a control room where the tech people literally get to play Mother Nature. There are also some small plot changes that help set up the sequels.<br/><br/>Director Gary Ross makes the great decision to downplay many things, with the use of hand-held cameras and the resistance to glorify many cinematic techniques. For example, the score by James Newton Howard is only used when is necessary, and when it is used, it's used effectively. This makes the world of Panem feel real and the issues more pressing. Of course, the shaky cameras also allow a lot of violence to pass with a PG-13 rating, resulting in possibly the most violent PG-13 film I've ever seen in my life so far. I also have to give a shout out to the sound department as well, which is another aspect that is taken advantage of to convey the violence. With the start of the film, we are put into an unusual world that we learn ourselves as the film progresses instead of the characters telling us every important plot point because they naturally know the rules of their world already. On top of that, the bleak and somber tone is done extremely well, with the build up to the game terrifying.<br/><br/>Of course, this is Jennifer Lawrence's film, and the camera is mostly with her the entire way through. Accordingly, it's a good thing that Lawrence does a terrific job in her role, playing the strong-willed character with such incredible subtlety that it aches us when she finally does show her emotions. Josh Hutcherson as Peeta does a great job as well, successfully giving the character the charismatic quality that was in the novel. Adult stars Stanley Tucci, Wes Bentley, Woody Harrelson, Lenny Kravitz, Elizabeth Banks, and Donald Sutherland are just great, doing justice to their roles. Sutherland, in particular, plays a menacing villain without showing much emotion at all, delivering his lines in such a subtle yet fierce manner.<br/><br/>If you think about what the filmmakers had to work with, a book told in first-person of a new world, and saw what resulted on screen, the accomplishment is commendable, if not entirely amazing. With the direction of Gary Ross and a powerhouse performance from Jennifer Lawrence, THG is a faithful adaptation of the novel that deserves the success it receives. Happy Hunger Games, and may the odds be EVER in the series' favor!"
"brenweh","10","4","11","2 December 2012"," Intense, poignant, heartbreaking movie.
","Having read all the original books, the only thing I can say is ""Wow"". The movie is so much like the book it's scary; even minor details, like the character's appearance, are faithfully included. Jennifer Lawrence was an incredible pick as Katniss, pouring her all into a heartfelt performance that made me cry at times. And Josh Hutcherson was a find - he portrays Peeta accurately as a caring, compassionate individual who fiercely loves Katniss. A warning: while Katniss and Peeta's romance is included, it's definitely not the forefront of the story. But what takes the movie to the next level is the supporting cast. Stanley Tucci is exactly how I thought of Ceaser Flickerman; he pulls off the entertainment personality flawlessly. Elizabeth Banks is almost the comic relief of the movie as Effie Trinket, and Woody Harrelson almost unnoticeably sets the tone for the movie as Haymitch. The actors really make the movie what it is, pouring their all into their performances and giving depth to such a politically poignant movie. While it is pretty violent, the end result has me counting the days until ""Catching Fire"" hits theatres!"
"NickMullins","5","4","11","9 November 2012"," Deep, Very good
","This film is disturbing in a very deep touching way. It leaves you with a jolt of shock that you get after watching a good movie.<br/><br/>I would suggest this to 14 and older for violence, thematic elements, and frightening scenes. I wouldn't suggest having a family movie night with this, as it faces some disturbing topics and scenes. However, adults and mature teens will fully grasp the message the author is trying to relay to the audience. We enjoy violence, and laugh at it in movies and TV shows. And yet this movie tries to put violence in a darker more serious light, and does so very, very well.<br/><br/>Performance wise, the acting is superb as well as VFX, however they must of run out of tripods, they should get some so that the poor camera man doesn't have to hold the camera the whole time...:)"

","The Hunger games book was amazing, but then the film took the games to a whole new level of excellence. I thought that the cast were effortless, it was like Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson were actually born to play the parts of Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark. The rest of the cast were amazing to, it was like they knew how to play the characters and you can tell that by their actions and facial expressions, such as Isabelle Fuhrman who plays Clove you could tell that she was dangerous body language. Overall the film was breathtaking and a really great film for the suggested age group. Congratulations to all of the Hunger games cast and crew."
"iholland95","10","4","11","2 June 2012"," Great Movie!!
","Just saw this movie a few weekends ago with my aunt. It was FABULOUS!!! I found myself wanting more by the end of it. Like a ""was that it?"" moment. I loved Jennifer Lawrence in it and Josh Huchenson. They were both terrific. Loved the camera work and the stunts. Very well done!!! I would definitely see this movie again. It was amazing. I am now going to read the books. I've heard people say that the books are very different from the movie so it will be interesting to see how it compares once I finish the first book. I honestly didn't think there was enough dialogue in this film though. You see Katniss running a lot, but there wasn't much dialogue except for the beginning and towards the end. There was more fighting then anything. This was my first action movie I've ever seen and I am looking forward to seeing more action movies in the future."
"kjbouche","8","4","11","20 April 2012"," Read the book first!
","Alright look I'm not going to sugarcoat it because if you didn't read the book you will most likely not be able to follow the story. There are no reasons for why certain actions are taken as opposed to others unlike the book which gives detailed reasoning for everything. It does seem a bit drole at times, but overall I still think the movie is decent and I do think that it had some good acting. Seriously though the major thing is just to read the book before seeing it and I guarantee you would find the book much more entertaining. I think that the majority of the concept was laid out in this one so hopefully the next two in the trilogy don't need to recap too much because the major issue with this movie was time constraints."
"guyincognito1","6","4","11","7 April 2012"," Such a shame...
","I say 'such a shame' because stylistically, this film was close to flawless. It was stunningly beautiful, and I adored the majority of the shots. The use of colour contrast between the settings was wonderful, albeit quite blatant, but then again there's nothing wrong with that. The futuristic quality was good too, and I loved the way in which they portrayed the grotesqueness of the city people as opposed to the lowly and oppressed. And while I'm on the positives, I shall compliment Jennifer Lawrence on an excellent performance. <br/><br/>But I'm afraid that I just had too many gripes with this film for it to be as good as I had been told it was. The first one is not the fault specifically of the film, which is again, I emphasise, a shame. I must admit to not having read the book, but the premise on which the entire story is founded bothered me right through the film, and I have to say that this detracted from my enjoyment of it. Why on earth would 24 young people be made to fight to the death? Because it is 'a tradition'. But then what is the significance of this? And answer came there none. And even if there was an answer in the book, I highly doubt I would find it convincing. It is just not believable enough. And while I accept that futurism and Sci-Fi rarely make much sense, most of the masterpieces you will find in this genre are suitably convincing. The sacrificial aspect of this particular vision of the future just doesn't make any sense to me.<br/><br/>Secondly, the character exploration was poor, at best. Especially Peeta, who came across as nasty, selfish, and condescending the entire film. No doubt there was supposed to be some change, or some equivalent, to make Katniss fall in love with him, but it wasn't there. Why did she protect him? I think, and correct me if I'm wrong, that when he 'teamed up' with the others, he was trying to drag them off her scent, as it were, but if this was the case then it didn't come through. It just wasn't obvious enough. And while we're on Peeta, Josh Hutchinson was pretty bad, relying far too heavily on his puppy-eyes (the number of close-ups tells us that much).<br/><br/>We also felt nothing for any of the other 22 'tributes', especially Rue, with whom Katniss looked vaguely like forming a connection with, probably because she reminded her of her sister. But the connection was just not strong enough to evoke any emotion. In addition to all of this, the storyline was far too predictable.<br/><br/>So I do say, 'such a shame', because this was, visually, a pleasure to watch. But was never going to be a great film, purely because of the premise. And that there are other things, which could have been rectified (unlike the premise of the entire story) that weren't, put this film just the wrong side of a 7/10 for me, I'm afraid."
"mhidalgo-305-233657","6","4","11","30 March 2012"," It might be good for teenagers
","First of all, i didn't read the book, then i don't know if it follows the book story or not. But what i can tell is that this movie roams around a love triangle with a violence deploy at the background. This is the first fault, because i was expecting the other way. I mean, the title is ""The Hunger Games"" and not ""Love in the Hunger Games"". Maybe teenagers, specially female ones would love this, but not me. The next fault is the shaky shoots, why are there shaky shots on action takes? This movie is not documentary style, nor first person view, so why?<br/><br/>Now the good of it, thats why i gave a 6, photography is good, good special effects, as for makeup and digital (except when takes are shaky), acting is good, and music is good too.<br/><br/>In short, the movie kept me entertained, made me dizzy some times, and not expectant for next part"
"jhershey888","6","4","11","26 March 2012"," They missed on the adaptation
","I will try to keep the words to a minimum and points to the maximum. I have read all three books. I am not a kid. <br/><br/>With that established, I have read countless well written reviews on this site and have to reiterate, that the adaptation IS NOT GOOD. When you see much larger (page count) books adapted so well (Potter's, LOTR, Dragon Tattoo) you know it can be done, without compromising detail, character development and story. <br/><br/>Those that said this movie presents like a ""Cliff Note"" version are dead on. I kept finding myself looking at my wife as we would acknowledge to each other the back story we knew, almost like an inside joke (that's not good).<br/><br/>And for Pete's sake, I can't be in the yard for more than 10 minutes without being filthy, and these kids are in the woods fighting for their lives for days (we think.... but who knows.... it's weeks in the book) and they are barely disheveled? Come on, that's just lazy film making.<br/><br/>And other reviewers are not lying when they say that the small budget came through in the visual presentation (cornucopia, fire suits, hover craft, to name a few).<br/><br/>I'm sorry but I believe that Gary Ross was the wrong pick as well as Susanne Collins for co-writing the script. Look at the visual pallet and details of the film. At no point does it feel gritty, dangerous or desperate. And Ross has never done a film with those characteristics, he plays it safe and easy to digest. <br/><br/>As far as Collins being a mistake for the re-write. I think it was too difficult to get away from the source material to get a different view in how to present it. Once again, Peter Jackson re-worked LOTR and made it work well and Rowling didn't even try to do her scripts.<br/><br/>I actually had to come back and edit this to add.... the shaky camera work (that is mentioned in the other reviews) is not and exaggeration. It is TRULY that off-putting. <br/><br/>Well folks, they have 3 more chances. Let's hope they don't buy all the hype, and make some much needed changes. If not, they will continue to be weak, watered down versions of great source material"
"six2561","8","4","11","25 March 2012"," We didn't fall asleep....
","I'm 50, my husband is 58. We never read the book, but have been hearing about this movie for a year from our 18 year old daughter. We went to see it on her recommendation. It's a good movie, and as my husband states, it held his interest, he didn't fall asleep, killed 2 hours and he didn't leave feeling like he was once again ripped off of money spent on a bad movie. The movie The Truman Show kept popping in my head throughout. I'm sure many of the target demographic have never seen that movie. And at the end, with the berries, The Blue Lagoon popped into my head. So not entirely original plot lines. What I couldn't come to terms with is the plot line of killing 23 teens each year as penance for causing an uprising against the government. And why exactly would people want to watch this and allow it? Husband says they explained it at the beginning, but I missed it, I guess. Another point I didn't fully grasp was the caricature, cross between Cirque costuming and the DR Seuss-esque dress and make-up of the people living in the capital. Weird. But again, I didn't read the book. The actors did do a great job and many of the scenes really added to the movie, notably the scene after Katniss was stung by the wasps, and the way Rue's death was handled. Woody Harrelson was great as he usually is. Lenny Kravitz was a nice surprise and also did quite nicely. I just can't get past the fact that these teens were made to kill each other for sport."
"Kubris","7","4","11","24 March 2012"," Read the book or the odds will not be in your favour
","The Hunger Games is a good adaptation of good material. As a reader of the first book but not the sequels, I liked how Katniss was an independent and strong character and that it's a teen lit novel that doesn't become a love story. The idea is great (I'm a firm Battle Royale fan) but the writing was only fair- too many cheap cliffhangers- but I felt that it would translate excellently to the screen. However I was able to avoid the hype and hold a very neutral, yet educated stance.<br/><br/>The structure of the book is intact. From start to finish the film is very faithful, with the only exception being that a flashback is told sporadically in the film instead of being laid out early in the book. The time distribution however is not equal throughout the film: the first act is skimmed through. It gets the plot rolling quickly, but the characters suffer- something that happens a lot. Gale, Prim and Mom see so little screen time, which makes The Reaping feels very wrong. It seems too quiet and empty, despite silence being the point of it.<br/><br/>Very early we get to the Capitol, which is lushly realized despite some very plain visual effects. The costumes and locales are ridiculous, extravagant and ignorant like the citizens who wear and occupy them. And the Games itself jump right out of the book.<br/><br/>There's two major, looming problems with the film, which are the assumptions filmmakers made about you and removing the narrator. Suzanne Collins, the author of the books, co-wrote the screenplay. So in her mind, it is assumed you know anything she leaves out of the film because you have to have read the book. For example, who Foxface is. Readers know, but if you are in the dark you probably won't understand until her arc is completed. In fact, most characters disappear in the film- Thresh gets one line, Clove, and Rue even. The thing that could have rectified this problem was taken out of the film: Katniss' thoughts. The perspective changed in transfer to objective, meaning we only see what happens, no thoughts about them. Katniss' thoughts could explained so much that didn't need to be shown and wasn't. Maybe a full blown narration wouldn't have worked, but even hearing her think to herself sometimes, or hearing things others said earlier, or even Nathan Drake (Uncharted) style talking to herself could've fleshed out the world and made the film easier to stomach for those who didn't read.<br/><br/>There are more issues though. The camera gets ridiculous. Understandably, not all of the violence could be shown on screen, but the action shots here are sickeningly unfocused and uninspired. A late change to the 'dogs' makes the scene impersonal and has the cheapest scare I've ever seen in a PG film, and like the source material there's not much closure. Despite a healthy 2:20 runtime, characters are really underdeveloped (Peeta's alliance has no repercussions or explanation, mind-boggling), and it still feels slow in some areas. The visual effects are lazy- the flaming dress is SO BAD- it put very dangerous words in my head: cash in. <br/><br/>There are some great performances though. Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) is perfect, strong and unaffected by men, and the film thankfully has even less forced romance than the book. And while it's not played up for excitement, she kicks some ass for survival. Haymitch (Woody Harrelson) makes the best of any support. He's captivating, a clearly haunted and tired character, but still humorous and helpful. Seneca Crane (Wes Bentley) is a character I can't even remember from the book, and I'm conflicted about him. Some parts he seems too nice to be the Gamemaker, and in others he seems too cruel, but he gets a fantastic last scene that I think was the best original thing they added. It's very poetic. Lastly Cato (Alexander Ludwig) is the primary tribute antagonist, and I always pictured a very intimidating young man playing him. So while the casting isn't the best for him, he's convincingly vicious.<br/><br/>The atmosphere slips sometimes. Some parts nail the desperation and horror of the event, but others actually coaxed laughter from the audience like a very important and tense last scene from the book that had the whole theater giggling- still not sure if it was intended to be comedic.<br/><br/>The Hunger Games has its ups and downs, but a solid core. It's a fair adaptation of material heavier than its developed audience and it shows in the film that the goal is to make lots of money from fans. It's a good couple of hours but not an especially memorable film. If you're a fan of the novels you'll love because you'll actually understand it, but if you're like me, on the fringe, or haven't read them at all, don't feel too bad if you miss this one. 7.5/10"

","OK, so I just watched the Hunger Games.......... You should really read the book before going to see this movie. A lot was left out and the entire movie was rushed. I enjoyed the movie and thought it was good but from reading the book first, I was able to fill in a lot of the blanks. There was a lot of the movie that stayed true to the book but had I not read the book first, I don't think I would have enjoyed it as much.<br/><br/>By reading the book first you can actually feel and understand what's going on mentally, physically and emotionally with the characters, all while the movie is rushed from one scene to another up until you get to the actual games. Even though the movie was 2 1/2 hours long, it still seemed like that if you didn't read the book, there's stuff you would not understand or feel regarding the character, their families, their home and their districts.<br/><br/>The scenery setting for the entire movie is pretty close to how I pictured it while read the book.<br/><br/>I give the movie a 7 and say that it's worth seeing if you read the book."

"jtuck044","7","4","11","23 March 2012"," Good, But Several Flaws
","The big screen adaption of the Hunger Games was good, but could have been better. As weird as this may sound, it could have been more violent. I know that they have to cater towards their demographic (pre-teens), but I felt that the way the violence was portrayed in the movie didn't give it the same sense of peril and intensity as the book. I'm not saying it need to be gorier, but there definitely could have been a bit more raw. There were also some character development issues. The Katniss-Gale relationship is never completely explained. Also, the Katniss-Peeta dynamic was not developed fully enough for the audience to get a clear picture of Katniss' true feelings (as stated in the book). Overall, the movie is good. It is definitely worth seeing and will make you laugh, cry and jump out of your seat."

"victoria-spolen","9","2","4","27 March 2020"," A must see movie.
","With adapting a book into a movie there are inevitable difficulties and restrictions, they won't possibly make a 10 hour movie. When adapting a book into a movie everybody's gonna have different opinions on what should be included, and what shouldn't. Folks who read the books first are gonna have a wide range of different pictures in their heads on how the characters look and move, how the scenery looks etc. And that's why, everybody's just not gonna be satisfied: there's no way to avoid it. But i personally think they did an excellent job.<br/><br/>The casting has the be one of the things they absolutely succeeded in. Jennifer Lawrence is without a doubt the perfect Katniss. She perfectly portrays this young courageous, strong independent woman yet also awkward and shy, she doesn't long for fame or attention, she merely wants to protect her family, especially prim. One other thing I loved with Lawrence's performance was the feel of realness and sincerity. In the scene where Katniss is hit by fire and has the wounds on her leg and she has to care for it, it's like you can personally feel her pain. It's like your in her head and that's your leg that's burning. (That's one of the things i generally love with Lawrence's acting, it just feels so real, like you're watching a live stream.) Josh Hutcherson plays Peeta beautifully, you can tell that he's been neglected by his family. He might have had more money and lived in a nicer part of the district but he didn't really receive any real love from either of his family. He feels really fragile but also very likeable and charismatic. The dynamic between the two characters and actors, feel raw and sweet.<br/><br/>Characters such as Effie, Haymitch, Cinna, Caesar and Rue were all casted perfectly. They fit perfectly in this dystopian world. Cinna's and Katniss' relationship was gorgeously portrayed by the two actors. You could instantly feel how comfortable Katniss felt with Cinna, almost in a way she wasn't with anyone else: at least at first. Cinna's calmness was exactly what Katniss needed when she felt overwhelmed by all the craziness, and i think that Lenny Kravitz was as born this role. Rue's and Katniss' relationship is also one of those that you can't help but adore and it ties the whole movie together. Amandla Stenberg was just perfect for just that, she brought Rue to life.<br/><br/>The cinematography is just beautiful (and stays so throughout all the movies, almost gets better with each movie). It brought to life everything i imagined in my head and more.<br/><br/>Of course the one thing I did not like and I know a lot of us didn't is the shaky camera. As someone who easily gets nauseous by such things it was definitely annoying (thank God they changed director by the second movie.)<br/><br/>There are so many thing to be said about this movie and a lot of them I cannot even express with words, truthfully. But that being said it's one of the best Sci-Fi movies made ever, in my opinion. All the actors brought the book into life and amazingly so, especially Lawrence exceeded every expectation I had. Every time I watch the movie it's like I'm blown away."

"brookesdewing","9","2","4","22 January 2020"," Great Emotion and correlation to reality
","Do you remember the release of the first The Hunger Games movie? I sure do as an 11 year old in 2012. My friends and I were obsessed with the struggle, the female champion and the rising up over an evil society! The Hunger Games was originally a book series written by Suzanne Collins, eventually produced into movies by Lionsgate Entertainment. The original film seemed to take the world by storm as children and adults flocked to theaters. The first Hunger Games movie is a story of a collapsed world divided into 12 districts and one capital. Every year the capital holds a competition between several districts. Two tributes are chosen from each district and must fight to their death, while weighing in love until there is one person left. Once there is a ""victor"", they are gifted a posh life with enough money to live very comfortably. In this story the main character Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) balances love, family, friends and finds a way to make it through the story while bending the rules. This film uses various components throughout to effectively communicate what society cares about in this world, and the character's personality and feelings to the viewer.
Right off the bat, The Hunger Games uses a sad looking dystopian world to draw the viewer in and portray the original feeling of the film. The cinematography of a dark looking forest with barbed wire fences gave me an uneasy feeling. We then meet the characters Katniss, Prim (Willow Shields), Gale (Liam Hemsworth) and a few others. All of these characters look like they have a cloud over their heads, almost like they're talking to us through the screen saying they need help in this unfair world they live in. I also picked up on parts of their personalities from the dialogue used in this sad time, Katniss is obviously very stubborn, but loving.
Something portraying this absolute gloom, I noticed quickly, is their clothing. They wear dull colors with all of the other children and parents as they make their way to the Reaping. We now meet a bright and colorfully dressed woman named Effie (Elizabeth Banks), Effie is from the capital whose job it is to draw names at the Reaping. Anyone watching would pick up on Effie's over the top personality and relatively positive personality all from her hot pink outfit, elaborate hair and makeup. Effies personality does not change throughout the film as she is one of the chosen ones from the capital with nothing to lose. Her eccentric outfits seem to feed her ego. Next, when all the districts and the capital are introduced to the tributes competing on live television, you see a piece of their personality and life based on the customer they are dressed in. I found this very interesting to see how they portrayed their personalities through the costume they wore, especially showing Katniss's fire within herself with a dress literally on fire.
Throughout the entirety of the film the actors did an incredible job showing emotion and feeling through each scene. Jennifer Lawrence showed great spirit and drive, going against what the capital and what it represents wanted from her. I found myself feeling inspired by the end of the movie, it felt as though I had my own fire within me and society did not have the authority to control my actions. Gale was Katniss's best friend and ""sort of"" lover. Gale's feelings for Katniss and her family, even after she left for the games, made me root for him the entire film. The acting was impeccable between these two, Liam Hemsworth and Jennifer Lawrence allowed viewers, myself included, to identify with the characters.
A theme I found in this movie, although it may not have been the most prominent theme in the film, seemed to be the honesty many societies deal with. You see a future version of the world that is desperate, a society obsessed with reality television. You see a society that values money and wealth over others' quality of life. I appreciate this theme was included, in my opinion it is a good representation of how our world could completely fall apart. It is a wakeup call for society to open their eyes and quit being absolutely engrossed in social media, reality television, and things that are intangible for the majority of people.
The Hunger Games overall does a wonderful job throughout the film in every aspect of entertainment. Something I found could be improved upon, is an explanation to initially to help us understand and provide background as to how the world had come to this state. It is obvious it is disarray after some sort of collapse, but left me with many questions. Why is it divided into 12 districts? Why is there still a capital with lots of money if everything was destroyed? How did everyone get divided into the ranked districts and capital? In a movie like Netflix's Bird Box, you may not know why this thing people see makes everyone die or go crazy, but the backdrop and believability with society seems to fit. Providing further historical perspective as part of the Hunger Games would have been a good to include in order to understand the rest of the story. It makes for a few blank spots within the plot.
The Hunger Games is an interesting story that holds the viewer's attention throughout. The acting, dialogue, scenery, photography, costumes, makeup, and themes are only a few examples of how the film successfully conveyed society's views and the characters feelings and personality. The Hunger Games first film did a very effective job across the board connecting to today's culture through the film's society, able to pick up a character's feelings through costume and being relatable from the viewer to the characters feelings and acting. Happy Hunger Games, and may the odds be ever in your favor."

"aimless-46","7","2","4","29 November 2015"," Excellent Book - Very Ordinary Adaptation
","Like many adaptations, this one leaves you amazed at Lionsgate's staggering contempt for the movie viewing public, a contempt similar to the ""Capital's"" contempt for the populations of the ""Districts""; so perhaps their attitude is appropriate.<br/><br/>Susan Collins' source novel (she is complicit in this insult as she had a least some part in the adaptation), the first of a trilogy, is the story of an existential heroine (Katniss Everdeen) who performs a single heroic act, volunteering to take the place of her younger sister in the post-apocalyptic games from which the grim trilogy gets its name.<br/><br/>But Katniss immediately knows that there was nothing heroic about her action, that her lightening fast decision required no contemplation but was something she was compelled to do. For the rest of the first book (upon which the 2012 film is based) Katniss is buffeted along by mix of free will and destiny, second-guessing each of her decisions and feeling far more guilt than satisfaction over the consequences and (more fundamentally) over her decision to essentially prostitute herself to the Capital in the service of survival.<br/><br/>And the reader gets full access to the inner working of her mind because the story is told entirely (100%) from her point of view. This storytelling device shrinks the scale of the story, as a reader never goes out beyond the reach of the first person storyteller. This fosters the sort of reader identification Edgar Rice Burroughs brought to his ""John Carter of Mars"" series.<br/><br/>Apparently Lionsgate felt that viewers were not up to the mental challenge of Collins' storytelling technique and they converted to a third person POV, going so far as to completely dispense with a voice-over narration by the main character. A puzzling decision since film offers wonderful opportunities for the juxtaposition of objects of contrasting scale.<br/><br/>Lionsgate also felt the need to draw in characters and events from the second book in the series (endless scenes of President Snow and signs of the beginning of dissent in the Districts). These immediately destroy the scale unique to the first book and the concept of a faceless enemy, so that the progression of the trilogy from small to vast is compromised. Overt dissent in the Districts appears far too soon in the adaptation, effectively spoiling both the intimacy of the first book and the expansion of the struggle in later books.<br/><br/>The film's ham-handed treatment of the story is reflected in Haymitch's explanation for the high score Katness receives after shooting the apple out of the pig's month. He says it is because they liked her guts; but his explanation in the book is that they liked her temper, that this exhibition of her fierceness has made her a player who they believe will bring some heat to the games. Guts are not going to attract sponsors or win the games, nor are they going to incite anyone to revolt. It is a critical change of phrase because throughout the trilogy it is not her courage but her mix of fierceness and humanity that is the difference maker for Katniss, and it is this mix that gives the character the dimensionality necessary for reader identification.<br/><br/>Most remarkable, however, is Lionsgate's inexplicable failure to feature the most powerful and most memorable moment in the entire trilogy; the moment Katniss receives the bread from District 11. Arguably the most intense segment ever written. This is really the first book's climatic scene, as Katniss slowly grasps that the bread was originally intended for Rue, with those in her district making a great sacrifice in order to support her. And that after Rue's death they elected to redirect the gift to a participant from another district, the first time in the 70+ year history of the games that such a gesture was made. And the first hint of a unification of the twelve intentionally isolated districts.<br/><br/>This is the turning point of the entire story, much like the moment in ""The Magnificent Seven"" when the Villagers tell Chris they collected everything of value in their village to hire him and he accepts this small sum, saying: ""I have been offered a lot for my work, but never everything"".<br/><br/>Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child."
"keithlovesmovies","7","2","4","22 November 2015"," The Hunger Games Review
","In what was once North America, the Capitol of Panem maintains its hold on its 12 districts by forcing them each to select a boy and a girl, called Tributes, to compete in a nationally televised event called the Hunger Games. Every citizen must watch as the youths fight to the death until only one remains. District 12 Tribute Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) has little to rely on, other than her hunting skills and sharp instincts, in an arena where she must weigh survival against love.<br/><br/>So I didn't see any of the movies or read any of the books but I am still aware of the series and all of its three (and almost four) films so far. I think I must have been the only one who hasn't yet. It's human nature for things in this first film to not seem as climactic when you've previously known things about films past and future. This review will be based on this.<br/><br/>This film took place in what seems like some dystopian future but we never really got an explanation about how this world came to be. We start off by seeing Katniss (Lawrence) trying to hunt for food for her family including her mother (Paula Malcomson) and her sister (Willow Shields) (they mentioned a father but I'm not sure how he died). Her family appears to be poor and the residents of each District appear to be poor as well. She lives in District 12 with her friends Gale (Liam Hemsworth) and Peeta (Josh Hutcherson). Her life soon gets interrupted when her sister gets selected as a tribute (participant) in this year's annual Hunger Games, a televised event where male and female youth from each district are selected at random to fight to the death (that's why these are YA novels). They don't really explain why this is the case but the explanation we do get just seemed silly to me. When her sister gets selected as a tribute, Katniss volunteers to compete in her place. Her friend Peeta gets selected as well. So the majority of the film after that is just her and Peeta being introduced to this world and preparing themselves to compete in these Hunger Games. These two get assistance with this from Haymitch Abernathy (Woody Harrelson), Effie Trinket (Elizabeth Banks), and Cinna (Lenny Kravitz). Once they finally do get to compete (it took a while to get to this point), they must face the elements, the landscape, and the other participants. The actual Hunger Games itself was quite a letdown when it was something that had to potential to be exciting (the subject matter as far as I've heard had ""R"" level violence but was watered down to cater to a wider PG-13 audience). I found the violence to be quite muted and infrequent as most of the killing was offscreen and implied. But a film/book called ""The Hunger Games"" isn't necessarily about the games itself but it was about Katniss and Peeta having to stick together and survive the games. The second half of the film serves to further develop the friendship/relationship between the two teens. This worked as the acting of Lawrence and Hutcherson were good here as well as Harrelson, Banks, and Kravitz (surprisingly). Despite finding the story to be very silly, I found the film was shot very beautifully. I cannot speak to its authenticity but it did a good job depicting a dystopian world. Overall. this is a decent, big-world film but I just couldn't get into it as I probably should because I did not like the story. I can, however, understand why people just ate this up.<br/><br/>Score: 7/10 keithlovesmovies.com"
"disinterested_spectator","4","2","4","28 March 2015"," A Contrivance for Violence
","The basis for this story is just a contrivance. It is said that the Hunger Games are punishment for a rebellion that took place seventy-four years earlier. Seventy-four years? Reconstruction only lasted about ten years after the Civil War. And whom would the Capitol be punishing? Most of the people who rebelled would have long since died, and most of the people being punished would not even have been born when the rebellion took place.<br/><br/>The squalor of the districts people live in looks like something from the Great Depression. But when the Hunger Games begin, we find that technology has developed to the point that the people monitoring the games can cause three cats to materialize by pressing a button. Well, if they can do that, why not materialize a bunch of cows for the starving people in the districts to eat? Oh yeah, I forgot. They are still being punished for stuff they didn't do.<br/><br/>We expect all movies to be politically correct to some degree, but when the political correctness is too obvious, you just have to groan. In particular, all the evil people in this movie are white; all the people who are not white are good. Oh brother!"

","This film tells the story of a young woman who is forced to enter a death match that only one will live out of 24 contestants.<br/><br/>While many people compare this film with the book is based on, I'll compare it with the Japanese film ""Battle Royale"" which has a similar storyline. ""Battle Royale"" is bloodier and more brutal, and it doesn't beat around the bush. This film, on the other hand, concentrates on plot development before the actual game begins. I was getting a bit impatient for the game to begin, and for people to really fight with each other. ""The Hunger Games"" still show the struggle for social, cooperation and altruism like ""Battle Royale"" does, but on a smaller scale. Jennifer Lawrence is very convincing as a brave young woman fighting for survival. I was amazed by her in ""Winter's Bone"", and this time she amazes me again.<br/><br/>The plot is tight but not eventful enough to fill up the 2.5 hour screen time. I am intrigued enough to want to watch the next episode, but I can't say I loved it because I think ""Battle Royale""is better."
"dom-lerose-8","Null","2","4","18 June 2014"," 'The Hunger games' is a story revolving around unrealistic child heroes and a ridiculous story.
","Children can be great heroes when put in realistic situations. 'The Hunger Games' is a series so big in America, that it may even become the biggest of all time. The film is a very poor story, and did nothing to make the characters feel real, or even have a story that wasn't complete garbage fantasy. The Hunger Games' tells a futuristic story about different games called the hunger games that are held annually and are similar to the Olympics. The games are not monopoly and hopscotch, but kids killing each other until one survives only. A few kids from each district of the separated people are chosen to participate in these games. Katniss Everdeen is the main character who volunteers for the hunger games over her little sister. She is an excellent survivor and is very clever. She befriends Peeta, who is in her same district which will lead to some further difficult decisions. Jennifer Larence as Katniss din't do the best job at playing Katniss. She just wasn't believable and was a very boring actor and character. The film making aspects were minimally done to make the visual aspects very disappointing. The main fault in this story is that children are the heroes. Kids is action stories are horrendous leaders, and are unrealistic at making sense to the story. Kids in stories that involve struggles and difficulties that kids actually face are much more powerful. In The Hunger Games' you have a teenage girl that is as fake as cookies and orange juice acting like Alexander the Great when she really should be portraying a girl with difficulties of a teenager that others can see as inspirations to help with adolescents."
"Koodle0101","6","2","4","31 October 2013"," Not Much Really Happened
","Quite frankly, not much happened in the movie. Katniss pretty much hides in a tree or behind one most of the time while everyone else kills each other. Then grows fond of Peeta and they both win. A bunch of random things happened in between that doesn't really add much to the movie except time. The concept is a bit odd and it's strange how the dogs come out of nowhere. (Yes this release them from doors) Also when they reach a certain point of the ""forest"" they start shooting fire from nowhere or make things burn. Movies need MEANING to be good. It's slightly too random for the sake of having a movie/story but it isn't necessarily a good/great one."
"DeepBlue0705","5","2","4","29 July 2013"," A lot of wasted potential
","First of all I have seen Battle Royale. This probably alters my perspective on this film as I just can't help myself but compare the two films. Just a heads up. <br/><br/>Firstly, I feel as if this film is too slowly paced and is dragged a bit too long, what makes it worse is that in these two and a half hours there is very little character development so when a child dies within the film it isn't very emotionally impacting and both aspects are better handled in Battle Royale as many of the characters in it are sharply introduced and just as sharply cut off and the shock and horror within their introduction and demise make it all the more impacting. <br/><br/>However, the performances in The Hunger games are rather strong. Josh Hutcherson does a very good job as Peeta but is overshadowed a bit by the wonderful performance by Jennifer Lawrence. She manages to display a large variety of emotions with such ease and accuracy that it makes the film fill out some of it's potential but only a little. Nevertheless the performances by some of the supporting cast members are rather weak. The careers are prime examples...to me they seemed to overact their malevolent side and made it less emotionally impacting which was a major purpose of the film. After all they're children killing other children they're meant to represent innocence. Yet all they represented were heartless killers from a typical slasher film. Once again I think the performances in Battle Royale were far better than in this. Not only are the main cast amazing but so are the supporting cast. I can't think of a major character in that film who wasn't convincing at all. <br/><br/>The fight scenes. For me it didn't work. Why they used a jumpy camera all the over the place was beyond me. We weren't seeing from anyone's perspective, they made that clear. It also didn't make sense, one second Katniss is on her feet, a few seconds of the camera trembling horrendously and then she is on the floor and restrained with the viewer being none the wiser on how she got there. When compared to Battle Royale...well the fight scenes in it made it all the more tragic watching adolescents break down with fear and paranoia before your eyes make the horror in it stand out even more. <br/><br/>One thing I did like in this films were the visuals. The budget on that truly paid off. <br/><br/>So in conclusion, if you have the choice between Battle Royale and the hinger games, then choose Battle Royale, it is a very well made movie with plenty of positives which scold into your mind for a very long time. This just had far too much wasted potential."
"kameryj","4","2","4","8 July 2013"," If I didn't read the book, it may have been better
","I read the Hunger Games book and to my surprise it was pretty good, I didn't have high hopes for it.<br/><br/>I won't get into a summary, you can read that on IMDb.<br/><br/>I wasn't the biggest fan of Katniss in the book, she is a huge debbie downer. But that's one big thing they changed in the movie is make Katniss a stronger person, which I think was a good move.<br/><br/>That's almost the only change they made that was good in my opinion.<br/><br/>They took out characters in the movie that aren't the most important, but they do help share more inside to the type of person Katniss is. They are reflections of herself in the book. In the movie, I think she only talks to three people outside of the Hunger Games. So you don't get a lot of depth on Katniss, or her past. The book goes into her past and explains why she is the way she is, the movie spends a few seconds on it really.<br/><br/>Also, they don't explain certain things. You are given a brief history lesson about the Hunger Games and then you're thrown a lot of stuff quickly.<br/><br/>In the book you are told the significance of the people holding up their middle three fingers, in the movie you have no real idea why they do it.<br/><br/>Book explains the significance of why it's hard for Katniss to trust Peeta, her fellow person from her district. Then, the significance of them working together and always being together. This was one of my biggest problems with the movie. The book stresses from the beginning that they must be buddy-buddy even though in the Hunger Games Katniss knows she must kill him eventually. It's a tough thing she goes through that shows her real character at points and really shows her growth as the movie progresses. The movie makes no attempt what so ever to explain or show this. It's just mentioned for a second and that's about it. To me that was one of the most important things in the book.<br/><br/>They changed the ending around, a lot too. The ending in the book is very climatic and builds up well. The movie just disregards parts that are important and says they never happen.<br/><br/>Like I said, if I never read the book, I probably would of liked this movie more. I wasn't a big fan of the shaky camera during a lot of the beginning scenes but they worked better later on.<br/><br/>The movie stands well on its own and it's not bad, nothing amazing. For me it's more frustrating to know what it could of/should of been after reading a great book like the Hunger Games."
"estreet-eva","5","2","4","18 February 2013"," A mildly entertaining cinematic take on a mildly entertaining book.
","Suzanne Collins monster hit series based largely on the collected writings of horror-writer Stephen King comes to the big scream with a can't miss fan base. Thus, the director Gary Ross's only true challenge is to just not screw it up. He succeeds. To be fair, Ross does take the extra step to clean up numerous shaky plot points (such as the torture porn death of Kato that mars the end of the book) and devices most especially the first person narrative which limits the development of backstory and B plots (realistically, once Katniss enters the Hunger Game arena all we should have known is her quest for food and water). Ross also does a nice job of peppering the cast with real actors including Woody Harrelson and Stanley Tucci as well as Jennifer Lawrence herself. Given that the core 12 year female audience lacks any interest in such matters must have represented a temptation to hire cheaper talent. Ross adequately captures the brutal action in the book and smartly drops out before the long, meandering final section. However, the CGI very much comes across like CGI and two often the film feels like a car commercial. The cimenatographic slickness undercuts some of the emotional scenes quickly jumping away before Katniss' emotion can fully land. It blunts the viciousness found in the book without papering over it but still results in a non-recommendation for those younger than fully in the pre-tween ranks. In short, the mediocre King- homage (or ripoff depending on how much of his stuff you've read) makes for a somewhat entertaining book that wears is 2 hour 22 minute running time well."

","The Hunger Games turned out to a big disappointing movie rather than an exciting ride which I had expected after reading glowing reviews and earth shattering box office collections.

The Review Directed by Gary Ross , The Hunger Games was like a thundering clouds which makes lot of noise before raining but actually doesn't rain at all. After watching such an exciting trailer, you will feel a complete let down. Neither it is thrilling nor exciting at all. Loosely based on a novel of same name , the story of a girl struggling to survive do raise few eyebrows but that does not transpire into an must-watch film. Direction is completely immature with movie running sluggishly at a snail pace. There is not even a single moment which is entertaining. Story is good which could have made more sense given in the hands of some other director. Screenplay is haywire. I did not understand if every participant has to kill each other to survive , why everyone was after Kate ? How come little Rue came to find the whereabouts of Kate and how did she protect her continuously for 2 days ? I am still surprised to the 7.5 IMDb rating for this boring flick. The only silver lining is the performance by Jennifer Lawrence. She leaves no stone unturned when it comes to superb acting. Rest of the star cast are average. At Direction and Cinematography is good. Background score is nice. Dialogues are just OK. <br/><br/>Overall , a very boring and disheartening film moving at a snail pace.

"yooyong","4","2","4","30 April 2012"," Made for TV movie?
","4 out of 5 stars? a 7+? I don't what you people are smoking. This movie felt like it was made-for-TV. Flimsy and unbelievable. <br/><br/>Why are the 'districts' so docile when government troops don't even look like they are armed with anything but batons? You are telling me people would live like that for 74 years without rising up? <br/><br/>Where is the background story on how Donald Sutherland became the ruling dictator? <br/><br/>It also utterly unbelievable there would be so much cooperation amongst the 'tributes' considering it is 'last man standing' competition. Also, why would the capitol allow 'tributes' as young as 12 to compete? Wouldn't that make for pretty lame competition and entertainment if say most of the 'tributes' ending up being kids? Also, how is that so many of these 'tributes' became experts at knife throwing or swordsmanship when they were randomly chosen and only trained for like 3 or 4 days? The fact is, if you randomly picked people from the general population for something like this, there would be very low entertainment value and would probably drag on. Also, Woody Harrelson quotes that 'most tributes die from the elements, not combat'. Hmmm...if I recall correctly, all of them died at the hands of other 'tributes' save for maybe the girl who died eating the poisonous berries. None of them died from starvation, cold or thirst as Woody Harrelson claimed they would. The fact that Woody Harrelson is in this movie made it even more laughable all though he did an OK job. I am thinking the makers of this movie toked up more than a few times with Woody while filming.<br/><br/>Those who read the book apparently are not fans of this movie and this movie certainly has not stirred me to go and pick up the book. <br/><br/>Cheezy costumes made it feel like Running Man or the Fifth Element. I have seen more entertaining and engaging episodes of Stargate SG-1 and that is a show that I find barely watchable at the best of times."
"Fred-S","5","2","4","25 April 2012"," Missed the book almost entirely
","If one had not read the book(s), I think he might find this to be an enjoyable, if not outstanding, movie. However, anyone who has read the trilogy knows that the movie did not even address the theme that made the trilogy so outstanding. The trilogy is primarily a character study of at least four of the trilogy's characters: Peeta, Gale, Haymitch and most importantly Katniss. Katniss is a girl who seems to stand for honorable ideas, but who finds insult and deceit in almost everything anyone tells her; especially Peeta. She finds comfort in his arms when she is fearful, but then refuses to admit to anyone, including herself, that she has any need for such care. Rather than being the hero, she is more the anti-hero of the story.<br/><br/>In the movie, she is brave and bold and smart. In the original she is bold, but not really so brave and certainly not smart. She operates entirely on emotion, saying and doing things without paying the slightest attention to logic. Time and again she is convinced that everything bad that has happened was caused by her. In this view she is only somewhat wrong. But after all of her agonizing and vows of repentance, she continues to do the same self-serving and illogical things that lead to more suffering of herself and others. In book 2, Haymitch tells Katniss, ""See, this is why no one lets you make the plans."" Later, she recalls Haymitch's statement and says,""That's true, no one in their right mind would let me make the plans. Because I can't tell a friend from an enemy."" Here, she is exactly correct, but that does not prevent her from making that mistake time and again with her most loyal friend, Peeta.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, Katniss is a very appealing character, and that is what kept me going for three volumes. I got a feeling about Katniss very much like the feeling I had for Scarlett O'Hara in ""Gone With The Wind.""<br/><br/>This, not her skill with the bow, is what makes ""The Hunger Games"" a great story."

When Katniss and Peeta Mellark (They choose 1 boy and 1 girl for the hunger games each year) Anyways the rest is just absolutely AMAZING, some scenes are very heartbreaking but quite violent, It is a dark gritty PG-13 film and i wouldn't rate it any higher or lower. The hunger games is a phenomenal read AND film but my one complaint is that Jennifer Lawrence is a great actress and all, its just that i think that she looks a tad bit too well fed for the role of a Poor food seeking hunter from district 12.
But other than that The Hunger Games Is a BRILLIANT movie and i highly recommend it to ages around 11+"

","After recently finishing the Hunger Games book for the first time, I was very excited to dive into the movie. I had heard mostly good things and was ready to experience it as it had been described. And woah...<br/><br/>I'd never seen a movie like this one before. From the moment the opening titles passed, I could feel my heart rate climbing. Very similar to the book, there is, to quote Stephen King, nearly constant-suspense and a looming sense of dread in every second of every scene. This was one of the few movies that genuinely kept me right on the edge of my seat at all times. There were some changes made to the story when adapting a screenplay, as is par for the course with any screen-adaptation of a book, but they all worked for the overall benefit of the narrative. The casting was next to perfect. After watching the movie, I can only see Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss Everdeen, Liam Hemsworth as Gale Hawthorne, and so on. The combined efforts of facial expressions, body language, and an uncomfortably quiet setting made for a very fast-paced, very entertaining, very frightening, very real feeling plot. The score is iconic where it has to be, anxiety inducing where it has to be, and triumphant where is appropriate. Cinematography wise, this was a knockout. The rapid camera movement and flashes of blood brought the games to another level of scary. The directing was excellent. The editing was excellent. Costumes and makeup were done so unbelievably well. The acting was top-notch.<br/><br/>I was hooked the whole way through, and finishing it felt very rewarding. It's not exactly the same as the book, but it doesn't have to be. If you liked the book, the movie certainly will not disappoint."

EVERYTHING is wrong with this film. Unrealistic and caricaturized dystopia, Mary Sue protagonist, cardboard cutouts for other characters, nothing good ever happens to the characters, it's just the whole melodramatic ""whaaaa life is hell"" trope used all too often in dystopias, the actual Games don't start until halfway through the dadgummed 2 AND A HALF HOUR FILM, the level of violence isn't near as high as it should be to properly convey the sobriety of this subject matter, the filming looks like it was done on someone's iPhone, and the ending was just cheap sequel fodder."

","The chase has been with us as long as celluloid; and this particular storyline dates back at least as far as 'The Most Dangerous Game' eighty years earlier; which clocked in at just 63 minutes. Since then several 'Star Trek' episodes have used the basic situation and a teenaged element had recently been contributed by 'Battle Royale'. The costumes of the affluent seem to have been inspired by Terry Gilliam's 'Brazil' (while Woody Harrelson appears to have have been given a makeover by the same hairdresser and beautician as Klaus Kinski on 'For a Few Dollars More').<br/><br/>Set against an incongruously serene woodland backdrop; the constant use throughout of whip pans and wobbly steadicam photography already looks as dated as the excessive use of zooms during the early seventies now does.

"moniangelessanchez","10","0","0","7 May 2020"," A really good movie
","I really like the movie because it is based on one of my favourite page-turner books written by Suzanne Collins, and it was a best-seller novel.
The Hunger Games it is a science fiction, drama and action movie. The movie is directed by Gary Ross, he is known for writing and directing the fantasy comedy-drama film, Pleasantville (1998).
I think the The Hunger Games plot is fascinating because the story is about a poor society controlled by de government, there are 12 districts and each district choose two persons to fight to entertain the government, the persons that are selected has to fight with others and kill them to survive.
Katniss and Peeta Mellark, the protagonists, were selected by their district but only one can survive, Peeta is in love with Katniss and he wants her to win but she is a really good person.
Katniss Everdeen is a really brave woman that protected her sister and fought for her. That was very moving for me.
I think Oscar Winner Jennifer Lawrence, who has Katniss Everdeen role, is a brilliant protagonist in the movie, in my opinion, her acting is always good.
Also I think Joshua Ryan Hutcherson, who has Peeta Mellark role, has a nice and very cute role in the movie.
I felt very emotive when Katniss sang ""Deep in the Meadow"" for other girl who was murdered in the fight because that girl reminded her of his sister. The song is composed by the British musician, Sting.
I also like the special effects because all of them are really amazing. In the movie is very usual to look the special effects, for example, in the Katniss dress, in the fight when the managers throwing fireballs, the big dog at the end of the movie,etc.
In the movie, there are a variety of nice scenes, the place where Katniss Everdeen lives is actually Henry River Mill Village and it is in North Carolina, also in the movie you can see North Carolina forests and a lot of beatiful places.
The film is long, at over two hours and twenty minutes, but all the time is gripping and exciting.
In my opinion, The Hunger Games is a really thought-provoking movie because we maybe one day can be in a similar situation in our country because of the bad government.
I have enjoyed every time I have seen it, so I really recommend you see The Hunger Games."
"xx-slay-n-xx","7","0","0","30 April 2020"," Visuals Out of Texts: The Beauty of Adapting
","If you wanted to watch a faithful adaptation of a novel for the big screen, then The Hunger Games is a perfect starting point. The film is able to capture not only the main story and important details, but the feeling and aesthetics described in the book. The dialogue, characters and scenes feel like a translation into visual media, without any need for re-imagining or reworking. The novel is what captivated audiences and launched the story to its lofty heights, and so an accurate representation was necessary. Unlike many films in the past in which directors can take many liberties with relatively less popular novels, The Hunger games follows on with the trend of young adult literature, think Harry Potter and Twilight, which is so universally well-known that nothing can be changed without provoking the ire of wanting young audiences. In this regard, The Hunger Games has done its job and given the people what they demanded.<br/><br/>One interesting, but not entirely novel, problem faced with a film adaptation was the first person narrative in the novel. Katniss is the narrator and main character, and much of the exposition happens in her head. The novel is relatively sparse on dialogue for a large chunk of it, but we have Katniss to help guide us through the various newly introduced details. In the film, however, we don't have her inner monologue. Instead, the film opts to have Caeser Flickerman and his co-host act as elucidators during the Games, and the intermittent flash-backs inform us of the backstory for Katniss and Peeta. The film is not over-the-top with its backstory, giving us only the bare minimum of what we need to fill in the blanks. This is okay, because they know that many of those who come to see the movie have already read the book and know the details. However, any new fan coming into the series starting with the films might have their work cut out for them to understand the finer points.<br/><br/>The visual representations are also stunning. On one side we have the districts, garbed in 1940s style clothing as a symbol of living under totalitarianism mimicked from our own often sad world. They are lacking of all luxuries and indulgences. We get a short glimpse of this austere world in Katniss's household and the depressing village she lives in. Then suddenly we are shocked by the image of Effie Trinket, a fluorescent china doll in a gray world. It is like coming out of a dark room and seeing the sun for the first time, it blinds you. The contrast between the people in the Capital and those in the districts could not be any clearer. It is hedonism versus survival. The pastries and parties and petticoats and an insult to the lifetime of struggle faced by the peasantry, and that comes across astutely in the film.<br/><br/>Despite the nearly two and a half hour length, the film still feels as though it were somewhat rushed. The important setup is skimmed over in favor of getting to the Games quicker, but still arrives there at the one hour mark. This is sensible from a marketing perspective, you want the action to take up the majority of the film. It is somewhat of an unsolvable problem. The film must necessarily be the entire plot from start to finish and not broken up into two parts (leave that to the final installment after your audience is already emotionally invested). Yet it still needs to summarize a relatively complex plot with an entirely new world in a short amount of time and satisfyingly display all of the important action. There isn't enough time to flesh out certain things, like Katniss's love triangle, or Haymitch's true character, but the film does as best as it can. In this regard, it gets a passing grade.<br/><br/>Another limiting factor is the desire to make the film available to all audiences, that is to say, to tone down the violence and allow for a PG rating. This story is another unfortunate casualty of the MPAA and the need for as wide a reach as possible. What is this story about, really? It's about teens tearing each other apart in bloody gladiatorial conquest. It is violence to the umpteenth degree. If ever there was a film that deserves as much blood and gore as possible, this is it. This is not the fault of the filmmakers, they did their due diligence in trying to show as much as possible. This is more of a ""disgruntled critic shaking his fist as the system"" type of situation.<br/><br/>The film is not perfect by any stretch, as it comes from a rather imperfect book. The novel did not reach its zenith on the back of Collins' stupendous ability to create lifelike characters. Nor was it on her convincing ability to make a romantic subplot. These faltering details are present in the film too, though somewhat compensated by the acting abilities of Jennifer Lawrence and Woody Harrelson, among others. The story is amazing because of its premise. It is a collectathon mixed with a battle royale with an intriguing political subplot of fascism and cultural revolution. It feels like something that can inspire us and give us refuge from our own world. Despite its fantastical elements, it feels like something you could place yourself into, and it almost makes you wish you could be there to see if you could survive.<br/><br/>Where this film succeeds is in its ability to take an already successful and interesting novel and put it into visual terms that everyone can enjoy. Where it fails is paradoxically in the same way, where it was too true to the book when it could have improved or reinterpreted. Dialogue that works in text doesn't always feel lifelike coming from a real person, nor does an exciting action sequence look as exciting on screen. That being said, The Hunger Games should not be overlooked in the ever-growing genre of teen-fantasy novel adaptations. It is not a masterpiece or a hidden gem, but it is fun and worthwhile. Not everyone can be Peter Jackson and create something as monumental and consistently lauded as The Lord of the Rings trilogy, but we can hope not to go too far and become The Hobbit. Settling for a solid middle grounds of Harry Potter is a pretty good place to be."

","I am not a fan way out there sci-fi stories with fictionalised cars and planes etc...I like to keep my films close to reality. However despite this I like this film very much. The lead actress carries the whole film and indeed the whole series of films, she is excellent. The story-line is fictional, however the main theory about a big elite power group is now emerging, so the basic lline of the film is well worth consideration for future generations. One of my main gripes is the character of Gale Hawthorne. The actor who plays him cannot act to save his life, his character is completely anachronistic and his character development is absolutely ludicrous, from poor, simple coalface miner to some kind of crack top elite forces leader of troops is so unreal and utterly unbelieveable. The character is so out of place it is as though someone else wrote his script and dropped his character in from afar.

","I'm honestly very impressed! At first, I was a bit scared, thinking it might be too violent and filled with profanity. This is the OPPOSITE of that. This and the other movies are excellent.<br/><br/>Firstly, I love how well Jennifer Lawrence portrayed Katniss. She truly displayed Katniss's love for hunting and her skill at it. She also showed true fear when Prim (Willow Shields) was reaped for the Hunger Games.<br/><br/>Next, after the interviews by Caesar Flickerman (Stanley Tucci), I loved how Katniss really put forth her anger towards Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) after he told the audience that he had a crush on Katniss for most of his life.<br/><br/>I was absolutely in tears when I saw the scene where Rue died. Katniss was very upset, and that emotion was very realistic. I also love how she sacrificed so much to keep Peeta alive after she found him.<br/><br/>Some of the more sweeter scenes were the ones with Katniss and Peeta. When Katniss first found a cave for them to settle in, the scenes following that were the most peaceful. There was a scene when Peeta wanted Katniss's comfort. That was sweet when they simply just cuddled for warmth so Haymitch (Woody Harrelson) would find more sponsors and send them food and medicine. It was also nice when Katniss lies to Peeta about not going to the feast so he could be calm.<br/><br/>At the feast, I also liked how Thresh saved Katniss for her alliance with Rue.<br/><br/>When Katniss and Peeta were scavenging for food, I liked how Katniss was genuinely scared when she heard the cannon, thinking it was Peeta. She ran over and gave him a meaningful hug. That was very sweet.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie was AWESOME. They don't mention Katniss's prep team, Delly Cartwright, nor the mayor's family though. They don't mention Peeta's stylist, Portia, either.<br/><br/>Guide: For ages 12 and over. Only profanity mentioned: ""damn"" twice and ""hell"" once.

"mattheweverlewis","9","0","0","14 December 2018"," Is America's Reconstruction Different from Panem's?
","The Hunger Games by Gary Ross is a dystopian young adult novel about 16-year-old female protagonist Katniss Everdeen who represents her district in a battle for her life. The Capital of the nation of Panem forces each of its twelve districts to send a teenage boy and girl to compete in the Hunger Games, a cruel punishment for a past rebellion. The Hunger Games is a nationally televised event in which ""Tributes"" must fight with one another until one survivor remains and wins food for a year for their district. The Hunger Games, although fictional, has strong connections with the real world. Although the movie presents a post-rebellion dystopian world, in which viewers can see connections to the American Reconstruction, the movie does not develop the character's backstory as much as it could have.<br/><br/>The Hunger Games movie is similar to America's Reconstruction period, which was after the Civil War. After the union won the war, America went into a period of turmoil. This is similar to The Hunger Games because, after the rebellion, Panem went into a tumultuous period due to their continuous uprisings. The president decided to have the Hunger Games to remind the districts of what they did in their past. Also, while America was going through Reconstruction, Grant and Hayes created an unintentional class system, and similarly, that was what Panem was doing with The Hunger Games and their idea of Districts.
Most countries are willing to join together to fight a common foe. In the sense of The Hunger Games district, 3 through 12 all fought together against the Capital, District 1, and 2 in the rebellion. Proving that people rich or poor come together to achieve a common goal. In American History, in WWII U.S.A. France, U.K., and Russia, the Allied powers, all came together to fight against Germany, Italy, and Japan, the Axis powers, due to the common goal they wanted to defeat their enemy. All of the countries worked as a single unit against others focused on their advantages.<br/><br/>While Ross does transform the book into a movie, he does not develop some part of the movie. Taking .4 off of the rating is because of how Ross had the characters killed. The characters had an immense amount of screen time before entering the arena and little in the arena. When watching the movie, Rue is showed to be shy, and in the arena is killed. Although Katniss does give Rue a 'proper burial,'Rue could have used more time connecting with Katniss before they entered the arena.
The Capital was willing to tear down their country for their benefits, which is inhumane. It is unfathomable to see what types of terrorizing laws governments could create. The power of working as a unit is much stronger than individuals trying to achieve righteousness for themselves.

The movie The Hunger Games, how far is the sci-fi story from reality?

There are 12 districts and the lower the number, the more safe and wealthy it is. The capital, the highest power created ""The Hunger Games."" They created The Hunger Games to prevent the districts from rebelling against them. Every year, two young people, one boy, and one girl are selected from each of the 12 districts during ""the reaping."" The story lines main character Katniss Everdeen takes us through an anxious journey thought he 75th annual hunger games. This film presents alternative perspectives on how to keep peace and the emotion of death. The social class system is often a divide in the human race; The Hunger Games is a strong representation of what could happen if the social class system is taken too far.
The Hunger Games movie comes from a series of books written with immense detail by Suzanne Collins. The books were later produced into the film due to the popularity of the books. The movie includes extensive detail like the original novel. Since this movie has so much detail, the viewer may find themselves lost if they miss parts of the film or drift off into space. Due to The storyline being packed with so much detail the movie can feel extremely realistic times. Though the realism is distracting, what is keeping everyday society from reaching this point in time with rebellion, class-divided districts, and the murder of young innocent people for entertainment, and punishment in a way; from happening today? Some may see The Hunger Games as a simple movie, but there's actual meaning behind it. Collins is trying to show what the world can come to if humanity falls under the pressure of the class system, and thinking that one is better than another due to their economic status or social status. But the thought of all man was created equal is what is keeping the pressure of the social class system from taking over as it did in The Hunger Games.
The Hunger Games truly shows The horror of the class system and how it could change humanity. Katniss brings the viewer through the journey of what it's like to be in the poorest district, and how being the lowest class is shoved in her face all the time. The movie is full of vivid detail that represents the human races class system and how its hard for one to escape. I would rate this book a four out of five because of its vivid detail."

","The movie The Hunger Games may be the best movie ever made. The film is set in a post-apocalyptic North America, where the citizens are separated into districts based on economic status. To keep each district from rebelling against the people in a higher power, the Hunger Games, a fight to the death between randomly chosen individuals from each district, is held every year. The storyline follows the main character, Katniss Everdeen, throughout her nail-biting experience in the 75th annual Hunger Games. The film gives an alternative perspective on war. The Hunger Games is a movie that engages and transports the audience into the fictional world.
The Hunger Games was originally a book written by Suzanne Collins, but due to its popularity, made into a movie directed by Gary Ross. Throughout the film, it takes the details from the novel and displays that in the sets. The backgrounds perfectly portrayed the poverty of district twelve to the wealth of district one. More importantly, even though the characters are in different situations as much of the audience, such as participating in the Hunger Games, the audience is still able to connect to cast. The movie is very much like the book, but instead of imagining what this world looks like, the viewer is automatically inside of it. On the other hand, at times the film is difficult to follow if the individual is not paying full attention because minor details help piece the plot together.
The film forces the viewer not only to feel Katniss' emotions but what it would be like to partake in the Games. The Hunger Games is a movie made to take the audience out of any existing comfort zone and show an alternative perspective on the future of the Earth. However, due to the mature themes and violence, the movie should be recommended to people over the age of 13. The Hunger Games should be given 5/5 stars because, despite the outlandish idea, the movie still manages to relate to the audience through the well thought out characters and the relationships built during the plot. The Hunger Games series, while at times confusing, will open one's eyes up to a new version of the world and better movies."

However, this movie is based on the book version, written by Suzanne Collins. With the majority of people loving the movie (84 rotten tomatoes), there are still some others who hate it ""WORST MOVIE EVER. IT's TOO LONG(Drew McWeeny)"". Here are some reasons why viewers would love The Hunger Games.
In the movie, The Hunger Games, there are a lot of reasons why viewers love this movie. The first reason why viewers would watch this movie is that of the cover. Since most of the heroes in movies are mainly male, people were in love when they saw a woman on the cover. After watching the movie, viewers would love to watch the next film or even the same one because of the amount of detail the movie gave the viewers about each character, and how much the people got to know the characters individually to find out how relatable they are to people today. Another reason why the viewers would watch the second movie is that of how action-packed the film is. At one point of the movie, there are fight scenes, and then the next is a romantic scene. ""This movie is really for everyone. They added a bit of everyone's taste(Katie Lees)"".
Even though The Hunger Games may seem like the best movie ever created, some of the viewers hated it ""I came into the theater thinking it was going to be the best film. However, it was not! (Savannah Macbeth)."" Reasons, why people wouldn't like to watch this movie ever again, is because it is over 2 hours. Since people today are so busy, no one has the time to watch a 2+ hour movie, and if it is above 2 hours, it's normally going to get the audience bored. Another reason why people hate this movie is because ""This movie places us a post-apocalyptic world, though is no sign of how the end came and no trace of toxic aftermath(David Thomas)."" To put that into words, viewers do not like this movie because it makes no sense whatsoever, and the setting is off.
In conclusion, The Hunger Games is a great movie to watch if you love action-packed films and love a movie that will keep you on your feet. However, if you have children under the age of thirteen, watch movies way too seriously, and have no time on your hands, this movie is not for you."

","The Hunger Games, directed by Gary Ross, is a 2012 action, thriller film about the ideas of social status, entertainment, and enslavement. This movie is given a 4.7/5 star rating because it deals with scary topics and it this also makes it very enticing. A girl named Katniss lives in district 12 with her mom and sister. All of the districts are extremely poor and have little food, except for the Capitol which is where the Hunger Games is shown on television. This makes it hard for Katniss to obtain food for her family, and when placed in a dire situation she risks her life for that of her sister's and the better for her community. The Hunger Games is a 4.7/5 star movie because of the ideas of social class and status, the maybe too harsh concept of enslavement of districts, and the entertainment of the rich.<br/><br/>Social class is one of the most significant issues that Katniss faces which gives viewers an inside look at her struggles to provide for her family. Katniss lives in one of the poorest districts that make money only on farming. All she has is her sister whom she loves dearly. When her sister is chosen to fight in the annual contest, the Hunger Games, Katniss takes her spot. The Capitol has everything that could ever be wanted while the districts are impoverished. The prize for the winner of the Hunger Games is free food for their district for a year. The people in the Capitol do not have any struggles, and they watch the Games as entertainment even though many people die. This is why Katniss takes her sisters spot when she is picked to participate. This is one of the main turning points that brought down the review because it is slightly confusing as to why her sister was chosen. The movie indeed portrays the difficulties for this teenager trying to move up in social class and provide for her family, all while trying to stay alive, and this is one of the more advanced topics that need to be handled carefully.<br/><br/>All of the districts are enslaved in some way and do not make much money if any at all. The Capital is where all of the money is, and that is why Katniss must fight to gain fame and fortune for her district. There are even guards in some districts. Near the end, Katniss does something that upsets the President, and this provokes even more rebellion in the districts. Some of the districts that aren't as close to the Capitol have more freedom and property. This also creates rebellion which moves the storyline forward. The enslavement of the people in the districts continues to grow when the viewers are told that the more laws that are broken, the more that name goes into the bowl that determines what two people are inserted into the Hunger Games. All of the enslavement and torture of the people in, and out, of the Games is all just for the Capitols entertainment which shows how terrible the situations are for the people in the districts and this is one of the very mature topics that could prove difficult to some.<br/><br/>The people of the Capitol are rich, and they want the Hunger Games to happen because they are entertained. It is like a giant television series where people die. They enjoy it because they never have to experience any struggles themselves. This makes Katniss, and the other participants, struggle to hold back and not yell and scream about their struggles. The participants gain more help in the games if more people like them because they can give them money, which is why the contestants must win over the people of the Capitol. Viewers also see that the Capitol controls the arena and can kill anyone they want at will. This adds even more suspense to this already thrilling movie. The fact that all of this ruthless killing is just for people's enjoyment frustrates the viewer and provides for a suspenseful and thrilling watch which is why it has such a high rating.<br/><br/>Viewers see inside the life of a teen girl, and her society, struggling with, social class and status, enslavement of districts, and entertainment of the rich in the thrilling movie, The Hunger Games. Katniss is thrown into this horrible situation of imminent death all because of her social status and need for a better life which gives the storyline a captivating beginning and end. Each district is enslaved with the knowledge that the Capitol has everything they could ever want and this leads to rebellion and a plot twist in the story. The people of the Capitol enjoy this ruthless killing of others just for their entertainment, and this is why there is conflict in the first place. The Hunger Games would be enjoyed by viewers who love to delve deep into a storyline, and who enjoy thrill and suspense, but it does handle some deep topics that could prove scary, and difficult, for some to comprehend. This movie is one of the best that dives deep into a story and leaves viewers begging for more.<br/><br/>Rating: 4.7/5"

","The Hunger Games; A Blood Bath
Review of The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins
(Lilly Berry)
The Hunger Games, written by Susan Collins, and turned into a movie in 2012, is about a Dystonia society in which every year there is an Annual Hunger Games. Two people are chosen from each district (1-12) adding up to a total of 24 people. The tributes are then taken to the Capital where the richer citizens live. They are then trained to fight and survive in a given arena. Then, they are put into a random arena and are forced to fight to the death resulting in one victor.<br/><br/>This movie, made in 2012 was wildly anticipated and well-liked across the world. Throughout this book, the perspectives change vividly. At first, Katniss talks about her life with her family in district 12, and how she then volunteers for her sister in the annual hunger games. Then, the focus shifts to Peeta who is the boy tribute in district 12. Then, once they get into the capital, the focus shifts to a past victor, now mentor who does not support the district 12 volunteers quite as much as he should.<br/><br/>As the movie progresses, the rich Capital citizens start to support Katniss and Peeta, therefore sending them ""aid"" while in the games. The aid in the movie is when people support a certain tribute, they send them something to help them survive. Soon, Peeta and Katniss become the only two tributes left and they are faced with a difficult decision; Do they fight each other to the death, or kill themselves together. Alumantly, they choose to kill themselves with poisonous berries which had killed another tribute. The Capital then claims that both are victorious thus sparing them.
The Hunger Games is a very well filmed, and heart wrenching movie. The movie has many great symbols and references to the book. People who have watched this movie are torn between loving and hating the movie but, I feel that it is an amazing movie that everyone should see. Therefore I give this book a 5 out of 5.
Rating: 5/5"

","The Hunger Games, a dystopian action/adventure film by Suzanne Collins, is about a girl's fight to survive the government's death games. The protagonist, a teenage girl named Katniss who struggles in part poor of the society with a wealthy government, must survive a pawn game that the wealthy government of ""Panem"" forced onto the districts of the society. While in the middle of fighting, destruction, she realizes the only thing that will allow her to survive the senselessness, is love. The Hunger Games is a cinematic, action-packed, engaging movie with many hidden love stories.<br/><br/>The Hunger Games were created by the Capitol to show the people of Panem who was really in charge and to stop the rebellion. The 12 districts surrounding the capitol of Panem were not only living in poor conditions with no aid, but also were required to send people to participate in the games. A boy and a girl from each district compete to the death, and if two people didn't volunteer, they would pick randomly. On the day of the choosing, the person who pulled the tributes, Effie, choose Prim (Katniss's little sister). To save her innocent sister from the games, Katniss volunteers not thinking about her life at stake.<br/><br/>The other tribute was Peeta, a boy who loved Katniss but wasn't loved back, who spent the pre-games helping Katniss. During the games, Peeta joined the powerful group of fighters to survive; while Katniss remained the targeted loner. Throughout the Hunger Games, she used her hunting skills to survive and lasted a long time before meeting up with Peeta again. They realized the only way to survive and to get the capitol's support is to fake their love and care for each other; through fan support this later caused the capitol to make a rule saying if both tributes from the same district survived, there could be two winners. While Peeta was her fake love, there was also a connection between Gayle (Katniss's close friend from district 12 that would do anything for her) and Katniss, which made the movie have multiple love stories woven into it. In the end, they worked together to survive and to defend themselves from the strongest tributes, until it was only them left. But the capitol, sly and untrusting, changed back to the old rules and forced the ""lovers"" to fight themselves to the death. Instead, they were just going to poison themselves at the same time; if they both can't win then there is no point in both of them living. The capitol stopped the madness before it happens in fear of how the citizens will react.<br/><br/>The movie was very cinematic and thought-through; there didn't need to be a lot of dialogue but scenes of the society and the actor's actions. There was also plenty of fight scenes and action for viewers that a thrilling action movie. It was so engaging and left you on the edge of your seat because each character had a strong desire and will to live. But what I think made the movie so appealing was the government's part, it seemed like it was related to the reconstruction time in our country after the civil war and showed different people oppressed by different things. The government oppressed the districts and did no like to spread hope and rebellion.
Even within the capital, it restricted the citizen's knowledge and understanding of how the other districts lived. The movie seemed to have multiple messages that made it so relatable and inspiring.<br/><br/>The Hunger Games, while slightly brushing up on hidden love stories, is engaging, cinematic and action-packed. I recommend it, just by its ability to capture the audience's perspective and emotions to be empathetic for the storyline. It can be fantasy, love story and historical fiction, which makes it so appealing to different types of audiences."

","The movie starts with kids from throughout the country being tallied up and sent to a location to try to kill each other. The Hunger Games are on live TV, like a real life ""Survivor."" Only one of the 24 teens (two from each of the 12 districts) can survive.
In the poorest, Appalachian-like district, teen Katniss is growing up modestly when her little sister gets chosen at random to be in the annual Hunger Games. Katniss then volunteers to take her sister's place and heads to the Capitol city as a heavy underdog. However, She grew up in the kind of wilderness where the Games take place, and she is handy with a bow and arrow.
As for the plot, the movie has problems: A big development happens because of coincidence (overhears an entirely private conversation), there's an unlikely alliance, an attacker makes the mistake of giving a lengthy speech before finishing off a victim, and the villains are not impressive.
Fans of the book will be angered by the lack of development of secondary characters. (I was more annoyed that the primary characters do not come into focus either, despite the long running time.)
Just like the Harry Potter movies, however, this one is just a sellout, like most movie series nowadays.<br/><br/>Rating: 3.6/5"

","In what used to be North America, the Capitol, Panem is divided into 12 Districts, who are all responsible for different jobs. Every year, to assert their dominance, the Capitol requires each district to send a boy and a girl to fight to the death. These people sent are called tributes. During these games, all the tributes go in with only one victor to emerge at the end. The movie is set around District 12, the Seam responsible for all the coal making. The 2 tributes Peeta and Katniss begin preparing with their mentor Haymitch, the notorious town drunk. Peeta portrayed by Josh Hutcherson is an experienced baker and helps his father in the bakery living a well-fed life, and Katniss portrayed by Jennifer Lawrence has to hunt whatever she can get to keep her family fed and alive. They find themselves keeping up a romantic act to remain alive and gain sponsors, or so it seems to be an act, in reality, Peeta has developed feelings for Katniss going back to when they first met, on the other hand, Katniss is forced to choose between survival and love.<br/><br/>The movie is overall a very well made film and a great group of actors but leaves many gaps. Throughout the movie I find myself confused with what happened an some of the background information that they neglected to mention in the film. The romance side of Peeta Mellark and Katniss Everdeen is very undersold. They touch little on some of the more emotional scenes such as Rue's death. The Hunger Games is a very exciting and entertaining film and overall covers a lot of ground from the book, the movie sets up a great platform for the movies to come."

","The Hunger Games, directed by Gary Ross, is an extremely popular Academy-Award-Winner motion picture about a poor woman named Katniss who lives with her sister. The Hunger Games is a nationally televised event that forces twelve districts to choose one boy and one girl to compete and fight to their death for the prize of living in a mansion and getting free food for you and your family for one year. Katniss is one of the tributes. She has to rely on her hunting skills and sharp instincts to survive and choose survival against love.<br/><br/>If you love adventure, romance, action, and suspense, The Hunger Games is a movie for you. It is a well thought out unique storyline and keeps you waiting for the next scene. The acting is amazing and very real. They make you feel like you are apart of the movie. The Hunger Games is a movie for any type of audience. Preferably, girls might be more interested in the movie because they can relate to Katniss much more.<br/><br/>One of the negative points about The Hunger Games is that it is not an original movie. The Running Man, another popular motion picture starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, is the same storyline instead the main character is a male instead of female. If the storyline was more original, the movie would be more likable. Also, the movie is very predictable and you could guess what was going to happen at the end. The rising action is also very weak. The Hunger Games has some weak points and strong points throughout the movie. The movie is very bland and does not seem to stand out from any other movies.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie is decent. It has a balance of great points that stand out and also some weak points that need to be changed. There has been a mix of bad and good reviews. Instead of judging the movie from other people's opinions, everyone should watch The Hunger Games and get their own perspective on the movie."
"MovieManChuck","Null","0","0","24 July 2018"," It's a good book-adaption with a great female lead.
","3/4<br/><br/>After reading The Hunger Games books, I immeadiately HAD to watch the movies. I knew the odds were in their favor in a subjective sense. While I can't say I liked either the book or the movie better, I'd say the book tells the story in a more complete and emotional manor, while the movie makes the same story more accessible. (The Hunger Games movies pay homage to their source material, unlike some other re-makes).<br/><br/>The 12 districts of Panem, who are under a dictatorship that requires a teenaged boy and girl from each district every year. The selected people are put into an arena where they will fight to the death on live TV. The story centers around Katniss Everdeen, (Jennifer Lawrence) who volunteers for the games in her sister's place. Jennifer Lawrence gives a great Everdeen, and Josh Hutcherson gives a great Peet's, but most of the non-leads (with some exceptions) felt lacking. Example: when a certain highly likable character is killed, it fails to wrench your guts.<br/><br/>If I had to pick one thing I was very disappointed about in this film, it would definitely be the CGI. Some of the action (ESPECIALLY a certain scene toward the end of the film....no spoilers) looks incredibly fake to the point where you aren't in the movie anymore. While it's definitely no Battlefield Earth in terms of poor CGI, it should be kicked up a notch considering the high demand for this movie.<br/><br/>Despite some flaws, this movie is probably my favorite ""YA"" movie (if not one of it's sequels) and one definitely worth a watch. It takes great care to give you the same experience you had when yo read the novel, and it's a ton of fun as well."
"johnnyboyz","6","0","0","5 January 2018"," Workable action film, which burns its way to some involving content involving characters we like and social commentary
","What I admired most about ""The Hunger Games"" was how it managed to resist the temptation to leap into the second unit material straight away - a misstep so many films of this genre, especially those geared towards the same demographics as this one is, have done so. Instead, ""The Hunger Games"" earns the right to 'go there', so to speak - taking its time to establish character and situation. What I also appreciated was its subtext to do with violence and entertainment; de-sensitisation and trivialisation, and more broadly how governments are able to utilise such things to control populations. <br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence plays the rather conspicuously named Katniss Everdeen, a young woman living somewhere in a North America which has gone to the dogs through war and now suffers life under a totalitarian regime in the far-future. Where she lives, the equally conspicuously named Panem, possesses in its constitution a highly questionable law which dictates that, every year, one male and one female between the ages of 12 and 19 from each of the country's dozen or so districts must face off to the bloody death in a large gamezone carved out of the forests in what are the eponymous 'hunger games'. <br/><br/>The reasons for this brutal regulation pertain to the dictatorial government wanting to keep up the traditions of honour and willpower synonymous with its national identity, but these days everybody largely agrees it is down to the sheer fact that said contest makes for damn good television. Questions pertaining to how old the nation is and what they did before television was invented are not answered... <br/><br/>As a character, Everdeen is nobody special - nobody in Panem is, because the grip the rulers have on the country keeps anybody from broadening out too far into becoming anything at all. She maintains her friendships; lives in her rudimentary village; takes care of her younger sister and spends enough time fooling around with a bow and arrow to become a bit of a crack-shot. Will the skill come to benefit her later on in the tale? <br/><br/>Disaster strikes when, through reasons I will leave unspoilt, Everdeen winds up appearing in the yearly contest having been selected as the female to represent her district. This plunges Lawrence's character into a whole new world of colour; energy and fame, not to mention life-threatening danger on account of having to do battle with a motley group of compatriots from the other districts which range from robust, muscular black males on the very brink of being too old to compete to mousey younger girls too young to possess any real clue as to what is even happening. <br/><br/>""The Hunger Games"" is not an especially exhilarating character piece, but it does do the basics required of both the action and horror (and, in part, romance) genres especially well. The film is an energetic post-modern fusion of all sorts of things ranging from ""Predator"" to ""TRON"" by way of the 2000 Japanese film, to which it seems to owe its greatest debt, ""Battle Royale"". <br/><br/>It allows its premise and the sheer scope afforded to it in terms of whatever content it might possess to make a scathing attack on modern American (even Western) free-market consumer entertainment. This is unsubtly presented to us for the first time quite early on when one character quips about the contest that ""...if no one watched (on TV), they (the government) wouldn't do it"", eventually becoming a film depicting a society with a violent, deranged spectacle at the very core of its identity. <br/><br/>Indeed, while nothing in the world (that we know of) can quite match the barbarity of what Gary Ross' film depicts here, we should be aware by now that WWE is adored by millions; heavyweight championship boxing matches can make billionaires out of its participants in one evening and that some of the highest grossing films of all time are action (or violence) packed blockbusters. <br/><br/>This begs the question: how do WE - the film-going audience - react to the violent action when it finally starts? Are we entertained? Do we fall into the trap of rooting for a character because we want them to succeed? Is it not too often the case that the target audience for the film roll from multiplex screening to multiplex screening absorbing the latest actioner? <br/><br/>By the time the ""Games"" themselves have begun, the film has earned the right to take us to where we go. To complain that they are episodic, and that the set-pieces & killings might happen in any order, seems silly, but the best action films have always had a sense of grace and timing to their second unit sequences as events unfold around their characters: ""Terminator2"" and ""Jurassic Park"" might be two good examples from recent history. <br/><br/>The screenplay possesses very little of any terrific profundity, while the lead's taking in under her wing of a fellow female contestant far too young to survive on her own merely proves what we already knew: she is a good older sister - a more affecting arc may have been to establish her earlier as a bully to her sibling and have her return much kinder. Irrespective, there is enough in ""The Hunger Games"" to get stuck into and enjoy."

","'THE HUNGER GAMES' was directed by Gary Ross and stars Jennifer Lawrence, Josh Hutcherson and Woody Harrelson. ​Due to an uprising nearly 75 years ago, an annual tournament called 'The Hunger Games' is held once a year in the not to distance future. Each one of the 12 districts that rebelled against the capital must nominate one male tribute and one female tribute to compete in a battle to the death. On the reaping of the 74th Hunger Games, Katniss Everdeen(Jennifer Lawrence)'s sister(Willow Shields)'s name is pulled out of the reaping glass. To stop this, Katniss volunteers in her place and must fight against the other 23 tributes to get back home.<br/><br/>I think this movie was made primarily for the fans of the series(like me) and not for newcomers. I recommend you watch this movie but I recommend you read the books first. If you hate reading, I cannot blame you but screw you. This movie is fine but the book is far superior. Nothing in this movie is particularly impressive but everything leans more on the positive side. It's a mildly entertaining movie that I probably only like because I really like the books. I'll say you can watch this movie and get entertainment out of it but you don't NEED to. <br/><br/>If you'd rather watch the movies before you read the books, I don't envy you but I can understand were you're coming from. If you watch the film first, you will probably be a little bit confused because they don't explain things the best and leave a few things out but I imagine you'll be able to understand eventually. The story is completely fine and passable but it is kept afloat by it's awesome premise. Again, the story is better done in the books but I can understand you not reading the books because you shouldn't have to. Thus, I will not say that I have issues with the story(because I get it) but I can understand non-fans not enjoying it.<br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence is more wooden than a tree in this movie but I can understand that she was perfect for the role because the character being pretty wooden as well. To be fair to Lawrence, she does express genuine seeming emotion at points in the movie and I can't say she's terrible as Katniss but I think some more emoting would have helped. John Hutcherson displayed worse acting in this movie than Mel Gibson did in his Anti-Semetism apology. I hated him in this movie and I can't really explain why. I just don't like him. I like the character of Peeta, but not Hutcherson's performance. Woody Harrelson's performance as Haymitch Abernathy was the best part of the movie. He was great and I just wish he was in the book longer. Elizabeth Banks was off the wall as Effie Trinket which isn't surprising considering she supported Clinton(points! and I can say that because I'm not American). The remaining performances were mediocre(Liam Hemsworth) to barbaric(Lenny Kravitz) with some impressive exceptions(Stanley Tucci).<br/><br/>A lot of hate was thrown Ross' way for the cinematography for this movie and while I understand the need for tripods, I feel that the style he was going for was the documentary style which fits more in line with the first person perspective of the books. That's probably just my opinion and I completely understand why someone would hate it but I personally didn't mind it. This movie was released in 2012 but the effects were finished in 1875, or whenever George Lucas began his CGI fetish. The effects in this movie are barbaric and it's disgusting they were even allowed. The set design is also extremely bland and generic in this movie. I wanted to feel the awe and wonder Katniss felt when she first visited the capitol but instead I was vastly let down.<br/><br/>The action in this movie is okay but could have been much better. The world building is fine but was done much better in the books. This movie is a perfectly disposable dystopian action/romance movie which I can recommend you watch but it's not something you NEED to watch. I'll rate it 6 out of 10 PEETAS!!!"
"andyonabike","Null","0","0","16 May 2016"," A History Lesson
","The basic premise of this movie is that a decadent society, supremely ruled by one man, forces two children from each exploited and harshly controlled district to battle to the death in an arena for the entertainment of the rich and privileged capitol residents. They battle in an arena where animals and other environmental/climatic conditions can be altered to ensure the action is continuous and dramatic.<br/><br/>The movie itself is well made. The acting performances are good and the visual effects and music are excellent. I haven't read the books but movie adaptations rarely match the standards of books so I'm sure this would be true in this case.<br/><br/>So what is the history lesson embedded in this film? If you think that this society could never exist think again. It has, or at least it did exist about 2000 years ago.<br/><br/>The ROMAN EMPIRE had many similarities to the society depicted in the hunger games.<br/><br/>A gloriously rich and decadent capitol, Rome - Check. A supreme leader or Caesar - Check. A rich upper class of citizens in Rome - Check. Outlying settlements exploited for their resources and brutally controlled - Check. Poor exploited workers in those outlying settlements - Check. Gladiators forced to battle to the death for the entertainment of Rome's elite - Check. Brutal weapons used to make each death particularly dramatic and gory - Check. An arena or Coliseum where the battles take place - Check. Lions on chains to introduce other hazardous and dramatic twists to the action - Check.<br/><br/>Perhaps this movie could be used in the school history curriculum."

","The film does a great job at making good look good and evil look evil. It seems like today's media really likes to make bad look good. But in The Hunger Games they make it very clear that the actions are wrong. This isn't a film where you're in your seat cheering at the fact that someone has died. Even though in the film there is a group of kids who would be considered ""the bad guys"" and eventually they are all killed, you're still heartbroken at the fact that they were even put into this situation. In some scenes they show the faces of parents and the effect it's having on them that their kids are being killed, which brings the audience back to the realization that the whole situation is very messed up. It shows that it is very obvious that the only reason these kids are killing each other is solely because of the government, they have no other choice."
"Karin_Reimertz","6","0","0","8 December 2015"," Misses out on the most dire subject and becomes its originals opposite
","To sum things easily up, let me say that I was positively surprised by the books while the movie did fulfill my what I was afraid of – making something violent something easygoing. Therefor the movie becomes the very opposite of its original, making violence and killing entertainment which is exactly what the books wants us to question. <br/><br/>My biggest concern with the movie– as other reviewers also have pointed out – is that the Hunger Games seem to be some kind of ""happy camp gone bad"". The careers run around killing with laughter while the underdogs shiver in the bushes. The books much better describes how the games where really games of hunger and thirst and cold. How all tributes struggled against famine and how killing became the only way to get yourself a chance of getting out of the arena and back to where you could drink, eat and not be so cold any longer. As the struggle for pure survival is lost in the movie, all that remains is the killing. <br/><br/>Apart (if you can look apart from this) the movie is very true to its original with very few alterations. Most of the important scenes are there. But here comes my second concern – missing most important scenes are Peeta. In the books he's good through the heart from the beginning, making both Katniss and the reader question him, but very soon realizing that yes, he IS that pure. In the movie he seems rather ignorant in the beginning and you never get that warmth from him. You just don't like him! (And the stylist who was in charge of dying Josh Hutcherson's hair should look for another job. I couldn't help thinking that Peeta looks like he escaped from a 90's boy-band and not from the poor district 12.)<br/><br/>Overall, the whole movie has been given a light touch of a Hollywood- filter. Everything and everyone, has been made a bit lighter, easier, more friendly and more lovable. I guess it's something that feels needed today to make sure the movie becomes a blockbuster. A movie as dark and critical as the book might not have gotten as big audience (but may have raised a more important discussion). <br/><br/>This is a good movie, but don't expect it to be something that makes you stop and question what's going on in the world. It won't last in your thoughts too long. It will be like any other good movie, nothing more, nothing less. But – if you want to get something more, something bigger and something more important – do read the books as well."

","Once a year, 12 districts each have to supply a boy and a girl aged between 12 and 18 to take part in the Hunger Games, a televised trial where the 24 young people have to kill each other so that just one survives. 17 year old Katniss Everdine volunteers for District 12 after her 12 year old (and woefully un-survival oriented) sister is picked. Katniss is a successful hunter/archer and at least stands a chance. The first part of the film details Katniss' background, the selection and preparations, and the second part deals with the Games themselves.<br/><br/>This adaptation of the first book in a trilogy (which I haven't read) is a film which I expected to be good: it was better. It portrays a world similar to the familiar, but different enough that the changes keep you interested. There is no explanation, but you pick up background information as the story unfolds. The science fiction aspect is good, the action is good and, best of all, there is a lot of brain food in the film. It is not just eye candy and action: it makes you think.<br/><br/>If I have a criticism, it is that I thought it could have done with the killings when the games start being rather bloodier than they were: I thought this would have pointed up the brutal nature of the Games, whereas I felt the deaths actually felt rather gentle. However, given the ""young adult"" demographic which the books (and film) are aimed at, I can understand dialling back the violence.<br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence was terrific again.<br/><br/>This film ticked all my boxes and I recommend it highly."

I felt it captured the tone of the book beautifully. Jennifer Lawrence killed the role of Katniss and deserves to be recognized by the awards next year. The acting was great, they pulled off the tone greatly, and I just loved it. It is a slow burner and that may irritate people but, so was the book. My only real issue was they didn't develop the love story between Katniss and Peeta well. In the book you can clearly see Katniss' feelings towards Peeta grow from disliking him to falling in love with him. In the movie it sort of just happens. I thought the movie breezed right by.

","I'd read a couple of professional reviews, thought I knew what to expect. I was wrong. One reviewer thought the motion camera was overdone. In the beginning it did seem as if it might go that way, but quickly it calms down and you forget about it. Another reviewer thought a couple of the characters needed some of their back story told as in the book, but I didn't read the book and didn't miss it at all.<br/><br/>What I noticed first was how gripping it all quickly became. I think the director and his screenwriters did a wonderful job. It felt as if the essence of some very compelling book was being conveyed. And that actually was what I thought about second, that I am now extremely curious to know more about the book's author, Suzanne Collins. This film gives no indication it was written by some wishy washy woman without a clue about real combat. There's been some real thought given to what might have happened in real life though her real gift to her readers is her keen understanding of the way leaders manipulate.<br/><br/>But the real driving force behind this movie is divided between the writing and the lead, the mega-impressive Jennifer Lawrence. I remember seeing her in 'Winter's Bone' another film set in hill country and thinking I'd like to see more of her. Boy, was I right. Spending the time of this movie with her is a true joy. But her real trick is, I still want more! Something about watching her is very rewarding. I'm at a complete loss as to what exactly except that I kept thinking I know exactly what she's thinking and feeling. That's very rare, especially for such a young actress, I think, to be able to reach an old guy like me so clearly and effortlessly.<br/><br/>Of the rest I'd give special attention to Woody Harrelson who is spot on and Donald Sutherland who seems to know about leadership for real. I've no idea where this trilogy is going but I do know I want to see it as it seems millions of others do. I saw this at a matinée in a smallish town and it was packed. I don't doubt this series will be in the Potter range.<br/><br/>Finally I'd mention one small quibble I have, but what for? You'll probably notice it yourself and then quickly forgive the director for it. So why mention it at all? Go enjoy!"

Plus the Tribute Parade was VERY disappointing..the worse part of all was Rue...there was hardly any screen time between her and Katniss...maybe 3-5 min...next thing you know...Rue is dead, Katniss is bawling....and you don't really understand why.....well if you read the book you know why....but District 12 was exactly as i pictured it and so was the capital...."
"LCbaseball22","10","6","21","25 March 2012"," Dare I say...better then the book?
","I know this might be a knee jerk reaction but...The Hunger Games is my new favorite film of the decade! And I believe that's saying quite a bit considering this young decade has already provided us with films such as Inception, Black Swan, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, The Artist, and of course the 2 Part Harry Potter finale!<br/><br/>Honestly, this film was fantastic. Incredible cast (Jennifer Lawrence has such amazing range and beauty), hard hitting emotion, and some really great adaptation choices. It's such a skillful adaptation of the novel's story of sacrifice and survival and does a fine job of retaining the novel's themes and satirical statements against violence, reality TV, etc while at the same time providing entertainment and genuine emotional impact. Oh how I wish all films were like this.<br/><br/>All that being said, the film is not completely free of flaws (frankly I have yet to see a film that is though) however and there were times when I wanted to strangle either the director or cinematographer. The much discussed shaky cam is completely inappropriate at times (like before the games start) though quite effective at others. Also on the visual side of things, for a film that is going to rake in so much dough, some of the special effects could have been better. Oh, and yes, of course some things in the novel were left out but I think the film would have dragged if they had focused too much on life in the districts and not condensed the games a bit. On the other hand, as I said there was some really great adaptation decisions which fleshed out the novel in certain ways and made the film work even though it wasn't all first person POV like the novel. Also quite frankly I think a lot of scenes play out better on screen then they read, so I think the film is more then deserving of Best Adapted Screenplay consideration and maybe even Best Picture. Other award consideration should go to Jennifer Lawrence for Best Actress, Woody Harrelson for Best Supporting Actor, and James Newton Howard for Best Original Score. Possibly Art Direction and Costumes as well. All I've got left to say is after this year's fiasco of virtually ignoring the fantastic final chapter of the Harry Potter saga, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences better take notice of this one; this is blockbuster film-making at its finest!<br/><br/>For a richer experience you'll probably want to have read the novel though!"
"nicole_ward","10","6","21","23 March 2012"," What I expected and more ...
","From the moment I read the books, and then found out there was going to be a film I have been excited to see The Hunger Games. The wait was worth it, and I cannot express how much this film moved me. <br/><br/>I was always expecting it to be good, because of the books. However, it was better than I expected! The characters were portrayed excellently especially Katniss. The settings were perfect and exactly how I had imagined when reading the books. <br/><br/>There were a few let downs but very minor ones at that; a few changes to how things should have happened and a few things missed out that I thought should have been in there. However, it is only meant to be a film based on the book - they can't get it one hundred percent the same as the book and therefore I don't really complain about these minor faults. <br/><br/>I would say to everyone - GO AND WATCH THE HUNGER GAMES. Whether you heard the whole 'Team Gale, Team Peeta' thing about this film - ignore that. This movie is about so much more than a romantic relationship between two characters. It is such a moving film and those people who bring it down to that 'team' argument are not giving it any justice and making it sound like a stupid meaningless film like 'Twilight'.<br/><br/>So, don't be put off by thinking it's about the whole 'team Gale or Peeta' ... I promise you it is not and that you will most likely thoroughly enjoy this film (unless you wanted the team love thing).<br/><br/>Overall, outstanding film."
"caputo-christian13","10","4","12","9 November 2012"," The Hunger Games
","The ""Hunger Games"" by Suzan Collions is an enjoyable movie for all ages and it is a great family movie.. With the good in every movie follows the bad. Although the movie has its very few bad clips in the end the good out weights the bad. <br/><br/>Although there are many different point of views to look at all of the good one very interesting topic is the twisted romance. Peeta and Katniss were thought to be ""star crossed lovers"" to the audience. Although Katniss dose not love Peeta, she some how manage to convince the Capitol into her plot.<br/><br/>In Addition, the action is a big part in the story. Beside story the blood and violence, which may intrigue part of the audience, it is a great aspect to put into the book. It is a great attention grabber to show the seriousness of the situation.<br/><br/>However, the few clips may be non-appealing to some select groups. One group and reason is adults and the violence. Many adults may think this amount of violence is inappropriate for the younger generation and the consequences of seeing this much violence could be damaging. <br/><br/>Last but not least, a great thing about the book is it was helped directed by the author of the book. This is a great aspect of the movie because many movies based off of books derails from the details that make the book a great book. <br/><br/>The ""Hunger Games"" is a great book for so many different reasons that have gone unmentioned. Although the movie has its bad parts, there is so much more good things than bad."
"incognito4884","9","4","12","28 September 2012"," Did we see the same movie?!?
","I have been seeing a ton of bad reviews for this movie and I don't really understand why.<br/><br/>Main complaints by other viewers: The shaky camera - It rips off Battle Royale - Children being murdered - Not violent enough<br/><br/>First, I want to say that I am not a big fan of the shaky camera because it gives me a headache after while, but it was an important tool used to portray the chaos that is unfolding around Katniss. It is supposed to be seen from the perspective of the main character. It is in no way enough to rate this movie with one star...<br/><br/>Yes, there are great similarities between this story and Battle Royal, but that is an issue to take up with the book, not the movie. Avatar rips off Pocahontas...but it is still a great movie.<br/><br/>I have seen some nasty comments about the author for killing children. I think they are completely missing the point of this story. You are SUPPOSED to be disgusted by this. That is the premise behind the entire series. The Hunger Games are what sparks a revolt against the oppressing government. This ""disgust"" will be a big part of the next movie.<br/><br/>This series was written for young adults. Now imagine that they decided to make this movie so violent that it had to be rated R. That is idiotic! The books are for young adults so the movies should be geared towards them too. Just because you read this as an adult, it doesn't mean that the movie should be geared toward your age group.<br/><br/>I read all of the books before the movie was released and I was hoping that it would be a great adaptation. It was. Yes, the readers could get picky and point out some changes, but every adaptation is going to have a few changes. This one had so few changes that I had to watch it again to pick them out.<br/><br/>It is refreshing to see a movie that portrays a young female as strong and independent. Young teens have been given movie after movie that portrays females as only having one goal or aspiration...to have a boyfriend. This story decided to go a different route; instead of swooning over a young hunk this girl is fighting for her life and the lives of her family. Instead of being sweet and quiet, this girl is strong and outspoken. Young females need more characters like Katniss in their lives.<br/><br/>I thought that the costumes and make-up were done perfectly. They are supposed to be ridiculous and bright. This is important to the story because it is one way that the regular people of the districts find themselves hating the Capitol. It touches on the tensions caused by class division. The poor people can't afford food, yet they see these people wasting their money on outrageous things like getting their skin dyed green.<br/><br/>Most of the important plot points are subtle, like they are in the book since it was written in 1st person POV. You have to take note of the little details to get the full feel of this movie.<br/><br/>The cast was perfect. The only complaint I have is that Katniss could have easily been non-white because she is described as being olive-toned. They could have pushed the boundary a little more and given teens a more ethnically diverse cast.<br/><br/>Overall I rate this movie as a 9 for being a great book adaptation and giving young girls a good role model to look up to. Hopefully this series will reverse some of the damage that Twilight has done. I deducted 1 star for the shaky camera."

"Bruce722","8","4","12","10 April 2012"," Really good but could've been great if they stuck closer to the book.
","Really good movie but, as usual, it wasn't as good as the book which was outstanding. Obviously, you must inevitably cut out quite a bit of content in order to turn a 10 hour book into a 2 hour movie. This is not necessarily where I felt the movie missed it's mark. I didn't mind that certain minor characters were cut out (Madge and the Avox girl) and others' had their roles diminished (the prep team). I also didn't mind that certain characters' roles were embellished for the movie (Gale and Crane). However, while those were things that were necessary for the transition from pages to big screen, certain changes were not and slightly affected the overall feel of the story. ***SPOILER ALERT*** IF YOU HAVEN'T READ THE BOOK AND INTEND ON IT, QUIT READING NOW. For example, Katniss and Peeta were instructed to never separate from one another during the training session by Haymitch. This was a crucial strategic element and the movie not only glossed over it but actually largely removed it entirely. This made the ""star crossed lovers"" vibe difficult to push. The way the Cato/Thresh thing went down also was unnecessarily changed. It wouldn't have been any longer to keep to the book here. In the book, Cato was more of a villain whereas in the more, while they tried to make him out as one, small changes diminished this effect, this change being just one of them. Now for the biggest areas of the movie where changes weren't necessary. First of all, the Mockingjay, which is the symbol of the entire trilogy, lost all importance in this movie. All tributes take a ""token"" into the arena with them and this was Katniss' token. The fact that she got it from Madge and Madge not being in the movie is irrelevant to the fact that they still could've had this symbol keep it's meaning as a symbol of rebellion and a smack in the face of the Capitol. Secondly, the scene of Rue's death. While I thought the movie did a really good job here, there is a critical moment afterwords where Rue's district shows their appreciation for Katniss' actions by sending her a piece of bread. Katniss then salutes them to show acknowledgment. This should not have changed because it is a major part in Katniss' rebelling against the Capitol. Katniss voluntarily saluting the cameras without initiation didn't make any sense. Instead of sticking to the book, the movie decided to replace this important sequence with a scene of Rue's district revolting. Not only did this not happen in the book but it actually doesn't occur until the second book when Katniss and Peeta take their victory tour. I wonder how they are going to fix this when they make the next movie. I did like some of the changes they did make though. It's not really possible to keep a movie in the first person so showing things that happened outside of the arena (Crane meeting with Snow, the control room, people watching back home, etc.) helped push the third person feel that was a must. Overall, it's impossible to know how I would rate the movie without reading the book which is really strange because you normally know. I might think that the movie was outstanding because I wouldn't know any different. Then again, I might feel like some of the scenes were rushed and not explained thoroughly enough. Nonetheless, it was a really good movie. It could've been great if they would've stayed a little more true to the book but it was still a good film and I look forward to seeing the next two."

It's how the movie makes YOU feel and almost pushes you of the edge of crying, yelling at the characters you don't like, feel their pain (may it be physically or psychically) and how it almost makes you jump out of your seat in the dark. Katniss the strong girl who makes the biggest sacrifice in order to protect her sister. A decision we can surely all relate to. She goes her own way, finds her goal and fights for it. Unstopable in her will but still just human. And this is the big difference between The Hunger Games and many of the other big budget Hollywood motion pictures. No invincible Heroes, just humans with the will to survive. Screw romance! Survive! And to all the people who compare the film to the book. Wake the fu-- up! Films will always be different then books. Different audiences. Deal with it!"
"lewiskendell","8","4","12","4 April 2012"," The First Blockbuster of the Year!
","The Hunger Games is as straightforward as book adaptations get. Nearly every scene is taken word from word for the page, and while some things obviously have to be left out in the interest of time, watching the movie is incredibly close to the experience of reading the novel. <br/><br/>And in this case that's a very good thing, because The Hunger Games is a great book and makes for a great movie. The tone is spot-on, be it the frivolous, manic environment of the Capitol (the ruling city of the future post-war remains of America and yearly organizer of the Hunger Games), the unflinching poverty of District 12 (home of our main character and several other people important to the overall story), or the brutality of the games themselves. Nothing featuring children killing each other should be easy to watch, and the PG-13 rating doesn't stop several scenes from being wince inducing. The violence is never really glorified or lingered on, but it's there. <br/><br/>I loved Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss. Any concerns I had about her being a little older than the character or too ""healthy"" looking were quickly forgotten. Katniss is defined by her determination and resourcefulness, and Lawrence nailed that. I also was pleasantly surprised by how well most of rest of the cast embodies their characters, including Josh Hutcherson as Peeta, who actually made me like the character in the movie more than the book. Lenny Kravitz as Cinna, Woody Harrleson as Haymitch, and Wes Bentley as Seneca Crane all help bring the world to life by handling their characters so well. Even the actors playing the other contestants in the games managed to be memorable and show the essence of their characters, no matter how brief their scenes are. <br/><br/>If you're a fan of the books, put your worries aside. This is The Hunger Games you know and love on the big screen, and it's done well. If you're new to the franchise, just know you're in for a thrilling, often brutal, and occasionally touching story."
"jburtroald95","8","4","12","30 March 2012"," An excellent stand-alone film that doesn't belong in a series
","After last year's Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 famously hammered the nail in the coffin of the beloved Potter franchise, many avid teenage readers and moviegoers searched frantically for another dependably exciting adventure series to fill the aching, gaping hole that was left after the worldwide heartbreak. The fact that many of them believe that they've found it with Suzanne Collins' The Hunger Games will, it seems, mitigate the power of what is really an inspired, intelligent, brilliantly crafted fable and provide egoistic film critics with the perfect ammunition to blast away the threat to their vain conservatism. <br/><br/>This should never have really been a series, because it works on the same level as other eerie futuristic pieces such as George Orwell's fascinating 1984 or Ridley Scott's rickety but well-intentioned Blade Runner (1982). Books or films belonging to a pre-mediated fantasy or science fiction series usually end quite inconclusively and mysteriously, with a neat explanation being provided in the final instalment. This perfectly packaged ending is made possible by the disconnect from the real world, but The Hunger Games is very much focused on harsh realities and palpable, relatable ambiguities, or at least it was until the sequel Catching Fire was published in 2009. The main premise of the story might have been typical of teenage entertainment – yet nevertheless exciting – but the insightful earlier and later passages are what set it apart from mainstream blockbuster entertainment.<br/><br/>As most people know, the story centres on young Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) who struggles to support her family and to cope personally in a brutal dystopian future. She lives in the last of twelve strictly separated districts that get progressively poorer, although each has been oppressed severely by the Capitol, particularly after the great insurrection that occurred several decades before Katniss' birth. This is where one of the story's most unique aspects comes in, in that the violent and passionate rebellion that usually takes centre stage in these stories has come and gone unsuccessfully, and has had adverse effects on the later generations. Now, every year, the Capitol draws names out of a ballot and takes a boy and girl between the ages of 12 and 18, gives them a brief bit of training and places them all in an arena in a gruelling fight to the death that becomes a twisted reality television show for the entire population. Katniss volunteers as a tribute after her fragile, 12-year-old sister is called up, along with the humble and kindly Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) who is just as convinced that he will lose because of his useless fighting skills as he is that Katniss will win because of her determination and hunting experience, and is eager for them to pose as ""star-crossed lovers"" in order to gain publicity and extra assistance from sponsors.<br/><br/>What follows is their navigation of a perilous moral, philosophical, physical and emotional minefield whilst they try to find a balance between staying true to themselves and their personal beliefs, even if it means defying the Capitol, and being strategic and adaptable enough to survive. It would be a very laborious task to describe the many details of these rich plot developments, but due mention must go to a few of the most intriguing characters, and the actors that so impressively embody them. Liam Hemsworth effectively plays the supporting character of Gale, Katniss' best friend, who always optimistically insists that they should flee to the forest to live as nature intended and be free of the Capitol. He is just as likable as Peeta, and both are naïve and coldly realistic in their own way. 12- year-old newcomer Amandla Stenberg beautifully captures the innocence and cheekiness of Rue, a gentle but elusive young tribute who is incredibly adept at climbing. Jack Quaid, another newcomer, somehow manages to mask his natural warmth in order to play an insufferably pompous yet undeniably tough and dangerous competitor from the wealthier area of district 1, where tributes are fiercely trained from a young age and volunteer with pleasure to slaughter the poorer citizens. As for Katniss herself, the still unsteady Jennifer Lawrence has proved to be the perfect casting choice. Our heroine is very similar to her Oscar- nominated role in Winter's Bone (2010) and no doubt she's used many of the same characterisation techniques to portray this tough, earthy yet very sympathetic character, but here she has refined her acting skills enough to make the audience like her as well as the Academy. Josh Hutcherson has also been very well cast as Peeta, being very believable and incredibly moving. It is a pleasure to see him still acting well and prominently after his terrific efforts as a child actor in the last decade, and hopefully he will make the transition to serious adult actor. Lenny Kravitz portrays another powerfully sympathetic character, Cinna, the only Capitol official who recognises the cruelty and harshness of the Hunger Games and extends a gentle, helping hand towards Katniss. Indeed, the upper class is a ghastly sight. Respected actors Wes Bentley, Stanley Tucci, Donald Sutherland, Woody Harrelson, Toby Jones and Elizabeth Banks stagger on screen as outrageously dressed, ridiculously drunk, shamelessly shallow and often shockingly heartless bureaucrats that appear to be caricatures at first glance, but eventually one realises that as far as representations of government officials go they couldn't be more realistic.<br/><br/>A story such as this could never have a concrete ending and remain believable, and unfortunately, by giving it an ending across two sequels, Suzanne Collins has ruined this marvellous fable's chances of ever being taken seriously by anyone over the age of twenty. Still, make sure you experience this fantastic book and film."

","The Hunger Games is set in the future, in a dystopian society called Panem which is in the ruins of North America. The Capitol controls all of the 12 surrounding Districts ever since the rebellions by the Districts, and rules them fiercely. Every year, the Capitol selects one girl and one boy from each District to fight to the death in a bloody battle, which is televised to the District families as a reminder of the Capitol's power. During the selection of the tributes (names for the selected young girls and boys) for the 74th Annual Hunger Games, Katniss Everdeen, a young girl from District 12, volunteers in the place of her younger sister Primrose to save her. Peeta, a local boy, is also chosen. They obviously have some history between them but it becomes clearer as the flashbacks become more detailed. <br/><br/>During the weeks of training, emotions run high between each other and the other tributes, all of them jostling for public success which will bring them sponsors. The sponsors send help such as food, medicine or clothing to their favourites, which could mean the difference between life and death.<br/><br/>The Hunger Games is fast paced, punchy, exciting film that will have you on the edge of your seat. Tense sequences culminate in fast action scenes which leave you terrified! It made me sob with terror and with sadness alternately, and was overall the best film I've seen so far. Be warned, the gore in this is not melodramatic, but disturbingly effective. <br/><br/>The fact that it doesn't gloss over the brutal murder that Katniss has to see, but shows it in all the gory detail, makes us feel more connected with her than ever because we know what she's seen and are just as shell-shocked at it. Like any film with that amount of violence, it could have quickly descended into an action-packed chaos, but finely tuned emotional sequences (Katniss and Prim, Katniss and Rue) steady the plot and are brilliantly played by the actors. Jennifer Lawrence I adored in this role, I felt she acted it perfectly.<br/><br/>Also, I loved the fact that although Katniss is an extremely powerful, strong and capable female character, she's not emotionless. The most sensible thing to do when Rue died was to run and seek shelter, but she risked her life to show one last mark of respect for her. Katniss would beat the sappy, submissive and meek Bella Swan any day. Bella wouldn't last a second in that arena! Katniss is such a brilliant female lead, and Jennifer Lawrence is outstanding. What else can I say? <br/><br/>Overall, a triumph. I'm considering going to see it again because I loved it so much, and I really hope that if they do a sequel it'll be just as fantastic as this one."
"cadfile","8","4","12","28 March 2012"," A Young Adult Film That Is Actually Good
","I was concerned before seeing The Hunger Games movie if I would actually enjoy it since the film isn't for me. I was worried too, not having read the books, and hearing about the plot, if young people should be seeing a film with violence as a primary plot device. Luckily I was wrong on all accounts. The Hunger Games is a young adult film that was actually good and the violence wasn't as graphic as I feared. I recommend it.<br/><br/>I hadn't read any of the books in the trilogy but knew enough about the plot that I was concerned the violence would be on par to the trashy horror movies seen recently like the ""Final Destination"" series. The film used all kids of tricks to get the sense of the violence without actually seeing buckets of blood or guts. That's good for those with kids in the age range this film is targeted.<br/><br/>The other themes that I think aren't seen much in young adult films these days like self-sufficiency, altruism, poverty, starvation, and fascism, are some things we should explore, warts and all, although I'm not quite sure if younger people will understand those on first watch. I do think those ideas will seep into their heads and come back when they are much older. This is a film that lends itself to discussion between parents and children afterward.<br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence who played the main character Katniss Everdeen, has been on my radar since she was on the Bill Engvall Show on TBS (2007-2009). I also enjoyed her performance in Winter's Bone in 2010 which got her an Oscar nomination. She has a very expressive face and her bright blue eyes give her a gravitas that most young actresses have to grow into over time.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast was great. I really liked Stanley Tucci's Caesar Flickerman (the TEETH!) and Lenny Kravitz as Cinna (that guy starts at Cool). The only person I thought seemed out of place was Woody Harrelson's Haymitch Abernathy. I think it was his wig. It seemed too fake.<br/><br/>Being an old guy I was disappointed there wasn't a lot of actual game play. The game didn't start until half way through the film and then not a lot happens action wise. IMHO. I wanted to see more game play from Katniss. She is portrayed as very smart with natural survival skills and except for the scheme to destroy the supplies of the professional tributes, she didn't do a lot game playing. I was wondering if she would even be able to kill anyone. That was probably the point.<br/><br/>There was a love story, well actually a triangle if Gale is included, and that is the main focus of the film. That story plays a major part of the plot and I expected it. Luckily it isn't as sappy as I thought. It seemed real and natural and not contrived.<br/><br/>Another great part of this film is the protagonist is female and not one of those vain ones that need to be saved by a man that we tend to see in films written by men. I liked that Katniss actually saved Peeta. I think our film industry could stand more of this kind of female roles and not the usual brooding comic book buttheads.<br/><br/>The only real problem I had with the film was the stakes weren't high enough. We know how it would end even if you hadn't read the books (it is one of a trilogy). I know they couldn't significantly change the story so I was disappointed with the ending. But overall that's a minor quibble. It would be more of a problem if it was an original story.<br/><br/>There has been some chatter about how the Hunger Games seems to rip off the story from a Japanese film. No matter if that is true or not I just remember what my writing teacher told me years ago: all the good ideas have been written - judging a book (or film) is how that old idea is presented.<br/><br/>In other parts the film reminded me of other films I had seen like Blade Runner, Star Wars, and even Romeo & Juliet. I think this film does a great job with the story even if we've seen it before.<br/><br/>I recommend ""The Hunger Games""."
"kingofgondor-329-621391","10","4","12","27 March 2012"," The Hunger Games - A pleasant surprise indeed
","Coming into this movie I had no expectations, just that I knew it was based off of a book so I gained the basic plot from my fellow movie-goer friends who had read it. Honestly I didn't expect it to be that good, the plot sounded like a messed up plot with little redeeming qualities and not one that I would condone. <br/><br/>I was taken aback at the excellence in which this movie was filmed. It took a plot that was based off of a book, which quite a few of the viewers like myself hadn't read, and that usually means it would be confusing and not very enjoyable. What I saw was a very well put-together movie that made sense while making me rethink my original expectations. The plot, while not being totally original, was different from almost all other movies in the last few years that I've seen. So what if it drew some plot points from Battle Royale, or Running Man, or Gladiator. My point is, it was based on a book that was inspired by history, not by Hollywood. Collins based it off of Ancient Rome, among other things, so anybody who's comparing this to Battle Royale (and there's a lot of you) is just not getting it. <br/><br/>First, the acting was brilliant. Usually in any big movie there is always an actor or actress that cannot pull off their part or just plain annoys me. Not so in THG, what I saw was young and old actresses/actors alike performing with class and skill, even the minor characters. Jennifer Lawrence was insanely good, it seemed that her roll was based off of her rather than the other way around. Every line line that she said(what few there really were), every emotion that she displayed, every scene she was in, she played them all perfectly and stood out to me as being light-years better than the sub-par acting I've seen in the last few years. She captured all the emotions one would expect from a 16-year-old who was thrust into the kind of scenarios she had to go through, and she didn't even have to say a line to let the audience know what she was thinking, which was quite incredible. I was very pleasantly surprised. The supporting actors as well were just great, from Woody Harrelson, who can pull off a gruff but ultimately kind-hearted drunkard, to Josh Hutcherson, who played the innocent yet strong unexpected love interest. Even the Capitol citizens that ran the games were acted brilliantly, the most pleasant surprise to me was Lenny Kravitz, who pulled off a very calming stylist brilliantly. Overall, one of the best acting performances I've seen, at least in the last 5 years. <br/><br/>Second, the camera shooting. I read tons of reviews that were giving sub-par ratings based off of the jerky camera shots and fast switching angles. Now considering the original target audience would not be able to see an R-rated movie without parental guidance, the studio needed to lower the rating a bit, and they solved this by using the unsteady camera shots. I thought they were used to their fullest, and while some might want to see over-the-top violence, I think the movie did the best it could given it's target audience to show how dreadful the violence was without showing what could have been shown. Jerking the camera around gave a sense of urgency and complete chaos at the right times, which fit the scenes quite well. I accepted the camera shooting as a necessary part of the movie and I admire the work that they put into the filming to make sure the point of the movie was not lost while keeping it target-audience clean. <br/><br/>Third, the world-view of the movie came as a shock to me. Usually movie makers will not put a lot of politics in a YA movie, so I expected the bad guys to be watered down. It was barbaric the way that the characters were treated, it would be really hard to say that this movie glorified violence. If anything this movie portrayed violence as being, well, barbaric and disgusting, but necessary to show for the audience to learn from it. It's definitely a thinking movie, I started lots of great discussions from it, and it has a lot of good lessons to learn. <br/><br/>My favorite part about it, though, was the fact that Katniss was a true heroine, who was not perfect, as there really aren't any perfect people around, but rather was morally sound. She loved her family, if she didn't then she would have never placed herself in her younger sister's place, and that's a rarity in modern films, good family values are hard to come by nowadays. She had unwavering determination to not let the people in charge tell her what to do, to not let them change her to do their will, but to stand firm in her beliefs and buck the system, which she effectively does. Overall, she struck me as the anti-Bella, she's strong, self-sufficient, determined, unwavering, caring, smart, and pretty much everything a good role-model is.<br/><br/>Now, the movie is not perfect, I will admit that it could have been more logical in some places, making it longer might have helped. And this is all coming from me without me reading the book. After watching the movie I went out and purchased the trilogy and read the book, then went again to watch the movie, to see if it was still as good. I think the book makes the movie even better, just like the movie also makes the book better. It's amazing how they work together and augment each other to make the story that much better. I would definitely recommend reading the book, it's an amazing book, but also watch the movie as it's so good I was amazed at how it grasped me."

","My grandson and I went to see this film the other day. I haven't read the novel, but he is absolutely enthralled with it so I figured I'd give it a go. I don't ever comment on this website, but I just had to create an account so I could review this film. It was simply marvelous. I didn't like some of the violence and how it was focused on teenagers, but the message behind the story was made very clear in the film and I think it somewhat necessitates the brutality of the Games. The acting was wonderful across the board, especially Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss. The emotion and poise with which she portrays the character is mind-boggling, and for someone who hadn't read the novels, I feel like I know Katniss inside and out because of her incredible performance. The other characters are great as well, each adding something unique to the story. I especially liked little Rue and saw that Katniss felt like she had to protect her from the horrors of the Games. I even liked some of the antagonistic ""killer"" competitors (yes, even the brutal blond guy) because even they eventually realized that the true enemy is the government, not the other fighters. Brilliant casting, acting, and directing all around! Overall, the film is fantastic. Parents, be warned: there is definitely some harrowing stuff in there. But it's necessary for the moral that the film is trying to give. Without it, I'm not sure I would have been as affected. I give ""The Hunger Games"" a 10/10 for its wonderful meaning, incredible cast, and capacity to make non-readers like myself care deeply about the fates of the characters."

","At first I was worried that the movie wouldn't stand up to the quality of the book, fortunately I was wrong the movie is superb although I didn't liked how the camera moved at some times and there where important things in the book which didn't make an appearance in the movie. Jennifer Lawrence really nailed the role and just to be clear this is not Twilight (the ugly love story!) this is more than just the romance, it's about the GAMES and all the action that comes with it but I have to say if it was rated R it would meant more of how they actually live in hunger, kill in the games and so on. All in all it was a really good movie with a really good cast though I always wished that Jonny Depp would take the role of Haymitch but Woody Harrelson did do a good job with it.

","I was unaware that this movie was based off a book until I came on IMDb to review. As a movie first viewer, I have to say the film was quite entertaining. I watched the late late show when I should have been sleeping and the movie kept me up and engaged the entire time. I was expecting from the trailers for a bit of cheese due to the lead character looking like the girl from The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. I was pleasantly surprised that the characters and acting were not half bad, and that the story was in fact quite fresh. I have read that this is the first book of 3, and I noticed the characters were built and left with some hanging conflict. I have to agree with another reviewer about the camera work. The use of hand-held cameras was appropriate some of the time, but there was just too much of it. It was jarring to the eye and distracted me from time to time. I got a bit confused in the fight scenes, because I could never tell who was hitting who. Some shots could have definitely benefited from a locked off tripod, or a steady cam. My goal in every movie is to get lost in it, not confused by it. Overall, this was an awesome film and I look forward to the sequel."
"mdmjuggler","8","4","12","26 March 2012"," A decent movie for the time they had to cut it to
","After reading many of the reviews on ""The Hunger Games,"" both positive and negative, I have to say that I had to see for myself what the movie was like before I could support either side.<br/><br/>I do feel though that people who give this as an ""Unhelpful"" review are sadly those who wish to see any fair to positive reviews of the movie be seen as just fan-worship or are ""Battle Royale"" fans who just want to try and ruin a decent movie - never mind there are probably those who can be just as ugly toward the other movie.<br/><br/>Simply put - it isn't exactly like the books, but it wasn't going to be. You can't exactly copy books to begin with - be it the film would be too long if you took it straight from the book (at least requiring an intermission - think ""Gone With the Wind"" long) and some scenes couldn't have been filmed in order to keep it PG-13 (and I don't mean bloodbath BTW), or were out of our present abilities art wise.<br/><br/>There are many pros and cons to the movie, but I'll start out with the pros.<br/><br/>First, the acting - all the characters, and even the extras, were spot on for who they were, what they were and where/what they were doing. All the actors I felt did a very good job, and in the case of the extras, who many get scale (which isn't a lot) who could honestly probably just phone it in instead of showing depth like they did, that spoke volumes. I felt like I was a character in the movie and experiencing exactly what they were.<br/><br/>The scenery, especially for the arena, was perfect and felt in many cases exactly what I saw in my head reading the book. And the scenes showing the OUTSIDE world of the arena were good.<br/><br/>I even liked some of the changes, such as Katniss' interview dress and a twist in one of the scenes.<br/><br/>That said, with all good, there are some problems. First, I feel it suffered a bit of a ""Tree of Life"" syndrome - you had too many scenes that you wonder if there was more footage but it had to be trimmed to fit the timeframe. One of these is NOT showing all the bloodbath tributes in the arena - they should've shown at least all the bloodbath tributes, because in several cases, that would've been the only time they were featured in the movie at all. This holds especially true with how nice they did the photowork for the deceased tributes.<br/><br/>Secondly, I think they needed maybe to keep two of the scenes in the arena - Rue's death and the final battle, closer to the actual storyline in the book. I understand costs, but in the case of the final battle, it could've be stronger. Some things too weren't explained clearly which could hurt those who haven't read the books.<br/><br/>Finally, the most annoying thing was the shaky hand-held cameras in some scenes. While I think they were used to try and create a real life feel - the shaking was a tad too much that it became distracting.<br/><br/>Overall, not as bad of a movie as some people will like to make it out to be, but the director will need to work harder to make the next installment stronger because there is room for improvement."

But Jennifer Lawrence is really awesome not because that I love her but her performance was exactly the same I imagined from book.<br/><br/>The thing I did not like much is the screenplay itself. I know this is an adaptation but it was too much copy of the book, there was no surprises, no much creativity. I felt the director followed the book word by word, paragraph by paragraph and did not changed much. So I found the movie boring in the middle.

The future looks grim and depressing in Catniss's community. Once she is selected, she and the other guy are sent to the Capitol. I have to say that the make up, hair, and costumes are outlandish, strange, and even bizarre. The people in the Capitol seem to relish the hunger games. While the future has the inevitable society catastrophe of wars, drought and famine, the Capitol city seems untouched. What bothers me about this movie is the violence and children caught in this horrific game of survival viewed by the world. I wonder why others didn't volunteer to enter the hunger games instead of children who stood no chance. It's a brutal film. I am becoming a fan of Jennifer Lawrence who does a terrific job here and deserves a second Oscar nomination. She reminded me of her role in ""Winter's Bone."""

","The Hunger Games gives us a fascinating glimpse into a dark dystopian future society. Here an oppressive government exercises it's power each year by forcing 24 children to fight to the death in a massive battle arena, purely for the sake of intimidating the 12 districts of Panem. This setting stimulates many ethical questions about survival and inequality that resonate across the entire story.<br/><br/>This was simply a very well made movie. Despite the occasional dodgy camera angle on the whole it was brilliant. There were aching moments of suspense along side the deeply saddening. All of this was weaved together with the help of a fantastic director and cast. Jennifer Laurence gave a respectable performance as did Josh Hutcherson which made for a strong relationship between Peeta and Katniss. Many of the other characters seemed to be brought to life even better than I expected, my personal favorites being Caesar Flickerman and Effie Trinket. The director also seemed to encapsulate the maddening, over-intoxicating colors and fashion of the Capitol in a way that was just spot on.<br/><br/>If you have read the books you may have mixed feelings about this film but I would just advise you to keep an open mind. There are some small areas where bits of the book have been taken away and others where extra scenes have been added to better tell the story and the result is highly enjoyable. The detailed, gripping story is surely the main factor that has brought this film such wide success.<br/><br/>All things considered this was a smart, entertaining and though provoking film that sets the series off to an excellent start.<br/><br/>The of the must see films of this year."

"TxMike","Null","3","8","23 August 2012"," A future dystopian society where kids must kill kids.
","A dystopia is the idea of a society, generally of a speculative future, characterized by negative, anti-utopian elements, varying from environmental to political and social issues,usually hypothesized by writers of fiction.<br/><br/>Yes, ""Hunger Games"" is about a future dystopian society, decades after a rebellion. As a type of penance and reminder that the Capitol has the power, each year each of the 12 outlying districts must choose two youngsters, one boy and one girl, to travel to the Capitol and participate in the Hunger Games. This is the 74th Games. There will be one victor, one survivor, all the rest will die. Children killing other children.<br/><br/>This story focuses on district 12, a mining district where people struggle to feed themselves and have established a barter system. Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) is the older daughter of the family, she hunts and fishes, is good with a bow and arrow and survival in general. Against the odds her younger sister, more the girly type, is chosen in the lottery, but Katniss speaks up and volunteers to go in her place. Along with the boy, Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) that she only knew casually.<br/><br/>The story becomes one of survival. Neither Katniss nor Peeta want to kill any of the other kids, but they also are determined to defend themselves. The days, perhaps most of a week, of the actual competition takes place mostly in a forested area, monitored by technicians in a center with virtual reality displays. The citizens of the Capitol look at the Hunger games as a big entertainment event, perhaps like the ancient Romans did for their arena battles to the death.<br/><br/>A saving grace for the movie is that, although we know kids are killing kids, it is done with a certain grace. We don't see a lot of blood and gore, or graphic killings, which makes the movie more palatable for such a distasteful topic.<br/><br/>Fortunately the main story of survival turns into a love story as Katniss and Peeta form a sort of bond, particularly after he reveals in a pre-games televised interview that he has always had a secret admiration of Katniss.<br/><br/>Stanley Tucci is one of the flamboyant citizens of the Capitol, he moderates the ""show"" before the games begin, interviewing each participant before a live audience in a large theater setting. He comes across most as a host of a TV show like ""America's Got Talent"", ignoring the fact that almost all of these young kids will die shortly.<br/><br/>I didn't read the book so I can't compare the two, but I suspect they had to leave some things out to keep the running time around 2:15. I found the movie enjoyable, it makes one think about the freedoms we mostly take for granted.<br/><br/>SPOILERS: The people monitoring the Games also have a viewing audience they need to keep entertained. So to generate interest they announce, and the participants hear this, that for one time only they will allow two survivors for the same district, if it turns out that way, to play up the budding relationship of Katniss and Peeta. They in fact do ""win"" the Games, but then it is announced that they changed their minds, one must kill the other. Peeta encourages Katniss to kill him so that she can survive, but instead she gets a handful of poisonous purple berries, and indicates they will both eat them at the same time, both die rather than have to kill one. Peeta starts to object but Katniss says, ""Trust me. Trust me."" And what she guessed, happened, instead of seeing both of them die they call it off, let both live and travel back to district 12."

"DubhDoo","8","3","8","18 August 2012"," A highly enjoyable and promising start to the series
","Gary Ross' film begins with Jennifer Lawrence living in a rural community, being the glue keeping together a fatherless, almost- penniless household, with the camera-work intimate and indie-styled, and the music sparse. But wait, this isn't a sequel to Winter's Bone, is it? No, instead what we have here is (as I'm sure you're aware) the much anticipated adaptation of Suzanne Collins' The Hunger Games (Collins also serves as one of the film's three screenwriters), set in a post- apocalyptic US entitled Panem, where, in order to keep the youth in line and civil order maintained, 24 randomly selected 12-18 year olds are forced to fight to the death until one remains.<br/><br/>Of all the good things about the film, its shining star comes in the form of Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss Everdeen; from the moment she steps on screen she exudes a magnetic, presence; her performance is strong, convincing, emotional, and at times, vulnerable. She's a firm and consistently engaging central figure, who only benefits the film, bringing it to heights it may not have otherwise reached. But it's not all that surprising when you take into account the fact that she's the second youngest actress ever to receive a nomination for the Best Actress Oscar. <br/><br/>Lawrence is also backed up by a terrific supporting cast, including a shabbily charismatic Woody Harrelson, and even if he's only Basil Exposition, he's still enjoyable in the part; Stanley Tucci and Elizabeth Banks are entertaining as media-minded Caesar Flickerman and Effie Trinket. Wes Bentley and Donald Sutherland also make memorable impressions in significant roles with small screen time. However, Toby Jones barely utters a word. <br/><br/>I was taken aback by Josh Hutcherson, that while he may not be a astounding actor, he works quite well as Peeta Mellark, in the occasionally damsel-in-distress-like role, being believably vulnerable against Lawrence's resilient Katniss and even if their chemistry doesn't sparkle just yet, there's three more films for it to catch fire (wocka wocka).<br/><br/>While the film does indeed plant the seeds of love triangle, it is more focused on the Games themselves; And while Ross doesn't take the material's satirical promise as far as it could go, it's still laid on the table; making a statement about exploitation, the class divide, government distrust, repression and reality television. Because when you boil it down to its most basic, it is about kids killing kids. This could all have come across as strikingly tasteless on screen, but Ross works in the confines of a PG-13/12 certificate, effectively delivering violence that makes you feel the pain. He does this without making it overly gratuitous or alienating the target audience. The intense and frantic start to the Games illustrates this as we witness all the Tributes against each other, with bodies falling like dominoes and the horror of the carnage retained. <br/><br/>The film is not without its flaws – Ross' frequent use of shaky-cam in the film's action sequences is understandable, but it makes the action somewhat confusing and dizzying (maybe that's the point), but in a particular fight, each blow is delivered in hand-held flashes detracting from my enjoyment of said scene. The pacing in the second half is also uneven, at times it feels brisk, at others overly slow; not that I have a problem with slow pacing, it's just that the briskness of the first half's pacing is slightly at odds with the second half's, where Ross appears in no rush. One last gripe I had was that the finale was anticlimactic, (it was obviously designed to lead into the sequel) but I'll say no more to avoid spoilers. Yet these are minor flaws that can be ignored as it didn't destroy the experience of the film, because from start to finish, I thoroughly enjoyed it.<br/><br/>Many have made this clear and so will I: this is not the new Twilight, nor has it ever been - shoddy visual effects, stilted performances and cheesy dialogue are nowhere to be seen – instead this is something much better. More sophisticated than Twilight and darker than Harry Potter, this is a grounded, thoughtful, very well-acted and at times emotional film, which is also a very promising start to this franchise. Let's just hope the odds will ever be in its favour."
"secondtake","7","3","8","1 June 2012"," Fabulous scenario, adventurous filming, the best of it makes the rest of it really good!
","The Hunger Games (2012)<br/><br/>Well, with a sequel already planned you know there is some kind of hook and success here. It's a chilling idea doled out with high drama and great campiness: in the future, a televised ritual annually pits teenagers in a fight to the death as a kind of protection against war. The brutality and primal cheering of the masses bring to mind the Roman matches to the death in the Colosseum. And the superstitions implied (that such a thing would actually work) made me think of the story (and movie) by Shirley Jackson, ""The Lottery.""<br/><br/>The main character is a young woman already equipped with survival skills. She is the female representative from District 12, and in all there are 24 combatants, a male and a female from each of the dozen districts. Yes, it's eventually a bloody awful affair. In fact, the first half of the movie, before the battles, is the best. It introduces the whole idea, including the pomp and circumstance, the game show atmosphere, and behind-the-scenes primping and strategizing. Stanley Tucci is the host of the show, the Hunger Games as they are called, and he's wonderfully nutty. Woody Harrelson is a jaded and unconventional tutor (and former games winner) for the District 12 pair. And Lenny Kravitz plays an attractive smart stage manager and morale booster.<br/><br/>Dominating in every way is Jennifer Lawrence, who is a good reluctant strong participant. How long she survives you'll have to see for yourself--that's part of the game--but it's how she survives that matters, and how she becomes the target of some of the other ""tributes"" (as they are called, since the youngsters are bloody sacrifices for peace, ultimately). The scenario is great stuff, the sets and filming and pace of it really first rate. In many ways it's a terrific movie, and it's making billions at the box office for good reasons.<br/><br/>The second half of the film is the grand battle. It amounts mostly a series of encounters between various ""tributes,"" a dwindling number of course. Members of the television audience worldwide are cheering for their own districts to win, and cameras seem to be everywhere. In fact, the control room of the ""world"" makes clear it's a lot like ""The Truman Show"" with complete mastery over the elements, the sun, and even invented fires and other threats. (It was all filmed in North Carolina, by the way.)<br/><br/>If you like logic to your ritual barbarism, you'll have to look the other way now and then. Our heroine is singled out for some extra terrors, a bit unfairly, and then avoids other sure death situations by inexplicable kindness or little goodies floated in on metal parachutes. And those ultra-lethal genetically modified wasps? They don't live up to their billing. And why do some giant dog cyber-beasts suddenly attack our heroes and not anyone else?<br/><br/>Nitpicking? Only maybe. There were some avoidable gaffes like this, and it's the director (Gary Ross) who is also the writer who needs to shoulder a little blame there. Or can we eventually attribute some of the limitations here to the young adult novel that forms the basis to it all. There is some background buzz about the movie because of supposed racist and feminist issues one way or another, and I think there is room for argument there because the ""types"" used in the movie are in fact stereotypes. Some small effort at surprising the audience with better casting would have avoided the criticism and made a better movie. (The wikipedia entry for this movie is stunningly long. Check it out.)<br/><br/>In some ways this is nearly a 10 star movie. It's that good. But it's really too long overall, especially the second half which revels in some pretty basic hunt and kill violence. And there are some cracks in the veneer that drag the whole thing down to simply a fun, inventive, interesting futurist drama. That's good enough."

","It's pretty good. Most of the unfavourable reviews come from a tendency, which might be called - No, there isn't a chance, that a film based on a teen-bestseller book-might be - artistically good. But well, it is. A genuinely perfect scene-to-scene montage reflects the struggles of unimaginable dictatorship. As for actorship I'd like to mention Wes Bentley and Donald Sutherland as making the perfect ""baddie"" image. Especially Snow's mono-dialogue about hope - which is near to Gregory Peck's acting. The trembling camera comes and goes as a feature, but it establishes a certain here-be feeling, which might've been lost in some of the terrible CGI scenes. All in all - even a literature critic, who happened not to have read ""The Hunger Games"" ""read"" all she needed from Gary Ross's sweat and blood, which took to make this extraordinary good ecranisation."

Good special effects, OK action and good times at the movies.<br/><br/>What I hated though, was the cinematography. The hand-held camera, the shaky-cam irritated me so much, I couldn't enjoy many parts of the film because of it. The fast-paced editing didn't help either! Sometimes things got so confusing, I couldn't tell what was going on on the screen. And the camera never stopped! It would've been great to let our eyes have some rest between poorly coordinated action scenes, but the darn camera just kept on moving! This has to stop. This style of shooting isn't good. Stop it. Please.<br/><br/>Other than this unfortunate error, I enjoyed the movie. I haven't read the book, so I don't know how good the adaptation was, but I think the screenwriter(s) did a terrific job. There were a couple things I didn't like about the story though: the ending, which I found predictable, and someone's death, which I think was overemphasized. The love story seemed forced to me too, but maybe it was better written in the book. I also missed the twists. All the major plot points were in the trailer, so there weren't any surprises. I loved Stanley Tucci in the film and Jennifer Lawrence was a perfect action star.<br/><br/>Another thing I didn't like was the PG-13 rating. Some scenes could've been so awesome, but the editors took away the sound, added some heart-braking music to the shakily shot scenes, making them hard to enjoy. The film could've had so much potential if the studio didn't want to stick to the lower rating. Blood and gore is fun! Especially when the theme of the movie is so brutal. People expect to see more, than just quick, shaky images that only imply the action, rather than show it."
"hers1163","8","3","8","2 May 2012"," Biblical opinions on the Hunger Games
","Overall, I think the Hunger Games was an intense but enjoyable movie. I have not read the books however from the summaries I can conclude a few things. First of all, Collins has written this series of books that keeps all ages alike interested. I think Collins has taught kids the consequences of our beliefs. She raises serious questions about our culture and violence and what it does to the hearts and minds of the younger generation. There have been a few people that I know personally and from what I have read that complained about the violence, not because there is violence, rather there wasn't enough. The violence seems to show past things that happened in history; for example, the Coliseum with the persecution of Christians. Children today are attending government schools and learning that man can save man. However, as a Christian, I know that's not the case. Socialism seems to play a major role. Another topic that I'm not sure if Collins knew or not, but she incorporated the idea of total depravity. Total depravity is the idea that no one is innocent and everyone is in need or redemption. (Romans 3:9-18) Collins added a few ideas into her books in order to make the readers think. The Hunger Games was a good movie, if you can get over the idea of kids killing kids. I know a biblical world view has nothing to do with The Hunger Games; however Collins placed a few ideas such as consequences for your beliefs, what violence does to the heart and mind, and a huge idea of total depravity throughout her books."

I read the book again for the second time right before watching the movie, to see how close it would be, and I was not disappointed. In fact the few changes were even better and all the action I wanted was there. The story depicts very well the disconnect of a modern vain society between reality and violence, the power and dominion on the weak. It did very well showing what our human nature is capable of. I am very critical of movies and I strongly dislike movies without a good story and cheesy, this movie and story will be of the very few movies that i will watch multiple times in theater."

","Being realistic, they took a Rated R book, a story about an oppressive and extremely capitalist government, and they made it commercial, just like that, PG 13.<br/><br/>Im 14 years old and I was dragged to the movie, I knew they had made it like this, commercial, I was expecting another twilight but instead of that I found out this is game changer for teenage films.<br/><br/>The movie shows a lot of things about the human, we eat, or we wait for someone to eat us; and how can we people fight for our rights and against the oppression.<br/><br/>In my opinion, it was quite good, if you are not expecting a perfect adaptation from the book, you won't get disappointed."

","""May the odds be ever in your favor."" The Hunger Games is not just a movie of action and romance – it is a movie about survival of the fittest. The Hunger Games is about who can outwit the others. The Hunger Games is about finding your true self. But how can one find their self in a brutal attempt to please the one nation that created the games – The Capitol and the ruthless dictator of all time President Snow (played brilliantly by Donald Sutherland).<br/><br/>With an all-star cast, directed by Gary Ross – who brought us Pleasantville and Seabiscuit, interwove the world that Suzanne Collins created. From Jennifer Lawrence (Katniss) to Josh Hutcherson (Peeta) to Gale (Liam Hemsworth) to Cinna (Lenny Kravtiz), this movie defied all odds.<br/><br/>I have nothing negative to say about this movie, it was a movie that will stand up against one other movie this year. A movie of a test of time standing still for one immortal girl, one immortal boy and clan that will have to meet their end in The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn – Part 2.<br/><br/>But for The Hunger Games, thank you Suzanne for sharing your world with us. Thank you Gary Ross for your excellence in movie making. And thank you to the cast – you outshone and maybe just maybe in Catching Fire we will see more of your brilliant work."
"keesalemon","10","6","22","23 March 2012"," The Hunger Games Left Me Breathless
","Just a bit of background: I have been a die-hard Hunger Games fan for over two years. I have been watching this movie's progress ever since they announced that they would be making one. <br/><br/>And this movie blew my expectations out of the water. It was absolutely fantastic!<br/><br/>The acting was brilliant (Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson absolutely shine - in particular Lawrence! There is not a second in the entire movie where she does not completely embody Katniss.) The special effects were amazing. I was on the edge of my seat right from the reaping. The movie plot was identical to that of the book and the way they explained everything was very well thought out. (In fact, this was one of the things I was the most apprehensive about prior to seeing it. Because the book revolved around Katniss' thought process, I was afraid it would not translate well into a film. However, it was all very smooth, using Caesar Flickerman and the Gamemaker's room to explain what was going on.) Everything was very professional and so real. Costumes were fabulous, the sets were fabulous. Everything was perfect. <br/><br/>There were two minor things I did not like. First was the shaky camera at the beginning. It was part of the effects and becomes smoother once Peeta and Katniss head to the Capitol, but the first twenty minutes it is very hard to focus on the content because of the shaky camera. The only other thing I didn't like was the fact that Katniss never actually told Peeta that she wasn't in love with him. I feel like those who never read the book might not understand that Katniss thought their relationship was fake whereas Peeta is actually totally smitten with her. This was implied but I felt they could have gone deeper and explained it better. <br/><br/>I would not advise younger, less mature audiences to watch this movie however. It is very brutal, bloody and violent. For example, both main characters injure their legs severely and the wounds are extensively shown. However, if you can take the gore, I would advise that you immediately drive to the closest theatre and buy a ticket. You will not regret it - in fact, it will leave you hungry for more Hunger Games. <br/><br/>10/10"

It had everything that I loved about the book and the screenplay's omissions and additions where appropriate and sometimes brilliant.<br/><br/>Also I was worried about Hollywood watering down a female lead character, or changing her personality to match expected social norms. They did not. She is totally Katniss. The characters where all very good.<br/><br/>I was so impressed with everything overall. When I see an adaption of a book, this is what I want to see."

I, for one, admit that this movie made me cry, laugh, cheer, and scream (from mutated dogs, nasty)throughout the whole movie. Yes, there were some changes but not enough to change the whole story outline. I will say that the movie did cut through really fast, making it seem rushed, but when the Games finally started, the movie slowed down and looked closely into the effects. The fire scene was sketchy and confusing but overall, I was on the edge of my seat.

When I intended to see 'The Cabin in the Woods' I couldn't get in the cinema as my 'age' seemed to be a problem, so I thought, ""Lets go see The Hunger Games."" - I thought it was going to be rubbish, with the reviews and all; however it was one of the best action drama films I have EVER seen. I'm not exaggerating about it, do not listen to the reviews because the film is simply amazing. It should not be a 12A or PG- 13 but definitely a 15 or R because some of it is very disturbing and extremely graphic. It has an element of darkness and horror in parts and was quite spooky; however it made it all in all much better. The first 45 minutes is quite slow and dull but when the fight of survival kicks in it is amazing! Truly sensational. I am honestly saying this with true passion, it is amazing. If you liked the book then the film will startle you, in my opinion it was much better in the cinema than reading the book. Please, believe me, watch this film. You will love it."

However I ended up going anyway and it was a really good film although upsetting in some places but this was a vital part of the storyline and it worked well cinematically. I would definitely recommend this film to any one but in the audience were children about 9 years old with their parents and they were clearly effected by it so I wouldn't recommend any parent to take young children as the certificate already advises. The acting was brilliant especially Jennifer Lawerence who was very convincing with the hardships that her character has to go through."

It's always a risk seeing a film after you enjoy a book, on this occasion it didn't affect me. Not read the books, not a teenager, neither are my kids anymore and I loved it. I am fussy and don't watch rubbish, I prefer high end intelligent films and not the ones for the masses.<br/><br/>I was in two minds about this and only went as we had nothing else to do. Very glad that we did. I didn't need to know the story to understand that they were living in extreme poverty, I managed to work that out for myself. The acting has been criticized as 'shallow'??!! Unbelievable. I thought Jennifer Lawrence was fantastic. I also don't agree that the special effects were poor, I thought they were great and a big part of the movie.<br/><br/>Maybe some people are unable to suspend their disbelief and that is why they couldn't enjoy this film.

I do not care much for Woody Harrelson but he and Lenny Kravitz were both terrific in their supporting roles and Stanley Tucci, Elizabeth Banks, and Donald Sutherland took the most clichéd characters and each made them special in their own way.

Having not read the book or even heard of the series before seeing the trailer, I was surprised of how wrong I had been. When walking home from the cinema, I kept asking myself the question, why, why it wasn't great, what made it bad. And I found myself unable to answer my own questions. Other movies adapted from books, where I hadn't read the book before seeing the movie, I hated to ask the question ""but, why did he say that or why did that happen?"" and getting the answer ""you gotta read the book to understand that"".

","The Hunger Games was a well written and acted movie. The movie had a lot of heart. Jennifer Lawrence did a wonderful job and did so much with facial expressions. She said so much with her eyes. The bond Katniss has with Prim,Gale,Cinna and Rue are well done in the brief scenes they have. The movie succeeded were the book didn't. In making Katniss the hero and not just a pawn but the hero. Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson had a great sibling vibe about them. The matching black outfits remained me of Luke and Leai's white outfits in Star Wars. When the story turns it romantic for them it falls flat. They lack the romantic chemistry and sizzle. I was actually rolling my eyes and cringing at the romantic attempts. Unfortunately it's clear a triangle is coming like any predictable teen romance.predictable and also makes the girl in the middle annoying. Like I said in the hunger games it is as predictable as ever other teen romance. In triangles one you usually hate, one you pity or root for and the one in the middle gets annoying. Plus the girl always choices the one heavily feature in first book or film and like Jacob, Ducky from Pretty in Pink,etc the best friend does not get the girl. Hopefully the rest of the movies will focus more on the friendships and uprisings instead. Also In there brief time on screen Lenny Kravitz, Willow Shields, Liam Hemsworth and Amandla Stenberg were terrific."

","When I first read the cast list I was slightly disappointed; however after watching the film my opinions have all changed. The right people were certainly assigned the right roles and because of this a convincing and engaging performance was delivered. Josh Hutchersons portrayal of Peeta Mellark was heartwarming enough to make me warm to a character that I despised throughout the book trilogy - which is something that does not happen often. <br/><br/>The special effects looked for the most part real and the costumes (bar one of two outfits) were beautifully designed and suited both the setting and the character.<br/><br/>Dialogue was well thought out and kept me hooked throughout the entire 2 hours and 40 minutes. The characters were so well distinguished and varied that you'd be hard pushed not to find a character that you identify with making parts of the film very personal.<br/><br/>Really the only problem I have is that some of the scenes strayed from the original story - which shouldn't have happened with the author writing the script. The opening is slow to start and it is only when the tributes reach the Capitol that you feel the pace liven. <br/><br/>This is one of the few book adaptations that has actually worked and well worth the ticket fare. I thoroughly enjoyed this film and am waiting in anticipation for the sequel."
"BloodyMari87","10","4","13","4 April 2012"," Compelling and Truly Heartbreaking
","I will admit to not having read the books, but I will also stand by my belief that it shouldn't matter. A movie, based on a book or not, should be allowed to stand on its own. Of course it's not going to be an exact replica of the book come to life. If you detested the film adaptation of this book, I'm inclined to believe you went in to it with either too high an expectation or way too low. You were destined to hate it from the beginning. But I digress.<br/><br/>I found this movie absolutely compelling. I was moved from start to finish. To use the word ""enjoy"" would be wrong. I cannot say I found much enjoyment from the story at all. But that was the point, was it not? This is a story about a government hell bent on scaring it's people into submission. A government that is so desperate to keep the lower class in their place, they insist on twenty three sacrifices from the lower class each year. A government that insists on the sacrifice of children, no less. The class distinction was glaringly obvious and truly devastating. I found myself overwhelmed with heartache for the poor children forced into such a macabre situation.<br/><br/>I found the lavish lifestyles of those who live in the capital nauseating. Especially when seen through the eyes of children who have to slaughter their own food regularly to avoid starvation. The stark contrast in colors alone between the districts and the capital was fascinating. I was strangely reminded of the Emerald City from the Wizard of Oz. Watching the children continuously paraded in front of thousands of cheering upper class people was probably the most difficult aspect of the movie for me to watch. (Excluding of course the slaughtering scenes toward the end).<br/><br/>I was moved by many of the actors' portrayals of their roles. They were honest and believable and in some cases, truly frightening. I laughed (briefly) with them, cried with them, cheered and sneered right along side them.<br/><br/>After all of that it should come as no surprise that I found this film to be one of the very best I have seen in a long time. The tragic and horrific nature of the story was told with integrity, sincerity, and just the right amount of flare. Cannot wait to own my very own DVD of it."

","That means: 12+.You can read it on Wikipedia! The brutality was NOT described exaggerated. (Like in the Battle Royal novel - this is truly a horror Book) So please, research in the internet before you write things which are wrong. And to the people who don't know if they should watch the movie: Book and Movie complement each other! That is what Gary and also Suzanne said about it. Please, don't believe poor reviews.<br/><br/>Here is my Review: I was impressed by the books. These novels are the most impressive books I have ever read. Such a powerful and frightening story with many very important massages.<br/><br/>The acting was very powerful. Jennifer is the perfect Katniss (in my eyes) and she embodied her fear, courage and her strength perfectly. Josh: He is Peeta! I always liked him in previous movies and when he got the role I watched interviews on you-tube and I saw Peeta! Willow as Prim is just so cute and she got a lot of talent (Prim is one of my favorite characters). Liam, Elizabeth, Woody, Lenny, Wes, Donald were so great! I'm happy that they are in the movie. But one actor in this movie is very special to me: Alexander Ludwig. Cato is one of the most brutal Tributes. No, he is the most brutal! I could imagine Alex playing Cato, but what I saw on the big screen was much better and more frightening than I imagined. Especially the final scene.<br/><br/>The look of District 12, the Capitol and the Arena were much better than in my imagination. Especially the Capitol! These massive buildings, the lights and all these people. Impressive and frightening at the same time.<br/><br/>So, the movie has not missed its goal for me. It was like a bomb attack. For a long time I have not seen such a heavy and intense film! (I mean like The Road or Changeling). I think I've cried 4 times. Every day I have to think about all this what happened in the story. <br/><br/>May The Odds Be Ever In Your Favor. <br/><br/>Someone here wrote that they need a better writer for the next movies. Suzanne Collins was involved in writing on the Hunger Games script! AND she was involved in the Casting choices! She is not just one of the producers!<br/><br/>And here is something from Miss Lawrence for those who don't get the point of The Hunger Games: ""I took away that, over time, we're just becoming so desensitized to death. Humanity is becoming dulled to itself. We can watch people die on TV; we can watch a snowboarder fall off a mountain and die. We see dead bodies and blood on the nightly news. The things people can find on YouTube are crazy! We've become so numb to the shock factor. The world is obsessed with reality television, and in a world where history repeats itself, it's plausible, really, that our world could get there."" – Jennifer on what The Hunger Games say about humanity.<br/><br/>And here something from Gary Ross, what he says about the movie rating: ""I don't think it has to be violent in order to be urgent. For the majority of the movie Katniss is being pursued and it's a violent universe she's in. But that doesn't mean the violence has to be depicted gruesomely or exploited in any way."""

It's suspenseful, action packed, visually interesting, well cast and worth the price of the ticket. What more could you ask for in a movie? The one thing I liked as well is it jumped away from katniss from time to time and you got to see haymitch behinds the scenes trying to help, and see how the gamekeepers operate to make the games more interesting, why they make the moves they do instead of just guessing at it when you read. <br/><br/>Except for a little here and there, they kept Very true to the books, the things they left out weren't important to the plot at all. You have to realize many people who went to see the movies never read the books, so they film makers have to make it understandable to them as well. <br/><br/>So, to sum it up. It's a very entertaining movie, for those of you who have read the books: go into it knowing it won't be exactly the same thing and just try to enjoy it!

"andre_rox99","7","4","13","23 March 2012"," An OKAY Entertainer...
","THE HUNGER GAMES is a teen-action film directed by Gary Ross, starring Jennifer Lawrence, Josh Hutcherson, Donald Sutherland, and many other supporting cast.<br/><br/>So The Hunger Games, is based on a book about this country called Panem which consists of 12 Districts and its Capital. So a bunch of years ago, there was a District 13 but there was a war, which demolished 13. So to remind the whole of Panem that the Capital was still the big shot, every year they held a televised program called The Hunger Games, where one young girl and boy was chosen from each district as Tributes, where they would fight in an enclosed arena to the death where one would survive and crowned victor, and bring the tribute's district money and respect. So this time, Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence)'s sister gets chosen, and out of love for her sister, she volunteer's as tribute, and along with her Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) gets chosen... and the rest of the film tells us what happens to the both of them.<br/><br/>Okay, I read the books of Hunger Games, which is a series, and when I heard the movie was coming out, I was so hyped for it. I even forced my friends to come with me telling them the exact same story above, because it sounded so great, and come on, if you are a guy and just read that story, you gotta be pretty intrigued. So first day, I went for the Hunger Games, expecting mind-crushing action. I was all like ""YEEUUHH, kids fighting to death! What are the odds of it being bad?!?!"" Turns out, quite high. Okay, so this movie isn't THAATT bad, but it just totally changed my WHOLE opinion of Hunger Games, just because of a stupid rating. ""A RATING?! What does that have to do with anything"" you say. YES, a rating. From the story of Hunger Games, it is completely an R rated film! but they had to go ahead and mess that up and make it PG13, just because the books had its fame with teenagers. The book focuses more on action, which I loved about it. The film, on the other hand, does all it can to focus on the one thing which the book needed, because there was no way they could edit it out, which was the romance. I'm not blaming Suzanne Collins, it was 100% needed, yet she did her best to lower it down so that it wasn't that big a deal. The movie, because it was PG13 and couldn't put the action, decided to make the romance a big deal, and went ahead and messed up people's thoughts on Hunger Games. The only one time they had action was at the part when The Hunger Games actually starts, its brutal but they use shaky cam so you can barely see anything. Half-way through the film, I was wondering, ""Is this what I want from this film? Coz it sure as hell doesn't feel that way.""<br/><br/>In the end, this movie is an OKAY entertainer... because now they are making another one, as planned, but its going to be PG13, which makes me doubt myself on whether I should see it or not. See what this movie has done to me? However it isn't a twilight fest, don't worry, thats something Hunger Games will never do to you. It doesn't pull off that big a cheap trick."
"jon.h.ochiai","10","5","18","26 March 2012"," The Hero Emerges in The Hunger Games
","Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss in Zen-like focus draws her bow and aims her arrow to punctuate her point. Nothing personal. Making her point, she says. ""Thank you for your consideration."" Lawrence is amazing. Her Katniss is the brave and noble hero, who never forfeits being a woman, in fact it is the source of her courage and compassion in Suzanne Collins's ""The Hunger Games"" envisioned on the movie screen. After selflessly volunteering as Tribute to replace her younger sister Prim (fearful Willow Shields) for The Hunger Games, she consoles friend Gale (charismatic Liam Hemsworth). Gale, her blossoming love interest and hunting mate, reassures, ""You're stronger than they are!"" Katniss admits that she only hunts animals. Gale reminds that people are no different. <br/><br/>At the dramatic arc in the woods, Katniss kills a boy out of rage and vengeance—still in icy repose. What good can come of kids killing each other, in a bloody contest of survival? That is the paradox of Director and Writer Gary Ross's ""The Hunger Games"", based on the book by Suzanne Collins. Ross, Collins, and Billy Ray wrote the screenplay based on the first book of Collins's enormously popular bestselling trilogy. I have not read the books. One of my friends Carol, also a published author, had told me that the books were great. I took her word. ""The Hunger Games"" is awesome: You have a young girl, who is the powerful hero of the tale. Jennifer Lawrence makes ""The Hunger Games"" work. Katniss is not the physically strongest, fastest or most skilled warrior. However, she is the toughest and she's smart. In a great scene before the Games, she tells her costumer Cinna (fostering Lenny Kravitz), ""I'm not afraid."" And both Gale and Peeta, who fall in love with Katniss, are attracted to her courage and character. Collins gets her hero transformation right. <br/><br/>""The Hunger Games"" depicts the post apocalyptic world, where the United States is now Panem which consists of 12 Districts. President Snow (calmly menacing Donald Sutherland) seemingly uses starvation and shiny objects to oppress the population. These are the 74th Hunger Games. Every year each District sends a boy and a girl between the ages of 12 and 18 to the Capital to compete in The Hunger Games. The Hunger Games are like the reality TV ""Survivor"" on steroids combined with cage fighting, where children compete to the death—only one winner. <br/><br/>Though set in the distant future the story opens in Katniss Everdeen's home District 12 which looks like a 1930's coal mining town. The dichotomy is that each cabin has a flat screen to watch The Hunger Games. Ross and cinematographer Tom Stern (""Million Dollar Baby"") have a serene affinity for the land—filmed mostly in North Carolina. The music by T-Bone Burnett and James Newton Howard provides a haunting down home atmosphere. Katniss lives with her Mom and sister Primrose (innocent and fragile Shields). Her Dad died in mining accident. Katniss helps feed her family as an expert archer and hunter.<br/><br/>When Tribute Escort Effie Trinket (seemingly vapid and unrecognizable Elizabeth Banks) selects Primrose in The Hunger Games lottery, Katniss (Lawrence) volunteers to take her place, and save her life. The other participant selected is Peeta (subdued and strong Josh Hutcherson). They travel to the Capitol to train and compete in The Hunger Games. They meet their mentor and former winner Haymitch Abernathy (deceptively powerful Woody Harrelson), who occurs as a drunk washout. Harrelson is one of the wonderful touches: As Haymitch he distinguishes the greatness in both Katniss and Peeta. He schools them in playing the Game. Peeta reveals that he has always been in love with Katniss. And she practically strangles him after his disclosure. <br/><br/>""The Hunger Games"" has a broader metaphor. When President Snow talks with Host Seneca Crane (meticulously charming Wes Bentley), he says that the only thing more dangerous than fear is hope. The Hunger Games exist to kill all hope. Amidst the atrocity of children killing each other for celebrity and food, the hero emerges in Katniss, who inspires others. Lawrence never sacrifices Katniss's humanity and boldly acts in the presence of fear. She gets amazing support from a talented cast. Stanley Tucci balances flamboyance and awareness as talk show host Caesar Flickerman. Amandla Stenberg is touching and powerful as young Rue, who befriends Katniss. Hutcherson is vulnerable and brave as Peeta. In the story Peeta can throw a 100 lb. weight 50 feet, but this is never used as a logical threat. Granted the twist is that Katniss is the savior. <br/><br/>The fighting scenes, including the climatic fight, are difficult to discern in the quick cut edits—maybe not Ross's strength. ""The Hunger Games"" is not an action movie, but action threaded. This is a minor point in the big picture. ""The Hunger Games"" is the great classic hero story that inspires others to dare to be great. Jennifer Lawrence is the awesome hero Katniss. Bring on the revolution and the sequel."
"femorais","10","5","18","24 March 2012"," Intriguing
","I saw the Hunger Games yesterday, and although I have read the books, I think the movie is spot on. What they cut made sense, what they added made sense. But most importantly, I watched something that worked as a movie, not just as an adaptation. Imagine my surprise as I was leaving the theater pretty satisfied (I'd give it a 8/10 at that time), and hear someone comment that it was ""pretty boring, and there are still two others to come? What will the movies be about if the games are already over?"", and I realized how the movie might come across to some people: an action movie with a sexy female hero and typical cartoon villains trying to kill her. But that was not the point of the movie at all. It's not a story about Katniss (the main character), violent games and romance on the side. It's a story about oppression. And a pretty good one at that. <br/><br/>The Capitol creates the Hunger Games with the objective of ending rebellions before they begin. They make the twelve districts remember, each year, how powerless they are to act against the capitol, and also makes the districts hate each other instead of the capitol by making one district's teenagers kill the other's. Then Katniss comes and semi- unintentionally turns the system around by starting to bring unity to the districts instead of distrust, and at the end of the movie exposes how fragile the whole system actually is.<br/><br/>""Do you know why we have a winner? Because the only thing more powerful than fear is hope. A small spark is fine as long as it's contained"" - That quote by the ""evil"" president Snow summarizes the premise of the movie. Katniss is that spark; she knows that rebelling won't end well for her and her family, but she still ends up accidentally (or is it?) bringing hope to the districts by showing them that they can, indeed, fight against the capitol - whether she wins the games or not is incidental. And that is why this movie, actually, this story, is genius. <br/><br/>That was just on the story part, though. I have seen a lot of people comment on 2 things (aside from the boredom from lack of action thing which I already commented about above): the shaky camera and the ""horrible costumes and make up"". The camera is indeed shaky, but the friends that watched the movie with me didn't even notice it; I only noticed it because I was looking for it (read too many reviews before watching it). If it bothers you that much, then I guess you won't like it, but your mileage may vary. As for the costumes and make up, it's supposed to be like that. That's their fashion sense. The book emphasizes that for Katniss, they look hideous.<br/><br/>Another thing that I found rather interesting were the people saying that Cato and the Career tributes (tributes who train their whole lives and volunteer for the games) were bad because they were just typical bully evil jerk villains. Villains? Were they? Out of the 24 tributes in the arena, who all have the same goals, to kill all the other tributes, some are considered evil and some aren't? This is exactly what I was talking about when I said that some people missed the point; the fact is that the villain wasn't the other tributes, the mutations, etc. It was the capitol, and the fact that many people forgot about the capitol and just took the other tributes as enemies just proves how the scenario described in the movie is not so unbelievable as it seems to some.<br/><br/>In the end, instead of the 8 I was going to give it, I had to give it a 10 after I saw how many people missed the point of the movie, and that made me realize the story was much deeper than I thought. If you go to this movie expecting an unending action scene with a simple, obvious plot, or if you don't like shaky cameras, you will be disappointed. This movie definitely isn't ""easy watching"", and you have to pay attention and read between the lines for it to make sense, and come into the theater with an open mind to enjoy it."
"Troy_Campbell","8","5","18","23 March 2012"," Ignore the Twilight comparisons, this is great!
","Despite what you might have read or heard from all the lazy promoters out there, this is no Twilight. Yes, this is a film adaptation of the first of a book series (three to be exact) that are adored by teens and young adults the world over. Yes, the tale is told from the POV of a 16 y.o. girl. Yes, there are two boys who are smitten with said girl. But no, this is not a weepy love story with shonky action and dubious acting. The Hunger Games – set in a dystopian future where two adolescents from each of the 12 districts of Panem (nee U.S.A.) are chosen to engage in a televised battle to the death where only one survives – is a thought-provoking and ambitious dramatic blockbuster that tackles themes such as oppression and class divide, all the while offering up thrilling (and surprisingly violent) set pieces and intriguing character arcs. The protagonist, Katniss Everdeen, is played to perfection by Jennifer Lawrence (Mystique from X-Men: First Class), who injects the ideal amount of both strength and vulnerability into Katniss and subsequently earns the audience's whole-hearted investment into her plight. Elsewhere Josh Hutcherson is solid (if not as powerful as Lawrence) as fellow competitor, and potential love interest, Peeta Malark, whilst older cast members Woody Harrelson, Elizabeth Banks, Wes Bentley, Stanley Tucci (very funny) and Donald Sutherland provide terrific support in their smaller roles. The Hunger Games is not perfect – the CGI could've been better – however it's an engrossing event that deserves to attract widespread critical acclaim along with its guaranteed massive box-office haul. Do yourself a favour and ignore the Twilight comparisons, this is well worth a visit to the cinema."
"blossoms-733-387580","8","3","9","5 August 2014"," An excellent role model for girls
","Katniss Everdeen is the hero that girls have been waiting for. She is strong, self-reliant, fearless, independent, and a leader. She is no female supporting character to some beefcake macho dude with an ego the size of Texas that has megalomania stamped all over it (eg, Tony Stark/Iron Man). She is the de facto leader of a rebellion against an authoritarian, autocratic state that beats its citizens into submission. When I read the book I felt thrilled and even proud that a writer has finally created a story about a powerful young woman in a role that is conventionally reserved for men...at least in Hollywood. Katniss doesn't allow her world to revolve around any boy. She has far more serious problems and romance generally takes a backseat to other priorities. But she is deeply loyal to her friends.<br/><br/>I am looking forward to ""Mockingjay"" and hope that the director will do the book justice and present Katniss as the reluctantly capable and adored hero that she is in the book. Katniss is a modern-day Joan of Arc but without the religious overtones and virginal connotations. She is just a normal, red-blooded young woman with two love interests and lots of courage! While the directing has some issues and the book seems like it may have plagiarized some elements from another book, this isn't the film's fault.<br/><br/>When I read the harshly negative, overly critical reviews of this film here I can't help but wonder if it's coming from some emotionally adolescent man fuming at the existence of a strong female action hero who isn't designed to cater to men, but to instead be an inspiration to women and most of all, girls."

","Katniss volunteer to participate in Hunger Games instead of her sister and the movie starts. Hunger Games is between the rich and the poor. The rich people choose randomly one boy and one girl from each 12 districts. To be able to win the game the winner has to kill all the others except teammate. Peeta and Katniss are from the same districts and they are teammate. Also Peeta loves Katniss and they support each other in this difficult game. <br/><br/>I think the movie is worth to watch and I advice people to watch. The artists acts well. The music and images are effective. Before I watch the movie, I read the book. The book was very impressive. Then the movie seems to me not impressive as much as the book. In the book there are many details but in the movie they is not enough details. Therefore the movie is a little bit shallow. Still I recommend people to watch."
"StephZinnes","10","3","9","24 February 2014"," A fantastic film that should not simply be dismissed.
","As someone who dislikes following the general populace, I was extremely put off from seeing The Hunger Games. I had never been a fan of books that were turned into movies and found that the biggest turn off from a movie is a huge cult like following. I eventually bit my tongue and went to see it with one of my best friends, expecting a mediocre film that was decent enough, but not worth a second watch. I have to say that after I watched it I knew I was very wrong.<br/><br/>As someone who did not read the book, I went in completely blind. I knew the general idea of the story and that was enough to at least fill in the small parts that the movie misses, which is unavoidable. What I thought would be another Twilight ended up being alternate world with oppression and triumph as some of the main ideas of the film. I feel like everything fit together perfectly and had all of the characteristics needed of a great movie.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, some people did not enjoy it as much as I did because they already read the books and were unhappy of certain parts being left out or felt that they were too high and mighty to watch something that many others were fawning over, as I had been before, to watch a movie and enjoy it for what it is and they really missed out."

They act so real and there are some violence in the movie but actually it is not that bad. The book and the movie aren't very different but they have some changes which are quite important in the other parts of the book so i am not exactly sure how the director is going to put that in if you don't here about it in the first movie and then in the second one... some people who have rated this movie rated very low and this movie doesn't deserve that because it is quite realistic and it must of took them ages to film and make as they had to make the creatures,the blow up, the effects and so much more. I know that they made it to a 12+ but i think it is a good age and in the book there isn't much violence to be honest and the movie wouldn't be that good if the movie wasn't 12+!!!

"richy1024","8","3","9","3 October 2012"," Picturesque scenery and wavering melodies, overshadowed by the brute unethical but the cult of survival.
","Once again the news of an up-and-coming novel series hits the paperback mantelpiece, news of a cinema expedition earths the media with a flourish of brand new protagonists who have intermittently had recognisable roles in many of their films but never had the ruptured their stance in the big time. Jennifer Lawrence (X-Men: First Class) participates as Katniss Everdeen, a mentally cool sixteen year old heroine who volunteers in place of her younger sister to take part in a periodic competition of survival and wit called The Hunger Games, a game of anonymous youngsters killing each other until they are whittled down to a champion. Selection is highly documented, the process is simple and unsystematic, one boy and one girl brawling in an unprecedented, just to make money and provide entertainment for the voracious masses. This journeying rampage has been seen in Japan with Battle Royale, and the nauseating fierce interpretation of the contest in The Condemned starring ex-wrestler Steve Austin alongside Vinnie Jones. Beyond this, games of survival have been part of the ethos of life since the ancient Roman and Greek sports. Survival sports have been overwhelmed with a new design, new combating technique and warfare, establishing itself upon the terrace with such mêlée films as Gladiator.<br/><br/>Collins' novel poses a ravishing and penetrating energy; it's a stirring fantasy with copious abundance of themes, with innumerable avenues to explore character development and situational circumstances. Katniss is a character of riding emotions. She comprehends with the intricate notions of the game, the impending sincerity of death but also accompanies an astonishing warrior psyche, believing in the decisions she makes and the philosophy of survival techniques. The earthly feel of Katniss' hiding in the trees whilst she plots her safety or her next move really provide the story with a eccentric feel of the location. The futuristic tones of Collins's writings offer an alternative diversion to the aggression, providing us with an eccentric fairytale feel to it with an enchanting soundtrack.<br/><br/>For once there are no sexual implications surrounding a female persona on the big screen. Instead we revel with the composite temperament of the mind as the violence has been stripped back from the novels; readers may find themselves a modestly disenchanted. A full catalogue of pointers such as cynicism have been toned down by themes of lighter tenor of selfishness, defiance and imprudent teenage pronouncements. There is a distinct thesis of the division of class. In District 12, Katniss' home village scour for food, clothe themselves in grey overalls, whereas the brightness of colour surrounding the mighty rich encompasses the differentiation between each district.<br/><br/>The leisurely pace of the tale allows us to appreciate character growth, effectively giving us the opportunity to understand the notions of the trilogy. Not only do we feel the emotion of Katniss we instantly feel attached to Peeta's (Josh Hutcherson) devotion and affection for his counterpart despite the two barely crossing each other's paths in the village. Hutcherson bright performance really tells the tale of Peeta's frail characteristics exploring his nervous qualities but knowingly suggesting he possesses great loyalty and honour to the sword. There is more than an inch of primal impact on the audience as the mystery of the battle increases the eventual showdown by using striking cinematography and resisting the push to provide the audience with an action packed beginning. The build up of tension is quite electrifying, giving a reflection of the various moods that encompass the temperament of the lead up to the ultimate clash. Truly encapsulating."
"paul2001sw-1","8","3","9","23 September 2012"," Good until the end
","For a mainstream thriller derived from a best-selling, teen-oriented book, 'The Hunger Games' is actually quite good. Indeed, more than that, it's gripping and far from stupid, its use of computer graphics unobtrusive (you could have made a version of the story without any, but it still works in its current form), and there's no attempt to over-romanticise the story or laden it down with uneccessary sex. It's Hollywood, of course, so the most beautiful and stylishly dressed people are the heroes (including heroine Jennifer Lawrence, who to her credit is not only lovely but also good in her role); the ridiculous and ugly the bad guys; but this aside, one might even call it a serious movie. The only thing slightly disappointing is the ending, in which the heroes appear to choose individual salvation over raising class consciousness, and the tone of the movie implies that this is actually a good thing. I don't know how the book worked, but there's something slightly limp in such a finale, and disappointing after a generally well-put together film."
"hakro807","9","3","9","6 September 2012"," Pretty darn awesome.
","I haven't written a review for IMDb for years, but Hunger Games made me so. It's not the perfect movie or with a perfect casting, but it's pretty darn close with its strong musical score, for the most part believable characters, an engaging story and a pacing that only drops for short moments.<br/><br/>Especially the main actress Jennifer Lawrence deserve plenty of praise for her roll as Katniss Everdeen.<br/><br/>In a sentence - It could have been just a popcorn-flick but was much more rewarding than that. If anything it made me reflect about society's's use of large-scale violence and all the lives being destroyed in the process."
"starsteamer","9","3","9","24 August 2012"," Straight as an arrow!
","After enjoying the dystopian reality of the novel, I was unsure if this could be adapted into the medium of film. I was concerned that the story itself was just too long and in-depth for the time constraints of a movie. However, I was pleasantly surprised. Casting is genius, particularly with Donald Sutherland as President Snow and Woody Harrelson as Haymitch. Jennifer Lawrence plays an acceptable Katniss. The setting is well done without taking over the film. The Capital's garish clothes are perfect and contrast visually with the bland poverty of the districts. Surprisingly, the violence is not particularly watered down. It is instead inferred with the camera only viewing the before and after. This works well in a story where the violence is integral to the plot. The Hunger Games themselves are well done. The brutality is emphasised by the switches to the control room and the concentration on the 'game' aspect. There is thankfully very little obvious CGI which could have been overdone. My only negative comment about the film and the reason I did not award it 10 stars was because the lack of focus on the 'hunger' aspect of the society. In the novel, Katniss and Peeta gorge themselves on food. Unfortunately in the film, they do not. This means that the poverty of the districts is not viewed as extreme as it is supposed to be. The viewer cannot believe any people who have lived on the edge of starvation their whole lives would sit in a dining car full of food without eating it... In conclusion, The Hunger Games is an excellent adaptation of the novel. Actually one of the best film adaptations I have seen. Worth a look whether you have read the novel or not."

This film was absolutely brilliant, although I still don't quite understand the logic of having people separated out into districts and being forced into participating, I was gripped throughout the entire film! The effects were brilliant and the acting was very good and although it's based on a book it's still very original. I also love the fact that it's totally unpredictable and you become very attached to some of the characters and you know that they'll eventually have to die because there can only be one winner. I cried very much when characters that I did like had to die and this is a very good sign because I hardly ever cry from films! This really was an excellent film and I definitely recommend it."

"PaddyReagan","9","3","9","29 April 2012"," The Hunger Games--More Than Meets the Eye
","With so many reviewers in attack mode I'm almost hesitant to enter this arena. But, I feel bound to do so, to step past the multiple critiques of actors and technique, to examine The Hunger Games in am alternative way. <br/><br/>We can never be sure how the stories we read evolved. Are they superficial flows of ideas, bound together by a simple plot or did the author or screenwriter fill the book or movie with complex literary devices that tested our attention during endless lectures in college?<br/><br/>Here, in The Hunger Games, the simple premise of a long past conflict was the stated basis. But, there is much more—many hints and suggestions, that encourage us to imagine our own back story—simple or complex as we wish it to be. <br/><br/>First of all, this destructive conflagration occurred at least 75 years in the past, hence the 74th Hunger Games. The President, Donald Sutherland, in all his ungroomed splendor, was probably the only resident of the Capital old enough to remember which explains a sensitivity to any hint of solidarity and rebellion. The Districts were splinter groups, cast into the wild, relegated to provide elemental sustenance for the Capital whose residents were obviously successful in bringing the great rebellion to a bitter end. Scattered and fenced, these Districts were guarded and forbidden from contact with others. <br/><br/>In this context, The Hunger Games was an effort to establish competition among these districts, to engender hate as a common bond with each other and against all other districts. That there was one winner focused this hatred on that district. The games deflected mutual hatred for the Capital and substituted it for the competition. In this role, the competitors became the gladiators in a futuristic but just as deadly coliseum. The victor presented as hero for a year, touring other Districts as a proxy of the Capital and its power. <br/><br/>This was centralized power in its most potent form. The Districts were kept hungry, near starvation, and worked in an environment reminiscent of pre-union industry. Indeed, glimpses of District 12 reminded us of America's own Appalachia during its rugged coal mining days. <br/><br/>This was the backdrop against which The Hunger Games were held—Olympic pageantry meets Roman arena. Hints of this volatile situation were common: the symbolic salute of assembled masses, the battles between Peacekeepers and workers on factory floors, and the paranoia of the President that ended in the demise of the Gamesmaker. <br/><br/>The Hunger Games was a splendid effort. It was a condensation to be sure and a better experience for those of us who read the book(s) beforehand. For those who criticized Katniss as too svelte for District 12, consider that she was a hunter whose family ate better than most. That the cat had a scene in the film and the goat did not—well, there must be some compromises. <br/><br/>This is the first chapter in what will be, based on its success, a trilogy and we'll learn much about these characters and the Districts. Like Harry Potter, a series of books written for a teen-aged audience has captured the imagination of adult readers. That the reality of death was downplayed so completely in the film was both a tribute to the director and a gift to a younger audience who otherwise would not be able to see the film at all."
"bshannon718","7","3","9","24 April 2012"," Very Good, With Some Minor Issues
","The Hunger Games, did a splendid job, especially considering all of the hype it had leading up to its release. For me the Hunger Games is kind of like Harry Potter, except a little bit past my time, and not as good. As much as I enjoyed this movie, there were quite a few things that bothered me, as well as a number of great moments. Let's start with the negatives: 1) Too many awkward close ups 2) Not enough complexity, or showing of how the characters really feel, like it was in the novel 3) Pg-13, the novel was R-rated, I'm not saying that violence makes a movie, but in the case of the Hunger Games it actually does. Now for the positives: 1) Great Acting 2) Tense, well directed action scenes 3) Brilliant use of CGI 4) Very good at putting a face to the characters we read about. In the end, this movie without a doubt deserves an 8/10, and that isn't anything to sneeze at. I definitely recommend this to anyone who is even remotely interested, or whoever read the novel."
"Dory_Darko","8","3","9","23 April 2012"," Beautifully grotesque.
","The Hunger Games is a new concept in a long line of post-apocalyptic future fantasies. Where other stories of the same genre often deal with technology and artificial intelligence as the main threat to human existence, Hunger Games actually takes us back to Roman times, with a revitalised version of ""Panem et Circenses"" or ""Bread and Circuses"". Simply put; human devastation as mass entertainment. Welcome to Panem: formerly known as The United States of America, where every year, a young man and woman from each of the twelve districts are selected to fight each other to the death, with only one possible survivor. These Games are broadcast on national television as a means to keep the people happy and submissive.<br/><br/>Considering the fact that this film is based on a teen book series (written by Suzanne Collins), I can't help but feel this concept is pretty far out there, and actually it's kind of sick. It's not a pretty idea to think that one day we might live in a world where watching young people, ranging from 12 to 18 years old, brutally murder each other is considered to be a form of mass entertainment. Thankfully, this is 'just' a story, and I must say, a very entertaining one at that (no pun intended).<br/><br/>The story revolves around the two youngsters from District 12, where the people are dirt poor and life is utterly desolate. 16-year-old Katniss Everdeen volunteers as 'tribute' to fight in the Hunger Games, after her little sister is initially selected. Her male counterpart is Peeta Mellark, and together they set off to train for and participate in the Games.<br/><br/>The character of Katniss is played by Jennifer Lawrence, and she is terrific. Actually, she is my biggest recommendation for watching this film. Before this, I had only seen her in X- Men: First Class and thought she was pretty good, but after seeing The Hunger Games, it's not hard to see why this 21-year-old already has her first Oscar nomination under her belt. She has a very natural quality about her, which makes it very easy to make you empathise with her character. She's not a superficial, happy-go-lucky kind of girl; she's actually very sullen, not even particularly likable. And yet you just love her from the get go. I guess it's charisma, and Jennifer Lawrence definitely has it.<br/><br/>Actually, this film is full of great actors. One of the greatest is definitely Stanley Tucci, who plays his most flamboyant role yet. His character (Caesar Flickerman, the TV-host who emcees the Games) is ridiculously over-the-top, but brilliantly amusing. With blue hair, prosthetic teeth and a big horse's smile which he flashes incessantly, he looks like a PG-13 version of the Joker. And if you're at all familiar with Tucci's work and talent, you know just what I mean when I say he's making this character appear to be oh-so nice, yet subtly sadistic at the same time. He's just great, period. Woody Harrelson also has a pretty interesting role as Haymitch Abernathy, a once-winner of the Hunger Games, who now mentors Katniss and Peeta in their training. He's scruffy and gnarly, basically just typically another weird Woody character, which is always worth the watch. Wes Bentley plays Seneca Crane, a character most notable for his unusual facial hair: he sports a beard Lucifer himself would be proud of. However, the biggest surprise to me was Elizabeth Banks, whom I am well familiar with, but never really cared for because I only know her from superficial, comedic roles. I was pleasantly surprised to see that she can also play challenging roles like this one. She plays Effie Trinket, a bizarre, neo-Renaissance type from the richest District, big wig, crazy make-up and all. She's pretty much the female version of Tucci's character and she was a delight to watch, beautifully grotesque in all her decadence.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, it can't all be great. I had three major problems with this film. One: if you haven't read the book, there's a lot that doesn't make sense. They really should have spent a little more time explaining everything, because more than once it simply wasn't clear to me what was going on and why. Two: Peeta's character. It could be just me of course, but he annoyed the crap out of me. He just comes across as such a sissy that it's frustrating to watch. Katniss burns her leg and deals with it. Peeta cuts his leg and stays lying in a cave because he ""can't walk"". And then he lets her take care of him, at the risk of her own life. Give me a break. Three: totally disappointing climax. I was waiting for fireworks, for Katniss having to make brutal decisions, but this never happened. It just kind of faded out.<br/><br/>And this is how you can clearly tell this story has a mainly teenage demographic, and they obviously wanted to keep it PG-13. Because despite the sometimes pretty brutal violence, nasty use of weaponry and tomato ketchup-a-plenty, overall the whole just lacked, well... balls. You can tell they tried to spike things up a bit here and there, but the film failed to make things truly interesting at moments where it definitely should have been. In my opinion, had they decided to make this rated-R, it would have been infinitely better.<br/><br/>Having said that, you can rest assured there is still plenty to enjoy. Visually it is absolutely awesome and simply beautiful. The costumes and make-up are great, as are the CGI effects. The characters (aside from Peeta...) are great, and the whole futuristic 'universe' that is created is pretty inventive.<br/><br/>There is actually still a lot more I would like to say, but I've reached my word-limit, so I'll just leave you with this: Thumbs up!"

","First of all, let me just say that this is really the review that makes sense. I don't see how this film can have some such low ratings. Whilst watching this film, you need to forget about the book and think that this started as a film.<br/><br/>The scenes are effective and action packed which keeps you wanting more! Surprisingly, it didn't seem to go on for 2 hours 22 minutes. The acting was great and believable for all the characters. This film was... different,in a good way, to other films with reasons like the camera angles and effects. There's nothing much more to say except you'll be sorry if you miss this cinematic experience and that this film definitely deserves a 9/10! I hope you use my advice,book readers, on not thinking about the book because if you do, you'll struggle to enjoy the amazing movie! The hunger games is definitely a MUST SEE MOVIE!"
"vladtopliceanu","9","3","9","22 April 2012"," A very good science, fiction action, drama film
","The Hunger Games is a great science fiction, action and drama film. I will not by a hypocrite and tell you guys that it was a nice movie but it had some stupid things in it just to appear lofty. I really liked The Hunger Games! I do not consider it to be actual Oscar material, but it is a great film that keeps you interested and makes you anxious to see what happens next.<br/><br/>It's weird to say this, because she is only 21 years old, but I have always loved Jennifer Lawrence as an actress. I first saw her in Winter's Bone, and after that I tried to find other movies in which she starred. And I must mention that I liked her in most of her performances. In The Hunger Games she stars as Katniss Everdeen, and I think she nails the role perfectly.<br/><br/>I liked the way Gary Ross directed this film, considering it is only his third film(as a director). The script isn't that great, but I guess that in this kind of a film it's not fundamental for it to be so. The makeup artist did a very good job, so congratulations to him/her also.<br/><br/>The one place the director should've insisted more, was the relationship between Jennifer Lawrence and John Hutcherson. I have not read the book, although I intend to, but I think he should have defined their relationship a bit better. The main reason for this, is because in some parts of the film I kind of got confused about how they really felt about each other.<br/><br/>What can I say more above the fact that I am really looking forward to the next film in this franchise? Probably that for the first time after a very long period, a movie convinced me to read the books it was based on. Check this movie out, trust me, you won't be disappointed."
"katsinspace-347-386800","8","3","9","19 April 2012"," Amazing movie
","It's a really good action-packed movie. In the same kind of Harry Potter or The king of the ring, this one is more poignant. Nothing is predictable. There is a moving plot and when you start to see it, you can't stop before the end. You can feel different emotions like blanching, crying, being afraid. Surprising movie. The acting is really good and it's interesting don't have any famous actors. Like that, people will see this movie without expectation about acting. The main character, the girl who is chosen is touching and you are transported in this imaginary world. They created a completely different world from our world. Maybe a possible vision of the future where there will be a lot of injustice between poor people and rich people."
"Fields201","8","3","9","18 April 2012"," Running Man With Metaphors
","I'm a little late in seeing Hunger Games due to having somewhat of a life lately and not being able to catch up with the latest flicks. Hype got me in that seat and the fact that Jennifer Lawrence is pretty hot. I feared that this would be another Twilight but thankfully it's much better than that piece of garbage.<br/><br/>Hunger Games follows a Running Man competition when two people from each district must hunt and kill each other for food for the districts. This is entertainment for the rich people, see, and us po' people must earn our way if we want to survive. Two things about this scenario strikes me: 1) This could happen because the Government and rich people are getting worse and 2) Someone during the development (possibly the author of the book) must have played too many online games because that's what this reminded me of. Not that I really invest much time in those but I'm just saying.<br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence does a fine job carrying this movie and the characters and plot devices keeps you from getting bored. However, there really wasn't much character development to get you fully invested to characters who contribute to important scenes. There's a scene where Jennifer Lawrence was crying over a character and I really didn't feel much emotion, mainly because this character she was crying for never had the time to develop. Another thing that bugs me and I hear it's in the book is the costumes. They were just so outlandish and weird for my tastes. I was never really big on future movies anyway so I digress. I love the sets, though.<br/><br/>But Hunger Games was a really good movie and I'll catch the sequel earlier when it comes out. Hopefully I'm not busy then."
"smt-nasser","8","3","9","18 April 2012"," Gripping and well paced
","Let me begin my review by saying that I haven't read the books, and as such I had no preconceived notions going into the theatre. From reading some of the more negative reviews, I think this may have a lot to do with how I feel about this movie.<br/><br/>I found the world that this film constructed mesmerising. It immediately engaged me at both an intellectual and emotional level. Being a guy who normally has a lot of space between his thoughts and his emotions, this is a rare and welcome surprise in a movie. You immediately connect with the plight of the people in the District's and develop a curiosity as to how the city folk live. When their opulence, disconnection and disregard for other people becomes clear, your hatred for the system that Katniss, Peeta and the others have to live under becomes almost palpable. Heck, I was practically ready to cry out for and end to the inhumanity, inequality and injustice right there in the theatre and start a revolution! On several occasions I actually felt horror and upset when some of the younger characters are killed and hatred for the characters that would kill younger children with little regard. I don't think that you have to be an intellectual or political person to feel this way. I imagine the books are so popular because they tug at our own intrinsic sense of compassion and humanity and if this is the case, the movie does an amazing job of transferring that to the silver screen.<br/><br/>The script was somewhat minimalist and fast moving in my opinion. It feels like anything that didn't further the narrative was cut. Every scene contributed something and seemed to be another important development or milestone in the story. <br/><br/>As far as the casting is concerned - I can't really compare the actors chosen to the way that they were described in the book and as such I had no real expectations as to how the actors needed to look in order to fit the part. However, I will say that I was struck immediately by the depth of character that Jennifer Lawrence (Katniss Everdeen) managed to portray. I felt immediately that the character being portrayed was a rare kind of woman - a strong, determined and exceptionally intelligent leader. Lawrence's performance has an immediacy and a directness to it, verging on a minimalism which is strikingly effective and is the kind of performance that I feel is marginalised in today's world of over-acting and over-reacting in every scene.<br/><br/>The other main part, certainly in terms of screen time, is played by Josh Hutcherson (Peeta Mellark). Again I think this is a solid performance and I bought into the character portrayed, finding him convincing as a potential partner to Katniss as well as a key driving force in their survival. Some people seem to be complaining that he doesn't fit the big and strong description given (apparently) in the books. Personally, however, I actually find that couples that appear too picture perfect become less believable. If anything, the fact that he at times appears slightly smaller than Lawrence lends their relationship a kind of reality, in a story that is ultimately about depth of character, that I feel is far too often missing from Hollywood and its fake plastic world. Life is messy and very rarely picture perfect, and if a movie about the tragedies of death, the horrors of poverty, oppression, inhumanity and war can't reflect that then what can? By accident or design I think Hutcherson's casting is actually a good thing.<br/><br/>I don't have time (or available word limit remaining) to review all of the other factors that went into this movie in detail. Suffice it to say that I thought every actor on the screen was excellent and delivered believable performances with real depth of character. The effects were minimal but well used and the way that the world drew on both Ancient Roman/Gladiatorial and Nazi architecture and imagery to reinforce the dystopian nature of the society was a nice touch. <br/><br/>Overall: a fast paced film with great acting and an intrinsically moving and well represented story line. Go see it."
"tanja-kaaria","8","3","9","4 April 2012"," Hunger Games from the view of a person who read the books more than once
","I went to see this movie with my boyfriend who has not read the books. He loved it, I felt a bit let down but I was expecting it as the books were very good and nothing ever compares to the book, no matter how good the movie is... well maybe LOTR extended version but that's about it.<br/><br/>They did change some things, like how Katniss got the mockingjay pin or how Cato died so quickly etc. They also let some things very vague, like why was Gale's name in the lottery 42 times. I actually had to explain it to my boyfriend because he didn't understand it. They also didn't include Avoxes (which is weird as they will play a role in the last story) and also the rest of the prep team was missing (which again is strange as they are part of the 3rd story in the books).<br/><br/>Besides these quite minor details I found the movie quite entertaining. But it is definitely not a massive cult movie unfortunately. The capitol was quite well made but for example the flaming suits in the parade just seemed cheap to what I had imagined in my mind. The whole production actually seemed quite cheap, which is a shame because it had potential to be so much more.<br/><br/>But if I have to say some good things about this movie I have to mention the actors. I think the casting was extremely well done, a special mention to Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss, Elizabeth Banks as Effie, Josh Hutcherson as Peeta (so cute) and Donald Sutherland as president Snow. Also the music was pretty good.<br/><br/>Lets hope they learn from this 1st movie and make the next two less shaky and PLS make it rated 16 or something. We need to have blood in a movie where the whole idea is around people killing each other, jeez for once stop thinking about the kids and make a proper movie for the adults...<br/><br/>8 for a great story (thanks to the book) and for great actors. Unfortunately the director really should be fired."

","Overall,best movie in years.Best for those who have read book.Written in first person the novel is an easy read though more graphic and as disturbing to any parent of teenage or tween children than the film but very little is left out.The editing is clipped and hand held camera unsteady at start of film with many shots less than.5-.25 s but it slows down once the tributes are selected and the effects are worked in seamlessly as the characters arrive at the capital.Hopefully the point of the film,it's message against violence,oppression,racism and economic inequality is not lost on the bulk of those viewing it. Go see this film-excellent cast well directed-never drags and sets new bar for science fiction."
"rebecca-ry","8","3","9","29 March 2012"," Excellent, a breath of fresh air
","'The Hunger Games' has received a lot of hype lately and it has deserved every bit of it! The story is great, I regret not reading the books before going to see the film because it's such an interesting story. The script is very good, dialogue can be a bit bland at points but it can be excellent in certain scenes. Actors in this film perform really well, there's no weak links aside from a few of the district tributes but they do not get a lot of screen time anyway. Jennifer Lawrence is, of course, amazing. She has shown she is a serious actress and has really out-done herself in this. Josh Hutcherson also performed well along with Liam Hemsworth despite not having a lot of screen time, he still makes an impression. My favourite performance however, was by Stanley Tucci. He was excellent, his role was not the most vital but it did shape a lot of the film's context, with him being the cheesy show host with a big fake smile and catch-phrases. His performance was without a doubt the best in the film. <br/><br/>The editing was really well done, it must have been difficult to try and make such a violent plot become child friendly, they've managed to do their best. It cleverly cuts away from violent scenes meaning very little blood is shows so you think you've seen something horrible when you haven't really, it's a good example of how films do not need to be violent to have an impact. However, young children can still be frightened by this because it can be very jumpy, particularly during the climax, and the sound effects could scare easily. <br/><br/>The only problem I had with this film was some of the hand-held camera work was just too much, there were points where the camera was jolting so much that you didn't really know what was going on. <br/><br/>Overall, I would thoroughly recommend this film to both children and adults however, I do believe only people over 12 should watch this film as it can be quite frightening. This film is a breath of fresh air and shows that a blockbuster can be cinematically great as well as commercially."

","HUNGER GAMES REVIEW: <br/><br/>The movie that all of the teenagers have been waiting for. The next BIG franchise to fill the gap that Harry Potter has left in Hollywood (and Twilight...thank God that's almost over). Does it live up to the hype? In short...it's a solid movie....but not the greatest movie ever made.<br/><br/>The acting was pretty good, and you can really tell that a lot of thought, time effort and money went into the making this book a realistic world (for the most part). People complain that its slow for the first 40 minutes, but honestly that's called character development. It was laying down the plot, telling us everything we needed to know to comprehend the rest of the movie...and did a nice job of keeping it interesting.<br/><br/>As a whole, the movie was well made, the actors did their parts well, the story was interesting, and it did a good job of making us care about the characters, and drawing out certain emotions when necessary. My only complaint is that the camera was way too shaky during action sequences (as if the camera man was trying to survive as well). I'm happy to say that this is a ""teenage book franchise based movie"" that isn't a pain to watch. Looking forward to the second one. 8.7/10"

"kandotom","8","3","9","27 March 2012"," The movie is gripping, but it is also disappointing, in that it lacks the Orwellian social analysis found in such classics as Soylent Green and the Omega Man.
","My wife and I went to see The Hunger Games. The movie is both gripping and disappointing.<br/><br/>First, what is this new blockbuster about? Well, it describes the dystopia which our society has become in the not-too-distant future. North America now consists of a dozen districts and a Capitol. The inequities and the contrast between the opulent plutocracy at the center and the decrepit, squalid and starving outlying districts are stark. In its Roman-like games-and-circuses policy aimed at anesthetizing the masses (think Aldous Huxley's Brave New World, here), the government randomly selects each year two young representatives from each district to participate in The Hunger Games. These games, televised throughout the nation, are a survival contest to the death, like gladiatorial combat. Only one of the 24 teenage combatants is allowed to survive. The other 23 must all be murdered by each other and by the sole victor. The story's heroine is Katniss Everdeen, played by the stunningly beautiful Jennifer Lawrence.<br/><br/>I haven't read Suzanne Collins' book(s) upon which the movie is based, but in view of the hoopla, I am going to review the movie anyway, and tell you why I am both impressed and somewhat disappointed.<br/><br/>What bothers me is not the enormous violence, although my wife makes a good point when she notes that we already have horrendous youth violence in real life, and that its glorification in popular culture is wrong.<br/><br/>My complaint is that, unlike many of its predecessors in this genre, The Hunger Games is sociologically shallow.<br/><br/>Hollywood has a rich tradition of post-apocalyptic scenarios which extrapolate today's worst tendencies and show us a future which is more cruel, more unjust and uglier than society is today.<br/><br/>During the first half hour or so, it seemed that The Hunger Games would follow in the tradition of such classics as The Omega Man (1971), Silent Running (1972) and Soylent Green (1973). As in those films, this movie locates the seeds of future decay and collapse in today's dysfunctional world, be it AIDS-like plague (The Omega Man), the destruction of the environment (Silent Running), overpopulation (Soylent Green), or nuclear war (The Day After, The Book of Eli).<br/><br/>Such movies are the counterpoint to the naive optimism of the Star Trek- and Star Wars- like faith in never-ending progress through science and technology.<br/><br/>The first part of The Hunger Games does something similar. To show the brutality and dehumanization of mass culture, and the grotesque commercialization and perversion of the mass media, is a good thing. The thinly veiled analogy with ancient Rome is apt. The children who are about to die - called ""Tributes,"" which sounds like ""Tribunes"" - are first paraded in horse-drawn chariots in front of admiring crowds, then pampered and fed lavishly in the Capitol's opulent quarters, as were gladiators 2000 years ago.<br/><br/>Today, we also have instant stardom and its adulation, in a myriad shows such as American Idol. Survival of the fittest, too, in the even more numerous Reality TV shows. Such programs range from benign elimination contests like Dancing with the Stars to actual elimination to the death as in the 1987 Arnold Schwartzenegger movie The Running Man (whose plot could arguably be said to have been plagiarized by Suzanne Collins!) Deteriorating social conditions, growing poverty and concentration of wealth, are also very much under way at the present time. Extrapolating these into the future is a valuable exercise. Let's also not forget that the vast majority of the 10,000 Americans who have died in our dual Iraq-Afghanistan war consists of youngsters.<br/><br/>In sum, the movie's first 45 minutes contained inklings of such brilliant prognosticators as George Orwell, and I was hopeful.<br/><br/>But alas, it was not to be. For the rest of The Hunger Games, the only remaining question was, who will be last one standing? The movie degenerated into one of those predictable survival contests, similar to so many other films, (including some where the elimination process is natural, as in the recent The Grey).<br/><br/>I am hoping that the sequel will have better sociology, but I am already bracing myself for a disappointment. It seems that the plot will now move to a love story. I guess Sociology is not America's cup of tea."
"jbitterman","8","3","9","27 March 2012"," Possibly Great if...
","Ill start off like most people Yes I read the books before seeing the movie, that being said I think the movie is a solid. I'll break down my review because there are some elements that need to be addressed and this is the easiest way I can think of doing it. I'll do my best to not give any spoilers.<br/><br/>Story:<br/><br/>I don't read a lot of books but I was compelled by my wife to read the books before we go and see the movie. I thought the books were great and the story in the movie follows pretty darn close to the first book, with some elements from the second book thrown in. This leads me to believe that the second movie will not only contain elements from the third book but some from the first book as well to tie it all together. Yes the movie does move along at a fast clip which I could see it making the movie confusing for some people, but it kinda had to move fast in order to be a two and a half hour movie. It was not as dark as the books and some of the traumatizing elements that you are supposed to be left with happened so fast they didn't quite sink in.<br/><br/>Characters: So the main characters such as Peeta, Katniss and Gale and even Effie were done great and were introduced very well. However like I said in the ""Story"" portion the movie does move along fast so a lot of the other Important characters such as Hammich, Cinna and his team were introduced but not developed very much (This may be corrected in the second movie). But the time everyone spent on screen was done very well.<br/><br/>Directing: OK so my main gripe, the shaky cam thing was overdone. There were times when a shaky cam would be fine but shook so much you could hardly make anything out (may have been necessary for the PG-13 rating for the gory stuff). And other moments when a shaky cam is not necessary at all it was used (the reaping seen WTF?). The time when you were supposed to have your heart strings tugged on where there and did what they were supposed to but the action scenes tend to happen so fast you would almost miss it (once again PG-13). Would this director have been my first choice being his biggest movies were Seabiskit and BIG, no. He has not done a future/Sifi/action/suspense flick before. But he did the drama portions very well, but needs to work on fast moving action scenes a little more. <br/><br/>Overall score: The movie is a solid 8 on its own with a possibility of being raised to a 9 or 10 if the subsequent movies are done right. Was everything perfect no, but the movie did succeed in me wanting more which if the next movies deliver it will be Awesome!"

","Like many films based on books peoples opinions will vary dramatically based on the source material. I haven't read the book this film was based on so I can't make a comparison and can only judge it based on how it fares against other sci-fi. That being said...<br/><br/>The things I enjoyed about the film wold have to be the acting, which was strong enough to carry the film, especially the lead actress. Supporting cast was also entertaining. The effects and sets were good and not overdone. Decent dialogue and costumes as well. <br/><br/>Things that set it back for me. Definitely the overuse of close up with shaky camera. Very distracting. Editing was also a distraction for me as well as it seemed choppy. But my main issue was the lack of violence.<br/><br/>It would seem to me that to demonstrate the stark misguided nature of this society the main characters (very well developed too) would have to suffer great anguish. The film seemed too PG-13 for me and left it very unbalanced. The horror that is the violence of the arena, much less using children, is just not there so the film really lacks the hard edge it would seem this screenplay needed to be effective.<br/><br/>All in all though it was an enjoyable film well made for it's target audience, young women. I rate it 6.0 compared to sci-fi classics that hold the deserved rating of 7.0 and 8.0."
"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","8","6","24","24 March 2012"," The odds were in their favor
","Set in either an alternate reality or a time perhaps not far from our own, the world is run by the dictatorial and futuristic Capitol, the rich and powerful(whose appearances border on the grotesque, with make-up, sharp colors and clothing choices) ruling over the twelve districts, from all of which, each year, two teenagers, one of each gender, must participate in the titular competition, these 2 dozen kids fighting to the death. This is both great as an adaptation of the book(which, for those who haven't read it, is pretty good, not brilliant), and as a movie(almost everything in this makes sense even if you haven't read it, you can enjoy this whether you're familiar with that or not). Going from a first person perspective written work to a visual medium requires decisions made; inner monologues that explain things are made into spoken lines, and they here show things that Katniss(Young Mystique Jennifer Lawrence, who is evidently sticking with her young, determined independent female disguise... to be fair, she wears it extremely well, so why mess with it), our lead, does not see or experience. This does mean breaking up staying with the wilderness, the hostile environment(that is not as deadly or dangerous in this as in the source material), once the Hunger Games begin. That, by the way, doesn't happen for about half of this(similar to the novel), giving room for development, plot and setup(the contest is massively built up, and it really pays off). The vital characters are present and matter; Caesar, you love from when you see him, Cato is vicious, Cinna is very sympathetic, etc. This has phenomenal acting, by pretty much everyone involved. Unlike his daughter(X-Men: First Class), Kravitz is convincing. With the talents of Wes Bentley(see? This is how you use him, not the emo crap in Ghost Rider) and Donald Sutherland, we have faces put to the totalitarianism behind it. It really gets to you, and arouses emotion. One bit could easily have been sappy, and instead, it is just rather tragic. This is quite well-edited and filmed nicely. One thing on that, however... and this is why I wouldn't label this an action flick(drama-thriller, more like)... those sequences, the fights and such, are disorienting, and they shouldn't be. Why is it chaotic when two people are wrestling? Shaky cam and close-ups, please, just... no. The wish-fulfillment is present(young girl who doesn't know how to be, just coming into her adolescence, suddenly adored, going from poverty to expensive, delicious food being thrown at her(and no weight gain!), love triangle(which they do disservice to) from her having no boyfriend...), if less obnoxious. FX are excellent. This works as a satire of reality television, and goes into different themes than Battle Royale(that's about growing up and going out into the merciless world, this is about brutality as entertainment) There is a little blood, violence and disturbing content in this, as much as they could fit in without losing the PG-13, and they choose the right times to put it in, so it's effective as can be. I recommend this to any fan of the franchise, and anyone intrigued by the concept. 8/10"

The only thing that made me tense was wondering when they were going to get to the battlefield ha-ha! In the beginning they're getting prepared for this horrific fight to the death for so long that I thought the movie would end right when it was time for them to battle each other.

","I would like to start by recommending this film, as it is good. however as many people have said its main flaw is its whole concept. To make this film available for its target audience every aspect of the film had to be toned down to allow it to slip in at a PG-13/12 rating. What this means is that the possibly great fighting scenes feel false and cheap. I have read the book when it came out and i would say that this film doesn't close. most of the aspects which made the books so good are lacking here. <br/><br/>If you are a fan of the books I would still watch this film, it may not be the full package which you would hope it to be, but that is because it is aimed at you (being the under 15 year old) who may have ruined a possibly great film.

Katniss killed three people in the first movie and she was very gorgeous talented and very intelligent. Is my favorite best film of the franchise, I own this movie on DVD and Blu-ray disc. Just my Blu-ray has a better quality. I love this movie and it is the best in the series I don't think the sequels are better than this movie, I am sorry I just don't agree with other opinions saying the sequels are better they are not. The Hunger Games: Catching Fire (2013) is pretty good damn sequel and that a good one, but not better than this one and The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1 is a true disappointment, I haven't seen Part 2 yet but I hope it is better than part 1. <br/><br/>The first movie in the franchise is evolving in a Dystopian future every year in the ruins of what was once North America, the Capitol of the nation of Panem forces each of its twelve districts to send a teenage boy and girl to compete in the Hunger Games. Sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen volunteers in her younger sister's place and must rely upon her sharp instincts when she's pitted against highly trained Tributes who have prepared their entire lives. If she's ever to return home to District 12, Katniss must make impossible choices in the arena that weigh survival against humanity and life against love. I love the challenge and the game so much. For 2. Hrs I was entertained on my seat from the beginning till end. <br/><br/>""The Hunger Games"" is a rare book-turned-movie that's able to live up to the gigantic hype of the book series it's based upon, while also standing out as a superbly crafted action blockbuster all its own. It's a marvelously entertaining thrill ride from start to finish that never forgoes its characters' humanity, nor does it ever abandon the strong political and social undertones of its source material. In the end, not only did this film exceed all my expectations of what a cinematic adaptation could accomplish, but it truly encapsulated everything I felt while reading the novel for the first time. I had no expectations for this film.. I thought it would be another ""Twilight"", however I was so wrong. I actually enjoyed it. The plot was incredible, the acting was sublime. Incredible film that blew me away. I am honestly honored to have had the pleasure of watching it. Definitely going down on my personal movie list :P A triumph! The odds were actually in my favor this time :) I would definitely recommend this - it was amazing, and I was obsessed with the movie and cast for a while afterward. But you should read the book before you watch the movie, but that's just my opinion ;) <br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence is amazing, gorgeous as Katniss Everdeen, very, very beautiful talented and sexy. She did amazing perfect job playing her character, this is the second time I memorized her in famous role. The second famous role she played was Raven Darkholme/Mystique in X-Men: First Class and X-Men: Days of Future Past. I heard that The Hunger Games quadrilogy and X-Men trilogy are the last movies of the franchise she will ever play. Than she will start playing in stand up alone roles. Woody Harrelson as Haymitch Abernathy did an outstanding performance of acting his character. I had no idea Woody Harrelson will be in this movie and he did a job so well. <br/><br/>This is a great futuristic Dystopian science fiction film. The people in the Capitol enjoy the Hunger Games, for them its their yearly highlight:) But for the poor people from the District it's a punishment. I did enjoyed some action sequences and clever intense scenes, like Katniss been on a tree and than climbs up the tree towards the nest and begins sawing at the branch holding it up, until the nest of venom wasps fall down and kills Glimmer (Leven Rambin) who stung too many times by wasps. It is hard to believe people would want to watch kids battle to the death, but in the Dystopian future is everything possible. This movie gets 10 by me for been a fun solid not boring Dystopian Science Fiction action flick by the novel. <br/><br/>The Hunger Games is a 2012 American dystopian science fiction adventure film directed by Gary Ross and based on the novel of the same name by Suzanne Collins. It is the first installment in The Hunger Games film series and was produced by Nina Jacobson and Jon Kilik, with a screenplay by Ross, Collins, and Billy Ray.<br/><br/>10/10 Score: Bad Ass Seal Of Approval Studio: Lionsgate Starring: Jennifer Lawrence, Josh Hutcherson, Liam Hemsworth, Woody Harrelson, Elizabeth Banks, Lenny Kravitz, Stanley Tucci, Donald Sutherland Director: Gary Ross Screenplay: Suzanne Collins, Gary Ross, Billy Ray Based on The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins Producers: Nina Jacobson, Jon Kilik Rated: PG-13 Running Time: 2 Hrs. 22 Mins.

"Solnichka","8","2","5","13 December 2015"," As a stand-alone film, this is really good stuff
","Forget the sequels, which are cluttered and ridiculous. This first film is pretty good as a stand-alone story, and perhaps the author should have left it at that. Lawrence is very good at being vulnerable and defiant at the same time, and the visuals in the film are good at bringing Panem to life.<br/><br/>The film is mostly exposition, as it has to explain so much to the viewers that haven't read the books—and that's fine. The actual ""Games"" themselves don't take up much time in the film and are a little underwhelming. But as a ""kids"" movie, perhaps it's best to limit the violence and gore, right?<br/><br/>You actually care about these main characters, because the acting is well done. You invest in Jennifer Lawrence and even Woody Harrelson, so their fates matter to you in the end.<br/><br/>As noted earlier, they should have stopped with the series right here, on artistic merit. Everything that follows is contrived, convoluted and disappointing."
"bowmanblue","6","2","5","22 May 2014"," One for the kids
","The Hunger games is rated a 12 Certificate (in the UK at least) and that's probably for a reason. I'm guessing it means that no one OVER the age of twelve should bother to watch it.<br/><br/>I imagine that any twelve-or-under will be well and truly wowed at the terrible vision of a future gone bad, where the poor are hunted and laughed at by their evil rich oppressors. However, being a man in my thirties, I kind of found it all a bit patronising. The rich are portrayed as evil. The poor good. This (pretty unsubtle) message is then repeated for almost every one of the hundred and twenty minutes this film runs for.<br/><br/>A girl (with a silly name) is selected from one of the noble, long-suffering poor communities and forced to compete (i.e. kill) another twenty-three kids from neighbouring noble and poor districts. If fact, she wasn't even selected. She was the first ever volunteer for certain death, because her equally (but slightly more weedy) noble and poor younger sister was the one selected, but this noble and poor girl offered to die on her behalf. All the time this is beamed across the world for the evil rich people to enjoy.<br/><br/>Luckily, the film's noble and poor heroine is so noble and poor that, despite being a crack shot with a bow and arrow, she's too noble and pure to actually kill any of the other noble and poor kids (okay, she kills about one, but that's it). They kind of do each other in for her, making sure she stays noble and virtuous at all times.<br/><br/>Anyway, the first half of the film shows us how badly the noble and poor people are exploited by their evil and rich oppressors and the second half shows us how the noble and poor girl with the very silly name runs about not killing people in order to win.<br/><br/>I kept hearing other reviews talk about how The Hunger Games is 'the new Twilight.' And they're probably right. Twilight was 'vampires for children/teens' and The Hunger Games is sort of an action/romance film for teens. They'll love it.<br/><br/>Remember: poor = good. Rich = bad (just in case you didn't get the film's particularly unsubtle message).<br/><br/>http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/"
"khreis-zaid","5","2","5","30 March 2014"," Critical Review on 'The Hunger Games'
","Are you looking for a movie that would get your mind busy? I would honestly suggest this one movie directed by Gary Ross. This movie put me in a state of perplexity. I didn't know if I liked it or not, maybe because I had no idea what I had waiting for me.<br/><br/>This fictitious movie occurs in the far future, where people in a nation called Panem lived in twelve districts. Each year,two young representatives, one male and one female, from each district are selected randomly to participate in The Hunger Games. These games are cruel and terrifying. The twenty-four participants have to terminate the competitors while the citizens of Panem watch. When 16-year-old Katniss's young sister, Prim , is selected as District 12's female representative, Katniss volunteers as tribute.<br/><br/>As the movie started, I was trying to capture the whole point of the movie. First of all, the sad, yet suspenseful music at the beginning of the movie kind of drew me in and caught my attention. In addition, the sounds during the games were exciting, especially the thrilling ""boom"" sound we heard once someone died. The idea of the movie was interesting to a certain extent.<br/><br/>On the other hand, there were some other times throughout the movie where I was reluctant to finish the movie. At the beginning of the movie, the idiotic fact that they barely had food was a bit unrealistic. Moreover, when I saw how the people at the capital were pampered with too much food to even eat. The costumes and the make up at the capital were ridiculous. I thought it was pathetic how they lived in the twelve districts. I also thought it was really unfair how just because of some kind of war, children at the capital lived with nothing to worry about; while the ones in the districts too worried whether they'd be in a life/death situation.<br/><br/>All in all, I thought this movie was somewhere in the range of a good one. Although when the movie was over, all I could think is, ""Is that it?""."
"Rome18","10","2","5","18 October 2012"," A Bunch of Kids Going on a Summer Camp
","I've read the book and i must say its one of the best series I had read in a while. The kind of book you just can't put down. I am also the kind of person who doesn't compare books with its movie adaptation. Changes makes it unpredictable and offers new possibilities from the books I read already. However in the Hunger Game, I was utterly disappointed of the lack of emotions the characters in the movie are as compared to the books. Specially the part where Rue was killed by another tribute. The was a sad epic scene in the book. Its one of the scene where I truly felt heartbroken. But in the movie, it was truly lacking, not enough emotion from the main character, Katniss. And the lack of emotions goes on in the other parts of the movie. The movie doesn't have the atmosphere where the viewers would truly believe that they are being a part of a world where the rights of humanity is being oppressed. What I saw was a bunch of kids going on a summer camp."
"alleyngoodwin","6","2","5","7 August 2012"," Just another average movie
","First of all,I didn't read the books,so I can't compare and will just talk about the movie.<br/><br/>There was a lack of character development,to the point that I couldn't connect with any of the characters and couldn't care less if they die or not.<br/><br/>The shaky camera filming is really annoying...it was OK when it first appeared in movies,because it was something new,but now that old trick is far from innovative or a form of art,and bring nothing to this movie.<br/><br/>The movie is called The hunger games,so I thought the characters would be more hungry,but I guess they were only hungry in the books :) Action?...not enough action for so supposed arena games...the deaths were without any kind of creativity,and with a minimum of blood...the cleanest games ever made :) The acting was OK...the actors did the best they could with the script they had.I found that Peeta really weak and not very likable,but again it's nothing to do with the acting.<br/><br/>Overall,for me,it was just another average movie,aimed for teens...The script was poorly written and I guess that it's a bad adaptation from the book too.After the games began,which was supposed to be the most interesting part of the movie,I found myself more and more bored of the movie.So I will give the movie a 6/10."
"lalaland-21-224850","6","2","5","15 June 2012"," A good effort, but still disappointing
","Firstly, I want to congratulate everyone who worked on this thing. It was good. I won't deny that. But it wasn't the best.<br/><br/>The books are quite difficult to adapt, so you have to commend Gary Ross for trying. When you read the Hunger Games, it is like Katniss is speaking to you, running through everything she experiences for you. That's quite difficult to do in a movie-you can't REALLY have Katniss talking through the whole thing.<br/><br/>I have to say, if I hadn't read the books, I probably would not have understood it as well. The story is more shown than explained. Yes, you find out the reasoning behind The Hunger Games, but it is never elaborated.<br/><br/>The relationships between characters aren't as strong as they could be. The important ones, like Rue and Prim needed a lot more attention than they were given, in order to understand how upsetting it was. Also, Peeta isn't as much of a kind-hearted in-love person in the movie as he is in the books. And Haymitch was NOT as drunk and crazy as he should have been.<br/><br/>I think that rather than spending time on the Gamemakers, they should have developed these characters more.Because if the basic story is not all there, then adding more is useless. I wouldn't have minded if this movie had run for 4 hours-if they had gotten the characters spot on.<br/><br/>The shaky camera thing was annoying too...<br/><br/>One more thing-I think the chariot costumes were a bit underrated-I was expecting something bigger, bolder and flashier than that.<br/><br/>There were positive points in this movie though. I believe the reaping scene was perfect and so were the outfits and acting in the interviews. Katniss was done beautifully by Jennifer Lawrence-she was BRILLIANT!<br/><br/>Overall, quite good, but lacking those details that could have made it so good. You should watch though! But read the books first!"
"sarahmdorra","7","2","5","6 May 2012"," Not as violent as it should be
","I finished reading The Hunger Games book trilogy three weeks before the Egyptian Revolution. Seeing what happened during the 18 days was like watching Suzanne Collins' books on screen. Until today, more than a year after the revolution, I believe The Hunger Games remains the closest work of fiction to the events of the revolution in Egypt. After all, it's about a game that the Capitol of Panem has started after the people made an uprising against it. The Hunger Games has 24 tributes but only one can win and that's by surviving.<br/><br/>Violence, thus, is the keyword. It's the core of the world created by Suzanne Collins who mentioned in an interview that she got the idea of the books while watching footage of the US crimes in Iraq. On the other hand, Gary Ross's film adaptation did not survive the gleam of Hollywood. The result is unnecessary scenes of romance (which filled the theatre with giggles at its silliness) at the expense of core violent scenes, all for the sake of topping the box office.<br/><br/>Despite that, most of the performances were excellent. When fans of the book trilogy (me included) made their disagreement clear when she was first cast, Jennifer Lawrence replied that she will do her best, playing Katniss Everdeen. And she did. When it comes to other leading characters, Josh Hutcherson is no less good, though there should have been much focus on the character of Haymitch and the humorous side of it as well as the relationship he developed with Katniss and Peeta.<br/><br/>Of course it couldn't all fit in 2 hours and 8 minutes. However, this is no justification for the film's clear means to win the war to the top of the box office. But, in the end, the first book is my least favourite. The best is yet to come."
"goughy1908","7","2","5","4 May 2012"," hmmm.... poor adaption.
","I found the Hunger Games to be a great movie, but i am not impressed with the adaption from the book! the book was defiantly the better of the two!! The movie has missed out a lot, such as peeta's fake leg, the origin of the mocking bird pin changed, the spear not being removed from rue... changed. It also used a slightly blurred clip for the bloodbath at the beginning of the actual games, so it didn't give you the intensity like the book did!! If you haven't read the book or seen the film yet, then read the book first! if you have seen the movie then read the book and find out for yourself how it is such a poor adaption!! i hope that for Catching Fire and Mocking jay, the adaption is a lot better!!"
"abcdefghmnzx-352-513890","5","2","5","24 April 2012"," Hmmm average
","The biggest problem with the film is the basic story. So people are in a ""last man standing"" scenario = released another winner. That is not really new. Spontaneously makes you feel at ""Le Prix du Danger - Head Hunting - Price of Fear"", ""Running Man"", ""Battle Royale"", a pinch of ""Truman Story"" reminds. Unfortunately, it succeeds in this case not to draw on the length of the film a constant tension. It comes to power through the hangers and explanatory gaps attract negative attention during the visit to the cinema and tear out the spectators from the seat, unlike the book.<br/><br/>The actors, especially the names (Sutherland, Tucci and Harrelson) get the script too little space to really shine to. The actor Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson you take screenwriter caused the cave scene ""you call that a kiss"" and then does not really have their feelings about not worked out enough to be believable. Unfortunately, the movie overall is not to create emotional depth. Too often coated by the emotion of drama is spoiled, and many scenes are thereby flattened. Especially at the end of the film, this is not stringent enough in the direction of a dramatic climax, but not round.<br/><br/>The look of the film combines the 60's clothes with makeup and cyberpunk-themed differently depending on the district outfits. Especially in the scenes in the Capitol is therefore necessary for the costume some fans.<br/><br/>Overall, it is not meant as a compliment when a horde is a film critic from the cinema hall and mumbles ""Twilight was better."" It will be interesting to see whether the massive marketing provides sufficient revenue in Part 2 of the trilogy will ever tackled. After all the hype I expected more, kindly: 5/10 fish wheels"
"MegRider1","10","4","14","14 April 2012"," Great Movie for Teens and young adults...
","I don't care what anybody says I think this was a great movie. Great actors. Great everything. It followed the book very closely. Hard to understand it if you haven't read the books so if you haven't read the books don't see the till you have. And people are saying Suzanne Collins ripped of Battle Royal, she didn't it's way different. And the book is not rated R, so they did not dumb down the book. But I definitely recommend that you read the book before the movie cause you might get confused. The books are NOT Rated R my neighbors are both middle school teachers and they are reading them with their classes. They went to see the movie with their classes and they loved them. Honestly, the books and the movies are directed towards young adults. People who do NOT like fast paced, action packed movies should NOT see this movie. The Hunger Games has many scenes that are emotional and some funny. This movie contains scenes that may be Intense for some. Honestly I think if they can show sex scenes and birthing scenes in breaking dawn they can show teenagers fighting, dying, and bleeding to death. Emotional parts include the death of Rue and when Peeta and Katniss are in the cave. There is some alcohol use and drunk scenes. Not for those who have weak stomachs or are really emotional. MAY THE ODDS BE EVER IN YOUR FAVOR... Also someone pointed out that it may be a gender thing. Honestly I do think it attracts more females than males just like twilight. That's my opinion."
"hamilton-tbn-pcn","8","4","14","12 April 2012"," Ridiculous Biases and missing the point
","When people read the books that turn to movies they are very unreliable critics. The reader will envision what the landscapes will look like and the small details about the character's mannerisms. One could take out The Hunger Games and replace it with Harry Potter or any number of other movies and it would still have the same degrading meaning. <br/><br/>The audience must remember that Collins, the author of The Hunger Games is a screenwriter, and it was very apparent in the style of the book, especially in how the dialogue was written. Collins, was also the executive producer for the movie. She had a huge influence on how her book was brought to life. Whereas in movies such as Harry Potter or Percy Jackson, the authors just skimmed the script and made comments and gave input. <br/><br/>Readers should expect some deviations from the text when they become the audience. So stop nit-picking! The movie was done artistically. The reason for the lack of character development come from the fact that the novel is written in first person narrative, where the reader gets to hear what Katniss is thinking and reflecting on. If you look at what is going on in the movie, there is no dialogue between when Katniss enters the arena and when she meets Rue, which is about 20% of the movie right there, there is also another short part where Katniss is crying over Rue's demise before Claudius Templesmith announces that her and Peeta can win. The point of the Hunger Games was to have ONE victor, therefore tributes were isolated and would not make close friends. Katniss doesn't develop in the short time where she is in contact with Rue for time's sake. <br/><br/>My only criticisms are that the gaping chasm between the residents of the Capital and the residents of the Districts was not large enough, nor was the fate of District 13 ever told. Harrelson, a wonderful actor was not given a deep enough role. The alcoholism was not portrayed as a way for him to escape the emotions that surviving the Games created. The soundtrack was also not one to create that sense of suspense that can be created in other ways. <br/><br/>My only two disappointments from the tenuous transition from novel to screen is that the screenwriter cut out the extreme thirst that Katniss nearly died from at the start of the Games. The Capital also did not have that candy-esque feeling that one read about in the books. Though this seemed to be the clearly green-screened portion of the entire movie. The Capital seemed more like downtown Washington, DC rather than the colorful and vibrant city described in the novels. The muttations at the end also didn't represent the fallen tributes, which was disappointing, but it didn't take away too much from the general feeling of suspense<br/><br/>Overall this movie was a masterful recreation of the novel and should be highly praised and complimented on this astounding achievement. The fans of The Hunger Games series can only hope that Catching Fire will retain this touch of cinematic magic."

","I loved this movie. Haven't read the book i did not know what to expect. At the end it was my greatest movie experience of the year so far.<br/><br/>Above all what i really like about the movie it's that the director manage to not put us as a spectator (voyeur) of the actual Hunger Games but as a witness of a dislocated future were children will kill each other for the pleasure of the population thus the government keep them in control keeping them entertained and letting a glimpse of hope for the ones with a life more difficult. A kind of tour de force, in ""battle royal"" for example my feeling as a viewer was very different.<br/><br/>However this future is anything but original. It is a kind of a modern Roman Empire. <br/><br/>I guess the fact that we do not really see any of the killing it is a great director's preconception. First we do not want do see slaughtered children, second the paradox with an ultimate reality show and the decency in death it is very interesting.<br/><br/>The pace is well handled, the suspense does not exist since we know from the beginning the ending but it does not matter since it is not the purpose to keep us wondering who is going to win since we are not the spectator of the TV show.<br/><br/>Some people complain about the dull love story, but there is no love story, may be a friendship, but no love. It is fake it is TV. At the end the mentor must put words inside Katniss's head to express feelings what she does not have. It is very deep and may be it needs lot of discussion to list everything that people can do in a reality show to become popular.<br/><br/>That is my understanding of this movie, i love everything about it form the acting, the directing, the customs, the music and even the strange beard of Seneca !!!<br/><br/>10/10"
"meeza","8","4","14","1 April 2012"," Appetite for destruction depicted in fine form in ""The Hunger Games""
","There is a movie that many moviegoers have had an appetite to chew on, and it's called ""The Hunger Games"". Heard of it? But of course you have, most of America and the world has not only heard of this movie but have already digested ""The Hunger Games"" with a cinematic viewing. I did that myself and I must say that I was pleasantly surprised. Based on Suzanne Collins' best-selling novel, ""The Hunger Games"" takes place in the future where the Capitol selects a boy and a girl (called tributes) from twelve districts to fight to the death on live television; hopefully, not the future of reality shows even though some of them have already plagued many with superficiality syndrome. In the competition, there is only one winner and the rest of the twenty-three participants will be fatally eliminated which can make any of the twenty-four participants sick to their stomach in the hunger games competition. The movie stars Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss Everdeen, she is the arching aficionado who volunteers to enter the hunger games replacing her kid sister Primrose who was primarily selected as the District 12 female tribute. Josh Hutcherson co-stars as Peeta Mellark, the District 12 male tribute representative selected for the hunger games in order for the Capitol to get a taste of that Peeta bred. Director Gary Ross does not dress for less this movie by brilliantly capturing the film's pulsating tone of its Darwinism competition and depicting a future of an oxymoron-like colorful darkness. Collins, Ross, and Billy Ray's screenplay was not a utopia scribe, but it did hit the verbal bulls-eye in numerous scenes. Jennifer Lawrence's starring performance as Katniss was multilayered and magnetic! It was dead on! Maybe wrong choice of words, sorry Katniss! Hutcherson's work as Peeta was mediocre at its best or maybe it was because the Kitty Katniss was more delicious than the Peeta White Bread. Woody Harrelson was hey bitchin' in his supporting work as mentor Haywitch Abernathy, and provided some of the best lines in the movie; so another kudos there for the film's screenplay. Other tasty supporting performances in ""The Hunger Games"" include Elizabeth Banks as District 12 spokesperson Effie Trinket, Stanley Tucci as Hunger Games' master of ceremonies Caesar Flickerman, Donald Sutherland as Capitol President Snow, and Amandla Stenberg as District 11 child tribute Hue. But it was Lawrence's tour-de-force performance that filled me up the most with thespian pleasure in ""The Hunger Games"". OK, I know you have had enough of my pun tributes to this movie, so I will conclude my review. So in all, I think the odds are in your favor that you will enjoy ""The Hunger Games"". **** Good"

","A brilliant film, very true to the book.<br/><br/>A bit of action and romance,so it's a movie for everyone. The intensity of emotion brought to the screen by the actors playing Katniss and Peeta is truly commendable. They drew the audience in with their charismatic persona's, which were backed by an intriguing post-modern storyline. Some moments were heart-breaking, while others were inspiring. Not advised for little kids, as some of the actions scenes are quite brutal, and harsh. However, it is a truly eye-opening look at the human condition.<br/><br/>Definitely worth watching!"

","I would classify myself as a major fan of the books. So of course I noticed all the subtle differences between the movie and the book. However, I'm smart enough to understand that books and movies are in two different mediums, and thus cannot be compared to one another. I'm allowed to say the movie was a great adaptation on the book, which it was, but you have to judge the book with one review and the movie with another review. That is the end of my little rant, now it's time to review the movie.<br/><br/>I thought Gary Ross did an incredible job taking a difficult storyline and piecing it together without losing all the brutal and cruel elements of the story. <br/><br/>What I liked:<br/><br/>+ The tone throughout the movie matched the tone of the characters. Too many times we see dramatic action movies try to add comedic elements to lighten the mood and add some comic relief, which I believe takes away from the ""mood"" out of movie. The Hunger Games kept a consistent dark tone from beginning to end. <br/><br/>+ All the actors were terrific and more importantly ""believable"" special shout out to Jennifer Lawrence, Stanley Tucci, Donald Sutherland, and Woody Harrelson. I have never seen a movie where I felt so connected with the characters and beating to the pulse of Katniss and Peeta.<br/><br/>+ The camera-work! I know some people may not like the hand-held camera shooting, but I think it gives the viewer a first-person view and I'm going to throw out the word again ""believable"" <br/><br/>+ The underlying Score! Music isn't featured as much in the Hunger Games as it is in most movies, but when it appeared, it added to that dark tone that I loved so much. Kudos to James Newton Howard.<br/><br/>What I didn't like - There weren't too many things I didn't like about the movie. Actually there is only one thing, I wish they showed more of the districts and capitol citizens reactions to the Hunger Games. It wasn't a huge deal for me but it's something that could have added to how cruel the sport is and what the citizens are thinking when there loved ones die. <br/><br/>Overall, I give this movie an A+. I don't give many movies A+ but this movie is well- deserving of an A+"

"namichaud","9","4","14","25 March 2012"," Shaken and stirred
","I am a film nut which means I am crazy for directors. Rarely do films rise above direction. Gary Ross is not Nolan or Fincher and they are not Scorsese or Kubrick. <br/><br/>In my life I can say that there are now three films that surpass the book that created them. ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" was better as a film. ""On the Beach"" was  better as a film. I had concluded that Gregory Peck may have been responsible for this. Now I have to add ""The Hunger Games"" to that list. Odd thing is that I did it backwards. I saw the film Friday and read the book on Saturday. <br/><br/>It may be that the first person narrative was not as engaging to me as the film. I may be pathetic because I am old but I have followed Jennifer Lawrence since ""Winter's Bone."" I thought that she deserved the Academy Award then. I also know that the politics of that system allows great performers to be nominated over and over again and never win, Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio. Kate Winslet had to be nominated for two great performances in one year to finally win. I just assumed, heck, Lawrence is just a kid and she will get her justice later. <br/><br/>I thought that she stole every scene in which she appeared in ""X-Men First Class."" That was a character driven cartoon with several terrific actors but even with McAvoy and Fassenbender, Lawrence shined. <br/><br/>To add to my native, aged prejudice, I am repulsed by the teen-trilogies. If ""Lord of the Rings"" and ""Star Wars"" and ""The Emprire Strikes Back"" offered the best,  then that is where I drew my lines. I am a ""Hurt Locker"" ""Tree of Life"" kind of movie film fan. <br/><br/>Perhaps driven by lechery or recognition of talent, I rushed to ""The Hunger Games."" <br/><br/>I have been blown away. I don't know how Lawrence manages to communicate to a camera as she does. These are not Streep's ""Sophie's Choice"" medium shots. These are intimate and intense close shots of the twitch of the eye, the corner of the mouth. <br/><br/>The Dystopia runs deep but is passé to me. The world of Harlan Ellison was done best by Harlan Ellison. I have been closed to these revisions of his work.<br/><br/>The film, ""The Hunger Games"" has opened my skull. <br/><br/>I am not certain if President Snow is Kronos or Zeus but both kill their children. The Greek Mythology got one thing right, we kill our children. The manipulation of ""hope,"" which was crystal clear in the film, did not seem central to the book. It was not Katniss's endurance or heroism, it was her humanity in the darkness of savagery that broke me to tears. It is the flickering flame of humanity that has moved me to write this. <br/><br/>I remain deeply moved. I can't get this out of my head. I am an old man who wishes our children are better than we are, not better off. The spiritual elation of the human heart found in children, embodied by Lawrence in her portrayal of Katniss, provided me with unexpected transcendence."

I think Katniss survived very easily... the whole fight match was not intense.. it can be made better.I am not saying that movie was not good but it doesn't deserve such point it is worth maximum 7.5/10 points.

","Basically this movie should be rated R and be longer to include more things from the book. <br/><br/>A poor attempt to take a rated R movie and give a a PG-13 rating to make money. I would have enjoyed it more if the movie was fleshed out better and had a more adult rating. <br/><br/>I still will give it a 7 out of 10 though, but it could have been way better. <br/><br/>Also, warning, for me it was kinda jarring to watch minor kill each other. <br/><br/>I have a kid who is 13, so this movie probably hit me harder than most."

","""We wish you Happy Hunger Games! May the odds be ever in your favor. "" The Hunger Games have begun and the odds are definitely in director Gary Ross's favor as he has managed to adapt Suzanne Collins's bestselling novel really well to the big screen. Ross has delivered a highly entertaining post apocalyptic, sci-fi, action, romantic thriller. Most fans will be satisfied with this film because it is truly entertaining and has a little bit of everything for those people who are looking for action, or for those who are more interested in the romantic story, and so on. It also has a great cast and the lead performance from Jennifer Lawrence is just brilliant. She captures the ideal female heroine who we all want to root for. She is truly the girl on fire. It comes as no surprise since Lawrence blew us all away with her performance in a small independent film called Winter's Bone. She has already turned into a true star and proves she can have a lead role in what looks to be a very successful trilogy. The rest of the cast is also pretty interesting as you have great actors like Stanley Tucci, Woody Harrelson, Toby Jones, and Donald Sutherland, along with young talented actors like Liam Hemsworth, Josh Hutcherson, and Alexander Ludwig. They've really done justice to the characters that were created by Collins, and I can't forget to mention Lenny Kravitz who was also excellent as Cinna. As good as all these actors were, Jennifer Lawrence was above par and she really delivered the story and brought a lot of heart to her character. A great deal of the success this movie is having can be owed to her remarkable performance as Katniss.<br/><br/>Suzanne Collins has created a very creative new futuristic world with some common elements from the past. The United States doesn't exist as a country anymore, but it is divided into twelve districts which are all controlled by the Capitol. The name of the country is Panem, and the further away the districts are from the Capitol the poorer its people. The wealthiest families live in the Capitol and in order to control the districts and avoid another uprising they have created the Hunger Games, which consists of selecting two teenagers (one male and another female) from each district and have the 24 teens face off one another until only one survivor remains. They force the entire nation to watch these games and it has become a popular sporting event, kind of like the Roman Empire did with the gladiators, except that the arena is much bigger as they have the wilderness to hide in. This serves as a reminder of what happens when the districts rebel against their capitol and at the same time it keeps the districts fighting amongst themselves so they won't form any alliances to try to begin a revolution. Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) lives in the 12th District along with her little sister and mother. She is a hunter and is excellent with the arch. Her best friend is Gale (Liam Hemsworth). When the elections for the 74th Hunger Games take place, Katniss's younger sister is selected, but she takes her place instead as a tribute. The other member selected from the 12th District is Peeta (Josh Hutcherson), who is very strong and has a secret crush on Katniss. Together they must face the rest of the tributes with the help of their trainer, Haymitch (Woody Harrelson), the sole Hunger Game winner from their district in its 74 year history. The favorites are always the tributes from the first two districts because they have been raised all their lives to be prepared for these games. Cato (Alexander Ludwig) from the 1st District and who is sadistic in nature is their biggest threat.<br/><br/>Once the Hunger Games begin the audience is immediately submersed into the story and Katniss's struggle for survivor. The story is really well told and there are plenty of thrills and suspense for the audience to enjoy. The two and a half hour long movie has such a quick pace that by the end it will seem like you were only in there for an hour. The games are really that interesting and have you at the edge of your seat for almost the entire movie. I really enjoyed the pacing of this film along with the performances. It is hard to get a lot of character development with a movie that has so many things going on and that focuses almost entirely on Katniss, but we really do grow to care for several of these characters that have to face off each other. Of course there is no time to really know all 24 of them, because the story centers on Katniss and Peeta. There is sort of a love triangle going on, but the film really doesn't delve in too deep with it. We will probably have more of that in the upcoming sequels, but most of the scenes involving Katniss don't have to be spelled out for us. She delivers such a great performance that we can hear what she's saying without ever having to say anything. We can read what she's saying through her eyes alone. When I heard about the story I thought this was going to be a violent film, but it really doesn't focus on the violence as much as it does on surviving. I really enjoyed every second of this film and it is my favorite film of the year so far.<br/><br/>http://estebueno10.blogspot.com"
"moviexclusive","8","6","26","21 March 2012"," And the odds are indeed in this opening's film's favour- a tense, thrilling and smart science-fiction thriller with a brilliant lead performance by Jennifer Lawrence
","Not since the Twilight franchise first hit the big screen in 2008 has there been so much fevered anticipation for a print-to-screen adaptation, but that should be expected for a book that spent 180 consecutive weeks on the New York Times bestseller list. Envisioning a post-apocalyptic North America named Panem comprised of a ruling Capitol and 12 enslaved districts, novelist Suzanne Collins' 'The Hunger Games' was a smart dystopian sci-fi thriller which also served as darkly satiric commentary on a world gone mad on spectacle.<br/><br/>The premise of the titular Games is intriguing- as penance for their rebellion against Capitol rule 74 years ago, a boy and a girl from the ages of 12 to 18 are chosen by lottery from each district to fight to the death in a televised gladiator event. It's the Capitol's means of ensuring subjugation from the districts- 'we own your lives' is the message the sinister President Snow (Donald Sutherland) wants the Games to convey alongside a glimmer of hope by allowing that one triumphant individual to return home victorious.<br/><br/>That winner for the 74th Hunger Games is 16-year-old Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) from the coal-mining District 12, a strong-willed independent girl who has been providing for her grief-stricken mother (Paula Malcomson) and her younger sister Prim (Willow Shields) ever since their father died in an accident. Ever the protector, Katniss volunteers to take Prim's place when her name is called during the Reaping and- together with fellow tribute Peeta (Josh Hutcherson)- is abruptly whisked off into a surreal world of pomp and pomposity very unlike their home.<br/><br/>It's only a temporary reprieve before the survivalist Games, just enough time for Katniss to pick up some useful tips from her drunken mentor Haymitch (Woody Harrelson) and make an impression to both the Games keeper Seneca (Wes Bentley) and the sponsors whose contributions may mean the difference between life and death. All too soon, Katniss finds herself released into a densely forested arena- that is really a tightly controlled space rigged all around with cameras- and made to fight for her life alongside Peeta and 22 other Tributes while the citizens of Panem and the districts watch riveted.<br/><br/>While the concept plays like an amalgam of 'The Truman Show' and 'Battle Royale', director and co-adapter Gary Ross has chosen a Bourne-like style with hand-held camera-work and quick cutting to inject urgency to the proceedings. Like Bourne too, our heroine is a master of her environment, making keen use of her terrain and the resources it offers to stay alive- even as the movie plays up the fact that the confrontations between her and her potential opponents are ultimately rigged by Seneca and his team for maximum viewing excitement.<br/><br/>Fans of the book will no doubt be making mental comparisons with key plot points in Katniss' harrowing struggle- desperately hunting for water at the start; confronting an uneasy alliance of well-trained Tributes from wealthier districts; outsmarting them by unleashing mutated wasps known as Tracker Jackers on them; infuriating them by destroying their food supply; and of course allying with Peeta when the rules change to allow both a chance at survival. Ross, who co-wrote the screenplay with Collins and Billy Ray (of 'Shattered Glass'), ensures that none of these crucial elements are lost, even as the order in which they occur get shuffled around.<br/><br/>At the fore of both the movie as well as the book- and played with remarkable clarity by Jennifer Lawrence in a performance of genuine grit and emotion- is Katniss' winning combination of intelligence and humanity, despite the dehumanising state of affairs she has been thrust into. Just as adeptly as its source, Ross conveys Katniss' ingenuity in the way she outwits her attackers as well as her indignation when an unlikely friend and ally, Rue (Amandla Stenberg), is abruptly killed. There is confidence, steeliness and vulnerability in Lawrence's brilliant turn, just as- if not more- outstanding than her earlier Oscar-nominated performance in 'Winter's Bone' where she also played a young teenager thrust into adult circumstances. <br/><br/>Not surprisingly, there are nuances that are evidently lost from the movie, some though more significant than others. Chief among them is the made-for-TV romance between Katniss and Peeta, key to understanding the climactic outcome at the end- whereas the first-person narration of the book allowed for a keen understanding of Katniss' ambivalence, the movie's portrayal opts for a much more straightforward portrayal that doesn't do justice to Katniss' complicated stirrings for Peeta vis-Ã -vis her hometown pseudo-boyfriend Gale (Liam Hemsworth in a small but crucial role when parts two and three roll by).<br/><br/>Ross also skims over the significant role Haymitch plays in their mutual survival (presumably to ensure tight narrative momentum), as well as the bloodshed of the actual Games (quite surely in order for the film to be able to play to a teenage audience). But in compensation, there is more emphasis on the behind-the-scenes manoeuvring by a quietly menacing President Snow- not simply setting the stage for later instalments, but also underlining the callousness of the Capitol administration in treating the lives of children as mere pawns in a psychological game of dominance and submission. Yes, if there is one aspect that comes off more strongly than the book, it is undoubtedly the allegory behind the dsytopic world of the Games.<br/><br/>Kudos then to Ross, who may have seemed an odd choice for the material given his past works 'Pleasantville' and 'Seabiscuit, for boldly taking the creative liberties with the material while staying largely faithful and delivering a tense, thrilling, intelligent science-fiction thriller with sharp social critiques that will resonate with grown-ups. Indeed, don't let the comparisons to Twilight mislead you for thinking that this is only for kids- thanks to a fearless performance by Lawrence, Katniss is a heroine that everyone of all ages can look up to.<br/><br/><ul><li>www.moviexclusive.com</li></ul>"
"EUyeshima","7","4","15","12 April 2012"," Survivalist Adventure with Satirical Reality TV Sensibilities Benefits from Lawrence's Star Turn
","Among indie-film aficionados, 21-year-old Jennifer Lawrence has lent an impressive-for-her-years gravitas to a diverse array of roles in Guillermo Arriaga's ""The Burning Plain"" (2008), Drake Doremus's ""Like Crazy"" (2011), and most memorably, Debra Granik's ""Winter's Bone"" (2010). She showed up as Mystique, one of the ""X-Men: First Class"" in the big-budget 2011 actioner last year, but it was her role as resourceful backwoods survivor Ree Dolly in ""Winter's Bone"" that appears to be the direct descendant of the heroine in this 2012 adrenalin rush of a movie - Katniss Everdeen, just sixteen but an expert archer living in District 12, the poorest of the dozen civilian sectors that make up the future state of Panem. Based on Suzanne Collins' hugely popular young-adult trilogy, Katniss' story is enmeshed in a dystopian society ruled by an unforgiving government seeking to provide penance to its downtrodden citizens through annual televised, ""Survivor""-like bloodletting sports which give the movie its provocative title. Each event requires two ""tributes"" from each district, a boy and a girl, who must participate in a winner--takes-all survivalist match which means a likely violent death for the 23 others who must lose in the process.<br/><br/>This gory concept is leavened by new-to-the genre Gary Ross' (""Seabiscuit"") surprisingly humanistic direction; a sometimes shrewd, sometimes silly screenplay by Ross, Collins and Billy Ray (""Shattered Glass""); and a sharp cast combining the faces and fit bodies of young Hollywood with veterans who don't appear to be taking the proceedings too seriously. It's over 2 1/2 hours long, so the pacing has to be quicksilver, and Ross manages to keep the momentum up for most of the story. In the introductory sequence, District 12 is represented as a tableau of Dorothea Lange-style images reminiscent of the Oklahoma Dust Bowl in ""The Grapes of Wrath"". Katniss lives with her passive mother and worshipful younger sister Prim. As fate would have it, Prim is chosen out of a raffle-like fishbowl to be the district ""tribute"" at which point Katniss unhesitantly volunteers to take her place. She is paired up with an oppressed baker's son named Peeta, who is more than willing to play by the rules to win the game. They are whisked off to the Capitol where along with the rest of the ""tributes"", they are groomed and trained in a style akin to ""American Idol"". This part of the movie is more predictably entertaining given the sly, satirical jabs at current reality-TV programming.<br/><br/>Once the games finally begin in the forest, it becomes more of a standard adventure action yarn albeit with some clever twists that recall scenes from Peter Weir's underrated ""The Truman Show"". However, the events start to feel by-the-numbers as the ""tributes"" meet their inevitable fates in orderly succession. Give Ross credit for not belaboring the violent elements in order to maintain the film's PG-13 rating. What I liked most about this part of the film was not so much the burgeoning relationship between Katniss and Peeta (which feels a bit more emotionally removed perhaps due to what may be coming in the sequels) but the poignant connection between Katniss and young Rue, which culminates into the film's most moving moments. Less effective are the hand-held camera-work by Tom Stern and the agitated editing by Stephen Mirrione and Juliette Welfling, both elements making it sometimes difficult to figure out what is going on at any given moment. Moreover, the movie loses whatever social consciousness it had at the beginning save for one racially motivated scene of violence. In spite of these flaws, Lawrence gives the movie a much-needed soul as she drives the film's fanciful narrative through her stoic yet penetrating nature.<br/><br/>Josh Hutcherson (""The Kids Are All Right"") doesn't make as vivid an impression as Peeta but handles the role serviceably, while it seems fairly obvious Liam Hemsworth's curtailed role as Gale, the smitten boy Katniss leaves behind, will be more prominent in the sequel. Among the ""tributes"", Amandla Stenberg shines brightest in the spotlight role of Rue. More exaggerated turns are provided by Woody Harrelson as drunken mentor Haymitch Abernathy, Elizabeth Banks as garishly garbed escort Effie Trinket, and Stanley Tucci as preening blue-haired emcee Caesar Flickerman, a Ryan Seacrest-doppelganger. Relatively more subtle are Lenny Kravitz (complete with gold eyeliner) as Katniss' compassionate stylist Cinna, Wes Bentley (""American Beauty"") as sinister show producer Seneca Crane, and a lionized Donald Sutherland as the President. Production designer Philip Messina and costume designer Judianna Makovsky deserve kudos, even though Katniss's flaming-red (literally) evening gown was underwhelming. For such an obvious franchise, the film manages to entertain for most of its running time, even if parts feel quite derivative of other films like ""The Running Man"" and even ancient relics like ""The Most Dangerous Game"". It's a pretty effective start to the trilogy."

","There are plenty excellent dystopic movies, and even movies that feature killer kids like Battle Royale and A Clockwork Orange, which combined the two. The adaptation of The Hunger Games can stand alongside them with its head held high. The Hunger Games is a dark, grim movie that is brutal with its violence (or as brutal as a PG-13 movie can be) and a character-driven story that is brilliantly led by Jennifer Lawrence with a talented supporting cast. Gary Ross was able to bring us into this futuristic world and the use of shaky cam was a benefit not a hindrance. The Hunger Games shows a well-created world and society with plenty of ideas of its own about violence in the youth and reality TV. There was a Truman Show-like feel during the second half of the movie with the gamemakers manipulating the arena. A little disclaimer, I was lucky enough to see the proper American cut.<br/><br/>Please visit www.playeraffinity.com"
"NyxEos","9","4","15","26 March 2012"," A Good Adaptation
","For those of you who don't know the basic story line: There are 12 districts controlled by the Capitol. Every year a boy and girl, aged 12-18, are chosen from each district to fight to the death for all to watch. <br/><br/>There lies the biggest problem with this adaptation. It is about the brutal slaughter of nearly two dozen teens by each other, and yet the movie has been watered down to be PG-13 appropriate, most likely to expand the potential audience. Unfortunately, this means that the true brutality of the games is somewhat overlooked.<br/><br/>For people who have read the novel(s), there of course are changes made. Having read the books when they first came out, I only noticed a few changes. Fortunately, these new ideas don't impact the overall story line that much, making for a good book to movie adaptation. However, the changes made do ignore some of the more subtle ideas of the book. This is especially true for explaining the relationship between Katniss and Gale, which is a minimal part in the movie because it occurs mostly in the opening of the book.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie was well done. The camera work was often shaky (on purpose to create drama), which worked in some scenes but became tedious in others, especially when it was simply used to cover up deaths. The actors worked better than I had originally thought they would. Josh Hutcherson is a little too boyish in my opinion to play Peeta, especially since all of his work has been in children's movies, but he did pull off the role. Fortunately, there were no actors who simply could not act or just did not have the ability to fill the role.<br/><br/>I went into this movie slightly terrified that they would ruin one of my favourite novels and was very pleasantly surprised when I left to find myself happy with the adaptation and with plans to buy the movie when it comes out on DVD. I definitely suggest seeing the movie, and reading the books of course.<br/><br/>I rate this a 9/10."

It was set out perfectly, i have no regrets whatsoever. I think everyone should go see the hunger games because it is absolutely amazing! the camera is not fast passed, in only one scene is it moving fast, the reason being is because the characters are in a part of the film which entails running. The guy above or bellow me who said he was sick is rather silly, some films are fast paced. Great movie i recommend it highly. My friend enjoyed it so much that she wants to go see it again! Just fantastic."
"zactac","10","4","15","25 March 2012"," May the Odds Be Ever in Your Favor. And they certainly are!
","The odds are definitely in The Hunger Games favor in terms of box office and reception. I am a huge fan of the book and when I heard about the movie I just got excited as anyone could possibly get. Of course I still had some doubt. Every time I heard someone say it would be the ""next Twilight"" my heart would drop because Twilight is by far not anywhere close to the standard set by The Hunger Games. However, I went into the movie with an open mind and was absolutely blown away.<br/><br/>The cast that were chosen for the film was perfect. Jennifer Lawrence played Katniss with exceptional strength and even grace that made me completely buy her as being Katniss and could not imagine anyone else as the strong heroine. Woody Harrelson portrayed Haymitch with a respect for the character in terms of how the character truly feels about the Capitol and showing him as a man made bitter by his life, which in my opinion was pretty much what Haymitch was. And Donald Sutherland as the vicious President Snow was absolutely terrifying in the role. He brought on the same aura of malice and hatred that the character was easily able to create in the books. This is just the first movie and I cannot wait to see what else he brings to the table in future installments. Now I could go on and on about how superb the cast was because it is true. Everyone brought something great to the table but it was Jennifer Lawrence's portrayal of Katniss that held the movie very high up. The action and violence was also pretty gruesome and done just right so that it didn't go overboard but was faithful enough to the book that the violence wasn't undermined. The outcome of having Suzanne Collins (author of The Hunger Games) work with director Gary Ross to write the script for the film version was probably one of the best things to happen for this film. It is superb filmmaking at it's finest.<br/><br/>In closing, The Hunger Games is a faithful film adaptation to a great book that is superbly written, performed, and directed to create what will probably be one of the best films of the year. The action and suspense will have you on the edge of your seat throughout the film as well as surprise those of you who have read the books. This film is about two-and-a-half hours long but the pacing matches that of the book so that when it's over you'll feel like its only been an hour-and-a-half. It never drags on but is always on the move to something more exciting than the one before. This film will stay with you for years to come and will make you think a little more about what direction our society is going in."
"zhopp-182-494878","9","4","15","25 March 2012"," A very good adaptation
","After having read the books, I was very much looking forward to this movie. I must say, it did not disappoint me. The acting was good, the sets and costume design very well done, especially in the Capitol. It also did quite a good job following the book, while also doing a good job of making it available to those who hadn't read the books. People will complain about some characters being omitted, but these characters were very minor in the overall story-arch, and were necessary omissions to keep the movie at an acceptable length. In my opinion, the only real problem with this movie is the excessive use of shaky-cam. It was quite distracting at times, and usually was quite pointless. 9/10"
"shanebeacham","9","4","15","24 March 2012"," From The Eyes Of Someone Who Has Not Read The Book
","I wasn't really sure what to expect from The Hunger Games. I had heard of the books, but I never read them nor did I know anything about how much of a fan base it has until recently. As for the trailers, they didn't seem to really excite me; they didn't look bad, but it didn't really get me hyped up to see the movie. I'm glad I gave the film a chance, because honestly, this is probably my favorite film of 2012 so far.<br/><br/>Now this film is directed by Gary Ross, director of Pleasantville and Seabiscuit, and while he hasn't directed many movies (he has written quite a few though), when he does direct he's actually really good. And same goes for The Hunger Games; he really did a good job of bringing this story to the screen. And he's also one of the writers of the story, along with Suzanne Collins (the book's author), and they both turn in a great script here, with great dialog, great story, and great characters. And this movie really gets you involved with what's going on, even for the minor characters. When a person dies in this movie, even if they've had less than five minutes of screen time, it was kind of shocking.<br/><br/>Speaking of the characters, let's get to the actors. Jennifer Lawrence is absolutely amazing in this film, and not just in beauty (my future wife, ladies and gentlemen), she really can act. Now I've only seen her in X-Men: First Class and in this film (haven't seen her in Winter's Bone), but this is probably the best I've seen of her. She is outstanding. And while I'm not the biggest fan of Josh Hutcherson in the few films that I've seen him in (mostly kids movies so maybe that's why, he was never really given a chance to act ever), but here he does a really good job, and he's sort of like the underdog of the story. There are also some great secondary performances by Woody Harrelson, Wes Bently, Donald Sutherland, Lenny Kravitz, and Stanley Tucci. All of them do a great job, in fact there is probably not a single weak role in this film.<br/><br/>And the action sequences are just fantastic in this film. There's been a few complaints about the use of shaky cam in the movie, but I think it actually made the scenes better because it really showed the intensity of the situation and the chaos of it all. And this movie is violent for PG-13, in fact there are a lot of bloody moments. This isn't something you should take your kids to see, young ones anyway. The pacing was also really good, and for a movie clocking in at almost two and a half hours, it felt neither too long or too short; it felt just right.<br/><br/>The funny thing was that I thought this movie would get boring after the first half had passed through, because I was so wrapped up in just getting to know the characters and wasn't really interested in seeing the actually Hunger Games section of the story. But it caught me off guard; not only did the second half keep me interested, it got even more and more better as the film went along. It has been a while since I've seen a movie that did that to me. In fact this is so good, that I can't really say anything wrong about it. It just succeeds in every way that it should have. Check this movie out if you haven't already. Don't worry if you haven't read the books at all, you will enjoy this movie as well. I never read them, but I may now after watching this.

","On edge from start to finish. Don't care about adaptations from the book. Kickass movie, one of the best i've ever seen. I've never been so taken in and consumed by a story of a movie ever. Brilliant bit of cinematography different from anything in the cinemas at the time. Amazing characters excellently portrayed! Only criticism is the fact Katniss and Peeta together end up only killing one other member of the games, seems pretty convenient wolves, berries, wasps and other team mates do all the dirty work for them! Apart from that an excellent movie that had me totally and utterly consumed, i'll be watching it again today! 10/10!"

","lets just say this to begin with,no movie adaption has ever been better then the book,though some movies have excelled in the fullest, there have been some horrid adaptions(Percy Jackson,i am number four,eragon.) but what really stood out about the hunger games book was that this was a dystopian and poor society where people die on a regular basis and children have to kill each other once a year.Gary Ross got as close to the book as he possibly could,some of the dialogue,the setting,the emotional scenes, everything.some people might be complaining about the shaky camera movements but i think it really emphasized on the fights and how you can never know whats going on.overall i feel that this is an amazing adaption and i hope that the sequel is just as good."
"melcher-2001","10","3","10","22 April 2012"," I Aim to Misbehave
","All of my friends know that I'm a dedicated fan and proselytizer of the Firefly television series produced by Joss Whedon in 2002 and canned summarily by Fox Television before it was given a chance to gain an audience. True to the spirit and very premise of the show, after cancellation it emerged through word of mouth and a widespread underground movement to become one of the most popular DVD collections ever. Universal Studios then acquired the rights to produce the movie Serenity in 2005, concluding the arc of the story and initiating Mr. Whedon to big screen directing. Nowadays the one season series runs almost continually in syndication on cable.<br/><br/>This story is reminiscent of the first Star Trek series, which was also cancelled (if somewhat less rudely) by clueless executives in the sixties, going on to become one of the most successful movie franchises ever. Ironically, Firefly offers sort of an anti-Star Trek narrative, where the corporate establishment that the Federation glorifies has now become bad guys and the heroes are essentially anarchists and criminals. Likely this is symptomatic of a collective loss of faith in the promise of unending technological progress and the corporate American Dream. Personally I hope that it indicates a resistance to the virtual assimilation and homogenization of the social commons by the Borglike marketing spheres of vast networked entities like Facebookistan and Twitter.<br/><br/>The quote, ""I aim to misbehave"", is one of the key lines spoken by pirate captain Malcolm Reynolds before he leads the forces of the the Alliance into a deadly trap to expose the secret that allows them to maintain absolute control. It expresses the spirit of contrariness and rebellion better than almost any phrase I can recall spoken in the movies. I've decided therefore to establish a personal commemorative to honor any movie or television show that embodies the subversive spirit so well portrayed in Firefly. <br/><br/>To this end, the first award goes to The Hunger Games, a film by director Gary Ross (Pleasantvulle, Seabiscuit). In a recent interview on Elvis Mitchell's show, The Treatment, Mr. Ross speaks about his interest in exploring societies where a select few exercise disproportionate power without consensus (the 99 and the 1 percent) and how single acts of morality can cause the tenuous fibers of that culture to unravel. <br/><br/>I saw the movie the other day, not without some apprehension. Judging by the number of cover stories on the magazine racks of my local grocery store, it was the most hyped movie since Avatar, and it appeared to be geared toward a younger audience that flocks to movies like Harry Potter and the Twilight series of vampire melodramas. Not only was I more than pleased with the movie itself, I was gratified that such intelligent storytelling is going over big with an up and coming generation. <br/><br/>The Hunger Games worked for me on many levels. The story is a finally crafted arc where a young and very believable heroine named Katniss Everdeen (embodied with strength and intelligence by Jennifer Lawrence) grows beyond her narrow focus on survival to discover the boundaries of her own ethics and morality. She lifts it proudly in the face of a brutal spectacle in which she is risks everything. Supporting the lead performance by a fine group of young actors are veterans like Stanley Tucci, Woody Harrelson (particularly good as a game survivor and mentor) and Donald Sutherland. <br/><br/>Although the movie is set in a high tech future the special effects are largely understated and never come to dominate the performances. Most of the narrative takes place in the woods of an Appalachian wilderness (it was filmed in and around Ashville, North Carolina) reminiscent of the Michael Mann film of The Last of the Mohicans. Unlike many sci-fi epics, The Hunger Games keeps its focus tightly with the point of view of particular characters. Through mostly close-up footage we witness the world narrowly through the eyes of Katniss and thus are taken along on her very personal journey. Outside and against the point of view of Katniss' we see the spectacle from the standpoint of those who work the machinery. In a single notable exception that breaks us out of this closed circle we get a short glimpse of people rising up in response to an act of courage and honor to express rage and quickly repressed rebellion. The scene is effective and memorable as it exposes the thinly fraying threads of brutal control that an act of individual courage can potentially unravel. <br/><br/>The spectacle itself is portrayed as a cross between a television show like Survivor and a modern broadcast version of the gladiatorial arena. By juxtaposing the brutality spawned by the Roman Empire with the presentation techniques of contemporary television (only the costumes and hairdos would seem out of place) we see the dark side of how modern media becomes the primary vehicle for social control. This is the reality of network television. <br/><br/>At the end of the movie we are left with an acute awareness that beneath a very thin veneer of temporary media satiation large forces have been triggered by an act of moral courage. The story is only beginning. Although I've never read the books, I can't wait for the sequel."
"u_sims","5","3","10","17 April 2012"," Fun for those who haven't read it and good enough for those who have
","Having read all three of Suzanne Collins' fantastic novels, I was pumped for this film. And I was mostly not disappointed. <br/><br/>Obviously the premise of this movie is that 24 young people between the ages of 12 and 18 are placed into an arena to fight to the death. The Hunger Games, as these annual events are called, are there to act as a warning to the people of Panem, a nation in the ruin of what was once North America hundreds of years in the future. Panem is divided into 12 districts and the Capitol, which is ruled by the ruthless President Snow. Every year a boy and a girl is chosen from each district to compete in these 'Games.' The protagonist of this film is Katniss Everdeen, a teenager who comes from the poorest district, 12. She has to hunt illegally to provide for her little sister and mother in poverty and in constant danger of starvation. She is chosen to compete in the Hunger Games.<br/><br/>I adore the books, and the film was good, but not great. The plot was fine, as the filmmakers didn't make any big changes from the novel, and the acting was great, especially Jennifer Lawrence's Katniss. Josh Hutcherson, Woody Harrelson, Stanley Tucci, Liam Hemsworth, Elizabeth Banks, Donald Sutherland and Lenny Kravitz round out the cast. All of them were great in it. The bad points of this were the shaky-cam direction style, the drawn-out feel of the 2 hour and 20 minute long running time and also the absence of a score in places which should have had music to make them more effective, e.g the choosing of the contestants. However, this lives up to my expectations and is a fun, exhilarating and interesting sci-fi action drama."
"maudevanhengel","7","3","10","15 April 2012"," Not another adolescent ""hype""
","My expectations were very high, I have read all three books, and I am an absolute fan of THG. The film was really good, they did change a lot, but I think they did it for the people that haven't read the books. They tried to make it less complicated than it seems, because in the books you can hear the thoughts of Katniss all the time, but they can't show thoughts in the movie.. I think the cast set up an amazing performance. I absolutely love Jennifer, she's very confident and strong but she can also show her sensitivity to the viewers. Josh is just adorable, in every way. I'm not a huge Liam Hemsworth fan, but he was rather good as Gale. I do have a downside. I went home with a major headache, cause I was on the 4th row in front, and the camera was really shaky so your eyes get so tired of it. The director attempted to make it that way, and to make it less 'flowing' and the attempt worked, but not when your sitting out front..<br/><br/>Overall, good film, great cast, and I'm waiting for 'Catching Fire'!"
"seaview1","8","3","10","11 April 2012"," The Bloodsport of THE HUNGER GAMES
","A mega-best selling trilogy by Suzanne Collins has spawned this first installment, The Hunger Games, adapted by Collins, Billy Ray, and director Gary Ross for the big screen as a satisfying adventure thriller featuring a terrific performance by budding superstar, Jennifer Lawrence. The film avoids the pitfalls of previous best-sellers turned into films that lacked a sound structure for the uninitiated readers (as in The Da Vinci Code); it works quite well for newbies. The filmmakers have kept the main storyline compelling and emotional within the framework of an action film.<br/><br/>In the not too distant future, a group of twelve districts has been punished for 74 years for a failed rebellion. Each year, they must participate in a random lottery or 'reaping' of their youth for a lethal competition, a fight to the death with only one winner. The games are grand, lavish events that are in essence, public executions in the guise of entertainment. There are specific rules and boundaries except when they suit the whims of the game masters. Food, weapons, and supplies are made available but not without an accompanying danger, and there are sponsors who can provide life saving assistance and support in timely ways.<br/><br/>In one district, Katniss (Lawrence) is a teenage girl who is good with a bow and arrow and dotes after her younger sister, Primrose, and their mother. She is close to a boy, Gale (Liam Hemsworth), who has strong feelings for her. When Primrose and a boy, Peeta (Josh Hutcherson), are chosen for reaping, it sets off a surprising series of events including a desperate sacrifice by Katniss as the chosen few must train for their lives in a competition that is televised nationwide. The contestants are feted like celebrities and are mentored by a former survivor named Haymitch (Woody Harrelson) with support from Cinnas (Lenny Kravitz effective in a brief role). When these modern day gladiators are released into the wild, loyalties are tested and survival instincts take over, and a grand spectacle is replaced by a grim fate that awaits all but one survivor.<br/><br/>Director Ross (Seabiscuit) knows how to tell a good story and he is aided immensely by a strong cast that melds newcomers with seasoned veterans like Harrelson, Wes Bentley, Stanley Tucci, and Donald Sutherland. Special mention goes to Elizabeth Banks as a macabre emcee. Lawrence (Winter's Bone) shines in a physically demanding role, but she never shortchanges her ability to show feelings and angst in a convincing way. You root for her and feel her pain. Her portrayal of Katniss has a genuine decency and soul which, despite the savage nature of the games, reveals her humanity for the world to see. Might her actions and deeds register among the masses and have far reaching consequences? <br/><br/>This brave new world of deadly sport (that plays like a perverted version of TV's Survivor), is authentically realized by impressive set designs and costumes which contrast two disparate worlds-a pauper class of citizens and the gaudy elite. If much of this film's storyline sounds familiar, it draws from pop culture sources as Shirley Jackson's short story, The Lottery, and films like The Most Dangerous Game, The Truman Show, and The Running Man. Even elements of Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 and George Orwell's 1984 come to mind with its oppressed societies and ever watchful video screens, and when cannon fire signals a fallen victim, it echoes moments from Capricorn One. The sacrificial humans are dubbed 'tributes', a contradiction of terms not unlike Orwellian propaganda and its mixed meanings e.g. ""War is Peace"".<br/><br/>While The Hunger Games ends in a manner that could be considered a conclusion, it does leave events open to a followup. Strong, emotional ties that are formed during the games have powerful implications at home, and the outcome sets the stage for the germination of a movement. I for one am very curious what will happen next."
"buter1","7","3","10","11 April 2012"," Good, but missing a lot
","I read the first ""Hunger Games"" book a few months back, and really enjoyed it. Today, I saw the movie.<br/><br/>I thought it was pretty good, but not great. It REALLY needed another 20 minutes or so during the actual Games. Many characters that are quite important in the book (especially Rue and Cato), are barely shown in the movie, and give us little or no reason to care about them.<br/><br/>A big chunk of the movie was the lead-up to the actual Games. I understand there was a lot to get through, especially for people unfamiliar with the book, but it took too much time away from the actual premise of the movie.<br/><br/>I will give the director solid props for conveying just how much the people were afraid of being selected to compete, and Jennifer Lawrence's scene (as Katniss) right before going up the tube was extremely well done. She's a fantastic actor.<br/><br/>In fact, almost all of the actors were great. The only one I thought was kinda average was Peeta, and I think that had more to do with his voice tone than anything. Still, he did a good job overall.<br/><br/>The main bad guy (Cato) in the book was not even much of a presence on screen. The knife girl did a better job showing that she was dangerous. The big black kid was probably on screen less than two minutes, and he was a major concern during the Games as well.<br/><br/>Again, Rue was REALLY not done well. I blame this on the editor. The actress did fine, but the movie just plain didn't show why she was so important to Katniss. Her character should have had at least five more minutes of screen time just to explain their bond.<br/><br/>The finishing scenes were decent, but the very end was ambiguous, at best, for anyone who hasn't read the book."

","The start of the film was very dry and boring then when the action happened the films was nearly over but the action and special effects were awesome that is why i give it a 9 they just need to fix up the start of the film then the films would be top of the box office I'm not that much keen about the romance parts i thought it was all about survival not kissing a guy seriously they should have removed it but i spose it was important otherwise they would have had a short film i am only a action/adventure type guy and i love films like avatar battle los Angeles and stuff like S.W.A.T and i love games so if you are into romance stuff you will like this films it has a lot of it"
"bill-1830","7","3","10","8 April 2012"," Good movie. Bad camera work
","this was a good movie with a good plot. The two main actors were surprisingly good. <br/><br/>The movie shows a stark difference between the poverty of District 12 and the technology and cleanliness and prosperity of the Capitol.<br/><br/>I think the time during the games could have been longer with more survival and conflict scenes. It seems like the actual games/competition went by awfully fast.<br/><br/>But, overall I enjoyed it.<br/><br/>EXCEPT: way too much use of the unstabilized shaky hand camera. My eyes hurt by the time the movie was over. This is what will keep me from watching again on the big screen."
"timothy-cooper4","8","3","10","5 April 2012"," True to the novel and a great stand alone film
","Of course it has to be said that no book adaptation is ever as good on screen as the novel is on paper, but for the first time in my life I have not in any way been disappointed by the film. The story is well paced and progresses, even if a couple of the lesser facts and details in the book are skated over in the interests of time, but still for the most part covered. (Sorry that I'm being a little vague but I want to minimise spoilers as much as practicable). My greatest criticism is that the character of Rue seems a little bit rushed, and it's hard to emotionally engage with her, that being said it is still pretty well done. I am grading this quite harshly as I have read the book so can't be truly happy, but it is a very good adaptation and well worth going to see."
"Putoestupido","8","3","10","3 April 2012"," Pretty good film...
","First of all, as someone else said in a review, I still make of point of surfing through IMDb before watching a film in the hopes of knowing whether it's worth watching it or if I should stick to waiting for a DVD version of some sort.<br/><br/>True, the scoring is not at all bad here on IMDb but then come the reviews... the first 15 or so rating the film very poorly, claiming 'twas the new Twilight saga or a rip-off of Battle Royale. If you've read these reviews, take them with a hint of salt. <br/><br/>Granted this is pretty much setting itself to be the next money-making Hollywoodesque saga. It has a lot of the usual elements that get teenage groups to fall in love with the franchise, throwing their money - and tear-jerking awe's - its way. That doesn't necessarily make it a bad film.<br/><br/>As for the comparison to Battle Royale, I'd much rather, if feeling the need to compare this to something else, compare it with The Gladiator - fighters from whatever part of a given world, mostly poor or slaves, are pitted against each other in an arena of death. Ring a bell? In fact, human nature, human history... humans in general, were definitely the inspiration for this story. Comparing this to Battle Royale is the equivalent to comparing 1984, a Brave New World and The Trial because of their descriptions of a ""future dystopian society"" - for anyone who's read them, you'll know how impossible this comparison is.<br/><br/>To wrap it up, go watch this film. I was expecting little and came out well impressed, if not a bit disappointed about how people are analyzing stuff these days. I'm a huge film and book fan, I watch films on a daily basis (being quite picky and critic of most of the stuff Hollywood sends out this way) and also read plenty of books, and I would find it very hard to compare the two franchises, BR and Hunger Games, let alone call the latter a ripoff of the former.<br/><br/>Please, please, please, just stop reading stuff online before watching a film if you know it will bias your opinion... You'll have a better time at the movies and you'll be thinking about them by yourself."
"mhar244","8","3","10","31 March 2012"," Unsettling and thought-provoking
","The main thematic elements of this film have been covered many times by many great books and films but The Hunger Games still is an exciting and worthwhile watch. I was impressed that they were packaged for a slightly younger intended audience than classics like 1984, The Lord of the Flies and V For Vendetta. As with Lord of the Flies, the actions are all the more disturbing as they are being performed by and on children.<br/><br/>The premise is a little shaky. There does not seem to be any reason why holding The Hunger Games is the best way to keep the rebellious districts in check. However, if we accept that this *is* the way that The Capitol wants to do it, the way that they manipulate the population and the competitors is very well executed.<br/><br/>The suspense is palpable throughout although the shaky camera that is one of the techniques used is irritating in the beginning of the movie. It is used to better effect during combat when it obscures gratuitous violence and conveys panic and disorientation. The violence was greater than I expected for a film aimed at young adults but the themes mean that it is not in vain and it is used to further the story.<br/><br/>I must admit to liking films with bad guys who I can get truly angry at. Although I did restrain myself the urge to throw popcorn was quite high in parts. It is possible to get emotionally wrapped-up in the story and a few tears were shed. In some of these parts it was quite obvious what was going to happen and the suspense comes from observing when and how. Perhaps that is the inevitable problem with stating from the beginning of the story that most of the characters will die.<br/><br/>Although this is the first of a trilogy and there are some loose ends, the major plot elements have been wrapped up by the end of the film. I did not feel short-changed as I have with others, but it did leave me wanting more and I don't intend to wait for the next film as I have not read the books yet.<br/><br/>I came out of the movie thinking about a lot of things, and comparing it with the great works I have mentioned before. If I thought for certain that this movie belonged in the same echelon as those I would have given it a 10 but by virtue of conveying the message in the way it did, to new audiences, and making me leave the theatre deep in thought it deserves my high rating."
"t-oliva2009","9","3","10","30 March 2012"," Really great movie.
","This movie was fantastic. I'm the type of person that picks out the flaws of movies, and to be honest I only saw a handful, which was rare. I'm sure if I watch it more, I will see more. But the story was awesome even though it borrowed from other tittles. It actually made me go and buy the books which I will start reading shortly. One part I really liked is when the commentators actually talked about things that were happening. And Katniss was played fantastically. One thing I wish they did, was add more of the survival aspect of the game. It seemed like it went too fast. But that is why I will read the book and get the full sense of it."
"stuttnugget","6","3","10","29 March 2012"," Overrated unfortunately
","Having read all three books, and finding the story was fantastic, I was hoping for an amazing movie production, bringing the 1st chapter of Suzanne Collins trilogy to a fantastic start...<br/><br/>... Unfortuanately I was to be disappointed, the movie had missed out many key points, and in some areas they where completely changed, making it difficult to understand - even for someone who has read the books. Another unfortunate element to the movie was the acting. In some areas there was special points when I really felt how they where feeling, but most of the time I could not connect with them, making the film less enjoyable. The idea of reducing the rating to a 12A and editing out elements that would of expressed the classic story that the author wrote. Overall the film was very plain, dare I say ""boring"", leaving me wondering what all the hype was over.<br/><br/>All in all, I would say this is a film to perhaps wait till it comes out on DVD, and not one to waist a night out on."
"hkronin","10","3","10","29 March 2012"," Excellent Adaptation
","I was aware that the movie had been made while reading the novel. One thing I kept wondering was, ""How in the heck are they going to do this in the movie?"" I just couldn't picture how the film could capture the imagery and storyline. I was very impressed with the movie. The casting was spot on, the acting was excellent, and the settings were perfect. So much of how the movie was filmed was exactly how I imagined it in the book.<br/><br/>Obviously, the biggest hurdle in any movie adaptation from a book is trying to encompass everything that happens in the book into a 2 hour time slot. Let me just say that NO movie can do this, and no movie ever has recreated the entire story of a book. It just can't be done in such a time frame. Had they done that, people would complain that the 6 hour movie was too long. Despite these restrictions, the film did an excellent job of capturing the feel of the book, and the emotions of the book.<br/><br/>In my opinion, anyone who is a big fan of the books should watch the movie twice. Once to learn about what is kept, edited in the movie and to digest the differences; then a second time to simply enjoy the movie, knowing already what has been cut/added, and just enjoy the feel of the movie."
"shadow_oflight","8","3","10","27 March 2012"," Well, it does actually deserve an 8
","Sure, it does. The concept of the movie isn't anything new, more of the same storyline or a mixture of themes of the movie Death Race, Spy kids, a little of the Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire- yeah, teens forced to battle at life-threatening conditions to survive for a cause. If you haven't read the book like me, you'll find that the same popular concept has been brilliantly executed in a unique way, thereby making it special from the currently releasing movies,and hence allowing one to easily give it a rating of 8. I'd say that it is one of the very few movies where the futuristic world, though transformed with high-end technology, still has the poor whose lives aren't changed a bit. This contrasts scenes of the movies where the rich live in the future."
"nowego","7","3","10","27 March 2012"," I've Read the Books, This Hits the Spot OK
","I finished all three books a couple of weeks ago, so they were pretty fresh in my mind when I saw this movie at the cinema. While it is not a perfect adaption of the first book by any means, if you have not read the books you will still be entertained and dare I say it be less critical of the things that were left out.<br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss is pretty much as I pictured her while reading the books, Josh Hutcherson as Peeta was solid and here I am a bit critical of too much being left out for his character. Woody Harrelson as Haymitch was nicely done and he fit my image of him from the books, again I am a bit critical of too much being left out for his character as well. Liam Hemsworth was terrible as Gale, not totally his fault though, another character with way too much cut from the book, not that I cared too much, I didn't have much time for him throughout the series.<br/><br/>A few reviewers, or more than a few compared this to Battle Royale. I can see where they are coming from, but this not comparable, they are not the same. OK fine they both involve teenagers fighting to the death, but that is where the comparison ends for me. Battle Royale is in a class of its own and has a story of it's own, this movie should not be compared to it.<br/><br/>I am not a teenager, but I went to see this with my teenage daughter and we both enjoyed it and thought it was money well spent for 2 hours of entertainment. I would have liked to see it quite a bit longer just to do the book justice, but I can see that when catering to the teenage market movies have to be cut short. Or do they? Hopefully there will be an extended version ala Avatar, which explained so much more than the theatrical cut.<br/><br/>7 out of 10 for me, I would have given it an 8 or a 9 if it had kept more of the depth from the book. Looking forward to the next one."
"LilCat","8","3","10","25 March 2012"," Nice Movie!!
","This movie was actually VERY great. I was sort of expecting it to be really terrible like most films that are based on a book. Not this one. It was very action packed for a PG13 movie, but there are SOME flaws though.<br/><br/>One: There should have been a Madge. I think it would have worked better if there was a Madge to give Katniss the pin.<br/><br/>Two: I think it was kind of rushed, but I don't blame them. If it were longer than two hours and thirty minutes I think I would have peed my pants though. Two hours and thirty minutes is pretty appropriate for this film.<br/><br/>Three: I think that the movie could have been more steady. I mean sure they're in a forest with explosions and all that, but I just think that they shouldn't have filmed this so shakily. I think I was really dizzy watching this movie.<br/><br/>Those are the ONLY flaws to this movie. Overall, it was very impressive. I think they really stayed true to the book. <br/><br/>I mean what did you guys expect? For the movie to be better than the book? I don't think that's EVER going to happen. Not in a million years. I highly recommend this movie, if not, read the book!"
"aoestrat","5","3","10","25 March 2012"," Adequate
","to start off, like the ""Twilight"" books, ""The Hunger Games"" is built for teens. After reading the books, I wasn't to excited that they were making a movie adaptation of it. This was based on the preconception of many movies based on books, but continuing. ""The Hunger Games"" does the book justice in the sense that many of the plot elements from the book are in the movie, but the main problem with this movie is that it's paced poorly. The beginning half of the movie could have been shorter in my opinion. There isn't much time spent on developing characters and even though the editing's intent is to speed up the history of the characters it doesn't work. The second half of the movie is to short. I'd rather suffer through the second half then the first half because it's really where the meat of the story is and spending time in the stadium with the characters would work because the camera is our eyes and I want to feel the anxiety in characters and I want to feel the fear that the ""Hunger Games"" are supposed to instill. The movie doesn't do this like the beginning it uses an odd pacing and it speeds the second half to much. The camera work is also something to complain about because instead of helping me enjoy the movie it gave me a headache with the constant shaking. Acting, Jennifer Lawrence did an OK job, but many of the other actors, especially Woody Harrelson didn't do well. The lines came out somewhat robotic. In the end the movie was an amateur adaptation of a fine book replicating to much and not taking advantage of it and improving it. The movie's adequate watch it if you want, but for those who don't want to sit in a crowded theater or pay unreasonable prices wait for it on DVD."
"TheRyleeAnn","6","3","10","24 March 2012"," Good, but watered down and detail lacking compared the the book.
","This was one of those movies i was very excited for- one of my favorite book series, that i read back in 08 when they came out being turned into a movie! I was pretty excited for this, despite my worries they would turn it into a twilight-esque cheesy romance to attract more of the teen crowd. The romance is a part of the book, but definitely not the most important part! One of the things i noticed: time passes way too fast. I know this is a 2 hours and 20 minutes movie, but time just barely passes. It almost feels like the whole games started and ended in a day. While in the book, Katniss' alliance with Rue lasts for about a week, taking up a good portion of the book, but in the movie it appears to start and end the day she wakes up from the Tracker Jackers. Peeta and her are in the cave for several nights constantly kissing and getting soup for it, not just once or so.<br/><br/>Also, i noticed several times, the other tributes would know something they couldn't possibly know without seeing the games, which, they cannot, being in the arena. Eg. Clove saying ""Wheres loverboy?"" mocking Peeta and Katniss. She couldn't possibly know that, Peeta hadn't left the cave and presumably the careers hadn't found the cave or they would of killed him and Katniss. Also, in that scene, Thresh says ""Just this one time, for Rue."" Which, he couldn't of seen, they don't show their deaths at the end of the day, and Clove hadn't said anything to reveal it.<br/><br/>The shots in the game makers rooms were great and added depth to the Capitols idea of what to accomplish. Entertainment for the Capitol, and keeping the districts in line, which is shown in the book through Katniss' thoughts. Haymitch, which some complained wasn't destructively drunk enough, was actually my favorite role. He started out very mean, and eventually decided to help them, which was pretty interesting, even without the intense alcoholism.<br/><br/>The gamemaker's parts were very entertaining. Katniss thinks about what Cladius Templesmith must be saying in the book, and actually hearing and seeing it fed into the games realism.<br/><br/>There wasn't nearly enough gore, but what did you expect for pg13? My only complaint was Cato's death, which was supposed to be awful and haunt Katniss for ages, was not gory at all. And it was another example of the time thing. In the book, Cato is gradually devoured by the mutts over the course of days before Katniss decides to be merciful on him.<br/><br/>Peeta doesn't have a prosthetic limb, which is new, but the prosthetic limb was unnecessary. As well as Madge and Greasy Sae being removed, unnecessary characters to start with and not a big deal.<br/><br/>I did like it, and it's definitely one of the better releases this year, but it was severely watered down, which is a given, considering the book is a pretty heavy read and a first person narrative, unlike Twilight, for example.<br/><br/>6/10 for good show."
"michaelRokeefe","9","5","21","31 March 2012"," Killing for future luxury.
","THE HUNGER GAMES is based on the first of a trilogy of novels from the pen of Suzanne Collins. In a futuristic nation-presumably the former United States-is divided into twelve districts. They are fenced and many miles apart. Some of the districts are affluent, while some offer a very minimal existence...akin to the former Appalachian area. The totalitarian government boldly holds a lottery every year to select two children, a boy and girl, from each district that will participate in a televised killing ritual to humble those that don't already reap rewards from the government that has unbridled power. To the survivor of the Hunger Games comes fame, wealth and luxury for their family. A young Primrose Everdeen(Willow Shields)is chosen as one of the 24 ""Tributes"" and unprecedentedly, teenage Katniss(Jennifer Lawrence)volunteers to take her sister's place. Katniss will have a mentor Haymitch(Woody Harrelson)to prepare her for the grim and deadly games. Himself a former champion of the Games trains Katniss in drunken disgust for the whole affair. Due to living in the poorer of the districts, she is already more than efficient with a bow and arrow. There is a majestic-like pregame program letting the masses get a better look at the participants they will be forced by the government to watch and root for. The Games are monitored by many specially placed cameras. The actual killings are usually brief and most off camera. To make things interesting the government will keep changing some of the rules as the Hunger Games are in process. Katniss will also be publicly forced into a romance with her district player Peeta(Josh Hutcherson). Meanwhile her real boyfriend(Liam Hemsworth)will be forced to watch. This movie runs over two hours and will spark interest in the Collins novels...and of course the sequels practically guaranteed to come to the silver screen. Other notables in the cast: Stanley Tucci, Wes Bentley, Elizabeth Banks and Lenny Kravitz."
"summeriris","10","5","21","23 March 2012"," At last, a first class adaptation of a first class book.
","I have always thought that The Hunger Games was a very good book with a lean and powerful way of conveying the plot. The film has a lean and powerful way with showing this. Going beyond strict adherence to the book it translates the story into a cracking cinema experience. The director got first class performances out of his cast, his vision of the books was spot on and I really did not notice the 'shaky-cam' camera work. I also have to commend the wardrobe dept, the fashions of the Capitol were truly bizarre and Katniss and Peeta's 'Fire Costumes' were just right. I in fact thought the red interview dress was better than the one described in the book. The killings in the arena were brutal and tragic. The death of Rue was just as heart wrenching as the book and I thought Jennifer Lawrence wonderfully conveyed her dilemma over her feelings or Peeta. I also really enjoyed Josh Hutcherson's portrayal of Peeta. He was great in a very difficult role to pull off well. On re-reading some of the reviews I find it so amazing that some people are still trying to say that Collins 'ripped-off' an obscure Japanese film that was never released in the US till after this film was in the cinemas. I just find it so difficult to believe that she 'stole' ideas from a film that never played in her country. It's just so hard to steal ideas that you don't know were made, and did the fact that Takami seems to have 'stolen' his idea for 'Battle Royale' book from a previously published book called 'The Knights of the Forty Islands' count as a rip-off' as well?"
"jmcginn174","10","5","21","23 March 2012"," ""I want to show them that I'm more than just a piece in their Games,""
","The Hunger Games is based of the novel by Suzanne Collins, and is the first in a series of books that are followed by Catching Fire and Mockingjay. I started reading the novels a few months ago when I first heard about the films and I have loved all three of the books, and couldn't wait for the film to come out. Now before I go onto the review I need to go over some of the preconceived notions about the film and books going around in movie reviews and the internet. The first is that the books and film are a rip off of manga series Battle Royal. For some reason fans of the series thinks the manga is an original idea when it isn't. I've read the manga. Years ago my older brother introduced me to the manga series. I enjoyed it for what it was a violent manga with great action, but not much else behind it. The story was lacking and so were the characters. As for the originality of the series it takes its ideas from great books and films like Lord of the Fly and Ender's Game among others, so saying that Battle Royal is original is laughable. When are people going to learn that it is virtually impossible to find a truly original idea anymore. What it comes down to is execution, bringing your own take on the idea and making it your own. Suzanne Collins does that The Hunger Games and her series of books using an idea that has been used before and making it her own in which she created a great and dark futuristic dark world with flawed and likable characters. The second thing I hear about is how the novel is geared down tween girls and these comments from people who actually haven't read the books. I've read the novels and I'm a man and in my early thirties, and I don't think they're geared for girls in their early teens. In my opinion this is geared for everyone. It's a dark series especially Mockingjay that deals with child on child violence, children forced to sell their bodies, war and torture among the other themes in the books, so saying the novels are truly geared for teen girls is just wrong. Finally we have the comparison to the Twilight books. For some reason reviewers and the public and general are overstating the romantic element in the novels and the so called love triangle between Katniss, Gale and Peete. It's nothing like Twilight, which I tried to read but couldn't because it was really bad. First of all unlike Twilight some crappy romance isn't the main driving force in the novels. Second there isn't a love triangle especially if you've read or have gone on to read the other two books. It comes down to Katniss and Peete. Collin's made that pretty clear in the novels. They are after all the two most important characters in the book. Katniss who will do almost anything to survive and the kind hearted Peete who doesn't want to let the Capital to change him and the confusing and growing relationship between the two. All right I'm done with my rant. I really got to stop surfing the internet or going to certain sites, and now onto what I thought of the film.<br/><br/>As I've said I've read the novels before seeing the film, but I'm not one of those people who'll penalize a film if it's not a perfect copy of the novel. The Hunger Games film adaptation is a great film to put it mildly, but in my opinion it's an excellent film. The best I've seen in recent memory. I think since Inception a few years ago. I won't go to in-depth into the plot of the film since it might spoil the film for those who haven't read the novel. It takes place sometime in the distant future after some kind of world war/disaster which caused the collapse of the United States and North America, and what rose from the ashes was Panem. Panem has a president but it's more of an empire then a republic. Years before the novel the thirteen districts of Panem rose up against the Capital but lost with the destruction of district 13. After the war the Capital forced the districts obedience by holding annual games in which a boy and girl from each district from the ages 12 to 18 are randomly picked and forced into game/reality show in which they children must kill each other and there can be only one winner. You don't need to read the books to enjoy the film as it's pretty easy to follow. As for the film adaptation of the book its stays pretty close to the book. There are a few people cut from the film. The mayor's daughter Madge Undersee and Peete's parents cut from the film. I shouldn't say they were cut since I don't know if they were edited out or just not added. Then there is Haymitch (Woody Harrelson) who they didn't wasn't introduced in the film like he was in the movie. I didn't mind the small deviations from the novel and I liked what they added in place. The added a behind the scenes take on the film. Showing the head game master Seneca Crane (Wes Bentley) as he views the games along with his interaction with president Snow (Donald Sutherland).<br/><br/>Sadly there's a word limit for reviews here. If you want to see my full review go to Movieweb.com and look under the name Huntsman. Otherwise this is a great film and should be seen by everybody."
"anithiasafreedom","10","5","21","23 March 2012"," Excellently Done
","The movie was absolutely amazing. Some die-hard fans of the books may be angered that Katniss wasn't narrating every step of the way, and we weren't trapped inside her skull; to this I respond, ""It's a movie."" Very few things were cut from the plot, and absolutely none of them were major. Gary Ross did an amazing job of converting the dark, immediate tone of the book to the big screen, and though some will be annoyed by the shaky camera shots, I personally liked them; they captured Katniss's very distracted, flighty view of the world. Suzanne Collins also did an amazing job of showing the back-story and logic behind the Hunger Games through scenes highlighting the Gamemakers, Seneca Crane and President Snow, highlighting that this twisted spectacle is being put on not only as entertainment for the Capitol, but also as a political tool to keep the Districts in line. Jennifer Lawrence was amazing; she captured every one of Katniss's emotions perfectly, really bringing her to life. The rest of the cast also gave amazing performances, and I am really looking forward to the prospect of seeing these actors again in the sequels. I strongly predict that The Hunger Games will become the next film series to stick in mind as a hallmark of this generation."

The subtle changes from book to movie were acceptable. How i pictured it in my mind while reading it, Gary Ross brought it to life. All the actors were amazing- they carried out the characters like its really who they are. They were not acting, they're living someone's life like its their own. One name that stood out- KATNISS. Oh how i love that Jennifer Lawrence did her justice. I felt her anger pain and triumph. I will definitely go to the cinema again just to experience the hunger games once more. IM COUNTING THE DAYS TIL CATCHING FIRE."
"haleyrox7","10","6","27","20 March 2012"," Watch out Twilight, The Hunger Games is here!
","I thought nothing could be better than the Harry Potter series until I read the Hunger Games. I am definitely one of the biggest fans of the Hunger Games and I was so excited when I found out they were making a movie. I was lucky enough to go to an early screening of it a week before it opened. There must have been a lot of pressure on everyone involved in making this movie and the actors because of the fans' expectations, but I can tell you you will not be disappointed. <br/><br/>I understand how you could compare the Twilight or Harry Potter series to The Hunger Games without knowing much about them, but the Hunger Games is a completely different story. Although Twilight and The Hunger Games both have a love triangle involved, The Hunger Games is more focused on Katniss's story and on the actual games. <br/><br/>When I found out Jennifer Lawrence was casted as Katniss, I wasn't happy because I thought she was too old. I'm sure many people felt this way too, but she did a phenomenal job with the role and she lead me to believe that she was sixteen years old. Josh Hutcherson (who is my favorite actor and future husband) was a remarkable Peeta. When I read the books before they casted the roles, I actually pictured him playing Peeta and he did not disappoint me at all. Willow Shields (Primrose) and Amandla Stenberg (Rue) are both young and new actors, and I thought they both did outstanding jobs even though they had small roles. I am not going to review all of the actors, but I thought all of them were casted perfectly for who they played.<br/><br/>In the beginning, the camera was very shaky and a little bit hard to follow, but later it improves a lot and the shakiness adds a real element to it. I thought Gale (Liam Hemsworth) had a very small part in this movie, and only had about five minutes of screen time in the very beginning in the woods and saying goodbye to Katniss. Hemsworth is in most of the interviews with Hutcherson and Lawrence, but I don't think his character is significant enough. He played a much more of an important part in the book than in the movie. The violence in the movie was not as bad as it was in the book because it had to have a PG-13 rating. The camera blurred out most of the gore, but there was still enough violence to make the movie. There were some minor flaws in this, but it is hard not to be a little bit disappointed when a movie is so highly anticipated, but overall it did not take away from the movie at all. I highly recommend the books and the movies, so bring a lot of tissues and go see The Hunger Games!"
"agent-ya","10","6","28","21 March 2012"," #1 Film of 2012
","'The Hunger Games' is one of my favorite, if not my #1 favorite, book series of all time. The movie was a really good film. If you've read the books, you could say that it felt very rushed, because to me it did feel rushed. I guess they did their best to fit what they could, in the amount of time they had. They left things out and changed a lot of things, which is expected for any book-screen adaptions. Books will always be better than the screen adaptions. The moment I was looking forward to seeing (the tribute parade) was kind of disappointing. What I imagined was more extravagant, especially with the District 12 outfits. Overall it was a really awesome film. Enjoy."

Usually movies based on books do not meet expectations. But this one is rather different: it is really good! Worth every minute of it, 100%! The whole atmosphere of the book is very well given, and the same with the characters too -- they are as real as they can be, acting great.

"moonspinner55","6","4","16","22 April 2012"," Distasteful premise made 'commercial' by its hedonistic, human-exploitation framework...
","In the future, after war has ravaged the planet and turned the basic rules of society inside-out, a bloodthirsty public goes wild for a reality show in which different young people are selected as participants (mostly against their will) in a survivor-take-all outdoor showdown. Director Gary Ross, who also co-adapted the screenplay from Suzanne Collins' book (with Collins and Billy Ray), throws a lot at the screen (action, family drama, teen romance) yet is relatively unable to erase the distastefulness from this scenario (which isn't made palatable simply by putting the context of human exploitation within a totalitarian society framework). Jennifer Lawrence doesn't have a particularly expressive voice or face, though she makes us care for the central character, a tough young woman who volunteers to substitute for her little sister after the child is chosen as a participant during the preliminary 'reaping.' The handsome boys cast opposite Lawrence don't really suit her, however--and there's an unavoidably anti-climactic void at the finale, which leaves itself open for the obligatory sequel. Well-produced and occasionally gripping, despite over-the-top visual effects, jittery camera-work and simple scenes edited to a fare-thee-well, apparently by filmmakers who didn't trust the collective attention spans of the movie-going public. **1/2 from ****"

","Now far from the future, North America collapsed. The country is divided into the Capitol and 12 districts. For the last 75 years the Capitol hosts the annual Hunger Games. The rules are simple: 2 people, one male and female in each district are drafted and must kill each other for survival. Whoever wins the game will receive fame and fortune. Prim (Willow Shields) is drafted to compete the hunger games. Her sister Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) bravely volunteers for her replacement. On the male side, Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) is drafted. Together Katniss and Peeta represent District 12. For the next two weeks the 24 contestants must be train both physically and mentally in order to get an idea of what the outcome will be. Her trainer Haymitch Abernathy (Woody Harrelson) has one thing to say ""Put up a good show."" Let the games begins<br/><br/>After months of speculations, I'm happy to say that The Hunger Games is well adapted onto the big screen. Fans of the book won't be disappointment. Yes, there are going to have sacrifices and changes, but keep in mind my dear readers that books and films are different entertainment formant. It is impossible for a movie to have all the content in a novel. If that was the case, then the movie would have been at least 10 hours. As long as films is faithful to the novel, then its good news. The story is far from original. From reading the book and watching the movie, it seems the Suzanne Collins, the author and screenwriter of the film, was influence by Battle Royale, The Running Man, Survivor, Gladiator, The Most Dangerous Game, Greek Mythology, and Reality TV. When you have this combine, you'll have a great story toe tell that is if the filmmakers can pull it off and they did. The characters development was astonishing, which is extremely rare in modern films. All of the actors were fantastic, but mainly Jennifer Lawrence and Woody Harrelson were great. Katniss is one of best female leads that I've seen in a long time and I have to give credit to Jennifer Lawrence for her portrayal. Her character reminded me of Allen Ripley from Alien Series. She's young, kicks ass, shows emotions, smart, and caring. On the hand Woody Harrelson is a well known actor who knows how to play his characters. One of the reasons why I like Haymitch is because he's an alcoholic and can be mean, yet he also is helpful and kind at the same time. Nobody can play the role as good as Woody Harrelson. The film lacks action, but that's a good thing because story comes first. There are moments of intensity during the actual game. Even better, some parts were brutal for a PG-13 rating. There are moments that were emotional, but unfortunately I can't tell you because I don't want to ruin it for you my dear readers. Believe it or not the film is political. Is it conservative flick or liberal? It all depends on you. There is one negative part; even the audience who I asked after the film was over, that I didn't like and it was the hand-held cinematography. It was unnecessary for Davie Ross, the director, to use this technique. The main problem was that he overused it. At least this problem is forgivable. <br/><br/>The Hunger Games is well adapted. Fans will not disappoint (unless of course you're picky about changes). Newcomers will love it. Male audience will appreciate it. The Hunger Games is easily one of the best films of the year. <br/><br/>A-"

","When I first saw the trailer for this movie, I said to myself, ""yeah, that looks interesting, might check it out on DVD."" Over the next few months the hype exploded for this film, and then for my birthday I got the first book. And after reading it, it completely lived up to the hype. It had everything, action, romance, drama, gore, political satire, the only thing it might have needed more of is comedy.<br/><br/>So by the time I got to chapter five, I knew I wanted to see this movie as soon as possible, and I just watched it, so it's fresh in my mind.<br/><br/>This could very well rank up as one of the best adaptations I've ever seen. This ranks up there with the Harry Potter series, and is actually better than a few of those. Every thing the book has, this film has, action, drama, romance, it doesn't have too much gore, but it is a PG-13. There are some things left out, and some things were changed, but that's just necessary.<br/><br/>The book is in first person, so the fact that this movie obviously can't be, both works for the film, and against it. I liked the fact that they showed inside the control room, and really liked when District 11 began to fight back. But since we can't read Kaniss' thoughts, we have to rely on flashbacks and dialog. Most of the time it works, but sometimes I feel that if you haven't read the book you may be lost.<br/><br/>I just hated the capitol, the fact that they can show private conversations just makes them even more unlikable.<br/><br/>I love the way the people in the Capitol dress, it's so over the top that it's hilarious. And the film also really made me hate the girl from District 1, Glimmer. As well as a few others from the alliance. The rest kill because they want to live. But it just seems like these people do it for the fun of it.<br/><br/>The acting is great, the special effects are well done, and There are a few things I didn't like, the shaky cam did get annoying at times. It seemed that the last twenty minutes were kind of rushed. And did I miss a few tributes deaths, because it seems they went from 24-11-10-6... Also, and this is personal, because I just finished the book a couple days ago, I knew exactly what was going to happen, so there wasn't much suspense. But that isn't a problem with the film, and I chose to read it.<br/><br/>Overall, I was very pleased with this movie. I couldn't decide if it was better than Chronicle or not, but in the end I put it ahead. Meaning this is my favorite movie of the year so far. I will definitely be getting this movie when it comes out on DVD/blu-ray, and I can't wait to read the next two books, and if those are good, then I can't wait to see the next two movies."
"sfo10","10","5","22","23 March 2012"," Beyond my Expectations
","While I originally loved all of the cast picks and expected this movie to be incredible..it was even better. Jennifer Lawrence was amazing. She became Katniss right before your eyes. You could see her emotions, the fear in her eyes, the determination to survive. I don't think there is any other actress that could have come close to bringing Katniss to life. Josh Hutcherson was another incredible pick for Peeta. He was able to make you feel the fear and dread Peeta felt at the reaping and show you the love he had for Katniss. As for all the other actors, they were all perfect. Elizabeth Banks couldn't have been a better Effie and don't get me started on Woody Harrelson for Haymitch! I wasn't sure if he would be a good Haymitch but he proved me wrong! And as for Lenny Kravitz as Cinna, perfection. I could go on and on about how great all the actors were because they really were the best.<br/><br/>As for the actual plot, the movie followed the book very well. There were a few changes that were made, but it was understandable since it had to have been difficult to put much of what happened in the novel into a two and a half hour movie.<br/><br/>In conclusion, Gary Ross did an incredible job directing this film. Everything..the cinematography, the costumes, the set, the effects, and the actors were just perfect. I had been waiting for this movie for three years and it did not disappoint."

It followed the storyline extremely well and I was impressed with the film. The little changes that were made from the book all worked out well and nothing in this movie was done bad.<br/><br/>The acting was well done especially from Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) and although Prim (Willow Shields)was not in the movie as much, her performance nearly brought a tear to my eye. The emotions that came out of her brought my emotions out which is quite hard for actors/actresses to do.<br/><br/>Overall, I am extremely happy with this movie and I could not stop smiling.

","I have never read any of the novels that the film is based on. I was never really highly anticipating this film. I saw this weeks after it came out, with the hype already having died down. So after saying all of that, what do I get? A pretty excellent and viscerally exciting blockbuster.<br/><br/>I think that the film does a very good job of being able to stand on its own two feet. It moves pretty quickly, but it never drags in any places. It also really does hold a lot of emotional impact. As the film goes on, we see more and more of the ""usual"" blockbuster trademarks, like music appearing especially louder in a ""sad"" scene. But it all works well. The film editing and cinematography are brilliant in the way they give the film it's tone and it's visceral excitement. A lot of people have complained about the cinematography especially, but I honestly loved it, and it's a big part of why the film worked so well.<br/><br/>How about the performances? All pretty good. But this is Jennifer Lawrence's film. She was great in Winter's Bone, but here she develops her character in a much more fascinating fashion. I loved Winter's Bone, it's one of the best films of 2010, but I was one of the few who thought that Lawrence's performance had some weak points definitely. Here? Not at all, she manages to show her traits and her subtle emotional ticks much better. As it is, she's an actress to watch out for, and this is her best performance yet.<br/><br/>Overall, I can't say everything in the film worked perfectly. I thought that the relationship between Peeta and Katniss was a bit forced, a bit awkward. I didn't completely buy it, then again I'm not so sure I was supposed to because I have heard book fans say they are ""faking"" it... could someone clarify on that? But as it is, this is great blockbuster entertainment, and a great film."

The special affects, scenery, and acting skills of all the characters were amazing. *SPOILER* When the Hunger Games begin, many of the tributes die in gruesome ways and it only shows them for split seconds, but a minute or so later it goes back and shows the dead tributes, and there's some blood and that might make some people cringe a little bit. They did leave a few details out of the book, which kind of annoyed me, but it's nothing they can't put in the second movie. Also, when the District 3 boy who gets his neck snapped(i love him!) and when Rue dies is very upsetting, but thats what happened in the book. For language, nothing bad.

","So to most people this is pure fiction.<br/><br/>If they would pay any attention, whatever the Elites are preparing for in this Country, would probably be much worse than what is depicted in this movie.<br/><br/>As for the movie itself, there were things that could have been done better.<br/><br/>Below is the list of few flaws in my opinion: <br/><br/>The way system of ""Elites"" works is that few rule and control many.<br/><br/>Even if that was intention, it was not depicted in that manner. It almost looks like each district was comprised of few hundred, maybe thousand people. However, the ""Capital"" itself was much more grand so the whole the concept of ""few"" vs. ""many"" was upside down.<br/><br/>The people who are constantly battling hunger, should they really be this strong and powerful? <br/><br/>There was dialog about how ""too much hope is dangerous"". That is correct.However, in battle of good vs bad, unless at least one or two so called ""Elites"" could start to question themselves, and realize they lack the basic human traits, there is no hope.<br/><br/>In a movie that touches the subject that this movie does, I would have liked some hope.<br/><br/>Now getting away from the bigger subject, and concentrating on the plot itself, in the end the two ""tributes"" from the District-12 are encouraged to fake love (at least the girl is) so some ""Elites"" would root for them. In the end the ""Show Master"" tries to turn them against each other, but fails.<br/><br/>Why not have them be true lovers? Why not let the movie also be a true love story? Why not have the ""Elites"" not only try and break them, take away their basic humanity, but also try to extinguish their love. That would be way more powerful.<br/><br/>Finally, I appreciate that people of District-11 have had enough and at least rioted. For sake of humanity, I needed more.<br/><br/>Maybe the movie's real purpose is to simply acclimate us to what is coming.<br/><br/>We are not in Kansas anymore ladies and gentleman.<br/><br/>Real hunger games are coming, and they would make the ones depicted in movie look like picnic."
"Agashi","9","3","11","5 April 2012"," Near as perfect a book to movie transition as is possible...
","In my opinion, The Hunger Games more than deserves its rating on Rotten Tomatoes. While the movie stumbled a few times trying to deliver the heavy messages and themes from the books, the transition was smooth to a large extent and the scenes necessary for setting up the next three films were, for the most part well-crafted. However, I feel that the success of this movie was due in large part to the fantastic source material and not so much to the film-making itself.<br/><br/>Where the film really shines is in the performances of its actors and their delivery of the simple, straight-forward script. While I felt one or two characters could have used more screen time and development, there wasn't a single bad performance anywhere within the movie, and quite a few wonderful, memorable ones. Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss in particular stands out.<br/><br/>All-in-all the only complaints I have with the film all have to do with the direction. The gratuitous usage of shaky camera techniques especially, were difficult even for me, a devoted fan of the series, to sit through without being sick. I also felt that Gary Ross may have dropped the ball with the last third of the movie, delivering a climax that was good, but uninspired and very by-the-numbers."
"PWNYCNY","9","3","11","3 April 2012"," This is a very good movie.
","Shocking as this may seem, this is actually a very good movie. What seems to be a contrived, half-backed plot set in some futuristic, post-apocalyptic world, is actually a substantive story. The lead actress gives a wonderful performance as a courageous teenager who is determined to survive without becoming depraved. This movie in some ways parallels the Running Man with Arnold Schwarzenegger, except here the characters are more nuanced and the heroine much more vulnerable, making her surviving that much more impressive and dramatically compelling. The supporting cast is excellent too and includes a composite of characters that are both amusing and repellent. The audience is kept engaged as the plot movies full speed ahead, taking the audience for a ride."

It made me even more excited to see this movie. I had very high expectations and they were definitely met! I am so happy with the cast that they chose. With Twilight, they chose the complete wrong actors which made the movies really bad. People cannot even compare this movie to the Twilight movies. This movie blows Twilight out of the water.

I am glad she is getting so much praise for this role because she deserves it! I can't wait to see the next couple movies!!"
"alloyd93","7","3","11","26 March 2012"," Well-Done
","When I went to see this movie, I was only halfway through the book after only starting it the day before. The book was so good (of what I had read of it at the time) that I was impatient to see the movie, especially with all of the notice it was getting.<br/><br/>Getting ready to see this movie, I had taken a couple of things into consideration: it was an action and partial teen-romance book. One big thing I notice in movies, while I'm watching them, is the music. This movie being the two genres I mentioned, I expected the music to either be epic (like Pirates of the Caribbean, LOTR, etc.) or very teen- oriented (band-based songs). It was, mostly, neither. The musical score let me down, and the main song that I had fallen in love with (""Safe and Sound"") wasn't actually in the movie.<br/><br/>However, many other things were done right. The graphics and camera shots were AMAZING. In one scene, the contestants are let loose into the arena, and the film goes relatively silent. This in itself portrays how easily your ears can fuzz-out when you are experiencing an adrenaline rush. I applaud the use of that tactic in this movie.<br/><br/>Also, when I saw Katniss's dress as compared to how the book described it, I was briefly disappointed. The book mentioned that it was supposed to look fiery, and as the scene continued, I saw nothing. Then, she stood up and twirled around--and the hem of her dress burst to flames! I was amazed. And one of the most beautiful shots was when they were in the chariot with their capes ignited. Many scenes/shots in this movie are gorgeous and worthy of being stills.<br/><br/>Honestly, when I imagined all of the violence that took place in the book, I was afraid of how thoroughly depressing it would be to see children killing each other in a battle to survive. Though it was sad, the movie was filmed to shield eyes from the worst of what happened, which I am grateful for.<br/><br/>Overall, since this review has gone on for far too long, I give this movie an 7. Watching this movie without reading the books is hard, but well-done to be sure."
"manuscriptna","9","3","11","26 March 2012"," A really good adaption of the book!
","From a Christian perspective, this movie had me once again second- guessing what I would do in Katniss' position. Would I resort to killing to stay alive, and bless my district? It was hard to think about. So, I simply sat back and watched. Katniss and Peeta do most of that sort of thinking for you, but it makes you wonder about your own convictions if put into such a situation.<br/><br/>The filming was excellent, for the most part. Near the beginning, and a few times later on, the camera shook so much that it nauseated me, and I couldn't tell for the life of me what was happening. The broad contrast in colors from District 12 to the Capitol was really cool, and that leads me to my next observation.<br/><br/>The Capitol really showed off its pomp and reliance on style. There were so many crazy and absurd ways of showing off their ""beauty"" that it made me sick. It starts just by wanting to get noticed. Reminds one of Hollywood, eh? *chuckle*<br/><br/>The gore was not very prevalent, which is good. In some cases, though (such as the death near the end), the violence is implied very intensely. That really bothered me, but it's a story to make you bothered at The Capitol. It did it's job well.<br/><br/>Peeta and Katniss' characters were done well. Peeta didn't seem to show much depth, however, while Katniss did. Her reaction to her sister was chosen as tribute was heartbreaking. Judging from her excellent work in X-Men: First Class, she will go very far.<br/><br/>In respect to the novel of the same name, it did very well! The slight few things that differed, improved the film. Seeing the book on the silver screen worked wonders, no matter if we knew the story already or not.<br/><br/>The length of the movie, nearly 2.5 hours, was actually quite necessary. The preparation for the games required lots of attention, as did the games themselves, obviously. The time spent in each area was well- determined.<br/><br/>I am pretty glad they didn't make this movie 3D. While it may have made it neat at times, there just wasn't enough reason to justify it."

","Story: Every single story element of movie is already seen in some other movie. So nothing new and exciting. Without much thinking recent ""In time"" movie delivered similar big brother, central elite province being supplied by slave provinces, the the survival game settings like in The Condemned and many more movies.<br/><br/>Action: Its not really action movie, action is rather mediocre.<br/><br/>Character drama : Maybe that appeals to someone, to me it was nothing special. Except maybe that little girl's part was OK i guess.<br/><br/>So if its not story or action , and I don't think drama is over the top... Besides cool shaking camera that give me more headache then boosts dynamics, I would say this movie is just average."

","NOTE: I did not read the book. I went in open-minded.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the movie, but there was lots of flaws.<br/><br/>The shaky camera was a distraction, but i assume the director planned it that way to distract from the gruesome killing or else we won't be watching a pg-13 film.<br/><br/>Almost every character felted underdeveloped. Maybe cuz there were too many characters to begin with. If I know more about their background I would've felt more remorse at the scene of their death.<br/><br/>The first half of the film was interesting but the second half felt rushed. I know it's already stretching at 2 1/2 hours but it just felt incomplete. I could use more explanations and more action.<br/><br/>The flow was inconsistent. Like others were saying, it's like clips pieced together instead of an actual movie.<br/><br/>Overall, I didn't regret watching the Hunger Games but i don't know if i will watch the next one in theater."

","6/10. Like an episode of Bear Grills meets the running man, I have mixed feelings about this one. Whilst it undoubtedly has its moments I cannot overlook some of the more annoying aspects of the film. Specifically the jerky camera thing, I assume this is some kind of ""technique"", if that technique is to make its viewers feel sick then bravo! It worked. Woody Harrelson has a great knock about role, but I wasn't sure what his motivation was, he seemed to swing from useless drunk to ruthless realist, I didn't get it. The ridiculous female character who picked the names, what was that all about? What was her role? Too many questions, not enough time, even in 2+ hours. Anyway, despite the daftness of the plot and the lack of charm or warmth from most of the actors I still quite enjoyed it - after all I do like Bear Grills and The Running Man, so there you go."

Each district has two teenagers between 12 and 18 years old in the killing competition, that the winner is the only one alive.<br/><br/>There are many memorable characters including Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence), a really brave girl that safes the young sister from the competition, entering in her position and Peeta Melark ( Josh Hutcherson), a guy from the same district as Katniss, representing it in the Hunger Games, has a long-date crush on her, and shows your force to fight and work in hers side.<br/><br/>I am not normally keen on actions and science fiction movies and I 'm glad that I decided to watch it, it's the best movie I've ever seen.

","Just a good plot start point to give a pseudo-socio-political vision of an unknown country, but that it does not give any details and focuses on the action and adventure of survival. Technically it starts with too much camera movement, something that can take you out of the story. Fortunately it stops and go on with more common ways of filming. There is a continuous walk on the edge between popcorn movie or something more serious and deep. At the end you are not sure of it is totally achieved or even you never get to know about the real purpose. The best without doubt, the image of the media and realities. And overall the uncomfortable and uneasy feeling that it generates and that leaves us wanting compensation. Incomplete movie but very good starting point for the remarkable proposal for the second part."
"Dan1863Sickles","Null","2","6","3 December 2013"," The Original Is Still The Greatest!
","Since I gave CATCHING FIRE a bad review, I wanted to come back and say how much I loved the original movie, THE HUNGER GAMES. <br/><br/>It's so easy to make fun of this movie as if it's just another teen exploitation product, like the TWILIGHT movies. Certainly there are times when it feels that way. A lot of people say it rips off other action epics, everything from RUNNING MAN to ROLLERBALL. <br/><br/>But THE HUNGER GAMES also has elements of much older films, like THE GRAPES OF WRATH (hillbillies coping with poverty in a dignified way) and ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT (corrupt government forces young people into pointless war) and even GONE WITH THE WIND (in a time of turbulence, a headstrong, independent, strikingly beautiful young woman must save her family and deal with her feelings for two very different beaus.) <br/><br/>This is not to say that it's a great movie all the way through. It's not always convincing as a study of totalitarian governments. As a drama it's often corny and derivative. The real point is that Jennifer Lawrence can do anything and make it seem fresh and new. She can be honest and stubborn in the face of social injustice (like Henry Fonda as Tom Joad), sensitive and thoughtful in the midst of combat (like Lew Ayres as Paul Baumer in ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT) and she can even be innocent and sensual and provocative all at the same time (like Vivien Leigh as Scarlett O'Hara.) <br/><br/>Quite a range for a young actress who's still learning her craft!"
"RyanEberhart","10","2","6","25 November 2013"," Excellent!
","The Hunger Games is one of the best movies of the last few years. Released a year and a half ago, The Hunger Games has grossed nearly $500 million; with a budget of $78 million. Suzanne Collins, with the help of Gary Ross and Billy Ray, wrote the screenplay for The Hunger Games using the book of the same name as a guide. The screenplay is as close to the book as possible given that the author is Suzanne Collins herself.<br/><br/>Suzanne Collins created an amazing story about a dystopian future, the totalitarian nation of Panem is divided between 12 districts and the Capital. Each year two young representatives from each district are selected by lottery to participate in The Hunger Games. Part Entertainment, part brutal retribution for a past rebellion, the televised games are broadcast throughout Penem. The 24 participants are forced to eliminate their competitors while the citizens of Panem are required to watch. When 16-year-old Katniss's young sister, Prim, is selected as District 12's female representative, Katniss volunteers to take her place. She and her male counterpart Peeta, are pitted against bigger, stronger representatives, some of whom have trained for this their whole lives. (The Hunger Games storyline, IMDb.com)<br/><br/>Since this movie is more than a year old I can safely describe my three favorite scenes and not feel guilty about giving away any surprises.<br/><br/>The first scene I liked was the when Katniss volunteered to take her sister's place as tribute. All the teens assemble in order to be selected as tribute. They are selected by lottery, with each having their names entered at least once, many several times. Katniss is worried that Prim, who is only 12, would not be able to survive the brutal combat. In order to save her sister when her name is called, Katniss volunteers to go in Prim's place. It is an emotional scene, as is the scene in which Katniss is saying goodbye to Gale, Prim and her mother.<br/><br/>The second scene I liked was actually the sequence of scenes that each district representatives are in training. It is here that Katniss and Peeta gain allies and support. My favorite part is when Katniss shoots an arrow in the direction of the judges. It is not well received.<br/><br/>My third favorite scene is when Katniss kills Marvel. Marvel, the male tribute from District 1, attacks Katniss and Rue. Katniss dodges Marvel's spear and shoots an arrow at Marvel killing him. Katniss turns to Rue and sees that the spear she dodged had instead impaled Rue through her chest. Rue dies in Katniss's arms. Katniss decides that to honor her friend and ally she would decorate Rue with wildflowers. Rue's family and the rest of District 11 appreciate the sentiment that Katniss showed. Upon seeing the last of his daughter before her body was taken away, Rue's father and many of the other men in District 11 start a riot.<br/><br/>I loved The Hunger Games. The graphics were amazing. The storyline was awesome. I could see how some of the things in the story could actually happen.<br/><br/>I would, however, suggest that before you watch any of the movies in The Hunger Games series, please read the books.<br/><br/>I give The Hunger Games 10 stars out of 10."
"arsalankazemian","6","2","6","14 September 2013"," Attractive story but poorly made
","I haven't read the Hunger Games book so I can't say if the adaptation has been a success.<br/><br/>The film had a very attractive beginning for me. A totalitarian state which still punishes its people for a rebellion committed many years ago. It reminded me of the world of George Orwell's ""1984"". The people of the districts will have to pay for their rebellion and live a deprived life while the people of the Capitol, Panem, live a life of plenty and extravagance.<br/><br/>Which reminds of another Orwellian element in the story: the ignorance in which people of the Capitol live. The whole frenzy of the people of the Capitol about the Hunger Games -- the deaths, the violence, the bets -- is out of their ignorance, and quite frightening.<br/><br/>The whole setting of the film and the story quite fascinated me and promised a very good film. But as it went on, it became more and more a teenager film with big flaws in the story and the characters.<br/><br/>As a whole, the film is entertaining and doesn't make you bored even at about two and a half hours. There are some good performances by Woody Harrelson, Donald Sutherland and Wes Bentley, not to mention the lead role played by Jennifer Lawrence."
"GibsonExplorer1976","6","2","6","3 March 2013"," Entertaining but thin throughout
","You can tell this movie was going for depth (which it sometimes achieved) and, during the games themselves, intensity, but it never quite reaches the heights it could have.<br/><br/>The first thing I noticed about the film was the directing style, which had a ""Children of Men"" approach to it at times (which is interesting considering Alfonso Cuaron is directing the sequel) but instead goes a little overboard. Some shots were extreme close ups and extremely shaky at the same time, giving you a slight headache within the first ten minutes, but that soon ended and for the most part the directing was pretty good.<br/><br/>What keeps this film at six stars for me were the games themselves. The build up to it was quite strong--the emphasis on getting sponsors, the reality show feel the games were supposed to be for Panem, the survival factors--but those did not come to fruition during the games themselves. Haymitch makes it quite clear to Katniss that she needs to find water. He says something along the lines of ""water is your new best friend"", and yet she enters the arena, escapes the initial carnage, finds some water almost immediately and never needs to restock for the rest of the film. As for sponsors (I'm assuming those ""gift drops"" are provided by sponsors), we only ever really see that come into play once or twice--a few quick shots of Haymitch shaking hands with some stylish dressers.<br/><br/>But my absolute biggest letdown was the ending. I liked the fact that the rules were changed to allow two competitors from the same district to survive, only to have that rule revoked at the very end. But then, Katniss boldly tries to commit suicide along with Peeta, which draws the sympathy of the Game maker who ends it there with both surviving? I understand the point is for Katniss to be a symbol of rebellion but the whole film seemed to be leading up to Peeta's death (and it should have, because now I fear the next film might involve a sappy Twilight-esque love triangle between Peeta, Gale and Katniss) Still, it was a good film overall and I'm hoping the sequel will top it."

I got the impression to get food they had to have their names put in the drawing each time they did but it wasn't explained. My daughter said it wasn't in the movie but it was. I have the books but neither of us have actually read them yet. I also thought there was enough blood in the movie to make the point of what was going on. No one needs raw gore unless they are a sadist. It doesn't matter if the over all theme has been done before. Look at all the vampire movies. The stories may be similar but overall it is different and all of them vary. That is not important.<br/><br/>I liked the girl who was cast as the lead but I almost didn't watch it when I found out Hutcherson was in it. He is one of the worst young actors around. He didn't fit the part as they were trying to portray it. He isn't that attractive and he always seems so childlike. I think that was a big miscast. I also didn't like Woody Harrelson. I don't like either of these actors so that sort of turned me off and then having Sutherland who is too old for the part I think. He is in too many movies like Liam Neeson. I thought his part was sort of milk toast.<br/><br/>The movie is all right but I don't understand why it was such a big box office success for the life of me. The acting was adequate and it is a bizarre movie. Some writers don't always want tragic endings and I have to say I am glad they are getting away from that trend. I watch movies for entertainment. This movie seems on a par with a TV movie to me and I can't say I didn't like it but I was disappointed."

This one has the requisite special effects and color process, sound modification, etc. but it is a joyless exercise with no heart at its core and no chemistry between the 'star-crossed lovers'.<br/><br/>""Hunger Games"" is no better or worse than most other big budget pictures made nowadays that lead the viewer to expect more than what shows up on the screen.

A parable that must resonate for teenagers indeed... since the film's 24 participants must be 12 to 18 years in order to qualify for the deadly competition that will leave 23 of them dead. A parable with manipulative and controlling adults taking their disproportionate pleasure from contests that children play on the little league fields, soccer fields and basketball courts of the USA... as in the hungry arena of fictional Panera. And what percentage will make it to the big time college circuit and then on to the pros? A game seen by teenagers as set up by controlling adults so as to produce one winner and twenty three losers: that is, one Ivy League acceptance for every twenty four applications in the annual American college admissions contest. Cut throat (oh so literally in the movie) competition over grades, honors, external recognitions. The big question in the viewers' final ten minutes of the film is... can the teenagers turn the tables on the adult leaders, outwit the system, and survive?

It was definitely a kill- joy to have 22 children violently killed however, this did create an attachment to each player.

A book can be a basis for a movie, but it is NOT a screenplay and it never will be.<br/><br/>It's an interpretation of an artist, and his point of view is subjective and restricted - so is a photograph, that portraits somebody (literally) in a different light and so is a movie. This includes:<br/><br/><ul><li>the cast - the plot - on what to focus - (and lots more)</li></ul><br/><br/>But about the 'focus': A story that takes days to tell in a book can never be completely 'converted' into a movie, unless it's something as dull and shallow as 'Twilight'.<br/><br/>So forget about the book for once and enjoy the impression that Suzanne Collins and Gary Ross are giving us. And yes, she also wrote the screenplay, so blame her for the adaptation :)<br/><br/>I haven't read the book and I have a lot of unanswered questions. But that doesn't matter. The movie is just amazing - and the producers' decision to avoid the R-Rating is completely understandable in my opinion, because I see a lot of educational value. To avoid spoilers, I won't go into detail, but it's a movie that portrays a likable hero, which a lot of the movies are lacking nowadays.<br/><br/>You find yourself in the protagonists point of view a lot and you really start to root for the good guys. The movies portrayal of entertainment, the power of television and the media over people (and how to take it back) is only a small glimpse of what the book might have to offer.<br/><br/>I am definitely going to read the book now, because I want to know the rest of the story.<br/><br/>A must-watch on my 2012 list, definitely Top 3. Ignore the bad reviews that refer to the books.

","In my original review of the hunger games, I said that it was a good movie and nothing special but after reading the source material and watching the film twice, I find it to be an ambitious and thought provoking film especially for the YA genre. As for the BA ripoff comments that people say, it is similar to BA in premise but thats where the comparisons end. It has more in common with ""The Running Man"" not that its a bad thing. The plot is this: In the future North America no longer exists and is now called Panem which is separated into 13 Districts and the main Capitol but District 13 rebelled against the totalitarian government and as a result it was destroyed. As punishment to other Districts, The Hunger Games (which involves sending teenage boys and girls to kill each other and the last one standing wins) was formed to prevent other future rebellions.<br/><br/>Our main character is Katniss Everdeen played by Winter Bone's Jennifer Lawrence who willingly volunteers to take her young sisters place in the hunger games after she is chosen. After viewing the film a second time after I read the book, I noticed that the movie was surprisingly faithful to the novel with minor changes and additions which make the story more interesting and emotional. The casting is great with the best being Jennifer Lawrence who manages to capture the book's Katniss Everdeen very closely. Not to mention, she's a more interesting and compelling character than Kristen Stewart's bland Bella Swan from the Twilight movies.<br/><br/>Gary Ross's direction is great with introductions and building tension in the first half then exploding with fast paced editing and action in the second half. I'd say that The Hunger Games is a good movie franchise off to a great start. For those who are tired of Twilight see this but be warned. Despite the fact that this film is rated PG-13, it still has teenagers killing each other and is not for the feint of heart. 8 out of 10 stars"
"blaineanna89","7","2","6","25 August 2012"," A good movie, but I just wished they paid more attention to details...
","I knew nothing about the Hunger Games book series up until this year. When I saw the previews to the movie, I assumed it was just another teen movie to drive me crazy will all the unnecessary hype. But I heard good things about the books from a couple of people and ended up reading it. Safe to say I enjoyed reading the first book and plan to read the rest in the series.<br/><br/>On the contrary I was not too caught up with the movie. I tired very quickly of the teen frenzy, which included the Twilight mania. Although I actually enjoyed the Twilight book series as well, but the movies are probably one of the worst film adaptations of any book series. Again I digress. I had the same fear with the Hunger Games. On a good note, I was pleasantly surprised and happy that this is definitely not another Twilight.<br/><br/>The Hunger Games was excellent in the visionary department. The scenery was excellent. The beautiful landscapes, District 12, the surrounding foliage and woods, and also the Capitol. I imagine you have to get the feel of the setting in the book. From the impoverished slums of the districts, to the plush and vibrant mood of the Capital. They did a splendid job on that. <br/><br/>The Games were done well too. I liked the technique of them showing the blood splatter of the tributes that were killed. I think this could have easily been a Rated-R movie because of how brutal the killings were in the book, but I liked that they made it more easier for kids and teens to watch. The camera angles and tricks were also cool and added great imagery. <br/><br/>I thought Jennifer Lawrence gave a convincing performance as Katniss Everdeen. One minor detail is that she didn't fit the physical description of Katniss (as also Gale) I just remember that some people made comments about some of the African Americans that were cast. (Rue, Thresh and Cinna.)I don't understand double standards. To defend the casting, I think Rue, Thresh, and Cinna where perfectly cast. I love Lenny Kravitz and who could resist the innocent face of Rue? The rest of the cast was surprisingly good as well. It was nice to see Donald Sutherland again.<br/><br/>Again I know the books are always better than the movie versions, but I just wished they paid more closer attention to details. The flashbacks were kinda confusing and would probably be even more confusing to someone who didn't read the book. They cut several scenes and rearranged it. The pacing was sometimes slow and sometimes it felt rushed, but these are minor details that don't ruin the movie.<br/><br/>I watched it four times already so far, so it is definitely worth more than one watch."

","Let me clear a few things up first. STOP comparing this movie to the book, I know it's an adaptation but clearly they won't be able to please you by adding every single little aspect and detail from the book into the movie, they tried their best and I think they did a wonderful job. This movie is heart-pounding, exciting, sad, funny and everything in between. This is a fun movie to watch alone or with your friends. Despite being a PG-13 action movie it did a fairly good job at keeping me interested throughout. I'm looking forward to the next one. I give this movie a 8/10 for a pleasant surprise and heart-pounding action."

","I will admit to not having read the book, but for me this was a refreshing movie in the wake of a Hollywood that seems out of any real ideas.<br/><br/>Sure, I know a lot o people who have read the book are somewhat disappointed with the movie, but for me, I liked it. I only rate it a 9 out of 10 due to some clear storyline stealing from other books and films, but altogether I think this is a movie that clearly stands tall in a sea of remakes, already dones, and uninspiring performances.<br/><br/>Now there are some stolen aspects that I did notice. It steals a political plot very close to that of the Orwellian 1984, a bit of the Wizard of Oz's Emerald city, and even a little Sheakspearean Romeo and Juliet thrown into the mix, but all told not too bad Let's face it, if you are going to take inspiration from others, those are not bad ones to use. My only real negative is that I wish it was a little longer and maybe a little more back story on how we got to this point in the authors created world, but knowing Hollywood we will probably see many sequels and or prequals because the movie business likes to ride the money horse until it is dead tenfold. I only hope they don't do that to this movie."

","The hunger games is about people coming out of different districts and two people from each district have to fight 'till life and death. The are brought Harry Potter like to the center with a train. Like ""cabin in the woods"" there is a Big Brother involved. This is an action movie, and from time to time there is an emotional element.<br/><br/>The people who came to fight, join groups to eliminate the weaker people. Why? It's everyone for himself. When the weaker people are eliminated, they surely have to kill each other, because only one can survive in the end. So it doesn't make any sense. For the movie maker it was easier to let some people join groups, because when they are eliminated, they are eliminated together. Besides that, it is easier not to work out all the different characters. There is this little black girl who puts leaves on the main character, why? At the end it is better is you would have killed the better contestants.<br/><br/>Nice movie, but it is not very believable."

","Just to start, I'm a huge fan of The Hunger Games books. And yes, I really need to say that there's a to many things different in the movie (like the absence of Madge, ) , but also things that's not in the book (like the last speech of Cato). About the actors I have to say that all of them are amazing... excepting some scenes with Josh Hutcherson, that sometimes seems very blocked, but nothing that can disturb our attention to the film. Gary Ross did an amazing job! what happens is that the book is narrated all the time by Katniss and the story happens on what she sees and feels. But the movie shows all about the gamemakers and all that occurs behind the hunger games, what's really interesting. There's maybe some poor effects, but maybe that's not the most important thing on this movie. I think we have to watch this movie not expecting something like Twilight or Harry Potter, with fantasy. Yes, there's one romantic scene that can dissatisfy some people, but the story line is not focused on that. So just watch this movie thinking about all the criticism it proposes about our world.<br/><br/>Ps.: I'm Brazilian, sorry for the bad English"

","Each of the last few decades have had a really popular book turned into an amazing movie. With Jaws, Die Hard, Jurassic Park, and Lord of the Rings. The currently decade already has one that lives up to the standards set by the previously mentioned films. Jennifer Lawrence is riding high into ""The Hunger Games"" after being nominated for a best actress performance in ""Winter's Bone"" and as Mystque in the Stan Lee comic book based ""X-Men: First Class"". Lawrence gives a very memorable performance and continues to show her talent. Josh Hutchersen may not exactly be my choice for Petta, but he does a nice job. Woody Harralson gives a great performance and Lenny Kravitz turned out not to be a bad choice. For the first half the movie really only develops the characters and saves focusing in on the action scenes for the second half when the games start. While a lot of the deaths are off screen, they are very clear none the less thanks to Gary Ross' directing and a terrificly written script. The characters are very likable and realistic. The whole story is realistic with young men and women going war. And in the world of Panam, that's exactly what The Hunger Games are. All out war. The action is also well crafted. For example, I was rather drawn into the movie when Katniss raised three fingers in respect to Rue right before District 11 is destroyed in a riot. The Hunger Games is a one movie that will get people talking for Acadamy Award nominations and made me anxious to see Catching Fire and Mokingjay on the silver screen."

Instead of an action/horror film, it was more like Harry Potter and perhaps the original Willy Wonka with a bit of light violence thrown in. <br/><br/>The story is good and the first half, which is free from violence is full of ""wonder"" and spectacle. The second half is darker but it never becomes so dark that it's a problem.<br/><br/>My kids, aged 8 & 11 loved it. <br/><br/>I'm stunned by all of the negative reviews on the site but I guess that going in with no expectations makes a world of difference."

","Since having read the book this film was a must to watch for me. The book was fantastic, great pacing and character development started in the book.

Some more depth of explanation could have been used throughout and introducing us to characters which will play a key role in the next two films.<br/><br/>Despite this the special effects are very good from the District to the capitol where the games begin to take shape. My only criticism for the film in the bad camera work and shots in various scenes. There is a beautiful scene towards the finale of the film where two characters share a moment and the camera is shaking all over the screen and, for me it lost its full impact on the audience. <br/><br/>Would I buy this film when it is released? Yes! Would I recommend this film as a family film?

"SnakesOnAnAfricanPlain","6","2","6","5 August 2012"," The Hunger Games (2012)
","The Hunger Games will always fail in comparison to one of my favourite films of all time that shall remain nameless. The book was embarrassingly bad. Poor writing, with no idea about characterisation, conflict, or pacing. Luckily Gary Ross is a much better filmmaker than Suzanne Collins is a writer. He manages to capture those silent moments of thought which allow the audience to breathe and contemplate what is happening. Unlike Collins' non-stop 1st person narrative from Katniss, which included every one of her mundane thoughts. She's a character that doesn't speak much, and this is better represented in this film. Lawrence gives a great performance and knows when a look is more than a speech. In fact, the whole cast do well. Like the book, the first half is more interesting, as we see the build-up to the games. The ceremony and pomposity is what hides this cruel sense of torture. It's in the second half where the film (like the book) begins to lose its pace. Ross does the best he can with having to deliver a PG-13 film. There was actually more violence than expected. However, the amount of violence wouldn't have changed a thing as we simply don't know nor care about the characters killed. They are nothing but fodder for the action scenes. It's strange to feel so empty at watching kids die. There's never a question about how this film is going to end because it is too cowardly. The amount of incidental deaths caused by accident are so high it relieves these kids of making any choices. It's still a fun watch for the most part, and simply by being better than the book it deserves a lot of respect."

The beginning was a little slow, the middle exiliration and the end took you to suspense. Hunger Games breaks the boundarys of crazy films and this is a true masterpiece. A little bit disappointed that they didn't have some of the books good moments but at least the dialouge from the book was finally out. Ending was much better in the film."

And I said the same thing I said then: I'd see that in a second. The film's best aspects are the performances. Jennifer Lawrence delivers a nomination-worthy performance, Woody Harrelson does the same, and everyone else was great as well. As for the rest of the series, let's hope that without even the great Gary Ross directing, they can be as good as this one was, and yes, I think the credit should go to him, a great director."

It's great acting, good story line (credit to Suzanne Collins for that one though), and overall fun to watch. <br/><br/>I have watched hundreds of movies in my lifetime and I have only cried for about 3 of them. But in the scene where Rue dies, it was made 4. I wasn't just tearing up a little bit, I was literally sobbing. <br/><br/>The only reason I gave this only a 9 out of 10 is because at points it dragged on a little bit.

"sergio2481","9","2","6","1 June 2012"," Why this film was successful, my personal opinion.
","I think the success of the book and consequently the success of the film are due to the author combined in a creative and convincing a subject so current and as present as it is the reality show, with a time of human history, more precisely the time of the Roman Empire, and I'm not saying you have to know history to enjoy the movie, but the film is convincing precisely because they are inspired by events that really happened, and knowing that human beings tend to repeat past mistakes. The film is excellent, still recommend to those who did not read the book in which it is based, do so because it complements, not only adding situations that do not appear in the film but also helps to understand how the character feels or thinks at certain times. The choice of actors is sublime, the best I remember at this time. In my opinion, the character of Katniss, Peeta, Haymitch, Caesar, Snow, Seneca Crane, Effie, Prim, Cinna, Rue, well, basically all but minor roles are well represented, although some may are not great actors. I have read some reviews that do not agree to the following, but in my opinion, the setting of the film is remarkable. If aspects are taken separately, may have weak spots, but the combination of all them transmit more than efficiently what the book expressed in words."
"Ryan_MYeah","9","2","6","30 May 2012"," Everything die hard Hunger Games fans, and even non-fans, could hope for.
","When it officially went into wide release over two months ago, The Hunger Games, based on the first book of Suzanne Collin's acclaimed trilogy of books, was the most eagerly anticipated literary film adaptation since Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone. Before you ask: Yes, I AM a fan of the books, and I can say that the Hunger Games movie, directed by the great Gary Ross, is one seriously good movie.<br/><br/>In the country of Panem, the 74th Hunger Games - a yearly event where one girl and boy between the ages of 12 and 18 from each of twelve districts compete to the death in an arena - is taking place. Katniss Everdeen of District 12 volunteers to compete in place of her younger sister, traveling to the Capitol of Panem with fellow District 12 tribute Peeta Mellark, a boy with ties to Katniss's past. As the tournament looms closer, Katniss and Peeta begin training and preparing for what will come in the arena, fighting against kids from other districts who've trained for this their whole lives.<br/><br/>As a director, Gary Ross' visual style is impressive. He's an expert at structure and staging, pacing the movie perfectly, and making it look and sound fantastic, especially Tom Stern's involving cinematography. But beneath the flashy aesthetics is also a film of genuine depth. If you're watching for full on action, look elsewhere. Any action scenes are lucky if they're longer than two minutes, but what I appreciate is that action is entirely not the point. The movie is more interested in building intensity and emotion to match the huge scope. Surprising depth also lies within the ideas the story presents. Themes of corruption in politics and government, social inequality, as well as society's disturbing thirst for exploitative reality television is explored very often. If I have any major complaints, I guess I'd say that the ending definitely rushes things.<br/><br/>As far as talent goes, look no further than that of the lovely Jennifer Lawrence, who fits the role of Katniss like a glove. Katniss can be thought of as an enhancement of Lawrence's fantastic Oscar nominated performance in Winter's Bone. Her emotional range and confidence adds so much to this character. Tough, fearless, and highly likable, Katniss is one of the greatest movie heroines in years. A fine young group of actors that play tributes from other districts are exceptional, and there's also a stellar cast of supporting adults that includes Woody Harrelson, Lenny Kravitz, and a virtually unrecognizable Elizabeth Banks. Scene stealer notice must go to Stanley Tucci. With razor sharp comedic timing, charismatic enthusiasm, and unexpected warmth, his Caesar Flickerman rocks the movie.<br/><br/>What can be expected of the inevitable Catching Fire? Well, My anticipation will be sky high. On a side note, a little fun fact: Second unit portions of the movie were directed by master of versatility Steven Soderbergh. So Hollywood, if you're reading this, please get Soderbergh on board to direct the sequel.<br/><br/>****1/2/ *****"

","Hunger games is a great movie, but i would strongly suggest not reading the book a week before you see the movie, because there are many small parts that were left out that i believe are integral to the plot of the story. this shocked me because i was told that nothing was left out at all. also there are many camera cuts and other things that i believe would not be friendly to people that have motion sickness. and camera cuts make some scenes confusing because you don't know whats happening. in whole the story itself is great, and once you start reading the books you can't stop. also there will be a different director for the second movie ""catching Fire"", hopefully they pick a better director."
"chase-guymon","8","2","6","20 May 2012"," Excellent book, fun movie. Lacks character development.
","I can be the first to admit that The Hunger Games novels were around the bottom of my list of things to read. I had in previous years read many other sci-fi/fantasy books that seemed to mimic the idea brought across in The Hunger Games general premise. The Hunger Games novels were suggested by my wife, a frequent sci-fi skeptic. And when the reading began it ignited an old flame for the love of science fiction that I thought I had lost.<br/><br/>Where Star Wars dwindled in quality and remakes are a dime-a-dozen, Hunger Games brings a subtle yet intriguing environment similar to that of Logan's Run or THX-1138. Where poverty runs rampant and imperialist dogma leaves breadcrumbs all over the gov't, Hunger Games takes what's good in your average sci-fi and keeps it fresh. Where many look at this as a blatant rip-off of Takami's ""Battle Royale,"" one must come to understand that Battle Royale itself was based, albeit loosely, on Ralph Ellison's ""Invisible Man"" where the first chapter is about killing for others' pleasure titled ""Battle Royale."" Good sci-fi always bases its premises on others works.<br/><br/>Hunger Games does just that. Its ideas are based on those who have come before it, but that gives no reason to pass it off as garbage. The games themselves are a thrilling place of dog-eat-dog intensity. the movie is a unique take on America's mainstream cinematography.<br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence does an excellent job as a girl who has no desire to be in this depressing world, but will try her hardest to make it better. Stanley Tucci does a wonderful job as a deluded and wealthy newscaster living the naive lifestyle in a power-hungry empire. But where these characters are well-studied by the actors themselves, it seems what the film lacks the most is still development in character on the large scale. Though she is honorably mentioned, I doubt Suzanne Collins had much sway in the writing of the screenplay, as there are many times in the film where the audience could gain a lot from learning more about the characters involved, but Gary Ross and Billy Ray leaned the opposite direction and decided intense action was much more important than character: in my opinion a huge flaw in most novel-based films. Why do we love books? We learn about character. The same frequently goes with films.<br/><br/>With that said the only other con of the film would be visual effects, at least on the CGI side of things. The ""girl on fire"" scene came and went and what could've been a potent and powerful expression of character for Kat and Peeta became a ""Oh, yeah, did we mention this is supposed to be cool?"" moment.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie brought a ray of hope for the sci-fi industry. With films like JOHN CARTER of Mars falling short and AVATAR being considered the cat's pajamas, Hunger Games flips the coin of chance and brings the old sci-fi style back into perspective. Something that I, for one, am very grateful."

Although the book had more details, and made more sense I still recommend this movie for Hunger Games fans. This movie is really appropriate compared to if every single detail of the book was put in the movie. If you don't know what the movie is about, then don't fret! This movie actually explains everything in the first 10 minutes. <br/><br/>This movie has everything from romance, (which is for the show), action (basically 7/10 of the movie was all action) , and intensity. (which is the same as action) The actor for Katniss (the main character) was actually mystique from X men first class, I kept on thinking about the girl on fire looking blue! Although there is going to be sequels (Of course!) IMDb announced that there will be a 4th movie even though there are only 3 books.... Just asking.<br/><br/>The Hunger Games is nothing compared to how some other movies look that are coming out this year, (Prometheus, the Dark Knight Rises, The Bourne Legacy, The Amazing Spider Man) but I still recommend The hunger games!

","How old am I? Old enough to remember that one of the first of the 'survival' movies was The Naked Prey - Cornel Wilde - 1966. In the movie, the great White Hunter, becomes the hunted and the action is on! Actually, one could go back as far a King Solomon's Mines if you wanted. However, I liked the movie and because it had been done before, didn't mean the movie wasn't good and unpredictable. The differences here were that the 'hero' is a woman and proves very resourceful. The 'deus ex-ma china' are the unseen 'sponsors' who keep leaving needed 'supplies' for the girl. The questions left in my mind are when will the populace rise up against this slaughter? Also, I feel a sequel coming in that the head guy, Sutherland, doesn't seem finished with her nor is she finished with him. I wouldn't mind seeing a follow-up."
"JCfinstone","8","2","6","9 May 2012"," A well done adaptation
","Having read the trilogy before seeing the film, I was really excited to see if the film (directed by Gary Ross) would reflect the excellence of the first book. I was pleased to find that while not by any means perfect, the film did a more than decent job of depicting the Hunger Games universe.<br/><br/>The film is set in a dystopian future in which young people are made to fight to the death for the pleasure of the government in the titular reality TV show. It follows the struggle of Katniss Everdeen to survive alongside her male counterpart, Peeta, after she takes the place of her younger sister, Prim, in said competition.<br/><br/>There were a lot of things that I liked about the film. First and foremost would have to be Jennifer Lawrence's portrayal of Katniss. Lawrence proved once again that she isn't just a pretty face with her strikingly authentic performance which conveys determination, fearlessness, and yet also vulnerability. Other elements which stand out include Stanley Tucci's crowd-pleasing TV show host, the clever 'news broadcast' mechanic that Ross uses to adapt the first-person written story into a movie format, and the look and feel of the Hunger Games arena and the beautiful scenes within the high tech Capitol. <br/><br/>However, my main gripe with the film was Ross's over-use of the shaky hand-held camera effect which disrupted at times my immersion into the narrative. I was also a little disappointed by the fact that some scenes in the games themselves were neutered to cater for the 12A target demographic, but despite this I still got a sense of their brutality and its implications. <br/><br/>I would thoroughly recommend that both fans and non-fans of the literary trilogy check out The Hunger Games at the cinema for an exciting and also thought-provoking experience."

","First of haters are going to hate. I was reading through the reviews and couldn't help but feel slightly angry especially since majority of the haters hadn't even read the books, so who are they to judge possibly the biggest young adult movie of our generation. So I was writing this to give the general public a reliable source.<br/><br/>The movie was definitely not as good as the book, but then again a movie never is. Considering the book and a lot of the hype the movie had to stand up to it did excellent. An annoying thing was that it was rated PG. I can understand and all but Hunger Games did/still has a lot of older fans (18+) I myself am only 15, but an M rating would have given the movie a little more justice with a little more violence. Though considering this was a PG movie I was actually fairly pleased with the violence.<br/><br/>Another great thing was that they fitted in almost all of the storyline and all the major one. There were a few things I did miss was a lot of the emotional impact. I found the movie to be silent a little. I found that there wasn't as much dialogue as you would expect in them movie. Majority of the book is the main character, Katniss thinking and ellaborating things which made the book in my mind a lot more realistic. And because this was majority of the book when it was cut it made it seem... weird? One thing that really, really annoyed me was that they had such a great soundtrack yet failed to use it correctly in the movie. A lot of the songs were perfect for the movie but they didn't put the music in. In fact the only music they had was instrumental pieces, which I think I can speak for the general public when I say that instrumental doesn't exactly interest us, especially young adults, the target audience. The only time when you hear music with words in the movie was when Lawrence sung ""Rue's Lullaby"" and in the end credits. THE END CREDITS? Why on earth would you put songs on the end credits? Let me guess to give it that emotional impact, because it is so emotional seeing a few hundred strangers names flying upwards with music.<br/><br/>Overall though I really did enjoy the movie and somehow it only got better when I saw it the third time in movies. Maybe my mind was more relaxed and exposed to the movie. Anyways I would highly recommend this movie to anyone and everyone."

","The Hunger Games centers around a dystopian society named Panem where a wealthy society possesses complete control over the rest of the country's districts. Every year, the Capitol hosts the Hunger Games, a tournament where a young man and woman from each district fight to the death until there is only one survivor. One young woman named Katniss Everdeen is forced to enter the Hunger Games to protect her little sister from entering. From there, the plot keeps thickening into an excellent cream sauce that makes up this film.<br/><br/>Writer-director Gary Ross does an excellent job adapting the key plot of the original book into film. He fully captures the drama and the thrills of the text and translates it into a visually masterful piece of film. From the desolate area of District 12 to the lavish Capitol city to the intimidating forest of the arena, Ross puts the viewer in a world of thrills and chills.<br/><br/>Academy Award Nominee Jennifer Lawrence once again proves her acting excellence by putting on a flawless performance as Katniss. She fully encompasses the honest emotion, strength and fear of the character that readers have come to know. In fact, every member of the cast from long-time acting veteran Donald Sutherland to newcomer Josh Hutcherson help bring the book to life in the best ways. The novel's message about class warfare stays completely intact and is even expanded by the varied narrative. It may not be the EXACT same thing as the book, as there are a lot of differences, but translating a book to a film takes a lot of creative liberties and I still thought that they did the best they could with this film. As of right now, I'm dying to see it again."

","For every successful film franchise based on books for young readers, like 'Harry Potter' and 'Twilight', there's one that sank without trace, E.G. 'His Dark Materials' and 'Stormbreaker'. The latest series hoping to make the transition from print to box office gold is 'The Hunger Games'. Grittier than 'Harry Potter' and less melodramatic than 'Twilight, this one could well make it. Jennifer Lawrence takes the lead as Katniss Everdeen, handling the role with amazing maturity. Woody Harrelson brings his immense talent to his character Haymitch Abernathy and is a welcome addition to the cast for older viewers. The plot has three distinct sections; before, during and after the games which is a lot to cover in a movie, giving a running time of 142 minutes. It's a credit to director Gary Ross that it doesn't outstay its welcome. Being aimed at the younger audience, violence is toned down as much as possible â€“ although you're never in any doubt about what's happening as the game's participants fight to the death. I did find the costumes of the ruling classes over the top and a bit childish with their garish colours. Whilst not quite meaty enough to satisfy adults, this film does succeed in being well pitched for its target audience."
"roxana-stegeran","8","2","6","27 April 2012"," Not as good as the book
","I saw the movie after reading all three books. I was hoping for a lot more... i don't know why but I felt like this movie lacked its substance. The book is SO MUCH BETTER. The movie is dull, sometimes boring, lacks many scenes that help the viewer understand why people do certain things and what's their meaning. You don't kinda understand what's the connection between characters... I feel like many of the important scenes from the book have been ignored, while others that don't mean so much for the whole story are emphasized. Many characters simply do not exist in the movie, while in the books they are important. I simply felt bored at some time, it just wasn't the thing I expected to be; I was with a friend that had no idea about the book and she had many scenes that didn't really understand. After I told her what's in the book she said ""now it all makes sense"" and "" now if you put it that way it's much more interesting"". Pretty sad, the book was great, the story was very catchy."

","Maybe it was just that my expectations were too high but I was disappointed. The story was not all that novel but since the main audience for the book was young adult, it probably was new to them. For the movie it may be the same. The authoritarian nature of Animal Farm and Fahrenheit 451 as well as others and the gaming best done in The Running Man. <br/><br/>I have not read the book but my daughter did and explained many things the movie glossed over or omitted. I believe reading the book before watching might have made some things better. The acting overall was nothing special and I hated that Elizabeth Banks was almost unrecognizable under all her make up. Lenny Kravitz was the exception and did great in his role. <br/><br/>The use of shaky cam and close ups during fight scenes was distracting and a trend I intensely dislike. The costumes and colors were evidence that apparently in the future leisure suits would have returned as all the rage. <br/><br/>I wish I had waited to watch this on DVD"

","If you have not read the book, you may like this movie. If you're planning to read the book, then watch the movie, DON'T! I did just right before I watched the movie and I was very disappointed. I think if I hadn't read the book, I might have enjoyed this movie more.<br/><br/>The story takes place in a post-apocalyptic future. The fictional nation of Panem holds the Hunger Games annually where individual teenagers, called tributes, are chosen to participate in a fight to the death and survive until one is the victor. Two tributes are chosen from each impoverished district and there are 12 districts in Panem. The Hunger Games are held as a historic reminder and punishment for the districts for a war held many years ago where the districts rebelled against the wealthy Capitol.<br/><br/>When Katniss's younger sister is chosen as tribute for their district, she volunteers to take her place. She is then taken to the Capitol where she is introduced to a different world then the one she knows in her impoverished district. The Capitol offers her fine dining, luxurious living quarters, and other wealthy amenities. They also have her train and give her assessment in order to prepare for the Games. The Hunger Games is also very media driven like a sporting event. Everyone watches it being broadcast and it even has commentary. Of course, Katniss tries to survive while attempting to stay true to herself. There is also a kind of love triangle story involving Katniss, her fellow tribute from her district, Peeta, and her best friend in her district, Gale.<br/><br/>The story, though we have already seen variations of it such as Running Man and Battle Royale, is still entertaining. I didn't have any problems with the acting. Jennifer Lawrence stood out in her performance as Katniss. I also enjoyed Lenny Kravitz as Cinna, Katniss's personal stylist, and Woody Harrelson as Haymitch, Katniss's mentor. The movie does seem rushed with incomplete character development and background story. You may not fully understand these aspects unless you read the book.<br/><br/>Now, if you read the book, you may feel CHEATED like me when you leave the theater. I'm not a big fan of the Hunger Games book, but I did enjoy it. I felt the violence was toned down. I didn't get the raw emotion that you get from the book. Also, there was so much psychological aspects in the book that the movie doesn't capture. During the games, some killing was shown, but where was the survival? Can the movie audience that didn't read the book understand Katniss is trying to sell the love story in order to receive assistance? They didn't really touch upon that factor in the movie. I know they couldn't cram the whole book into a 2.5 hour movie and could change certain aspects, but it lacked so much of the mentality of the book.<br/><br/>The movie was somewhat entertaining and a decent attempt. Those who have not read the book may enjoy it, but may not get the full value of The Hunger Games."
"bbyt-unv","10","5","23","22 March 2012"," Gary Ross is a genius
","Being a fan of the books you have to get past the fact that movie adaptations are always going to be verified. You can't go into the cinema and expect to enjoy your favourite book being brought to life while criticising every wrong or missed detail. I really loved the way the movie was filmed. It's hard to make a movie when the book is in her point of view but Gary Ross knew exactly what he was doing and the entire time you know exactly what Katniss is feeling. It's HER story and you don't know what she doesn't know, you don't feel what she doesn't feel. <br/><br/>I was worried that they would exaggerate Gale, Peeta and Katniss's relationship but they didn't! It had just enough romance to know that there was one going on but at the same time knew it was really just for the games. <br/><br/>it was a really warm film.Serious yet captivating. It felt so short though. Like everything was almost rushed just to get to the arena scenes. I felt like i wasn't prepared for it yet because it all seemed so fast. But that's good in a way too because that's probably what Katniss felt. <br/><br/>I think the ONLY think i wasn't happy about was Rue's death. I mean don't get me wrong the scene was sad but i feel like it wouldn't have left that much of an impact to people if they hadn't read the books. <br/><br/>Also don't worry about the gore and blood. It's just enough to traumatise you afterwards thinking about it but during the movie it's fine to watch."
"sundaefires","7","4","17","22 March 2012"," May the odds be ever in your favor.
","One of the year's most anticipated film The Hunger Games is a tight, suspenseful but woefully acted film that boasts on its right buildup and crazy suspense, it's a must see movie of the year.<br/><br/>I've read the Hunger Games a year before the movie and this is not because I heard the movie is in production, because I saw it on a bookstore. Being a sucker for YA novels, I got drawn on it. I read the plot and bought the book afterwards. The novel is a fast, electrifying read, cranked with terror, suspense and instilling fear. But I think everything's handled in a gentle way, not unlike similar novels: Battle Royale, Running Man and The Long Walk, which makes sense since it's targeted for teens that I am.<br/><br/>And now, I had the chance to watch the film, I'm exhilarated by it, excited to see how they pump up and make everything from my imagination to the silver screen. <br/><br/>The movie's main premise is wisely introduced by its first scenes, the gritty shot of District 12 shows how dilapidated life on Panem is, the greasy and brooding life on District 12 is just how I imagined it to be. The movie is pretty faithful to the books, though I'm amused by it, some points didn't really hit me, I don't know, I feel something is lacking. I thought that all novels can't be translated well to film, especially if it's faithful as this one.<br/><br/>Lawrence played Katniss exceptionally well, she embodied her, took the character and gave out all her best to show Katniss. Josh Hutcherson is stunning as well, the perfect Peeta I must say. But even with the strong supporting cast, the acting didn't really support the film. I felt it is bland as it can be, the supposed to be emotional death of Rue just passed like it's a certain boring scene with Cinna.<br/><br/>Also one of my main problems of the film is how bad The Capitol and setting in the Arena and the Districts blends. They don't blend at all. It really differs and it appeared like the Capitol is in space.<br/><br/>With a nice buildup, the Games is really worth seeing. The countdown and the Cornucopia bloodbath really had my blood pumping and my senses skyrocketing, the eerie silence used in the scene is really impressive.<br/><br/>And again, I think they missed the point of the book: survival. Here, it shows how easy Katniss found water and food. The death scenes are nice, less is more. They don't need to dwell on blood and gore, it's effective, they are all real.<br/><br/>The shaky cam work is good at times but I'm disappointed that they used for almost the action scenes. It's vomiting and makes you irked. I have to give my kudos to Isabelle Fuhrman for playing the scary Clove!<br/><br/>Overall, the Hunger Games is an amazing adaptation, Ross and his production team clearly seamed the whole movie very well. But right at this point, I'm still lukewarm, I think I need a second viewing. With that, I give the film a solid 7 and wishes the film that all the odds will be ever in their favor."

But anyway, the movie was enjoyable, I felt moved and enthralled, suspense even, but it is sadly nothing all that special really, just another teen fad movie that will probably be rotting on a blockbuster shelf in 10 years time. i hope i'm wrong as i think it's a bit better than that but face it, it's where a lot of these new movies are heading."

"maue-19674","9","1","2","19 April 2020"," Trauma - Rebellion - War - the Tragedy of Katniss Everdeen - a REAL Hero
","Sometime in the future PANEM - what is left of North America - has survived some dreadful catastrophe. It has organised itself into a dozen Districts that provide the resources to a central 'Capitol' run by the ruthless President Snow. We learn that the Districts rebelled against the Capitol in the past but failed - and must now pay the penalty. Every year, each District must provide 2 Tributes - one Male One Female between the ages of 12 - 18 to take part in 'The Hunger Games' - a televised event that allows just ONE victor to survive the ordeal. In District 12 - the Mining District - they have only had one winner during the previous 73 Games. Names will be selected by drawing lots and today - the 74th Games - will be the first time for Primrose Everdeen. Her Sister, Katniss, has already been through several 'Reapings' and reassures her that she will be OK. Katniss is a loner - she hunts/poaches on the fringe of her District and loves the woods and natural outdoor life. She is highly proficient with a Bow and uses it to bring much needed extra food to her Family. At a market she is given a little badge featuring a 'Mockingjay' bird - something that will in the future become indelibly linked to her. At the Reaping it is Primrose's name that is called out - the only way to save her is to 'volunteer' as Tribute - which Katniss selflessly does - and joins the other 'successful' candidate - Peeta Mellark to journey to the Capitol to be trained to fight in the Games. Both Katniss and Peeta realise their chances of survival are slim to none. Haymitch Abernathy, the only previous District 12 winner is now their 'Mentor' on how to play this 'game'. He tells Katniss she needs to learn how to make 'allies' of other tributes - something alien to her nature. But the other Districts also have Tributes that are better trained and more ruthless than the two District 12 trainees.
This is the basic set-up for the first Film in the Series and, having watched it again recently, it has shown itself to be an exceptionally well-made cinematic piece. This Film Series - based on the hugely successful novels by Suzanne Collins - is still the very best of the so-called 'Young Adult' spate of novels and Films that appeared in the 2010's. The 'Maze Runner' and the 'Divergent' Series all owe their basic DNA to this series. Why then is the 'Hunger Games' so effective?
Firstly, a lot of people have compared 'The Hunger Games' to Fukasaku's Japanese Film 'Battle Royale' - which is a mistake. The two Films are very much products of their respective cultures. The irony is that 'Battle Royale' (the central idea of which is of an entire School Class having to fight each other to the death) was made SO explicitly violent and bloody that the Film could not be seen by the very audience the Director wanted to tap into (15+)!! Also, as we will see, 'The Hunger Games' really isn't about the 'Games' at all - it is about war - and the price some generations have to pay to fight oppression.
The Film makers of the 'Hunger Games' did NOT make that mistake. Collins made it clear that these novels were aimed at a 'Young Adult' (YA) audience and Director Gary Ross and the Producers ultimately made a Film that COULD be seen by these 12 to 15 year olds. This is an important point to make as the approach to this Film is actually very subtle - the violence is never glorified or unnecessary. They could have gone and made a VERY different Film but decided on realistic and sympathetic ideal that allowed ALL ages to see the film through the eyes of the main Protagonist - Katniss Everdeen. The vast majority of the film is seen through Katniss' point of view - she is a simple, cold, taciturn, stubborn and loyal individual, who simply wants to ensure the survival of her Sister and Family. The Capitol - and all of it's 'pleasures' make absolutely no impression on her at all. As she matures through the entire tale, Katniss's niave view of the world starts to disintegrate - she is a pawn, being used and played by many other people - it is her humanity and courage that others wish to exploit.
The design of the Film is exceptionally well done as it contrasts the poverty of the Districts with the super wealth (and indifference) of the citizens of the Capitol. The opening shots of District 12 - people shuffling mindlessly along - destitute and starving - remind one of scenes from the Great Depression and 'The Grapes of Wrath' - no doubt the intention of Director Gary Ross. This is contrasted with the overblown Fashion of the Capitol, where every accessory, whether it is clothing, hair or make up, is taken to the extreme.
The Main Characters and their Cast too are well done - and all will have their own journeys to make. Jennifer Lawrence plays Katniss to the hilt and cemented her reputation as a leading Actress. The sheer confusion she exhibits - a stranger in a strange land - is very well executed. Her Character will be dealt blow after blow, exploited and betrayed. In a very real sense she IS this story - she states truthfully ""I never wanted any of this"" - but events will overtake her.
Josh Hutcherson's Peeta Mellark is the underdog - and very much 2nd fiddle to Katniss - a difficult role to play but his humanity and gentle soul are things that Katniss can identify with. Liam Hemsworth's Gale Hawthorne is Katniss's boyfriend - left behind in 12 when she leaves for the Capitol. They have grown up together but events will twist this relationship.
Effie Trinket is the epitome of the Capitol's ideals in Fashion and outlook. Dressed as if she has to be a performance all day long, Elizabeth Banks nails her character so that at once we are appalled by her insensitivities but also recognise that she does have a moral compass - something that will be tested by the events to come.
The pivotal role of Mentor Haymitch Abernathy - Woody Harrelson - is another who will run the gauntlet of change. Cynical, alcoholic and acerbic, he is the ONLY other District 12 winner and has spent decades mentoring and waving young people off to their deaths. He can no longer see any chance of success - until he encounters Katniss. It is a love/hate relationship - she is as direct as him, so sparks will fly. But there is also respect.
The lurking, menacing presence of President Coriolanus Snow is superbly portrayed by veteran Donald Sutherland. This is a highly nuanced performance by Sutherland - his villain is deadly because he thinks, exploits and ruthlessly does what he has to maintain his power - and the status quo. His quiet monologues are dripping with threat.
'The Hunger Games' introduces us to this world and revels in the excitement and thrill of watching the 'Games' - it lulls the audience into looking at the Hunger Games exactly as the people in the capitol do - as an audience thrill spectacle - getting swept up in the hype, glamour, Fashion, and the excitement of betting and watching young people die. This is then balanced by the view of Katniss - watching young people die at first hand and feeling the fear of imminent death. Katniss is not a 'superhero' - she is frequently confused, traumatised and bested in combat. She is flawed, stubborn and courageous. Her friendship with one of the youngest Tributes - Rue - shows that she has heart and it is the brutal end of this friendship that will spark the events outside the Games arena. Rue is hit be a spear thrown by another player - Katniss almost in reflex shoots him down with an arrow - but then realises that Rue is dying. Instead of merely thinking about her own safety, Katniss now holds Rue gently until she dies - a heart-rending scene as Katniss cries her heart out - something being witnessed by Rue's Home District on big Monitors. Katniss delicately builds Rue a bed of flowers and then turns to one of the many hidden cameras and raises her hand in the 'upturned three finger' salute of defiance. District 11 explodes into violence. Katniss is unaware of what her simple actions have triggered, but it is the catalyst that will drive the increasing tensions across Panem.
Katniss shows herself a REAL Hero, not one with superpowers, armour or other such affectations - she is fighting for her Family, trying to do the decent thing and just to survive. Even at the end where only Peeta and her remain, she would rather eat poisoned berries with Peeta - with both dying - than kill Peeta just to 'win'. Here is indeed something 'heroic' and the thing that made Katniss a role for so many young people from both the books and Films. The Capitol's 'Gamemaker' now has to make a decision - let them both die (no winner at all) or let them both live to ensure a 'hopeful' conclusion. He chooses the latter - a fateful one for him as Snow sees this as a total failure of the system.
The series will continue and it is in the sequel 'Catching Fire' that we realise that this is NOT about the 'Games' at all - it is about what they represent and the longing of people to fight oppression.
'The Hunger Games' has its detractors - some say it 'tones down' the violence to make it appeal to a younger audience (and ensure they can actually see it!) - that is correct but it makes it a much better film for it. If doesn't glorify or linger on the deaths. What the Film DOES do is show a young girl battling odds in a dreadful world. It shows the pain, death, and rage of those who are forced to live by this code. For it is the young people who always have to face up to this. In the subsequent Films Katniss will see her world explode in violence, Rebellion and War. Sacrifices will have to be made, people die, populations decimated and Katniss will be damaged like everyone else. As Alma Coin will say much later ""There is no victory without sacrifice"" - indeed - and it is as well to show young people what that actually means."

So straight away they throw the rule of show don't tell out the window from the top floor. Its just so lazy. And its completely pointless anyway as it is explained again in short film that all the tributes watch. The pacing of this movie is also unbearable. Things just happen one after the other. Even the dialogue is lightening fast a lot of the time. Its hard to keep up with the conversations.

They had reason to kill each other anyways.<br/><br/>In some cases it is even surprising how often they spare her life or how she can nap without being attacked all the time. I just kept telling myself that characters are teenagers, they sometimes lack logic.<br/><br/>And based on the title I assumed they will be hungry. Fight for food as well. There was nothing of it. It seemed like it took them 2-3 days for all those games and all that time they were well fed.<br/><br/>The acting and characters are really good. Was great to see Wes Bentley in his character. I am sad he won't be in the next one. It is not a big part but he was just awesome in it."

"jrjunior-25668","4","1","2","26 February 2017"," The Hunger Games
","Usually a movie has a lot of creativity, imagination, and a lot of problem solving. Well this is what you think movies like the ""Hunger Games"" would be like but it's not. From my experience from watching the ""Hunger Games"", I could tell you that it's not an over the top movie you would die to watch. It's more like a movie that's a waste of time watching. <br/><br/>In the movie ""Hunger Games,"" there's absolutely no creativity. Why? First, why would anyone be interested in watching a movie about young kids from the ages 12 to 17 being forced to kill each other, just for entertainment towards the public. There's no entertainment at all seeing young kids being forced to kill each other. Especially, the little ones that have no idea what they're doing, or why there doing this. In the movie you're going to see a 12 year old girl named Rue, which got picked randomly to compete in the 75th annual ""Hunger Games"". Unfortunately Rue did not survive, she eventually got stabbed by one of the competitor. The cruelty and sanity that occurs in this movie, no one should see it or watch it at all. <br/><br/>The director Gary Rose tries to hide the true fact of what is going on in the movie. He tries to make it look like it's a normal life these people go through everyday but it's not. <br/><br/>Throughout, the movie you're going to see terrible acting skills. Most of the characters have smiles on their faces when there trying to survive. If I were to be in this situation at all, I would never have a smile on my face, instead I would be really worried and frighten. Overall the acting could've been a lot better. <br/><br/>Also, I would never recommend this movie to other people because the conflict in the movie is never resolved. People are still being picked and forced to compete in the Hunger Games each year. And the director never bothers to let someone stand up and say something about it. Finally, the movie tries to pursue the audience, its fine killing people. When you kill someone other people will enjoy it and you feel entertain. This is not an example we want to set for our society at all. We want our society to realize violence isn't the answer. Overall the movie is terrible."

","Most of the criticisms I have for this film are targeted at the book just as much as they are towards the movie (as it's the same story.)<br/><br/>Very minor spoilers.<br/><br/>The idea of The Hunger Games is interesting without a doubt. A broken political system that pitches children from districts against each other to fight overpopulation is great potential for an intriguing story. However, instead of this concept being the main emphasis, the movie chooses to focus mainly on the dull love story between Katniss and Peeta. While watching, I felt a connection to Katniss to some extent (after all, I was rooting for her character to win,) however the forced romantic subplot's impact on the story completely ruined most of the movie's worth for me.<br/><br/>I don't recommend it (or any of its sequels.)"
"scorfield-51711","5","1","2","13 September 2016"," Deliverance from District 12
","""May the odds be ever in your favour.""<br/><br/>There are several strands that hold this movie together above the average pop culture adaptation. Most obvious of all these is the performance by Jennifer Lawrence in the lead role, especially given the level of expectation from the books' legions of devoted fans. Even she was reluctant to endanger her credibility by taking on such a high-profile role, and so this is a rare case where the payment of a highly lucrative salary to acquire the lead of choice was money well spent. It is an impressive feat that in embodying Katniss Everdeen, Lawrence manages to successfully portray a character who has to combine the steely determination of an Amazonian-style warrior together with a level of vulnerability commensurate with her tender years. The latter is best observed in the touching scene where her attempts to protect the child Rue prove fruitless. The synopsis of the story-line has Katniss break tradition in volunteering herself as female tribute from District 12 for the capitol's Games. This she does in order to protect her younger sister from selection, leaving Katniss having to fight to the death in a forested arena to be the last tribute standing. As such, the premise offered great potential for translation to the 'big screen'. This potential is realised in part by the contribution from Tom Stern whose glorious cinematography adds edge to an otherwise anodyne adaptation. In addition, other solid character performances from the likes of Stanley Tucci, Woody Harrelson, and Donald Sutherland add their weight to this feature. Tucci never fails to deliver and offers a memorable oily performance as the unctuous TV host of the Games, Caesar Flickerman. The casting of Harrelson was especially inspirational as he brings a vital spark to the character of Katniss' appointed mentor and former champion of the Hunger Games, Haymitch Abernathy. Even though I had not read the books prior to seeing the movie, it quickly becomes apparent that with an actor so capable of bringing real 'edge' to his portrayals as Harrelson, an opportunity was lost to provide far greater foreboding to the overall feel of the film. Another missed opportunity lies with the insufficient screen-time or characterisation given to Sutherland's portrayal of the malevolent President Snow. Perhaps, the most surprising successful addition to the cast is that of Lenny Kravitz as fashion designer Cinna. By contrast, the casting of Josh Hutcherson was wholly unconvincing as the male tribute for District 12, Peeta, whose persuasive charm gradually wins over our resolute heroine. Overall, from the selection of the tribunes destined to fight to the death for each district, through to the killings themselves once the games start, it is clear that the film has been shackled by an attempt to appeal to a younger audience. A further weakness is the lack of depth to the film, with the brevity of background given to the origin of the games, and the political undercurrents existing in this fictional land of Panem, failing to induce greater emotional involvement for the audience. The director, Gary Ross, more renowned for social satire and comedy, makes a surprise choice to bring this young-adult literature sensation to the big screen. Though he does accomplish an entertaining end- product, the film does lack a level of grit which the dystopian vision behind the novels called for. This is despite the presence of Suzanne Collins as part of the screen writing team. The inspiration for her novels were accordingly the result of channel-surfing between reality shows and graphic news images from the war in Iraq. Unfortunately, the darker connection between media-inspired violence and the need to attain popular acclaim to survive is not captured in the cinematic version, and, as such, the obvious comparisons with the cult classic 'Battle Royale', which many still feel to be an uncited inspiration behind the original book, will always leave this film wanting. Not even the 'Golden Globe' nominated Best Original Song, written and performed by Taylor Swift, supported by the superb 'The Civil Wars', actually features in the movie, only being the second song to accompany the end credits. Ultimately, however, it is the lack of chemistry at the heart of the story's 'love triangle' that is the film's weakest link."
"unbrokenmetal","Null","1","2","5 January 2016"," Arrival in Dystopia
","""The Hunger Games"" is a cross between Dystopian movies such as ""1984"" & ""Fahrenheit 451"" and modern gladiator movies like ""Rollerball"" & ""Running Man"". Nothing particularly original, but a good quality addition to the genre. I'm not familiar with the novels or sequels and just review the movie as it is - for it must be able to stand on its own feet, anyway.<br/><br/>What I liked best is Donald Sutherland's performance as President Snow. He never actually does anything evil like a Bond villain would do, you know: press the trigger to drop guys into a pool with sharks and that silly stuff. But when he just explains his philosophy, for example how to keep a small spark of hope contained, or when he reminds Seneca Crane to ""be careful"", that's more scary than any of that, because it's so disturbing to imagine what he might be up to. And creating this feeling of ""nobody will be safe"" is just what the Panem society, based on a lottery, is all about. (possible SPOILER #1) When Snow leaves silently in the end, that makes you worry more about what will happen in the second part than any direct threats.<br/><br/>The characterization of Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) is not really smooth. She begins stubborn when she opposes their mentor for the games, totally submits to the show business when she enters the arena with her dress on fire, then she is a bit provocative again with the shot at the apple, then she plays nicely along the rules again for some time, then she gets really mean to win the games, (possible SPOILER #2) finally switches back to 'smile and switch your brain off' mode. People who read the books argue that a lot of inner monologue was lost in the movie and thus her motivation is not clear enough, this explanation sounds likely to me. Still that is not satisfactory for an audience newly introduced by this movie to the Panem world.<br/><br/>What convinced me least was the actual game. Teenagers are picked at random, even 12 year old girls are expected to take part though they usually never handled a bigger weapon than a kitchen knife in their whole lives, and during 4 days of training, the majority of the participants seem to become experts in one or several kinds of martial arts, hitting any target with various weapons? I don't buy that. In all likelihood, there should be many more clumsy beginners who'd miss a table with an arrow from 10 yards distance. Of course, apart from a few skilled voluntary candidates, there is another reason for that surprising skill. The more dangerous the opponents from the other districts are, the more the audience fears for our heroine. We are expected to look forward to her killing them all, and this is where it gets cynical. In the above mentioned ""Rollerball"" or ""Running Man"", experienced professionals got ready for battle who knew the risks. ""The Hunger Games"" is suggesting you can turn average teenage boys or girls into killers without problems (with 2-3 exceptions who become easy victims), and that is a lack of good taste, pardon the pun. Easily, the couple from district 12 is beginning to enjoy the show with their spectacular entry, that costume on fire, submitting to the system, hardly opposing it. The shot at the apple was a childish gesture in that respect. Somewhere in between, the audience begins to wonder if the evil system is not so bad after all. The poverty of the people outside in the districts suddenly seems less important than the glamor of the show. Almost apologetically, Katniss gets an opportunity to cry, after an innocent nice girl was killed; an attempt to make her more sympathetic when it is almost too late. This review may sound a little too negative because I wanted to explain why I enjoyed it mostly, but not completely. I voted 7 of 10."

"dfa120374","5","1","2","15 June 2015"," Massively Overrated
","I had absolutely no interest in seeing this movie when it came out back in 2012. I saw trailers for it and couldn't see what all the hype was about, so I never gave it a 2nd thought. After now watching it (I saw it on TV purely because there was nothing else on) I STILL can't see what the hype is all about because for me The Hunger Games is a somewhat mediocre - and vastly overrated - Sci-Fi/Action movie that left me feeling unfulfilled and kind of bored.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong...it's a watchable film, but it's definitely not anywhere near the hype it's been given, nor as good. Teens may enjoy it, but in all honesty, anyone over the age of 16 will probably think it's a very average movie.<br/><br/>Now, I've not read the books (and have no intention to either) so I don't know how accurate the films are in comparison to the novels, but this is basically a cross between The Running Man and Battle Royale with the look of Tim Burton's version of Alice in Wonderland thrown in that is aimed for the mid-teen crowd. In fact I can just picture a bunch of teen girls ""ooohhh-ing"", ""aahhhhh-ing"", and giggling every time Liam Hemsworth comes on screen, or teen boys wiping drool off their chins as they gawp at Jennifer Lawrence. Makes me glad I don't have kids myself so I'm not forced to watch movies like this.<br/><br/>It's usually these reasons why I avoid these types of films...it's all about looks rather than acting ability or story. That and they are generally guff.<br/><br/>Anyway, if you're looking for something that is exciting, thrilling, keeps you entertained with an enjoyable story then you'd best avoid this. On the other hand, if you're wanting to watch something because there's nothing else on, or just want to while away a couple of hours then you can do worse than The Hunger Games."

"ParanoidAndroid97","5","1","2","14 April 2013"," A disappointing adaptation of a popular teenage book. And the new Twilight, unfortunately...
","Fasten your seat belts- just as you thought Twilight was coming to an end, here's another soppy teenage love story to replace it. Granted, this one is surrounded with kids murdering each other left right and centre, a crippled civilisation run by a scheming dictator, and more interesting characters (except Peeta) than we saw in the Twilight franchise, but even so it feels like the producers wanted this to appeal to the same audience that enjoyed Stephanie Meyer's novels. The thing here is that while the Twilight books were mostly directed at girls and put more emphasis on Bella and Edward's relationship than the whole vampire- werewolf thing, the Hunger Games books actually attracted a lot of young male fans who were interested in the violence and survival elements of it. So what would have been a sensible thing to do would be to share it out- have some romance for the ladies and some gore and scary moments for the testosterone-filled men, but the balance between the two in this movie is heavily geared towards the former- a five minute long conversation/make out session between Katniss and Peeta being the prominent example. There is violence, of course, but most of it is either shown off-screen (Thresh's death, among others), shot from a long distance or shot with a shaky camera (this annoyed me throughout the whole film but is most noticeable in the bloodbath at the beginning of the Games), supposedly to keep this at a 12A certificate. In fact, apart from a splatter across Cato's face at the Cornucopia showdown, there is no blood at all in this (the only genuinely creepy moments being Glimmer being stung to death by wasps and Thresh slamming Clove repeatedly against the Cornucopia (in the book he hits her with a rock, which is probably worse). I was really hoping to see the fight between Cato and Thresh, but rather than shooting this they have Thresh be killed unceremoniously off-screen by mutant dogs. I can't really complain about this because although this fight happens in the book, it isn't described in detail, but even so wouldn't this be an opportunity for the production team to take an off-stage fight in the book and use their creativity to bring it to life for the movie? The whole thing just seems lazy and although I tend to like films to stay accurate to books, I felt this one was almost word-for-word, and as such much of it was very predictable. Anyway, enough of the content and on to the acting. Jennifer Lawrence does well as Katniss, a character robbed of much of her personality by the fact that the film differs from the first- person narration seen in the book. Josh Hutcherson (who has impressed me in the past) had the misfortune of being cast as Peeta, one of the dullest characters in literary history, and as such there is little he can do with the script, largely based on the book, to make his character more interesting. His only scene in which he has a chance to give his character some life, the scene with Katniss where he talks about not becoming the government's pawn, feels pretty soulless. The supporting cast I thought were much better- Stanley Tucci is superb as the larger-than- life talk show host Caesar Flickerman, Woody Harrelson is suitably gruff as Haymitch, and Elizabeth Banks is hilarious as the eccentric Effie Trinket. Some of the other tributes are also quite good- Isabelle Fuhrman is scary as Clove, Alexander Ludwig is good as Cato and delivers his speech at the end, revealing the way he has been raised from birth to compete in the Games and bring pride to his district, with ample emotion. Amandla Stenberg is an innocent Rue, but due to the fact that she barely appears on-screen up to her death means that the scenes of Katniss' grieving and the rebellion in District 11 don't make you feel as sad as the emphasis the makers placed on these scenes suggest they wanted you to feel. So although this film is for the most part entertaining and true to the book, I thought they could have done so much more, and the five stars I did not give are the potential this did not live up to."
"alexvalentin92","6","1","2","15 January 2013"," So much Potential, so many possibilities, shrank down to an average film.
","First of all, i never read the books, I wanted to let you know that before I continue.<br/><br/>The beginning was very good, it set up the situation of the characters and the status of society. Their struggles and their thoughts, it was all very well built. The big city was interesting and full of themes of Artificiality, commercialism, control, fascism etc. it was all very compelling.<br/><br/>But the more time passes the more the movie starts falling apart. You start to feel like this preparation is taking a little too long, And when we reach the Games themselves, it is, underwhelming. It comes a point where even the games themselves seem to drag. And by the time the movie ends, all those emotional queues and situations where, somewhat thrilling cause the characters are very likable, but it's not as strong as the movie intended it to be. Almost everything about this movie's theme or message is just not as strong as it would've been.<br/><br/>As i see this movie i see all the possibilities of strong emotional moments, and a deep message about society and it's current state, morality and the human condition. But the movie completely underplays all of these things. They exist, but they don't use them, they don't take advantage of this and use it to the betterment of the film as a whole. It feels like they took away many character and situations, moments that would've given much needed layers to the film. And i feel it was because they were afraid to challenge it's viewers, afraid to make the audience question themselves or the characters in the movie. <br/><br/>here are the main reasons i believe they ruined this movie.<br/><br/>1. How come nobody says their opinion on this society? there is obviously some disdain towards them but, why not say some criticism or something to give the viewer a thought, an idea on why it's bad. We can think it's bad, but i'm sure they can have something relatively compelling to say about it, even if it's only 1 or 10 words, anything to give the audience something more to think about.<br/><br/>2. Who are these competitors? what are their fears or their aspirations? Why is it so easy for them to kill each other? why are they working together? this movie never takes time to give the other competitors any humanity. I am sure they have families and a loved one or hell, maybe not, but why not show that to us?<br/><br/>I know showing them die might be too R rated, but at least give them some humanity, make these peoples death truly matter. By not giving them a personality, they just become normal villains to the protagonist, making us be happy they killed another human being forced into this just like they have. Don't you think that would give some much needed dramatic strength to the film? <br/><br/>3. WHO IS RUE (Amandla Stemblerg)!!!! there is a very important scene that comes from the death of this girl (not a spoiler cause you know only one survives), and it's very dramatically intense and does something very important for the rest of the film, and hell for the series itself. Yet WHY is she so important? The movie didn't give any time us to know this girl. Why did it create that issue on her home district? these games have been going on for 73 or so years, what makes THIS specific moment important!? This also applies to the lack of development for the competitors i mentioned before, but this is it's own special category because she was meant to be important and yet she was just a very nice girl...and that's it.<br/><br/>4. If you have nothing to show, move to the next person! This movie is concentrated on Katniss the whole time, but this is a big issue when the games start. because, i wouldn't have minded, if she DID anything. By the end of the film, it doesn't feel like she went through a big change in her life, she killed one or 2 people, but it was because of self defense, aside from that she just hides and runs and does some things, but because she doesn't have to go through big issues, why not concentrate on Peeta, or to anybody else competing?<br/><br/>Peeta had a more compelling time there because he had an alliance, he had to help hunt down these other people and he specifically said before it all started that he didn't want to be changed, he didn't want to kill anybody. There is a strong dilemma here and it was ignored to concentrate on Katniss getting hurt, why is this more important?<br/><br/>5. NO RISKS!! this movie ignores everything about the plot. it doesn't take advantage of the drama of the morality involved in murdering each other, it doesn't explore the emotions characters go through, the doubts, the stress. it doesn't pay attention to nobody, everything is taken so artificially, they took away everything that would've made this movie worth watching. <br/><br/>The only really good thing from this is that it made me want to read the book, because i feel like the book is gonna do a much better job at telling a story with a message and true drama better than this film ever will."

Within the first ten minutes Harrison Ford outwits traps, outruns boulders, dodges poisonousness arrows, deals with treacherous side kicks -- the man isn't afraid of anything!<br/><br/>Except snakes.<br/><br/>He hates snakes. He meets one, only the one, not even a dangerous one... and he absolutely hates it!<br/><br/>So later on, what does the film do...? That's right, it dumps poor Harrison in room with a millions of 'em! Straight away, the audience are thinking: ""Blimey! If Harrison's afraid of one snake, how's he going to handle millions of venomous snakes?!"". <br/><br/>It's called ""setup"" and ""payoff"".<br/><br/>And this point, you're probably wondering what's this got to do with ""The Hunger Games""? Well, imagine the above scene as written by the makers of ""The Hunger Games"".<br/><br/>There'd by no scene early on, establishing Harrison's fear of snakes. What would happened is this...<br/><br/>-- Harrison Ford enters a room with snakes. <br/><br/>-- All of a sudden, the obnoxious commentator with the blue hair would cut in: ""Oh. By the way,Harrison Ford's afraid of snakes. On with the show."" <br/><br/>-- Harrison Ford fights snakes.<br/><br/>And that's the Hunger games problem in a nutshell. There's plenty of payoff but no setup. <br/><br/>Examples:<br/><br/>-- The scene where a contestant dies from accidentally eating poisonousness berries. We only find out 30 seconds beforehand that the berries even exists! Why not have a scene early on where a character is about to eat a berry but is stopped by a friend? Introduce the berries early, let it fester at the back of the audience's mind.<br/><br/>-- The poisonous wasp things. Again, you could introduce the wasps earlier, plant the seeds. So, when Jennifer Lawrence uses the wasps as a weapon, we don't need the TV presenters narrating to the us what the wasps are.<br/><br/>-- The scene where that big black dude (sorry, don't know the character's names) saves Jennifer Lawrence because he's avenging the death of the little black girl who Jennifer befriended. The scene means little because there was no setup scene a hour earlier showing the big dude and the little girl bonding. No scene showing the big dude forming a personal rivalry with the guy who wasted the little girl.<br/><br/>-- The unrest in Jennifer Lawrence's home district. All of a sudden, the civilians start rioting. There's no scene 30 minutes earlier showing ""the civilians being oppressed"", a scene 15 minutes earlier showing ""the civilians getting restless"", a scene 10 minutes earlier showing ""the civilians wondering: Hey, why are we watching this TV show? The state is oppressing us!""... again, very little build up.<br/><br/>There's a lot more examples like the ones above but you get my point (I hope!).

A good movie or book makes you feel the plight of the characters, and the book did better at that than the movie. As a film, it lines up some big names: Donald Sutherland, Woody Harrelson, Liam Hemsworth, all of whom could have brought a lot more life to their characters than they did.<br/><br/>The action scenes were decently done. Environments were rendered beautifully, but combat was mediocre and rather dulled down, probably to get that PG-13. None of it really ends up tugging at you too much.<br/><br/>All in all, as a movie, I've seen worse. It is mildly entertaining, but I wouldn't recommend it as any more than a rental. Neither fans nor non-fans of the book will find themselves popping this one in over and over again. It tries to hit every emotional point of the book, and just doesn't end up pressing your buttons hard enough to leave an impression."
"sgbeal","4","1","2","2 September 2012"," Excellent execution of a ludicrous and dissatisfying story
","During the introduction, as the premise of the story was presented, i thought, ""okay, i can suspend my disbelief for this."" Then we see little kids, age 13, being thrown into a combat arena against 18-year-olds (yeah, THAT's somehow going to end well for the young ones), and a society who turns its farmers-turned-killers into its greatest heroes (despite the psychological damage such ""heroes"" certainly accrue, as is eluded to via Woody Harrelson's character's constant drinking but never directly addressed). Nonetheless, the acting was good, the characters were well-cast, and the execution was commendable. As the story played out and the producers of the Games kept changing the rules, throwing out all sorts of ""unfair"" hurdles at the players (genetically engineered killer bat-faced dog/pig hybrids!?!?), who are supposed to be fighting _each other_ to the death, i kept thinking, ""okay, someone had a bit too much budget to play with and felt compelled to stretch this out."" As the end of the story drew near i kept thinking, ""i don't see the threads coming together yet... what's with the boyfriend back home?"" Then, after a particularly dissatisfying clip, practically out of nowhere, the credits started to roll. Aldous Huxley's ending was fine (if unpleasant) ONE time - we don't need a repeat. This time around is was dissatisfying on several levels, even more of a let-down than Brave New World's. Indeed, the ending is almost a 100% clone of Brave New World's, where the characters realize, ""we can't change a thing in this broken system,"" but instead of hanging themselves they simply grin and bear it, becoming the reluctant stars of the Hunger Games. i get the feeling that the author of the story is trying to tell us, ""accept it. It could be worse."" Thanks, but no thanks - for that story i simply need to browse any world-news website."
"jknow2012","5","1","2","30 August 2012"," The Hunger Games
","In order to keep my reviews up to the time, I decided to review something from this year(2012). My first choice ended up being ""The Hunger Games"". In ""The Hunger Games"" we are shown a vision of the dystopian future of a country in which the members of the ruling government and their elite affiliates are the only ones with any substantial financial wealth. Meanwhile, the rest of the country is broken down into 12 districts in which those populations live in sheer poverty. The ruling class then, have a yearly tradition of taking a young male & a young female(both under 18) from each district and making a game show which consists of the 24 contestants killing off each other or dying in one form or another until there is only one contestant left. This ""game""(reality show) takes place in a forest region with limited resources. There are quite a few things that make this movie a very disheartening experience. First of all, the premise of children between 13 & 18 years of age, being put into a wilderness environment to kill one another for the entertainment of a ruling government/class is NOT the kind of movie which should be marketed to children of that same age group. I wonder, what was on the mind of the Director and Producers of this movie. Are they trying to desensitize the younger generation into considering the killing of other members of their age group to be something which can be considered sane once it is government sanctioned? This movie closely resembles a familiar scene in which teenagers from all over America are trained after joining the military & then deploy to foreign countries to kill other people. This movie did not deserve a PG-13 rating. If this were to be released in the 80's or 90's, this would NOT have gotten a PG-13 rating, so why should it have such a rating now. Anyhow, visually things were good. There were quite a few special effects and futuristic pieces of equipment which placed the movie as being sometime in the near future. Overall, ""The Hunger Games"" has its fair share of action and emotions throughout the movie for people who are fans of those things, however, otherwise the premise of the script seems void of any true depth and compassion."
"c-nightingale","4","1","2","19 August 2012"," Disappointment
","Firstly giving it a 4 only because at times it was enjoyable, the book was really awesome loved everything about it but the movie just falls flat in every way. - there is no insight into the relationships at all, if you've never read the books you would have no idea who the hell Gale was and what the point of him even being in the film was, you just have no idea about anyones relationships, rue and katniss, katniss and peeta , making all these so called emotional scenes just fall flat. - somethings had no significance in the film, when Katniss has the flash back about her fathers death they barely mention him so if you haven't read the book would have no idea what that flash back was about - you didn't really get a sense of who the other tributes were. - In regards to the actually hunger games, i've never been so disappointed, it seemed to just fly by, one minute they were they the next they weren't , the whole Peeta and Katniss thing in the hunger games was not given nearly as much attention, which is really significant. - you don't get the sense of what the hell is going on and why they have to have the hunger games as much as you really should. <br/><br/>Based on this film it makes me feel that the book might not translate well to movies, Katniss is the books and her thought and feelings are no where in the film, i would honestly love a katniss narration in the film. <br/><br/>to sum up, if you've read the book prepare to be seriously annoyed and disappointed and if you've not read it you may enjoy it but also might be totally confused."
"Meven_Stoffat","6","1","2","4 June 2012"," Spoiler alert: Gary Ross made a very big and long trailer for a Hunger Games movie
","In all honesty, I appreciate the efforts of Gary Ross and co. He did what he could with what is really difficult source material, and in some form he managed to really pull it off. The film has great graphics and such, and right off the bat it already feels more intimate than your typical blockbuster thanks to some very low-key mood setting and hand-held camera.<br/><br/>But judging by the way the story is presented, this ultimately felt more like a fan movie than an official presentation. I mean yes there are flashes of brilliance throughout- one in particular being the Countdown scene. A moment of quiet brilliance. The embrace between Cinna and Katniss, the elevator to the arena, etc. Then the sudden blast into brutal violence. I will also admit found Haymitch to be hilarious too, great acting from Woody Harrelson. I knew when I read the book that he had to be played by Woody, and I got what I hoped.<br/><br/>One more positive comment: Jennifer Lawrence was amazing, she was not an Oscar nominee for nothing people. She really helped lift the movie off the ground. She IS Katniss and she managed to keep the movie running, though weak and sloppy it may be.<br/><br/>Now for the bad parts. Warning there's tons of spoilers.<br/><br/>First, if I had to narrow down what I loved about the book to one thing was its intensity. Sure the book wasn't particularly amazingly written but Susanne knew how to keep a rising line of tension throughout the book. She kept the action constant, the violence brutal and she saved the romance for when appropriate. The movie has almost zero suspense in the action scenes. I get that the filmmakers wanted to go for that ""silent action"" thing, and problem is for this movie it doesn't work. It worked for Haywire, it worked for Edge of Darkness, it worked for Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy but for a movie about a bunch of kids forced to kill each other.<br/><br/>The next big problem was there was not very much development. Sure Katniss is well developed but thats only because she is the protagonist. We don't get a sense that the kids in the other districts are connected, etc. Peeta's backstory is COMPLETELY CUT OUT. Primrose comes and goes. Effie Trinket gets a small amount of development in the sense that she as been around since the reaping began but that's it.<br/><br/>Oh, and the adaptation discontinuity. Cutting out various big parts (Madge Undersee, AVOX, etc) while emphasizing on smaller parts (Rue's death goes on for an atrociously long 10 minutes. They know each other for like 2 minutes then suddenly they are trying to get her out from the net, then she gets speared and Katniss cries for 10 minutes) and adding in parts that AREN'T IN THE BOOK (When Cato and the careers see smoke they leave a kid behind, and Foxface steals food without anyone knowing. So then Katniss tries stealing supplies and blows them up. And she doesn't go deaf or lose an ear.<br/><br/>I guess it's a good standalone movie and those who haven't read the book will like it. I'll admit it deserves credit there, but in the end it felt like a big long trailer for a better movie. I'd say skip it and read the book. Or wait for the 6 hour director's cut."
"jusquiame1","5","1","2","12 May 2012"," Almost threw up. I mean, physically
","The movie itself is not bad, the cast is good, however, the movie, as usually, is flat in comparison with the book. And, of course, Donald Sutherland looks out of place in this type of movie (PG13). Things that were complicated enough were not transferred into the movie at all, others were truncated to the couple of dashes, and mostly movie has focused on satirical representation of the capital and on action part. Peeta, for example, was just ""plain nice guy,"" while this character in the book is quite interesting. But it would be OK, since movies are in general considered ""entertainment"" that means they are for spending time with pleasure, not for thinking them over. However, pleasure was questionable because this movie hurts. I mean, physically. The worst thing was the work of cameramen and of the director of photography. I felt dizzy from the very first minutes of the movie. Mostly, it looked like the movie was shot by an amateur with a simple video camera bought in the nearest department store. If you try to shoot from hand, this hand must be strong, and nobody has dismissed the rule that the camera should not move randomly without stopping, as if it is hanging from someone's shoulder without switching off (even so called ""intellectual"" low cost movies are shot much better - even when directors want to make an impression of being shot by amateurs). If you hire cheap cameramen who don't know how to shoot, you should at least train them before letting them work on the movie. Montage could correct this a bit, but obviously nobody cared. I wonder how many people got seizures watching this movie? I went out of the theater with red eyes as after visiting swimming pool. Would not recommend for people with migraines, vertigo, seizures, or for those who are prone to motion sickness. I can read in the car, but this time I almost threw up in the cinema theater."
"don2002-368-729966","Null","1","2","12 May 2012"," Movie Vs Book
","I just finished the book then I went to see the movie. The first thing I noticed was how Katniss received the Mockingjay Pin. I think that the pin important. The train ride was longer and contains the start of the strategy for the games. The conversation between the prep teams while working on both of the tributes is key to the disconnect with the Capital and the Districts. Also the book had a deeper conversation with Rue. A richer back story. The time spent with Peeta in the cave was more involved than what was seen in the movie.<br/><br/>The movie did do a good job on the explaining the games and the President's concern with Katniss. The movie did a great job with the scenes of the Capital.<br/><br/>The movie was a disappointment. The first book was great and I'm half-way through the second. The almost two and a half didn't seem longer enough. They could have made it longer and spent time on character development.<br/><br/>The movie does not follow the book as closely as it could have. The final fight should have been by the book.<br/><br/>I agree with the others that the camera work should have better for this size ($) project.<br/><br/>If there is an sequel ""Pay attention"" follow the damn book!! This story is for an older audience than 12 year old years. Neither Peeta or Gale are heartthrobs nor did they present themselves in that manner."
"cthulu17","5","1","2","6 May 2012"," May leave you feeling a little hungry
","If I was to describe the hunger games in a single word, yes I know this is becoming a habit with me, it would be this: Stark. Having read the entire hunger games trilogy, I feel that this is appropriate, but does not necessarily make for the best movie. Let me clarify though: the very austere and even severe impression that I get from the movie isn't bad, it just isn't fun. Interesting, compelling, provocative yes, but fun, no.<br/><br/>A brief word to those that are fans of the series: the movie is fine. Structurally there isn't anything wrong with it and all the most critical details are left intact, as they had damn well better be if these people hope to make a trilogy out of this. Being a fan of the series myself and having read all the books, I notice the glaring differences where small or large details have been left out and while I'm not thrilled, it didn't prove to be a deal breaker either. On the whole, I would say that this film is a perfectly adequate adaptation of the novel, not good, not bad, but adequate. It is kinda neat to see some of the elements you read about visualized and I gotta say at least a handful of them are pretty satisfying.<br/><br/>On the positive side, I have to say that the casting is pretty good, with Lenny Kravitz being the biggest surprise and in my opinion, a fantastic choice for Cinna. The acting is good. The sets are at least mostly believable and the overall plot of the novel is left largely intact. This is quite an achievement when you consider positively Godawful adaptations of masterful works of literature like Michael Crichton's Timeline, which was thoroughly butchered into some schlock of cinema featuring Paul Walker.<br/><br/>On the negative side, people who did not read the books may likely find the film somewhat inaccessible, and need to either read the books or have friends fill them in as they go. While I fully understand the significant challenges of adapting a novel into something that gets squeezed into 2 hours and 20 minutes, this is something that has hurt the movie. Details from the book that helped to flesh out characters or events just aren't there and end up leaving the plot feeling thinner than it really is. Things that were included are over and done with so quickly you barely have time to register them or their significance. And lastly, the soundtrack, or to be more precise the distinct lack of a soundtrack. The entire film feels so muted and while that may be good for conveying the naked despair the general population feels, it really doesn't get the audience into the film.<br/><br/>I know it sounds like I've had a lot more bad than good to say about the film, but it really is a decent movie. If you're a fan, you're probably going to see it anyway and its not like anything is going to be spoiled for you in terms of plot twists. If you're not a fan, go ahead and check it out, you could certainly do a lot worse."

In fact, the whole cast was amazing and each character succeeded in playing the depth of their role. <br/><br/>Everything in the movie is well balanced. The romance story wasn't too much to ruin it and was just perfect. The violence was just right. And I personally loved the visual effects in the movie. The beginning set an excellent background for the movie, and the action part (the hunger games) was just of the right length. <br/><br/>The movie didn't drag on endlessly and left you only wanting for more.

","One might immediately assume that because the movie is about adolescents, it has action sequences and a well known cast then it is a big budget block buster movie that has good production value, but zero story. It is not so.<br/><br/>The Hunger Games is the first book in a trilogy (I know, they are either a trilogy or a saga nowadays) and the subject is nothing if not socially and politically deep. <br/><br/>You see, in a fictive country named Panem, there is a Capitol, something very reminiscent of Rome in a technological Roman empire and 12 districts that are ruled with an iron fist. Each year each district provides a boy and a girl, randomly chosen, as tribute in order to fight to the death for the pleasure of the people in the Capitol.<br/><br/>Now, the clichés that you would have expected at this point make their absence obvious. The main character is a girl, the games do not result in the destruction of evil and the win of good, nor does every character act like a piece of cardboard.<br/><br/>Without revealing more, I urge you to watch this. The main actors play well, the story is interesting, the effects are nice, but not extraneous to the plot, while the overall feeling is of observing great injustice and being almost powerless against it."

If you haven't read the book, but seen the movie, you would like it. If you read the book first, then seen the movie, then you would still like the movie. The Cornucopia was a really good design. It was easy to climb and to hide in. When Katniss got stung by the tracker jackers, it was so realistic how she reacted to it. Rue's death was really sad. It was emotional.

","First of all my expectations regarding this movie weren't that high but when a few days ago Eli Roth said that ""this shouldn't be a PG13 movie"" I thought that maybe this could be one of the classics. I'm not a kid not a teenager. I've passed my 30's and I do not find Twilight very amusing. But I do find a movie called ""Battle Royale"" very very good. It's useless to say that this movie isn't inspired on both movies... It is. But personally ""The Hunger Games"" to be a great movie it should have left the soapy and all smoothness aside. This is a good story (a little Battle Royalish - I can accept that - but this is a movie that I could have seen any given Sunday afternoon then recovering from a hangover. It lacks of violence (true violence) just like a movie like that should have. And right, in a s(h)ituation like that and a boy and girl fall in love... riiiight. It's all a little forced. The CGI weren't that good. I didn't enjoyed anything the final part of the movie with the ""DOGS????"" running after them. Seemed like it was forced and that there were no budget left for the final. Well you can't expect to have a dark and violent movie and being a PG13 for kids and teens. When I read that ""the expendables II"" is going to be a PG13 the first thing I said was ""here comes another kiddy movie""... Same thing with this one. But hey... I didn't read the books, I was there for the movie and although it was an interesting movie, I don't think it's something new nor I want it to review it later like I did for example with Battle Royale, Watchmen, 300, Sin City, Hostel, Inglorious Basterds or move recently Drive. 6/10 for me and... should be lower!"
"JeffAHayes","7","3","12","23 March 2012"," It was OK, but could have been a better adaptation.
","I just came from a midnight screening, and as someone who very well understands the need to make changes from books to movies (a college professor of mine gave a class using PBS' ""American Short Story"" series where we read the story, the screenplay adaptation, watched the PBS TV movie -- and with living authors read THEIR take on the differences) -- I'm still a bit dissatisfied with some of the changes made from book to movie for ""The Hunger Games"" (and I just bought and read the book within the past week, so it's VERY FRESH in my mind).<br/><br/>I bought and read ""The Help"" AFTER seeing the film, and while it, too, had differences, they sort of balanced out. I liked some changes in the movie better, some of the differences in the book better...<br/><br/>It was pretty obvious, however, reading ""The Hunger Games,"" that even though it's not a very long novel, the exposition in it would require a 4-hour movie to have all the scenes from the book, so I KNEW they'd cut a lot of the superfluous scenes, and they did (and most of the stuff they cut was OK to cut). My biggest issue, perhaps, is the SHEER POLITICS of Hollywood ""Blockbuster-Making."" There was more brutality in the novel than they showed in the movie, and some of it I felt important to the story, but I'm certain what they cut was to get a PG-13 rating SO the movie would be available to a much wider audience and therefore SELL MORE TICKETS! That said, the changes they made in the FINAL FIGHT SCENE -- particularly with the ""wildlife"" -- were, to me INEXCUSABLE. Katniss' realization of what was going on there, and the sheer horror of just WHAT this ""Capitol"" can, and will do, was pivotal, to me. I would recommend you see the movie first, THEN read the book, and see what I mean.<br/><br/>Flip side, they added A LOT of ""stuff"" in the movie that's NOT in the book -- mostly involving the president, played by Donald Sutherland... Of course a lot of the things he says may reflect things Katniss thought to herself in the novel. At any rate, I actually think what they did with him may have added to the impact of the story, a bit, but NOT at the expense of some of the other changes and a few deletions. I eagerly await (hopefully), an unrated ""Director's Cut"" of this movie that's 30 minutes or so longer and has more of what's missing.<br/><br/>I might have rated this a bit higher if the final battle scene had been true to the book. Then again, there were some other things after that which weren't that I actually preferred. I'll leave it to folks who've read the book to see for themselves.<br/><br/>I'd still recommend seeing this film to those who've read the novel. Just don't expect quite everything you may have hoped for. If you haven't read the novel, you'll probably LOVE IT. By itself, with no other context, it's a pretty great movie.<br/><br/>Jeff Hayes"

","Wow, there seems to be an influx of negativity towards the way the producers of this movie portrayed the book. I can't help but feel as if the majority of the people who take their time to write such deterring reviews for The Hunger Games might be influenced by peer pressure. There were so many people out there with bad reviews for the movie that it almost seems as if they wanted the movie to fail so that they could slam down some pretty harsh insults on the lack of the character's emotional depth and how it wasn't violent enough.<br/><br/>I thought the producers showed excellent work with the cinematography (especially the shaky camera feeling) because it made the audience feel immersed in the desperation and fear the tributes experience from the Hunger Games. Now I know that any popular movies that have received great reviews will also receive negative reviews, but if you honestly feel like the movie was a waste of cinematography, then watch the Academy Awards next year and see how people with a professional opinion feel about it.<br/><br/>The movie was absolutely fantastic and I believe that about 90% of the people who went to see it would agree with me.As for it being a huge waste of money and time as mentioned by arunspurs, well look at the amount of money it made in less than a month. Movies like these do not simply make 300 million dollars because the books were so famous, the movies actually have to be pleasant and entertained enough for people to see. I don't what it is with all of these negative reviews, but at least I can take comfort in knowing that there is at least one person out there who wasn't unreasonably critical of the movie. The only thing I found out from reading all of these reviews is that there are tons of people who either feel good about writing bad reviews or they simply cannot appreciate a good film with incredible depth and emotional movement."

","This is the most exhilarating movie I have ever seen in my life. I've sadly never read the books, but my friends whom have told me it was the best film adaptation they had ever seen. We all sat shaking during most parts of the movie due to the suspense. The cast was fantastic and the scenery was stunning. There was a lack of background information regarding each of the 12 districts, which was a slight pity. However the movie had everything from love, betrayal, fighting, sorrow... My expectations for this movie were tremendous. Normally when one has such high expectations, one is let down. Do not fear, you will not be disappointed with The Hunger Games!"

","'Last year was child's play' states Hamitch Abernathy, portrayed by Woody Harrelson. He is quite right too as Catching Fire, the second installment in The Hunger Games franchise has become; far darker, moodier and emotionally styled - all with a bigger, broader scope in comparison to the first.<br/><br/>Continuing from the first HG, the film begins - as fans of the book will know - with Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) and Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) back in District 12. With nearly a year passed since the events of the arena, and now mentors the duo must proceed with a victory tour throughout the Districts 11-1 to celebrate, all whilst keeping up the appearances of their love story. (There is not a single Prawn insight at District 9 - who knew.)<br/><br/>Shortly after capturing all of the standout emotion and violent traits from the novel they arrive in District 1, the Capitol. Where President Snow orders in his army of Stormtrooper look-alikes to the lower districts and announces that the 75th Hunger Games also coincides with the third Quarter Quell. Where that years reaping tributes are chosen from each Districts existing victors. Which in turn brings Peeta and Katniss back into the arena one more time. Dramatic suspense entrails and the story continues from there.<br/><br/>Taking over as director, Francis Lawrence- (no relation to Jen) and writers Michael Arndt and Simon Beaufoy have rather successfully crafted the story from paper to screen. Creating a rather faithful adaption. With its 146 minutes running time, it in fact includes almost every page from the book. But it is worth it.<br/><br/>Filled with mesmerizing performances, surreal narrative and seamless CG effects, you easily forget that you are watching a 12A, what with the raining blood, killing of Pensioners and extreme whipping scenes too. You are only reminded that it is a Young Adult film when you see the Wizard of Oz style Capitol and Effie's (Elizabeth Banks) elaborate attire, and hairstyles that even Princess Leia would avoid.<br/><br/>Post her Oscar win back in February, Jennifer Lawrence is the key to the franchises now even larger success. Her performance is flawless, emotional and simply striking. Portraying Katniss through and through, she represents the lost heroine lead that has not been this good since Lara Croft. Almost the greatest anyway, during filming Harrelson ordered on multiple occasions to give the Oscar back for forgetting her lines.<br/><br/>Starring alongside the now Academy Award Winner, Josh Hutcherson (Peeta) now has an even bigger challenge. The first HG's showed him as a bit of a drip, rather weak and quite defenseless. But this time around he seems healthier, stronger and more confident in the role – but still not great. Also returning are regulars Liam Hemsworth, Woody Harrelson, Elizabeth Banks, Stanley Tucci and Donald Sutherland, who has a much larger dictator-sith type role.<br/><br/>Additionally the new cast is equally as exceptional, which include; Sam Claflin as Finnick (the most standout character, no doubt a fan favourite) Jeffery Wright, Jena Malone and Phillip Seymour Hoffman, respectively, are also brilliant. Proving promising sparring partners for Jennifer Lawrence.<br/><br/>May the odds be forever in Mockingjay's favour."
"Minerva_Meybridge","5","2","7","4 September 2013"," Running Man Rehash
","Although in retrospect, Running Man seems cheesy, the basic plot is the same, from the worldwide television audience to the boisterous game show host. The only differences are that here the contestants are teens, they did not commit any crimes and they go after each other. At least the Running Man game show had a purported purpose. In the Hunger Games, it seem s strictly for sadistic entertainment. Essentially, this is a Roman gladiator scenario, but with unskilled teens, some some of them seem able to acquire weaponry talents overnight. Not a whole lot of tension. Everyone knew who was going to win from the start. Basically, it's a one-watch film; nothing to go out and by on blu-ray or DVD."
"Loquacient","8","2","7","30 December 2012"," Excellent Cinema
","I love living in ignorance. I never read any of the books, and before coming here to appreciate the film verbally after watching it for the first time on DVD, I never knew that the plot of the books upon which the film was based was similar to another set of books that I also never read. Fortunately, I do not care to read either set of books, and, most gratefully, I hadn't yet been polluted by all the trollish trash back and forth here on this board and in these reviews, so I was able to enjoy the movie objectively, having not read anything about it.<br/><br/>I can say that when the film is watched on its own merit - i.e., without all that unnecessary baggage - it stands out as a truly impressive production. I thoroughly enjoyed the spectacle. The premise of the film is quite absurd, requiring huge suspension of disbelief, so to get oneself in a lather about plot niceties regarding this particular kind of fictional universe is nonsensical.<br/><br/>No society populated by humans beings (homo sapiens sapiens) would allow the type of behavior typified in this movie to go on for so long. Rebellion would happen from the inside. People wouldn't just merrily go along with it. It's ridiculous to think otherwise. It's science fiction, occurring in a parallel universe of something like human beings, but not quite. That being the case, one would hope there would be more productive things to do than rabid fanboi bickering, but no, sadly.<br/><br/>The pageantry was fabulous. Art direction was stellar. Acting was superb. (Until the credits rolled, I had no idea that was Elizabeth Banks behind that makeup and hair! I make a point to hear as little as possible about a film before I see it.) The score was first class. The story moved within its own logic very nicely, I felt for many of the characters, and I can't wait for the sequel for what was obviously just the opening act. This review from objectivity is the best praise I can give.<br/><br/>I do hope that should some of the makers of this film be so unfortunate as to feel the need to read the rants, they must realize the insults and trolling mean nothing. (Most who are like me would just go away from the toxicity, rather than try to insert something good into all the nastiness.) Keep up the great work! I'll see the next one on the big screen, for sure."
"buzink","7","2","7","15 December 2012"," Entertaining, weak ending
","Entertaining movie. It has got some nice stuff for sf-fans, like 3d-objects created on the drawing table and made to come to life on the fly. I love the combination of futurism and middle ages (take that, steam punk! nothing beats a bow for a weapon!). Maybe that's what it makes far more interesting than it's Japanese foster parent, Battle Royal. The Lord of the Flies theme of innocent children and grown up violence in a remote place of beautiful nature combined with the reality game element of The Running Man and the cliché but ever more relevant distinction of cultural decadence versus natural purity does it every time. In that sense also in the line of Avatar. Connotations with colonialism and Nazi Germany are not to be missed. All stuff that comes much too late off course, in 2012, where critique on colonialism has become cliché and reality shows are, well, a reality. That together with the insignificant ending, that explains and solves nothing, renders the movie in mere entertaining. No, I must admit, VERY entertaining. And no no no, Jennifer Lawrence has nothing to do with that :)."

","What's with all these negative reviews? The Hunger Games is a fantastic movie, brilliantly made, and with fantastic actors. It's a great adaption of the book! It doesn't follow the original story EXACTLY but it does a pretty damn good job. Jennifer Lawrence does a sensational job as Katniss and Elizabeth Banks as Effie. The camera is a little shaky here and there but it is supposed to capture the chaos and the harshness of certain moments, which is something people don't understand because they're used to just a solid camera angle like you get in most films. All in all, I really loved the film and I could watch it a thousand times over. Don't believe the bad reviews."

","With the end of the ""Harry Potter"" saga and the ""Twilight"" series about to wrap up, Hollywood is ripe for a new movie franchise to take their place. After several attempts, Lionsgate came out on top with this summer's highly successful ""The Hunger Games."" <br/><br/>For those who live under a rock, the Hunger Games are an annual event that pit children from different districts against each other in a battle to the death. Sixteen-year-old Katniss Evergreen must rely on her training and archery skills to survive and return to her family. Her feelings for another competitor in the deadly Games complicate matters.<br/><br/>Everything about this movie is thought-provoking. It also contains layers of social commentary which add to its allure for teens and adults alike. Is it violent and controversial? Of course it is. It wouldn't be as wildly popular as it is if it wasn't.<br/><br/>Director Gary Ross does a wonderful job of capturing the animalistic nature and tragedy of the Games in a faux-shaky cam way that makes viewers feel like they're in the thick of the action. However, it doesn't cause you to want to blow chunks at the screen like ""Paranormal Activity"" or ""The Last Exorcism"" do.<br/><br/>If you're looking for an entertaining yet mentally stimulating movie for teens and their parents alike, this will hit the spot and encourage them to discuss the themes explored in the film."

The Story is based around Katniss Everdeen, A girl in district 12 who's younger sister Primrose is selected for the Hunger Games but she volunteers herself and replaces her sister in this dangerous games, and her journey in this dangerous games and how she copes with danger all around her in The Hunger Games.<br/><br/>The Acting by the whole ensemble cast is very good and everyone has done their own job very well and have portrayed their characters brilliantly, But the stand-out performer was Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss Everdeen as she portrays her character brilliantly and she was a brilliant pick for this character because she had all that it took to perfectly play this character. Her acting skills are very good and she is a really potential star on the rise. Stanly Tucci does a great job as the eccentric Caesar Flickerman who is TV presenter and Tucci has a small role in this movie but he really plays his character very well. Woody Harrelson and Josh Hutcherson also do there roles very well and their characters in this movie are quite significant and they do not disappoint. The Other Actors have done their part very well and the acting in this movie is very good.<br/><br/>The Director Gary Ross has done a brilliant job in making this movie and he implemented this interesting story and concept brilliantly and made a very good fantasy movie and he has done a marvelous job with his acting crew which is mostly a bit in-experienced. He was also a screen-writer in this movie and wrote a very good story for the movie which is unique and interesting in its own way and Ross did well by implementing the story written by Collins and he wrote good dialogues and took out the crucial parts and he implemented the story very well in the movie. Billy Ray and Suzanne Collins also were screen-writers and Ross along with them wrote a perfect story to start this franchise which is expected to be the next big franchise.<br/><br/>The Cinematography in the movie is quite good and all these new districts shown in the movie are really good and the Capitol was shown brilliantly too along with the area where the Hunger Games took place and the cinematographer Tom Stern did a very good job with the cinematography of this movie. The Special Effects were very good too and all these futuristic things shown in the movie were brilliantly shown and the special effects team did very well with all these action scenes and all the futuristic things shown.

The Background score of this movie is also quite good and the music is synchronised well with the scenes in this movie and music director James Newton Howard has done a good job with the music.<br/><br/>This movie has really set the tone for the upcoming movies to come for this highly anticipated and expected trilogy and with great acting and with actions and entertainment Guaranteed, this movie can be enjoyed by any audience.<br/><br/>My Rating: 7.5/10"
"Wuchakk","7","2","7","5 June 2012"," Worthwhile dystopian adventure
","Released to theaters in March, 2012, ""The Hunger Games"" is a post-apocalyptic film based on Suzanne Collins' popular book. A new nation, Panem, exists in North America where Capitol is the seat of Panem's wealthy, eccentric populace and cruel totalitarian government, which hosts the 'hunger games' annually, a brutal reality show featuring 24 contestants from Panem's 12 subjugated districts. The contestants, called ""tributes,"" range from ages 12-18 and there can only be one winner since it's a survival fight to the death! <br/><br/>The first thing that impressed me was the realistic air and overall ambiance of the film, as well as the entire dystopian concept and story set-up.<br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson, as the two ""tributes"" from District 12, Katniss and Peeta, are quality protagonists and I like the ambiguity of their feelings – are they for real or for show.<br/><br/>Lenny Kravitz stands out as one of the few caring characters from the Capitol, while Woody Harrelson is effective as the drunken adviser to the tributes, a past victor of the hunger games. Also on hand are Elizabeth banks, as the creepy but sorta winsome host of the District 12 tributes; Donald Sutherland as Panem's dictatorial president; and Wes Bentley as his right-hand man with a beard Satan himself would covet.<br/><br/>For me, the weak point of the film is the long third act, which constitutes the hunger games themselves, a fight-to-the-death in the forested wilderness (shot in the mountains of Western North Carolina). I anticipated this to be the best part, especially since I love survival stories and the wilderness, but it just wasn't as suspenseful or thrilling as it could have been. At the same time, it wasn't bad. The additions of the dubious ""mockingjay"" sequence and artificial horror-dogs who for some strange reason can't overtake the protagonists mar the film.<br/><br/>I thought the name of the nation -- Panem -- was really strange, until I discovered that 'Panem' means ""bread"" in Latin, as in the popular phrase ""bread and circuses"" (panem et circenses), which is figurative of superficial appeasement to pacify the masses. In the film, President Snow said something to this effect to Seneca Crane (Bentley). On top of this, the film shows flashbacks of Peeta intentionally burning literal bread and throwing it to the starving Katniss, which saves her. The bread motif appears elsewhere as well: as a parachute offering to Katniss from District 11 to show her their gratitude for her kindness to Rue (Amandla Stenberg) and the bread parachutes given to the tributes that communicated covert information.<br/><br/>I was a bit bewildered by the ending, since it left some things up in the air, but I suppose it leaves room for sequels.<br/><br/>When the credits began to role a song came on that just blew my mind; my wife motioned to leave, but I couldn't leave my chair while this awe-inspiring tune played. It's ""Abraham's Daughter"" by Arcade Fire, an incredible piece. Check it out on youtube.<br/><br/>FINAL WORD: If the long third act were better I wouldn't hesitate to give ""The Hunger Games"" an A-level rating. As it is, it's a good dystopian adventure with some excellent aspects, like the entire set-up, the protagonists and closing song.<br/><br/>The film runs 2 hours and 22 minutes.<br/><br/>GRADE: B"
"joeeyboy","8","2","7","5 June 2012"," Intriguing plot, boring characters...
","The Hunger Games has been hotly tipped to be the new 'Twilight' or 'Harry Potter'. Unfortunately this just doesn't seem to be the case. The film isn't bad it's just that it really hasn't lived up to the hype that has been circulating it for months. I hadn't read the books but I was intrigued by the format, it's different and not like anything else at the moment.<br/><br/>What I like about 'The Hunger Games' is that it really IS refreshingly different! It's not your average teenage novel turned movie; it's actually really quite interesting and it draws you in with the mystery and captivity of it all. It's intriguing to say the least and I found that I had to keep watching it.<br/><br/>Katniss Everdeen (played by Jennifer Lawrence) shows little to no emotion throughout the film. Whether or not she's supposed to be like that is yet to be heard, all I know is that she was incredibly boring to watch. Hutcherson (Peeta Mellark) is only OK and doesn't really bring anything to the film... Liam Hemsworth has been cast as one of the main characters (Gale Hawthorne) yet you see him about three times in the film? He has fewer lines than some of the minor characters and you barely see him at all throughout...<br/><br/>Overall the film was pretty good; it had an all-star cast and an intriguing plot. It was let down by the cast who were really quite boring. It was also massively over hyped which doesn't help when someone is trying to be critical. I'm definitely going to be buying the books, not only because I'm curious to find out what's next but also because I just don't see how you could fashion a good sequel off the back of this film..."
"link1907-360-813540","7","2","7","3 May 2012"," Good movie, I enjoyed it!
","Haven't read the book, didn't knew much about this universe. I'd say the director made a great job because even though I was completely new to the universe, it didn't took me to long to get immerse in it. The cast is impressive, they're all child and still doing a great job showing all these emotions. Overall I'd say this was a good movie.<br/><br/>There is of course negative things I found, the story is a little too cliché to my taste. The love triangle that we see in so much movie (like twi...cough...light shitty movie), and all TV show and nearly all teenager movie. So yes the movie was good but was also really cliché. The universe in which everyone evolve is also not really realistic. I don't get why they would do something like that (sending people to die for fun or like they say to keep the peace) its stupid. To me its absolute non sense. But if u ignore these thing the movie was pretty decent.<br/><br/>Might seems a bit rude but thats it. The movie was well done, great cast and a nice story but really unrealistic and unlikely. And of course all those cliché elements. Overall still a good movie and the ending really surprised me. I was expecting one of the two to die and definitely not an happy ending. Though I'm not sure it's a good thing or not i'd say the ending wasn't what i expected. I was expecting a sad ending.<br/><br/>If you like fantasy and teenage story you might actually think this movie is worth a 8/10 if not more like 6/10. For me its a 6.5 out of 10."
"mistarkus","8","2","7","3 May 2012"," Good Action Movie
","This was a very good action movie with an idiotic story premise. Most of the movie takes place in a forest-like arena where enemies and allies get knocked out one by one in a guerrilla warfare scenario like those classic Scwartzenagger and Stalone Extravaganzas from the 80s. It has a similar vein to the classic movies Predator and Rambo.<br/><br/>The story is rather ridiculous and hard to swallow only to be digested with the understanding that this is a total fantasy and despite the characters being humanoid we must understand this to be another world in some way.<br/><br/>Its about a futuristic society that pulls children's names out of hats essentially to be sacrificed. One out of 24 is supposed to survive the competition where the combatants fight with each other to the death with primitive weapons. And the oddest thing and purposefully hard to stomach is that that a small 11 year old girl must compete against a strong fully grown 18 year old male. It is a hard to swallow story. The world is so barbaric that our mind had to sense it in the middle earth realm and not this world. It is somewhat interesting to understand the reasoning behind this all powerful insecure government that runs such an event to keep the subjects in subjugation by fear yet teasing them with the smallest iota of hope. The expansive evil society and government will clearly play a larger part in the sequels but the movie wisely focused on the thrilling action packed training, build up to the competition and the game itself. Making a dumb, very entertaining and engaging action movie was beneficial over dwelling on another evil government movie. The charismatic actors gave the movie its edge and appeal.<br/><br/>There are some parallels to the world of reality TV. The competitors go on stage and are made up in their best outfits to try to win appeal and gain favor from the audience. The competition is shown to the public on screen. It was very reminiscent and hauntingly satirical of the reality shows in our world."
"berest19","9","2","7","2 May 2012"," The Hunger Games
","The Hunger Games, directed by Gary Ross, lived up to its hype by showcasing intense characters, detailed costume designing, and an inventive atmosphere that truly brought the book to life. The novel, The Hunger Games, written by Suzanne Collins, mesmerized me in the two days that I spent reading it, and by being so infatuated by the book, I prayed that the film would accentuate that same excitement. Fortunately for me, the movie did just that, and director Gary Ross used his touch of brilliance to create a nail biting film that captured the novel's themes of love, war, and hope. Although the movie exceeded two hours in length, it contained no uninteresting segments and the plot moved smoothly and efficiently. The three main characters in The Hunger Games, Katniss, Peeta, and Gale, were convincingly portrayed in the movie and the personality traits of each character were articulated and evident in their actions. As Katniss, Jennifer Lawrence was the fierce, skilled, and intelligent young woman that the book described, and the big screen allowed Katniss' character to truly flourish. Liam Hemsworth and Josh Hutcherson, who played Gale and Peeta, made a perfect supporting cast, and the duo helped bring Katniss' contrasting qualities of toughness and femininity to the forefront. The multiple settings of the movie were exactly what I had pictured while reading the book, and I loved how director Ross captured the desolation of District 12, the flamboyance of the Capital, and the treacherousness of the arena. Overall, I enjoyed the movie because of its realistic effects, its adherence to the novel, and its ability to keep me at the edge of my seat throughout the entire film. It is rare to witness a movie that forces oneself to meditate on the plot after leaving the theater, but this film involved elements of culture, politics, and morals that provided food for thought. I am happy to say that The Hunger Games did live up to its hype, and after seeing the movie, I am keenly anticipating the sequel, Catching Fire."
"breakingthefragile","8","2","7","1 May 2012"," Severely raises the bar for film adaptations of young adult novels, to a level of action that is accessible and appealing to all age groups.
","Every location in the setting is different from one another, visceral to take in, and stylishly inspired. It's difficult to add polished production to a post-apocalyptic scenario and still be taken seriously, and The Hunger Games does this so masterfully, it's especially impressive by movie adaptations of young adult novels standards. It doesn't feel the need to constantly remind you visually that it's set in a post-apocalyptic world, avoiding bland color schemes by utilizing its moody vibe and lighting which the production brings to life, and relies on its characters and well-crafted story telling to remind you of what the inhabitants of the world have brought upon it, with a intelligently powerful observational message that unfortunately rings too true a bell, on how we as a race continue to do so even after the world fell apart. It leaves a diversely organic yet grimy impression on a scale of varying atmospheres, without drowning itself in darkness, and has the balls to not let up on the violence and action even though the subject actors are teenagers, as is the target audience. Making it an example for poor adaptations of young adult novels with clichéd adolescent personalities and stereotyped casting to follow. This finds middle ground in thrilling appeal, and doesn't go too soft or too hard in either respect, making it very accessible without coming across as restrained or watered down. Its engaging, exciting, and remarkably respectable when considering the quality deprived reputation of its demographic of origin."
"MartianOctocretr5","8","2","7","29 April 2012"," Well executed futuristic dystopia tale, albeit an unlikely scenario
","Like any blockbuster movie with a futuristic dystopia theme, this one will have its hard core fans as well as equally passionate detractors. The one thing you can count on from any movie of this ilk worth its salt is that there'll be plenty of discussion--both on the positive side regarding its imagination and vision, while being vulnerable to ridicule about where it's over the top and unrealistic.<br/><br/>The vision is impeccable: a brutal government rules with unilateral control over a meek, broken, and battered proletariat. This was the result of a failed rebellion 70 years or so earlier, to the misfortune of the contemporary citizens. The government insulated their future control by rendering the rebels to little more than submissive, powerless slave colonies. Their ultimate symbol of their unquestioned authority was to force each of the 12 colonies to send two young people, through lottery, into a free-for-all challenge to the death. Only the last standing fighter would be allowed to live, in this apparent reference to ancient Roman Gladiators. Not an exact parallel, however; this challenge makes the Romans pale by comparison: it pits children/teens against one another, and no quarter is ever given. Kill or be killed is the only rule.<br/><br/>The story depicts the central government as something akin to the self- indulging phonies that Alice met in Wonderland. Fashion styles that would make the 80's punkers blush or laugh; hair styles that were even sillier. The inevitable mockery and finger pointing of modern society is not left out, usually expressed in the forms of technology, weaponry, communication, and social behavior. The arena-style presentation over television for a population of passionate spectators is a prime example of this. If taken at face value, the artistic point is clearly made through these exaggerations. The absurd styles seem unlikely (we're moving away from that, not towards it right now), but watching violence for vicarious pleasure is indeed already evolving in ever weirder and more dangerous reality show competitions.<br/><br/>The action of the film is appropriately brisk, and also masterfully tempered. Bloodbath scenes are measured by often being implied rather than brazenly shown for the sake of gore. This balances the intellectual moral of its dystopia message, with just enough violence to support why such a future is negative in the first place. Still, even though the movie successfully avoids overdoing the violence, the plot's idea of children killing children should give you pause before taking your entire family to see this.<br/><br/>The acting, by a mostly unknown cast, is exceptional, at least for the actors with a character that is developed enough to give them a chance to stand out. The settings and backdrop decor are impressive, and the flow of the story is spot on. The story is told well, the characters are interesting, and the world that is imagined leaves an imprint after leaving the theater. There are minor faults in the execution, but this is overall, a worth while film to see."
"michaelgreey","9","2","7","28 April 2012"," Great Film
","The box office didn't lie for this movie. I saw this movie on its opening weekend, it was a great film, that had it all. It has a phenomenal depiction of Suzanne Collins' futuristic world that is post war. I would suggest this movie to anyone that hasn't seen it.<br/><br/>The relationship between the book and the movie is actually pretty similar. If you have read the books and liked them (like most movies based off novels) you will love the movie for sure.<br/><br/>Lastly Jennifer Lawrence does an amazing job as the lead. The characters themselves were not developed as much as in the book but other then that it was still a awesome film and everyone should see it."
"Laakbaar","8","2","7","28 April 2012"," Hunger Games, the movie
","This movie is science fiction set in a distant future in which part of North America is divided into 12 zones, with some zones wealthier and more advanced than others. Television still plays a huge role in this future society. Television producers are able to create elaborate fantasy worlds.<br/><br/>For historical reasons, each zone is required to select a young man and young woman to participate in a reality show that is essentially a mutual hunt to the death combined with an escape from deadly special effects. The story focuses on the experiences of one engaging and attractive young couple from a particularly poor district.<br/><br/>This interesting future world and the grand theatricality and drama of the ""hunger games"" are gradually revealed in a way that allowed me to get caught up in it. I enjoyed seeing how they imagined the future would look and how such a show would be mounted. The characters were extraordinarily attractive and the movie was visually appealing. The movie was fast paced and I was curious to see where it would lead.<br/><br/>The character development of the Katniss character was good and the role was believably and well played by Jennifer Lawrence. She was the focal point of the movie (perhaps at the expense of the other characters). I ending up caring about what happened to her and there were a few places where I was emotionally affected by her experiences.<br/><br/>Every movie has flaws though. Most of the characters were two-dimensional. Some aspects of this future society, including the technological capabilities of the show producers, bordered on the unbelievable.<br/><br/>After looking at the discussion boards, I've discovered that this movie is part of a teenage phenomenon. Many young people see themselves as cognoscenti because they've read the books. They are explaining the movie in light of the book. It seems many fans don't want this movie to be taken at face value -- they want viewers to read the book and they want the movie to be interpreted in that light.<br/><br/>Also, some young fans are apparently troubled by comparisons between this movie and earlier movies, between this movie and earlier cultural themes and concepts. Of course, they want the Hunger Games phenomenon (including the movie) to be seen as something fresh and new in our culture.<br/><br/>I think we have to remember to respect the fact that a movie is a separate work of art. Books and movies are different media. The book will reveal more detail, including the thoughts of the characters. A movie is much more of a visceral, visual experience. A movie may be loosely based on historical facts or a book, but it will not be the same. And nor should it be. <br/><br/>Hunger Games the book and Hunger Games the movie are two different things. They are approached differently. It's not really useful to explain the ""real"" story behind the movie. There is no real story. The movie is what it is. It stands on its own, separate from the historical events or book that gave rise to it. This doesn't effect the validity of the original book or historical events, of course. They can all be enjoyed, but in a different way.<br/><br/>Also, many books and movies reflect earlier books, movies and themes that have arisen in our culture. This is a good thing and enriches the experience. Every book and movie will have to rely on artistic elements that went before. Some fans don't want this movie compared to the ""Truman Show"", for example, which was a fantastic, original movie. The movie ""In Time"" also had a future world where people were forced to live in districts with disparate wealth levels.<br/><br/>The fans particularly don't want the Hunger Games compared to gladiatorial combat. But to me that's what this movie reminded me of, especially the chariot entrance into the stadium. It was essentially futuristic gladiatorial combat aimed at teenagers. Clearly this is what the author intended or the country wouldn't have been called ""Panem"".<br/><br/>It didn't escape my notice that there was not much difference between the 21st century moviegoers and the futuristic audience watching the Hunger Games live. Perhaps not surprisingly, the morality of of sadistic voyeurism was a theme not explored in this movie. This movie might have been improved by the realistic depiction of gore. The violence here, despite being the core of the movie really, was of the goreless Hollywood variety. True gore is too difficult for most people to watch. For me the unrealistic violence mitigated the horror of the situation and the underlying moral point.<br/><br/>Hunger Games seems to be aimed at a generation that has grown up watching survivor, reality and game shows where people get ""voted off"". ""You are the weakest link -- Boom!""<br/><br/>I enjoyed the movie (but only for what it was) and would recommend it to anyone."

","Every now and then, there comes a sci-fi film that pushes the boundaries of what is considered civil, for even though civilization may prosper, there will always be a demand for violent entertainment. Films that portray futuristic death-matches for sport could probably be counted only in the double-digits; titles like the original ""Rollerball,"" ""The Running Man,"" ""Battle Royale,"" and the ""Death Race"" remake typically dominate this obscure corner of sci-fi.<br/><br/>In this niche, ""The Hunger Games"" might be the most accessible film ever. It doesn't indulge on gory, graphic details the way these other films do; most deaths in this death-match are off-screen, obscured, or just plain bloodless. There's still enough roughness to emphasize the harrowing nature of the actual Hunger Games; some might even say it's better that way.<br/><br/>It takes a good hour or so to get to the games; the film runs a good long length and takes its time to establish the story, characters, the environment, and the conflict, before getting down and dirty with everything else. The film entertains throughout; very few, if any scenes, dragged. I personally found myself well-invested in the story.<br/><br/>And the story will be the thing worth seeing. Those familiar with Suzanne Collins' book will probably relate to the film best, as they can pick out all the fine details and understand every nuance the best. The film does a first-rate job of adapting the original story; there are many minor changes, but most of it is just like the book. Those unfamiliar with the book may be alienated from the film, though most of it can stand on its own. Characters stand out pretty well; a romance does come about that seems reminiscent of ""Twilight,"" which will attract young audiences (especially the ladies) and could be off-putting for dudes wanting straightforward fighting. Regardless, the film never comes off as sappy or pandering.<br/><br/>My biggest complaint is in the filming; it looks great half of the time, but harsh, shaky, jittery cameramanship rears its ugly head throughout. There are three or four times where I wish I could have seen more of what was going on, but couldn't because of the photography. Otherwise, parts of the film look great and stylish, and have fine editing. I was pleased with the acting and writing; everybody puts on a quality performance. This production has some very fascinating sets, props, and costumes. For special effects, I've seen better and I've seen worse. Music is pretty nice.<br/><br/>I'd recommend this best to fans of the book, and interested sci-fi fans. Those seeking more hardcore material can do better.<br/><br/>4/5 (entertainment: 4/5, story: 4.5/5, film: 4/5)"
"info-355-578727","8","2","7","27 April 2012"," Teenagers fight to the death in order to affirm the government's power. There's a social commentary in there somewhere.
","THE HUNGER GAMES is the first movie that I saw on opening day at the midnight showing. By midnight, I was thinking that I had made a very serious mistake. I was beginning to feel unusually aged; I had just spent two hours sitting in a movie theater as scores of teenagers flitted by giggling, texting and composing songs. When I saw how many of them were sporting hand-painted t-shirts emblazoned with ""Team Peeta"" and ""Team Gale"", I started wondering if I should develop a taste for tapioca and begin amassing an obnoxious number of cats. ""Do NOT do this to me,"" I thought with a burning and selfish anger. ""Do NOT turn this into TWILIGHT.""<br/><br/>I need not have worried. From the opening, THE HUNGER GAMES pulled me in and immersed me in Suzanne Collins' dystopian world. Sure, I really enjoyed the book, but it does not necessarily follow that I'll enjoy the movie. This time, I did. Certainly, there are some things I would have liked to see done differently, but overall, I was impressed. No, not this-is-going-to-go-down-in-the-annals-of-classic-cinema impressed, but I felt as though the purchase of my ticket was money well-spent.<br/><br/>The movie stays very true to the story: Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) becomes her district's first volunteer for the government-powered, homicidal powerfest in the guise of a reality show known as the Hunger Games. When Katniss' younger sister Prim (Willow Shields) is randomly selected to compete in the games, Katniss rushes forward to offer herself in Prim's place as tribute. Katniss is then swept off to the Capitol with Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) as the other tribute where they must put on a show for the glory and power of the Capitol as they fight to the death against 22 other youngsters.<br/><br/>There is a great deal of bloodshed in THE HUNGER GAMES, but it furthers the movie's plot and does not feel as though the film team is just gratuitously spraying red paint across the screen. In fact, I had the distinct sense that those responsible for the production were toning down the movie's potential sanguinity. I had wondered how they were going to handle the infamous bloodbath at the Cornucopia, and I will say that I am impressed with how they depict such a raw and brutal scene. The use of the camera to give a distorted sense of time and vision does a wonderful job of underscoring the horror of what is occurring while not permitting the blood-letting to overpower the underlying message. At no point does the movie give the sense that it relishes the blood and the body count.<br/><br/>I am also impressed with the actors' performances. Lawrence's Katniss is appropriately strong with undercurrents of emotion while not delving into distracting waves of angst. Woody Harrelson does a fine job of portraying Haymitch as simultaneously humorous, sympathetic and haunted. I have to give some major props to Hutcherson for his portrayal of Peeta. Reading the book, I was lukewarm on Peeta- I didn't hate him, but I didn't care one whit what happened to him. Hutcherson's performance changed that. He presents Peeta as a complex and engaging person, really giving dimensions to a character I had felt was rather flat.<br/><br/>I do wonder, though, who signed off on the shaky-cam. Seriously. I see what you're doing there, but please stop. The jitteriness of the picture grows tedious quickly. I am not a film student, but I am under the impression that the shaky-cam ought to be used sparingly. If so, I now know why. And of course, I wish more time could have been spent on the other tributes, particularly Rue (Amandla Stenberg). Rue's relationship with Katniss becomes the catalyst for so many things on a grand scale, and it really deserves more time. Certainly, the scene in District 11 brought goosebumps to my arms, but I had also read the book.<br/><br/>That brings me to my next point: I would recommend reading the book first. The movie cannot possibly include all of the nuances, all of the character development, all of the implications of what is occurring. However, without understanding the depths of Collins' world, it can be difficult to fully appreciate the movie. For me, reading the book meant the difference between ""well, this is an entertaining movie"" and ""wow, I would definitely see that again"" (which I did, just in case anybody cared to know).<br/><br/>In the end, THE HUNGER GAMES is a very engaging, very satisfying movie and definitely is worth a watch.

"LeahJayne","9","2","7","25 April 2012"," A winner both as a movie and an adaptation
","I was lucky enough to see The Hunger Games at a midnight screening amid the droves of buzzing and excited fans. I have to say, it definitely lives up to the hype. I walked out of the theatre feeling really happy with it. The movie is a faithful adaptation from the book and does an excellent job of introducing the audience (both fan and non-fan alike) to the world of Panem.<br/><br/>As readers of the series know, the books are told from Katniss' point-of-view. This is a great way to experience a book – we're inside our heroine's head and experiencing everything as she does. In a movie, however, we have to venture outside of her head. This allows us to see things that we wouldn't otherwise see. For example, the Hunger Games control room and the uprising in District 11. These scenes provided a background for the Games themselves as well as the ruthless, totalitarian nature of the society.<br/><br/>This is one of the best book-to-movie adaptations I've ever seen. The story unfolds almost exactly as it does in the book, including every major scene. It also included a lot of the original dialogue, which was great. Whenever a movie is adapted from a book, there are going to be some differences due to timing and other factors. However, a good movie adaptation will capture the essence of the book, and I think this one does that well. Personally, the movie evoked in me the same feelings that I got when reading the book.<br/><br/>As a fan, it's wonderful to see really talented actors embody the characters we've come to know and love. The cast, both lead and supporting, is absolute perfection. Jennifer Lawrence, in particular, is phenomenal in the role of Katniss. Although slightly older than the character, she brings a level of maturity and a commanding presence that were necessary to play the part. She carries the whole movie and a couple of standout moments for me were the Reaping and also the launch into the arena.<br/><br/>I have to commend director Gary Ross and his team for bringing us a faithful and entertaining movie version of The Hunger Games. It's truly amazing to see this world as described in the books (from the dreary Seam in District 12 to the extravagant Capitol) come to stunning visual life. My only real complaint is that the release for Catching Fire is so far away!"

"johnnymacbest","9","2","7","22 April 2012"," A tragic, yet enthralling experience.
","Never have I had such an enthralling experience from The Hunger Games. It's not a heartwarming nor easy film to appreciate as it's dark and sinister tone punctuated with brutal violence(even for a PG-13 film) and callousness towards fellow human beings is enough to give anyone watching chills. All the acting, especially from Jennifer Lawrence is simply incredible. With such raw emotion and pulsating intensity, she's grabs your attention(along with the well-written script and dialog and plot) like wet rope and never lets go. She was simply born for this role and her performance will really resonate with audiences who had the chance to experience this dark epic. My only peeve is that some of the characters were not developed. The audience never got the chance to see things from the point of view from the other characters. But that's not enough to enjoy this film which is overall very dark with very little in the way of humor. I hope the next film will delve more deeper into the world and characters that inhabit it and judging by the phenomenal box-office results, I have become a new fan to this franchise. A second viewing is definitely not out of my league."
"snowwhistle-rk","8","2","7","19 April 2012"," Very Good, But Could've been Much More
","I really enjoyed this movie. It was thrilling, and it captured my attention. I enjoyed Woody Harrelson and that other lady, as Haymitch and Effie. It was a very good watch. I recommend it to all. That's not to say this movie isn't flawed. There are a few spoilers here so turn away if you don't wish to see that.<br/><br/>Many people claim that the book was much more detailed and that the movie was a watered down version of the book. Well guess what!? Those are MOVIES! Movies can't be expected to copy every single little thing! I understand that Madge giving Katniss the Mockingjay pin weren't there, but they couldn't add all of that! It just simply wouldn't fit in a two and a half hour movie.<br/><br/>People say Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss Everdeen was very bland. I disagree. No, she's not the most engaging person in the movie (a flaw) but she is very good at filling in her role.<br/><br/>Now, for the downsides. This movie had terrible camera work for the first ten minutes. Good god! Hold the camera still! 2. Clarify a bit! A few things in the movie were unclarified, such as how the tessarae works, or what Effie's name is. Another problem, they cut just a bit too much. I mean, a few cuts were fine, but some were kind of extreme. Like the Avox Girl and Tribute Mutts, which were pivotal in the story. Lastly, a lot of things were downplayed. Peeta's injury never made me feel sympathetic for him and I felt the romance was very underdone.<br/><br/>It was very good, but I felt it could've been more. Still, can't wait for sequel."

","In the near future, where kids from each district are chosen for The Hunger, a televised event where they fight to the deaths. Kantiss(Jennifer Lawerence) steps in for her kid sister. And Peete(Josh Hutchinson) is also picked. They travel to the place where it's gonna take place, they train and get prepared, but the question is will they survive? <br/><br/>A well made film, the futuristic look to the film is perfect. Jennifer Lawerence is perfectly well cast as Kantiss, she brings the character to life, it's hard to picture anybody else in the role after seeing her. Josh Hutchinson is good, so is Elizabeth Banks, Woody Harrleson, Alexander Ludwig, and Isabelle Furman. Although it slows down in spots, but still a good film."

","Before i went to watch this movie, i was told by some of my friends that the movie was amazing and they had my hopes up, i was looking forward to watching the movie, but when i watched the movie, i realized that the movie had a simple story line and definitely not the type i would consider amazing. When The official games started, i thought the competitors would be killing each other and hunt each other down with their various techniques, but then i saw that there were 6 people hanging in a group which disappointed me, its a tournament with only 1 winner gosh... who would be teaming up with their enemies, also when they are asleep, knowing that there would only be one winner, who wouldn't try to kill them while they are asleep?"
"kluseba","7","2","7","7 April 2012"," A step in the right direction for Hollywood fantasy movies for younger audiences
","After the overrated hypes around series such as ""Twilight"" and the last ""Harry Potter"" movies that are based on artificial special effects and rather mediocre acting I didn't expect too much from this new series that start with ""The Hunger Games"". To my surprise, this movie is easily better and plays in another league as ""Twilight"" or the last two ""Harry Potter"" movies.<br/><br/>This movie is also based on many special effects but they are visually truly beautiful and the strange future world is quite interesting to discover. The acting is also solid at many points I really appreciated the appearances of the charismatic Donald Sutherland, singer Lenny Kravitz and the very talented young actress Isabelle Fuhrman. The movie also contains some decent criticism about media and society but it could dig deeper at some points. The open ending makes you want to see the evolution of the characters and the addicting future world in the upcoming two movies. This movie is a solid Hollywood popcorn movie for teenagers but might also please to older fans of fantasy and science fiction movies even though I prefer the more mature ""John Carter"" that has been released a few weeks before this output. I was positively surprised by the high amount of brutality and raw killing scenes in the movie that make it more dramatic towards the end. After horrible adoptions from fantasy books such as the teeth-less ""Eragon"" in the past, this is definitely a step in the right direction even of worried parents, conservative Hollywood maniacs and too religious watchers might feel shocked about these tendencies.<br/><br/>On the other side, this movie offers nothing new after all. The dystopian context and the brutal games make me think of ""Rollerball"" and other classics and this movie has not enough originality and soul to come close to this masterpiece. It could though initiate a younger audience to this genre and make them discover further great dystopian movies such as ""1984"", ""Equilibrium"", ""Fahrenheit 451"", ""Renaissance"" and ""V For Vendetta"". In comparison to these movie this one we have here is rather forgettable and only worth to be watched once even though you get well entertained in over two hours of running time. I also disliked the choice of the main male character who lacks of charisma and guts in comparison to the convincing female lead role. Josh Hutcherson seems to be like a mixture of Justin Bieber and Robert Pattinson and seems only to be there to attract young girls to this movie. He might be a sweet guy for them but he honestly is a rather mediocre actor. The love story between him and the female lead role is simply not convincing in this movie and I'm looking forward to read the book to see if the whole thing is more authentic in the written version. The next time I wish the studios would chose an edgier and more unique actor or change the character of the book a little bit to make him more interesting. The soft guy simply feels out of place in this rather brutal survival movie towards the end.<br/><br/>In the end, it's worth to watch this movie once and to get out and watch the two sequels if their quality is as good or better than this movie. It's nothing groundbreaking though or something I would watch twice or purchase. A younger audience might though like it and overall the flick is well done and a step forward after the last rather mediocre Hollywood fantasy blockbusters with the exception of ""John Carter"" and ""Super 8"" that were approximatively as good or slightly better than this."
"ec_unlimited","7","2","7","1 April 2012"," It's difficult...
","(I've tried to make this short review spoiler-free, so I hope I don't give anything away!)<br/><br/>Contrary to the many negative reviews on this page, I actually found the film quite delectable. I did not even notice the shaking camera that much, though I'm not very sensitive when it comes to this, so I shall say no more.<br/><br/>The portrayal of the characters by the actors/actresses have been done very well, and I don't really have any negative comments for them, so I would like to congratulate them for a job well done.<br/><br/>Now this is where I disagree with the mainstream comments: I found the pace of the film easy to follow, and not at all boring. I watched it twice and I didn't feel bored both times. Maybe it was even a bit too quick. I would have liked to watch a bit more and I thought it could go up to 3 hours, but that might be pushing the boundaries a little... Also, I felt that the artistic side of the film was done very well, from the costumes to the design of the Capitol.<br/><br/>But I think the enjoyable aspects of the film speak for themselves. I should focus on the frowns a bit more:<br/><br/>I do agree that the book is a lot better, though I enjoyed the film nonetheless. I would have liked to see the political context explored in the film, and yes, there was a lack of desperation during the Games, and even outside of the Games. I think the audience is all too familiar with images of poverty and disorder. The book has much more to offer than these superficial images of a dystopian world. And if there is one thing which can separate the Hunger Games from similar stories like Battle Royale, it is the political context of the Games. Hopefully, the next two films will pay more attention to these issues as the protagonists become involved in a bigger world.<br/><br/>Also, the film did not develop the characters well enough. For example, there is more to the hunting and the mockingjay symbol than what the film suggests. Much of the history of the characters, as well as Panem, have been omitted. However, I probably enjoyed these aspects of the book most. It's not the actors'/actresses' problem - they have done a great job embodying the many aspects of the characters. Rather, the screenplay was unable to take advantage of the actors'/actresses' talents by not providing more background information to portray and develop the characters properly.<br/><br/>As a film, I'd give it 7/10, but I've always had this personal attraction to dystopian stories so I feel inclined to give this film one extra score, which makes 8/10. And I will readily admit that I'm quite biased, too! :D"
"jordan-egan","8","2","7","31 March 2012"," Definitely worth a watch!!!
","I knew nothing about this film until a few days before its release and when I heard it was going to be like Battle Royale I instantly looked into it. Discovering that the film was to be a 12A I was rather shocked and put off by the fact that a film like this could be rated that low, but nevertheless was still determined to watch it.<br/><br/>I must say that I'm glad that I did. The acting throughout the film is superb! The emotion of the characters really gives different parts of the film distinctive moods that entices you into the film. It gets you thinking, which is always a good thing, who's going to die next and what you'd do in their situation. Although I'd say it was pretty predictable towards the end, this is still a film definitely worth every penny!<br/><br/>I was very disappointed to hear that the bloody bits had been edited to reduce the rating (obviously for money purposes) as I am a blood and gore fan I have to say, but the story and acting indubitably makes up for this. <br/><br/>I wouldn't have really thought this to have been a family film before I watched it, but it is one that the whole family will definitely enjoy! Happy Hunger games!"
"bondfish","8","2","7","30 March 2012"," Good Adaptation of the world but....
","The Hunger Games is one of my favorite novel that has came out in the past 5 years. As I am writing this review now I am on Part 2 of Catching Fire so I can't say that its my favorite trilogy in the past 5 years. The actual story is compelling, yet not original but it's still satisfying either way. So lets get started!<br/><br/>After I saw the trailer which I think was an excellent trailer because of the fact that it didn't show any of the games, just the build up to them. By watching the trailer I felt as though they were going to follow the book very closely, considering that Suzanne Collins helped write the screenplay for the movie. So I was really excited that we are actually gonna see this world come to life and get to see the story unfold and see how another person would put together this world from what they thought it would look like. <br/><br/>Gary Ross who directed the film did succeed in making the world and the characters come to life. From the rundown and poor life style of District 12 to the crazy, colorful, and futuristic style of the Capitol, he nailed it spot on. Its not only the places that came to life, but also the characters.<br/><br/>The acting in this movie is extremely good. Jennifer Lawrence is the only person I can see in this role. She had already proved herself in Winters Bone, and once again she proves herself here. She makes Katniss come to life and plays her flawlessly. Josh Hutcherson I think did a fine job, even though I'm not a big fan of him at all. Woody Harlenson and Elizabeth Banks both did a really good job themselves in their roles. Donald Sutherland is up there with Lawrence in his role. He makes you hate President Snow as soon as he shows up on screen, fantastic job. Stanley Tucci also is amusing and does a good job.<br/><br/>In the movie I like how they give you a feeling that they keep reminding you that you are watching a gameshow. By using the announcers tell the audience certain things that Katniss tells you in the book, the announcers do in the movie. I thought that was a great and creative idea. I also like how they show to people that haven't read the books, the gamemakers control room. Once again a creative way to help move the plot points. <br/><br/>Now yes this movie does a good job adapting the source material, but it doesn't do a good job in exacuting them. By that I mean the biggest flaw of the film was character development. <br/><br/>The character development I feel is unacceptable in every way. Now the movie is 2 hours and 20 mins its already pretty long. In that time span they decide to cram every detail of the story, or I should say ""big set pieces"" of the book in there. Which is fine but not fine if a character dies who we should care about, but completely don't due to the fact that both those characters had 5mins of screen time together, and what feels like an hour time of day for the characters in the film but is really a few days in the book. <br/><br/>Personally I felt the movie seemed short due to the cramming of all the key points of the book in there, so I think the movie would have benefited with 10 more mins of character develop in there. Some might argue that the film would have been way too long and boring, but if it helps me connect with the characters I'm all for it.<br/><br/>The Hunger Games does a fine job adapting the novel and making the universe come to life, I just wished I actually felt more emotion towards the characters and actually cared what happened to them.<br/><br/>This one is really hard for me because I like the story of the book so much that I felt cheated on the saddest part of the book, next to the ending which they left out and I was disappointed."
"sabretooth91","9","2","7","30 March 2012"," Not truly accurate to the book, but a great movie
","The Hunger Games was done really well. I had been waiting for this movie for as long as it was announced it was coming out. A year? I am a huge fan of the books and I know many others who are as well. This is a brilliant reflection on the human species, our society, and our government.<br/><br/>I can't stand people who try to compare this to other movies, because this isn't trying to be another movie. This is telling Katniss' and Peta's stories. And the stories of the struggles of the districts.<br/><br/>Anyway, the cinematography is great. The make-up and clothes of the capitol are right-on. The differences in the quality of life of the districts and the Capitol are portrayed very well. As far as I can remember, the action at the Games seems about right. I was glad to see that they didn't focus on the gore. That's not really the point. I'm glad there was time spent on Rue and District 11.<br/><br/>Now my gripes. Why did you half-ass the CG of the dogs?!!! WHY!? I wanted to see that SO bad! For those who don't know, the bad-ass dogs are actually supposed to be some kind of man-made mutt, where each dog resembles an individual dead tribute. It royally screws with Katniss' head, and she has trouble killing them. And I wanted to see what a make-up artist imagined them to look like. So boooo! I had a couple minor gripes about little things that happened differently in the book. I imagine that they were changed for the movie because they don't have a major impact on the plot or story, and there really wasn't time to develop another character just to give Katniss the Mockingjay pin. Just little things which weren't a really big deal (that I noticed anyway) What carries this movie is the story. The people are being oppressed and controlled by the Capitol. I'm glad Katniss wasn't made up too much in the movie to be too beautiful (with make-up etc). The mood seemed right. Everything was pretty dark and dreary. Everyone seemed oppressed and depressed. That was right on. There were some quick scenes that reveal Katniss' past and that of her family and District. I'm not sure if someone who hadn't read the books would have noticed what they meant. I don't think it was pointed out that the Mockingjay became the symbol of the previous revolution, and Katniss was wearing it during the Hunger Games.<br/><br/>I went to see this at IMAX with a bunch of friends. Must of them hadn't read the books. They seemed to enjoy this movie the most: probably because they didn't know how it would end. They had wide-open eyes and big smiles after the movie. Then, we all had a great discussion afterward. Unfortunately, my friends are perpetually tardy, so we had to sit so close, I couldn't fit the entire screen in my peripheral. I'll have to go see it again to appreciate it better.<br/><br/>In closing.... Go see this movie. You won't be disappointed."
"haosstoposto","9","2","7","30 March 2012"," Loved it!
","Finally a movie without hyper-inflated action scenes on steroids. I had no foreknowledge about the books and watched the movie almost accidentally. It is nice to see there are still movie directors who can tell a coherent story. Movie is beautifully shot, accompanied with melancholic music. Battle scenes are sparse bur dramatic and not overdone like the fighting scenes in the recent movies like ""Game of Shadows"" where everybody seems to know some martial art. In reality fights are short and people die easily and that is how they are shown on the screen. Main character arouses sympathy and is someone who we can root for. Jennifer Lawrence looks gorgeous in every scene reminding of Diana, goddess of the Hunt. Some reviewers criticize the movie for its lack of gore claiming it is boring but that is far from true. There is no need for a movie to be brutal and bloody to be suspenseful."

","As a fan of the book who understands that everything cannot always be included in the movie I loved this film! They hit all the main points, it had a smooth flow, it was deep and really captured the characters though there could have been more character development. It was definitely an emotional roller coaster that will be able to touch people of all ages. Not everything was perfect about the film though. In the beginning there was a lot of rack focus and shaky shots but I can understand why they did that so as to make the viewer uncomfortable like the characters were. Anyway, great film. Go see it and take all your friends! <br/><br/>A final tip for the fans of the book. Go in with a clean slate. Know that everything in the books will not be in the film. That is impossible. With the 2 1/2 hours they had they did a wonderful and beautiful job!"
"bluetanker_07","9","2","7","29 March 2012"," It's almost the same as the book!
","I admit there might be some missing parts from the book but it is totally bearable and the acting of the cast is very good - no! the cast itself made it better! I love how they interpret the book's fast-paced action sequence.<br/><br/>This is going to be a hit, for sure! There is so many movie series nowadays but I trust this series will not disappoint its fans. Katniss Everdeen is so amazingly gorgeous! I love her! I love how they make it spark to light up their chemistry with Peetah! And yes I am a Peeta-Katniss Team!<br/><br/>And to Battle Royale Fans? Beat it. This is way different from Battle Royale. It brings The Hunger Games to next level, that's why the fans loved it!"
"AbigailRobinson","10","2","7","29 March 2012"," Superb acting, and electrifying movie!
","The Hunger Games movie was absolutely electrifying! You can tell how much everyone involved in the making of this movie cared about the story, as it showed in every one of the scenes they chose to keep. It is very easy for a film based on a hugely popular teen franchise to turn into something completely different (Eragon!) but Gary Ross was adamant that the film would stay as true to the book as possible. I am so glad he was on board because after a recent piece of news of a new plot piece that was almost added to the film, I'm not sure it would definitely have turned out perfectly, even with Suzanne Collins helping the whole way through. There was a lot of hand-held camera-work and it was very distracting at times, but I can't say it ruined the film because most of it only occurred during the District 12 scenes and intense fight scenes. The shaky cam made it feel as if you were running along with Katniss and it felt very intimate and made you feel really small amongst the surroundings. I think the style fit the story very well and it certainly did its job. At least no one can say it's like Twilight now! No one can say it was too 'Hollywood"" either! That's what the hand-held cam was for - to very clearly define the poor districts from the Capitol and show that there wasn't even a hint of Hollywood in District 12.<br/><br/>One thing that I was a bit disappointed with, though, was that the whole thing seemed far too short. Even though it was 2 ½ hours long, everything in the Capitol seemed a bit rushed. There were loads of scenes that I would have liked to see and I don't mind that they were missed out but it just felt like some of them should have been there just to pace it a bit more. I wasn't really sure whether people who hadn't read the book would fully get to know Katniss or Peeta either. I really hope they did because Jennifer Lawrence just IS Katniss! I would happily have sat through 3 hours or more and I'm sure that would have fixed most of the problems with missing scenes and pacing! <br/><br/>The acting was superb throughout the movie! Especially from Jennifer Lawrence because, as I said before, Jennifer Lawrence just IS Katniss, despite being too old and too naturally blonde! The child actors were amazing too! When they were cast, I never thought about whether they would be good at acting or not. I don't know why but all I thought about was their looks and I just thought that if they had been chosen, they must be good! It was only when I saw the trailer, though, that I realised how good Willow was, despite it being virtually her first film! Josh Hutcherson was perfect too and he seemed exactly like Peeta. I loved all the tributes too. I really look forward to the next two to three movies and I hope they'll be as good, or even better than this one!"
"MarkFreedmanNY","7","2","7","28 March 2012"," Enjoyable, but had more potential.
","I delayed a day to consider this, to let it sink in. First off, the acting was very good, considering the screenplay they had to work with. Jennifer Lawrence IS Katniss, save for the lack of the malnourishment she should have had. Josh Hutcherson was very good as Peeta. I just wish They had more of the dialog we saw on the roof before the games.<br/><br/>I know people complained about Donald Sutherland's limited screen time, but he did get more than his character's time in the first book. He's terrific, and he should get a much larger opportunity in the second movie.<br/><br/>But I am so sick of the ""unsteady cam."" I'm sorry, but it's now just a gimmicky distraction. It really took away from the movie. Enough, already.<br/><br/>I wouldn't have minded a 3 hour movie, if they had just fleshed out the other characters more. A lot more. The rest of the tributes were not much more than caricatures of typical movie teens. You didn't feel for them when they died so young for basically nothing. I wish Rue had more screen time, so they didn't have to extend Katniss's sobbing to get the sad point across. And I was disappointed with the last death scene at the cornucopia, where they used the stereotypical psycho-character speech before his demise. They should have stuck to the drawn out torturous death as portrayed in the book.<br/><br/>And the control room was given way too much screen time. Just show us one or two scenes, and at least make the capital control room folk show a bit more realistic reaction to some of the harsh events they help cause in the games. Too black and white. Where's the gray?<br/><br/>There were some positives, though. Peeta's camouflage was awesome, and Woody's portrayal of Haymitch was delicious half the time. At other times, though, it seemed they made him too nice just to speed things up. But back to the positives, many scenes were exactly like I pictured it. And Lenny Kravitz was excellent as Cinna. I just wish his scenes weren't so rushed.<br/><br/>I really hope they dive into character development much more in the second movie - even if it makes the movie longer.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I do recommend the movie, especially if you read the books. Although Katniss's internal dialog is gone, Jennifer Lawrence does a great job of conveying her feelings with her eyes and actions. I just wonder what people who haven't read the books would miss."

In this open competition there are no weight classes or gender delineations, it's to the death and may the odds always be in your favor.<br/><br/>Good movies manipulate you and you don't even notice. Gary Ross made you think Seabiscuit was an underdog. Ross is a master manipulator and outstanding story teller.<br/><br/>So what if the rules of the game change and two from the same district can survive, until the rules change to ""just kidding"". So what if the hand of the state production company manipulates the tributes around the arena and arbitrarily adds elements; at least they weren't raptors or other dinosaurs that would have been laughable over the top.<br/><br/>It's a great time at the movies. There are outstanding performances. Jennifer Lawrence is perfect as Katniss. So what if Donald Sutherland is the Donald Sutherland of ""Start the Revolution Without Me"". Where else will you see Woody Harrelson with floppy blonde hair? See this mega-hit that will spawn a franchise. It empowers women. It works for audiences of all age groups, but the reigned in violence may not be appropriate for younger children. Hopefully our society has advanced enough that life will not imitate art and kids won't hunt kids because they got the idea from the movie."
"khtayn","8","2","7","27 March 2012"," This is a MOVIE, not ""BOOK ON THE SCREEN""
","I did not read the books before watching the movie, but I did know about the detailed plot, and fully expected the movie to suck purely based on the facts that a/it's based on a Young Adult book, b/ Liam Hemsworth is in it. But it didn't suck. As a MOVIE, it works wonderfully. After watching, I read the book itself, and understood why fans are enraged some key details were left out - but, really? You know this is a movie, right? If they were to cram everything in, it'd take 5 hours. They might need to explain more why the mockingjay pin is such a rebellious gesture, but other than that, all the choices made were for the sake of time, and worked out just fine. Violence off-screen, which leaves a lot to imagination, can sometimes be even more effective than direct depiction. And saying the movie is SLOW without actions or dialog? PLEASE! A movie is a series of IMAGES. The images should speak for themselves. I loved it that without the characters speaking much or quick cut of actions, we still get a lot - if we pay attention, and if our attention span is longer than 5 minutes. For example, we DID get the sense that Katniss was pretending to be in love with Peeta - heck, she received a freaking note from Haymich criticizing the kiss to be too light, only THEN she kissed Peeta some more. How is that not clear? If you value the quality of an image that speaks a thousand words, and believe cinema should be first about images, and a coherent script, rather than a rote transcription of a book, you should see this movie."
"michael-neichl-904-632888","7","2","7","27 March 2012"," But it could have been so easily 10
","First of all I have to say that I haven't read the hunger games, a friend told me that the movie just had a few changes but it would sum up the book pretty good.<br/><br/>Well I gonna start with the good things: The characters and actors. I was impressed by the between teen and adult actors they were really good, I felt really connected to each of them which is also because their characters were written very well it's great to see that the author obviously treats his audience/readers seriously and knows how to write clever teenagers who aren't just cardboard cutouts. Next the camera-work is pretty good although there is a lot of shaky cam, the length and the way the suspense is build up with it's sort of two half's was really great sort of a Kubrick like and overall I liked the idea But with the idea and story were my problems. Now keep in mind I haven't read the book and i didn't want my friends to tell me anything from the book so that I can only understand this universe by the movie and I think thats were some people gonna have the same complains as I have.<br/><br/>*I'm not gonna spoil anything, but give a short version of the beginning* First of all these are the 74th Hunger-Games is seriously anyone telling me that this ending NO SPOILER has never happened in 74 years? I mean these are still humans I just cant comprehend the fact that for over 74 years these hunger games happened just as they were planed without any problems caused by the competitors. Second these games *again no real spoiler but a basic info* as I understood were made to prevent a war of the districts. Exactly how is a tournament of kids from 12-18 going to prevent a war rather then forcing people to get mad at the government and system who made this happen? In the book its probably explained but again in the movie it stays as a plot hole, at least for me. There is also a little problem that would require me to spoil something but I think a review doesn't need spoilers to explain my thoughts.<br/><br/>All in all its a nice movie, definitely watchable and for smart teenagers a must see but in the end I feel like I really have to read the book in order to understand the world this story takes place in and thats kind of sad because with Harry Potter I could leave the books aside and enjoy the movies for what they are without feeling betrayed, with Hunger Games I know that I cant understand this universe enough."
"marckjoseph_daza","6","2","7","26 March 2012"," Has a lot of potentials but didn't show
","The Hunger Games was a good movie but not great. <br/><br/>With its genre, the audience should feel the fear of being in an unknown territory surrounded by blood-thirsty teenagers and the compassion as the characters develop throughout the story.<br/><br/>I haven't read the book so I don't know what the movie lacks or what elements were overrated but based on what I've watched; the story has something the movie wasn't able to show maybe because of the rating or maybe the people behind the camera are just ""playing safe.""<br/><br/>Because of the theme and genre similarity, people who have watched Battle Royale can't help but to compare the 2 but for some reasons, I can't say that The Hunger Games is a Battle Royale rip-off. <br/><br/>However, Battle Royale left me thinking; ""If I was there, how will I survive?"" while The Hunger Games left me thinking; ""If I was there, how will I change the game?""<br/><br/>The acting was nice and the main protagonist was true to her character; I especially liked how she showed her emotions with her eyes. The cheesy parts were forgivable and probably moved me if I'm 10 years younger.<br/><br/>Seeing Woody Harrelson as a mentor and a drunkard adds color to the movie's ""environment"" and I wasn't able to recognize Lenny Kravitz until the credits."
"Sergeant343","7","2","7","25 March 2012"," Does it live up to the hype?(Note: I have not read the books)
","The Hunger Games is the first in a series of Post-apocalyptic American novels written by Suzanne Collins starring Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson. The film begins in a place called district 12 where we are introduced to Katniss(Lawerence) and her sister Primrose(Willow Sheilds) getting ready for ceremony in which the government chooses one male and female from each district to fight to the death in the Hunger Games. Katniss' sister gets chosen, but she volunteers in her place and on the male side Peeta(Hutcherson) is chosen. They are then taken swiftly back the the extravagant capital and inevitably the games themselves, while developing a connection in the process.<br/><br/>The actors in the movie do a great job selling each characters, none really stands out as phenomenal. Now that doesn't mean somethings don't stand out, like for example Lawerence had to practice hundreds of times a day to learn how to shoot a bow and arrow, which is an impressive commitment to the role. The rest of the cast however, nothing really stands out as rememberable that someone else could have a hard time doing.<br/><br/>The production design for this film is outstanding, from the extravagant costumes and set pieces in the city. When we first see the city we see how superficial both the building designs and the clothing that people wear compared to that of district 12 which we have just seen and shows a complete disconnect between the citizens of the capital and the citizens of the districts. The best showcase of the design is the parade for those who are going to be in the games, in which it is hard to tell what is cgi and what is not. The best example of the costume design is when Kattnis is being interviewed by a late talk show host and she is wearing a lovely red dress the catches ""fire"" when she spins, although the effect is laughable it is still nice.<br/><br/>There are 2 big things that bring this movie down, which is the editing during fight scenes and lack characterization outside the main characters. Lets talk about the editing, good god, there were so many quick cuts that it became nauseating and made hard to tell exactly what was going on and quick moving camera when it is not being edited doesn't help much either. Now the lack of characterization would not have been too bad, if it wasn't for one character in particular whose death is played up like it is big and dramatic, but we only knew the character for less than a day, so it is hard to believe that Kattniss would develop such a connection only after sharing 2 scenes of dialogue. This movie would had benefited being 10-20 minutes longer to flesh out the character more. Several other nitpicks of mine include, what was the point of the mocking jay, since it is barely brought up in the story, what are the other districts like, because we really don't know, why was Peeta running around with the group from district 1 who were after Kattniss, but obviously didn't want to kill her and why didn't she bring that up when they caught up, they made a big deal out the sponsors, when she only got 2 drops anyway from their mentor, what was the point of the 3 finger salute, and how did the battlegrounds work other than ""it is sci-fi.""<br/><br/>Overall however I did enjoy this movie and was a fun time to watch, it just could used a bit more work to make it great, than just being just okay. 3.5/5 Rated PG-13 for intense violent thematic material and disturbing images."
"imafunkymonkey","7","2","7","25 March 2012"," I enjoyed it. But I'm young.
","I had read the books, and had fairly high expectations. Watched every sneak peek, interview, trailer, spoiler. But I would give it a good 7,just for a couple reasons. I definitely think they did an absolutely amazing job at the casting. Amazing. Gale was exactly what I expected. He had the looks, the voice, and the charisma I was expecting. Katniss was perfect in my mind, just like Jennifer Lawrence. She definitely had the characteristics I wanted to see in whoever was taking this large role. She had the eyes that you could see in every scene what she felt about it. In the book, it talked about she felt for Peeta, and she can't obviously just blurt it out. She is such an accomplished actress for so young and inexperienced. Peeta was played by one of my favorite actors, but I honestly and almost regrettably have to say that I didn't picture him as Josh Hutcherson. He didn't fit the whole ""Lover Boy"" status I had depicted in my mind. President Snow, Cinna, Caesar Flickerman; amazing job. <br/><br/>There were some scenes in the movie that were not satisfactory to me. Well they did the scenes the right way, but they didn't have a good time balance on the important scenes. I understand that you have to make some scenes longer so if you hadn't read the books, then you could understand. But they spent over the first half just in the training. The Book is called The Hunger Games not The Hunger Games training. The Games are the main part of the book, and seem to be overlooked by how much time was spent on that section of the movie. <br/><br/>I just think they should have gone more in depth into the characters. In the book, the unforgettable Cave Scene took up almost 100 pages. You really could see Katniss' and Peeta's characters almost melding together. You watched them get closer mentally, emotionally, and physically. She completely was his full service nurse to bringing him back from almost dead. She starts up this whole romance angle real well in the book. But in the movie, it's condensed into literally 10 minutes. They only kissed about 3 times in the whole movie, and in the book, just about 2 pages after the first kiss happened it states, ""...takes an hour of coaxing, begging, threatening, and yes, kissing..."" So she was off and on kissing him for an hour, just in that one hour blurb, and literally they included that side of the romance, twice? <br/><br/>And he isn't dying. Peeta has a bone-deep sword wound in his thigh, He is definitely in a lot of pain, don't get me wrong, but the movie didn't portray the urgency of the situation they were in. When Katniss had to go to the Cornucopia to get his medicine, they didn't explain that it was Blood poisoning that could be the cause of his death in literally the next 24 hours. The medicine cured his wound overnight, while in the book it wasn't this quickly and he wasn't out of his misery yet. <br/><br/>Cudos to whatever review I read this off of, but literally, if they would have added 20 minutes to the movie, it could have easily captured the emotional depth that happened between Katniss and Rue, Katniss and Peeta, Katniss and Haymitch. Literally 20 minutes.<br/><br/>And if somebody told me that the guy that decided to move the camera around so much was not mentally sane, I wouldn't doubt it in a second."
"audagy","7","2","7","25 March 2012"," Should not have been PG-13
","The Hunger Games wasn't as good as the book, but was still a decent movie. The roles were well cast and most of the acting was excellent. Tom Stern, director of photography, deserves to be shaken to death for his gross overuse of shaky-cam. If you're expecting to see intense action you will be disappointed: the film was censored to give it a PG-13 rating. Don't get me wrong, PG-13 movies can be great, but when the premise is 24 teenage gladiators fighting to the death, you can't make it PG-13 without detracting from the mood and thrills. Overall, I give this movie a 7/10 and would recommend watching it, but not before you read the book."
"megs-x","10","5","27","19 March 2012"," Leaves you panting for Catching Fire
","I'm the kind of girl who hates movie adaptations of my favourite books but I won a contest to go see The Hunger Games Canadian premiere and I was NOT disappointed. This movie was thrilling. It held all the emotion, the grim determination, the friendship/familial loyalty, the heart break, everything that was important to the series. I was hesitant in believing they could pull this off but the acting was superb. Jennifer Lawrence is marvelous at Katniss - she wears Katniss' strength, fragility, dignity and arrogance with an ease that is astounding. Josh Hutcherson is brilliant as Peeta and definitely holds his own against the powerhouse that is Lawrence on screen and Elizabeth Banks is unrecognizable as Effie. The director took the time to make this good for fans and non -fans alike."

","The first thing I can't believe is that considering how great this is I hadn't heard of it earlier than I did but either way I'm glad I decided to see it because it was absolutely worth it. What I really liked about it was the fact that it had everything in it, comedy (particularly from Woody Harrelson's character), romance between Katniss and Peeta, the action and also the sadness in it too when the character Rue died. Even I cried and that doesn't happen that often.<br/><br/>I know a lot of people complained about the shakiness of the camera but I'm pretty sure a lot of that was to cover up the above 12a violence since the film was mainly to attract kids and teens. Either way it didn't bother me at all and I loved it."
"SouthSideChgo","10","3","13","27 March 2012"," Will Leave You Hungry For More
","SouthSide, at first, was quite wary upon hearing there would be a movie adaption of Suzanne Collins' The Hunger Games since Hollywood has the tenacity for chopping books to add and/or delete material as it sees fit for the audience (see review for the americanized version of The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo for more clarity).<br/><br/>After seeing this movie, this reviewer thoroughly enjoyed how the screenplay was wonderfully crafted so that if you didn't get a chance to read the book (and SouthSide highly recommends that you do read the entire Suzanne Collins' series - way better than Twilight), you won't get lost during the nearly 2hr and 30 minute run time. Yes, some minor characters and/or details were either omitted, meshed together or added for this movie however the main important details still remained to easily follow as if you're reading the book itself on the big screen.<br/><br/>This reviewer liked how the screenwriters Suzanne Collins (who wrote the popular trilogy series) and Garry Ross (who also directed this movie) along with Bill Ray wonderfully capture the tense moments (especially during the scenes before The Reaping when Katniss and Prim are getting ready for it and at the start of the game) without any (or with a few words) of dialogue. This reviewer also liked how they captured the differing reactions from District 12 to The Capitol as well as the twenty-four tributes on the playing field during the countdown. One could easily sense the range of emotions from Katniss' nervousness (especially after being sealed inside the tube to reach the arena) as she stares at Cinna (Lenny Kravitz), her stylist to the celebratory party mood within The Capitol for the 74th running of The Hunger Games.<br/><br/>Special kudos to the set, art and cinematography direction of The Hunger Games for translating the opulent look and splendor of what this reviewer imagined The Capitol would look ...more kudos to costume designer Judianna Makovsky for raiding Lady Gaga's closet and cosplay wigs to flamboyantly dress the 1% of Panem in the most outrageous clothing designs from Effie's powdered face and expensive dress suits to making Cinna's fire costumes (in which Katniss and Peeta wear during the opening ceremonies) come to life.<br/><br/>There's one thing more why SouthSide recommends seeing The Hunger Games. Besides the strong female character portrayed by Jennifer Lawrence, the story's love triangle (between Peeta-Katniss-Gale) doesn't weigh down the movie (and book) so heavily compared to the other popularized teen series - Twilight. To be honest, love is the farthest thing on our heroine's mind. She's only determined to survive and (hopefully) win The Hunger Games ...not for herself or the honor of representing her home district but for her sister.<br/><br/>Overall, The Hunger Games - a very good adaptation of Suzanne Collins' book ...worth the price to see it on the big screen before it hits the DVD / Blu-Ray. SouthSide cannot wait to see the sequel - Catching Fire."
"soccermaster99999","10","3","13","25 March 2012"," Very Well Done!
","Considering that The Hunger Games is be one of the most difficult and complex books to make into a feature film, id say they did a great job. Little things where changed here and there, such as how Katniss gets the mockingjay pin, but overall the movie stayed true to the book. Some of the main scenes in the book were quite powerful, especially Rue's death. This scene brought me to tears. Overall they did a great job making a movie out of a very complicated book! The only con i noticed throughout the movie was the music. Don't get me wrong, the tracks were great but they were executed during the wrong scenes and I thought that could have been done better. But overall this was an AMAZING movie and I will be seeing it again and can't wait for Catching Fire! I highly recommend this movie to those of you who have read the books. If you have not read the book then i HIGHLY recommend you read it before you see the movie."

I have been looking forward to this movie ever since they announced that lionsgate had acquired the rights to make the film. That being said, I have been slightly dreading the release of the film because I was so afraid that they would butcher my favorite books ever. I am very, very happy to say that that did not happen! <br/><br/>My girlfriend made me read these books and I was not expecting to enjoy a book starring a 16 year old girl but suzzanne Collins is a genius and truly knows how to capture an audience's imagination. I was worried that lionsgate would be unable to do the same thing, even though I was ecstatic about the hiring of Jennifer Lawrence (she is an incredible actress!) I am glad to say that they completely blew me away! I have no idea why people are complaining about character development, they did an incredible job with that, and why they are saying katniss should have been skinnier; I would rather take a gorgeous and talented Jennifer Lawrence over some anorexic terrible actress like Kristen Stewart. and I loved the shaky camera, it makes you feel like you are right there in the action. Incredible movie, way to go Gary Ross and Co.! I intend to sere this movie many more times!"
"sheila-robinson14","10","3","13","25 March 2012"," Highly focused, intense and brilliant
","The Hunger Games trilogy by Suzanne Collins provides a very exciting, stirring read, engaging young adults – and now of course adults too – with major issues in today's world.<br/><br/>I saw The Hunger Games movie having read the trilogy a couple of years ago. I found the books compelling in their narrative of horrific events, in the end delivering several shocks with the deaths and betrayals of characters I liked, but also some ingenious turning points. I felt the final outcome could have been more redemptive / uplifting, especially in view of the epic forces of good and evil this story deals with.<br/><br/>The forces of evil in this hypothetical future America are spiralling decadence, selfishness, obsession with glamour, image and celebrity, and inhumanity – and looking at our own world, if these forces were to reach a certain pitch we can see they would indeed lead us to some such outcome as the Hunger Games. In Panem, the inhabitants of The Capitol revel in the ultimate reality TV, entertained by the violent deaths of randomly drawn teenage ""Tributes"" from the oppressed Districts. Those Capitol citizens behave just as the crowds did in the ampitheatres of Ancient Rome. The fact that the young people drawn by lot then sent out to fight to the death are first glamorised, feted and paraded in front of the cameras alongside an oily TV host, makes it even more chilling. Another strong motif is the vacuous sentimentality of the massed audience, leading them to gush at a possible love affair between the main protagonist Katniss and her fellow-tribute Peeta whilst being equally ready to watch them meet a horrible death at the whim of the Gamemakers under the merciless direction of their Chief, Seneca Crane.<br/><br/>What stood out for me in the movie was Katniss herself. Played by Jennifer Lawrence she was totally absorbing. Her compassion, her courage, her survival skills and her subtle resistance of the evil in which she was forced to take part shone out. The intense concentration on Katniss's every move in the Arena made me feel I was there with her. Our attention and our hopes were 100% on Katniss. The empathy and support she won from her allies Haymitch and Cinna also made a strong emotional impact.<br/><br/>The premise of the story, and narrative flow of the movie was highly unusual and intense. The cinema audience sat in silence throughout, a silence to match the silence behind the action for the first part of the film – save for a few moments in the last half of the film when emotional reactions were inevitable! Brilliant, unforgettable and a sharply-focused portrayal of some of the worst excesses of the western world taken to their logical conclusion."
"sildarmillion","10","3","13","25 March 2012"," Oh the Irony of the American Audience
","I considered dressing up for the Hunger Games. But as always, it would have took too much effort, so I didn't bother. Only after seeing pictures on Facebook about people going all out to dress up for this event, did it strike me. How ironic is it that there is so much effort to dress up for a movie that is critiquing this very culture?<br/><br/>Yes, the movie is a critique on entertainment culture and of mindlessly giving into this culture, especially the one on reality TV. The book is also critiquing this, but I was pleasantly surprised that the movie played up this critique. I afraid it would sell out and focus on the love triangle, which in my opinion was the biggest problem with the book. There was too much at stake to expect the reader to be invested in the love story. Yet the book really focuses on it. (I also disliked the characterization of Peeta in the book who went from very interesting to very boring, and you don't really get that in the movie, so points for the movie.) Everything about the trailers and billing Liam Hemsworth in the first three of the cast suggested they were going to play up the romance, but really, Gale was in like 5 minutes of this 2.5 hour movie.<br/><br/>The movie shifts its focus to the cruelty and inhumanity in Panem. It opens with the MC and the Gamemaker discussing the upcoming Games like they were discussing the upcoming football season. It was disgusting. <br/><br/>The movie shows you clips of life in District 12 - of complete and abject poverty. Ten minutes later we see the opulent life in the Capitol (where people dress like its Halloween and have completely given in to the entertainment culture). The contrast was jarring. (Btw, the shots of the Capitol and of the train traveling to the Capitol were breathtaking. Just saying.)<br/><br/>I applaud the filmmakers for bringing out these details. The book was so fast paced, I didn't get a chance to feel so revolted. The movie gave me some of the emotions the book didn't provide. The Reaping was terrifying. The book is from Katniss' perspective, and she wasn't terrified of the Reaping, having been to it several times already. But the movie shifts the focus to Prim at times, and she was trembling. I felt sick to the stomach as I looked at all these kids and realized what must be going on in their minds. If their name is picked, they are being sentenced to die.<br/><br/>Shifting the focus between Katniss and the Capitol was a good choice, because it would have been hard to otherwise convey Collins' gripping voice through Katniss' thoughts. The present tense narrative of the book is excellent and it works really well, but it's hard to translate that to film.<br/><br/>When we get to the Games themselves, the brutality was of course largely toned down. If they had went all out and made an R-rated film, it would have conveyed the inhuman nature of the Games much more effectively. But it did a good job as it is, and I don't know if I personally could have handled any more! The movie didn't need the actual brutality to stress me out - the context of the brutality was enough to make me want to stop watching.<br/><br/>Yet I wondered, did all this go over the audience's head? I was shocked when my theater clapped - clapped - when two of the Tributes were killed. (These were the two most brutal Tributes who were trained to kill, so yes, they were evil, but still!) Yes I know they clapped out of different emotions than the Capitol dwellers (who were clapping out of entertainment), but this is not something to go fangirly about - ""Yay Katniss did not die!""<br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence told the director at some point (or so I read in a magazine) that when Katniss killed someone, her face should not be bad-ass; it should be broken. ---> Respect. <br/><br/>I haven't cried or trembled this much at the movies since Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. But this was a whole new ball game. In Deathly Hallows I cried because it had been like watching your friends die - I grew up with those characters. But in the Hunger Games, I cried at the cruelty and I cried at the inhumanity. This is not a feel-good movie. Don't expect to come out happy. But if you do come out excited and talking about how Peeta wasn't tall enough, and that there was no passion in the love story (like I heard coming out of the movie), then I imagine the whole point of the movie must have gone over your head."

","I had nothing to do Thursday night. My friend called me and said lets go watch Hunger Game. I was like SO SO. Then i went to see it after much consideration. At midnight the theatre was half full. I took me by surprise because last time when i went to watch a movie on Sunday, there was not a single body there. But there was an environment so my expectation went high. After watching the movie. I had a so so feelings. Because, in the past there were many movies attempted that was based on survivor game, Just to name a few "" Condemned, Tournament"". So there was nothing special or new in the movie. The worst part of the movie is shaky camera just like ""found footage"" used in Cloverfield and Chronicle. It gave me a headache. But the best part of the movie is Acting and the conflict that may arise between the Trio in the future. The movie lacks development of character and dept. But overall, its a good movie worth watching once."
"deltafire1972","10","4","20","23 March 2012"," Possibly the movie of the year
","We went to see this earlier today. I did not know much on the movie or the books, but I was pleasantly surprised at what I saw.<br/><br/>The movie begins in District 12, showing the choosing of a boy and a girl to participate in the games. The main starlet, Katniss volunteers to compete after her sister is chosen in the raffle. It becomes clear she is both an accomplished huntress and has the survival skills to boot.<br/><br/>People will put down this film on the killing of children as part of the games. Let me make this clear. The movie blurred out the killing sequences save one, when Rhu takes a spear in the chest, and she dies in Katniss' arms as she is sung to sleep. This movie is no worse than the battle scenes from Harry potter and the Twilight series. If parents let their children see harry potter and Twilight, this movie should be safe for them.<br/><br/>As for action suspense and drama, The movie was intense, beautifully done, action packed. A secret crush becomes the driving force for survival. There were many tears shed in parts when the young girl died in Katniss' arms, a few screams from a surprise dog/hyena mix (not sure what it was).... Beyond that, if you can get past the purposefully blurred gory scenes, this movie is everything the hype predicted it would be. Action packed and all in all very entertaining.<br/><br/>This film is a must see for the cult action teens who love twilight and harry potter. Safe for all audiences as well (there were many children under age 13 who were perfectly fine in the movie). Like I said if you survived harry potter and Twilight, this movie is mild on violence.<br/><br/>Definitely a front runner for movie of the year. Top 5 for sure."
"phillipjolyrocks","10","4","21","22 March 2012"," People think this is the next Twilight; Sorry folks, but this is the next Academy Award nominee for 2013
","I just saw the Hunger Games, and I have to say, I'm utterly impressed. I'm an avid book fan, having read everything from Jane Austen to Twilight, and since the Hunger Games series is one of my personal favourites, I was eagerly waiting for this day for three whole years. And it didn't fail me. The acting was brilliant; Katniss was bold and Jennifer Lawrence's acting chops were truly displayed in the more emotional scenes. You could sense her fear and nervousness when she was about to enter the arena, when a character died or in all the big moments of her character. She's the highlight of this film and a delight to watch; such an honest, human performance that surpasses expectations. Josh Hutcherson as Peeta was adorable, kind, honest and sweet. He exudes a natural air of confidence, but his character's vulnerability was portrayed perfectly. Willow Shields was lovely as Prim, as was Amandla Stenberg as Rue. Alexander Ludwig, Isabelle Fuhrman, and Leven Rambin were fearsome and brilliant in their roles as Cato, Clove and Glimmer respectively. Moreover, I loved Woody Harrelson as Haymitch from the first moment he spoke. He was funny, and brought a beautiful balance to Elizabeth Banks's Effie. I loved the direction and the special effects. Some scenes, especially the ones involving fire, were impossibly realistic and powerful. I loved every little bit of it.<br/><br/>My honest opinion? A perfectly casted film, with a magnificent director and great special effects. I've loved this series for so many years that now, it feels brilliant to finally be able to watch what I've envisioned in my head so many times. I truly wish this would be nominated for an Academy Award; if any film deserves it, it's this one. There's nothing bad about it."

","The movie was awesome, it actually seemed very short and not nearly as long as it is, acting was perfect all around, story was great and so was the effects - couldn't find a single thing wrong with this movie, but i must admit i have never read the books - so their could be something missing from the books, but the movie was great. If I should say a negative thing then it would be that their could have been more information prior to the hunger games, what started it and how it evolved also some more background on Katniss - its rushed a bit i think - anyways tucci, Jennifer, harrelson and Josh deliver very convincing performance - so all in all just a great night at the cinema."

","I am a massive fan of the books, and to be honest, when I heard it was going to adapted into a film, I was both excited and also a bit hesitant. The Hunger Games Trilogy is my favourite series of all time; I found inspiring, as well as entertaining.<br/><br/>I went to the midnight screening, and the theatres were absolutely buzzing with excitement. Everyone screamed and cheered to support Katniss, or their favourite character. It was also clearly distinguishable between the rivalry of 'Team Gale' and 'Team Peeta'. But when the curtains were finally drawn open at midnight, the audience lost themselves in the film.<br/><br/>The movie stayed truly loyal to the vision of the books, from the Capitol to the citizens of the Capitol; the crazy costumes, the fiery dresses and the wacky facial hair were all spot on. It was exciting to see the Games from other people's points of view in the districts, the Gamemakers, Haymitch, and even President Snow himself.<br/><br/>The plot was fast-paced, yet it didn't feel rushed at all. It captured the essence of every location, and didn't allow a single second for you not to swept away in the scene. There were touches of dry humour which lets the audience relax. There are moments where you can laugh, heart-wrenching scenes where you feel like crying, and times so sweet its all you can do to go 'awwwww'.<br/><br/>The casting impressed me; Jennifer Lawrence was stunning as Katniss, her acting was superb. I think that she was perfect for the role, as well as Josh Hutcherson as Peeta. He was exactly suited for a cute yet potentially deadly baker's son. They both had a lot of chemistry and tension in their scenes together. The build up to their kiss was totally perfect.<br/><br/>Overall, I was so happy how Gary Ross had made the film; it was everything I had imagined and so much more. I'm crazy all over the Hunger Games again, and have recommended it to anyone who would listen. True entertainment. 10/10"
"cultfilmfreaksdotcom","10","3","14","27 March 2012"," The Running Girl Makes Good
","As a herd of children and teens are gathered for the selection of two players one boy and one girl who will fight to the death against 23 others on live TV resulting in one sole survivor, they're shown a short film explaining why this kind of thing happens.<br/><br/>Set in a post-apocalyptic world, the Capitol needs these violent games as a reminder of hope and spirit, or something like that. Doesn't make too much sense, and the premise borrows from THE RUNNING MAN while the goofy looking adults – including the show's host and backers – resemble characters from the Willy Wonka universe. But the grownups aren't the thing here.<br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence plays Katniss Everdeen, a teenage bow-and-arrow huntress who bravely offers herself as a replacement for her lithe younger sister to take part in The Hunger Games. She, along with the male selection, Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) – whose meek disposition clashes with Katniss's steady prowess – are sent to a big futuristic city: a much different world than their rural district.<br/><br/>During the training process we get to know both characters... while the adults (especially a snarky talk show host) provide exposition to make things clear. The story doesn't rush to the titular game, allowing the viewer, like the characters, to feel involved in the initial process that – while leading to a death sport with inevitably dire consequences – is filled with suspense, melancholy, and even hope as Katniss remains a constantly evolving character, learning to charm the show's viewing audience.<br/><br/>And when the Games are underway, we're thrust from an intentionally vapid society into a sparse brutal wilderness. Centering on Katniss and her skills to survive especially when teamed against by a group of cutthroat players she eventually bonds with Peeta – and the Shakespearean love story doesn't mar the action. Especially thanks to Jennifer Lawrence, who makes one of the greatest cinematic female heroes for the teen set. With narrowed eyes and swift agile, her natural beauty's matched by cunning resilience while her pale vulnerability keeps us hoping she survives.<br/><br/>Filmed mostly in closeups and tense medium shots, THE HUNGER GAMES is replete with twists, turns and backstory only readers of the popular novels can fully understand – but the characters are everything here. It's their tale. It's their fight. And we're just along for the ride.<br/><br/>For More Reviews: www.cultfilmfreaks.com"
"dfranzen70","9","3","14","25 March 2012"," Perfect performance by Lawrence, and an exciting movie to boot
","I was very impressed with The Hunger Games. Sure, you have to suspend a little bit of logic, and the great old tradition of a dystopian future is revived, but overall it's an excellent film with terrific camera-work and editing and a knockout performance by the soon-to-be-a-huge-star Jennifer Lawrence.<br/><br/>So there was this big war, and the world was divided into 12 districts, and as a reminder of its vicious past the Capitol decreed that each district send two children, ages 12-18, to participate in a fight to the death. Somehow this is to remind them of not only their past but humility and the fact that they're likely to die young. But it seems like a post-apocalyptic society with a blend of technology and rustic charm, so who knows. Anyway, 24 kids, chosen randomly at ceremonies called Reapings, and it's all a Big Deal. They've been doing it for almost three-quarters of a century.<br/><br/>District 12 is a hardscrabble, coal-mining community whose mine blew up. So people are pretty destitute. They (barely) live off the land. When the Reaping comes, Primrose Everdeen and Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) are chosen. Poor Prim's just a little girl, so her older sister Katniss (Lawrence) volunteers in her place. This has apparently never happened before, which seems implausible, but you can go with it.<br/><br/>The two Tributes are then taken to the capitol city, where they are judged and evaluated in order to gain sponsors; sponsors can help you when you're in the middle of the forest. Preparing Katniss and Peeta for the Games is Haymitch Abernathy (Woody Harrelson), who's actually won the games and can offer advice, and Cinna (Lenny Kravitz) whose job it is to make the two Tributes look good when being presented in the parade and the talk show and so on and so on. And then the games begin.<br/><br/>Imagine you're in the middle of a field within a semicircle containing 23 other young people. Some of them are athletic. Some are tiny and may never have left the house. Some have been preparing their entire lives. There is a cache of weaponry and food near the semicircle. Your mission is to survive longer than everyone else. You're under a lot of stress already, and now it really sinks in - you will certainly have to kill one or more of those you see, kids with whom you have no quarrel. Kill or be killed, as they say.<br/><br/>The entire Games takes place in a huge climate-controlled dome. In fact, everything can be created/controlled, including fire and animals. As in the TV series Survivor, some of the kids form alliances, led by alpha males. Katniss isn't that kind of creature. She doesn't even want to be there. Who does? The ones who have been training all their lives, of course. <br/><br/>The cinematography is riveting. It's sometimes tough to get a read on a situation when all you see are people running through the woods, close up. Not here. The director of photography, Tom Stern, does a miraculous job of keeping us in the story, involved with the main characters, without losing the edge of heart-racing action. <br/><br/>I thought Lawrence was amazing in her gritty performance in Winter's Bone. This cements, in my mind, her standing as a tremendous talent. She is perfect for this role; her Katniss is tenacious, willful, and both terrified and determined. She's a skilled archer (has to be back home in order to find any food) but lacks a certain, shall we say, charm. Although she's not unattractive, she never smiles, seems resentful, and as a result is tough to get along with. Before the games, anyway. Through the tutelage of Cinna and Abernathy, she's able to show enough grace and poise to win some people over.<br/><br/>It's a knockout performance. Sure, you're supposed to be rooting for her anyway, even though she isn't the underdog in the fight. She's the one with the compelling backstory - young sister and distant mother at home, father killed in mine accident. She has a lot to fight for. Lawrence can evoke respect and fear just by her expressive eyes. And, of course, the role itself is physically very demanding, and she's well up to the task. But Lawrence's great skill here is in engaging the audience to the point where even if they believe she will win, they desperately want to know how she'll accomplish it. Will she kill? Will she not kill someone? (Remember, only one can survive.)<br/><br/>I like it when movies that seem to have a certain predictability about them - a predetermined finale, for example - throw in a twist that makes perfect sense but still isn't really foreseeable. As long as a seismic character change doesn't occur (such as a ""good"" person very suddenly becoming ""bad"" to further the plot), this is a welcome change - and it's tough to do. Big praise to The Hunger Games for throwing in twists that weren't laughable and to leaving the ending a little open ended in some regards. Not all loose ends are tied up. They often aren't in real life, either.<br/><br/>So, as long as you don't closely question the movie's overall premise, you'll be very pleased with this film. It's well acted all around, immaculately shot and edited, and has intense, action scenes that will leave you as exhausted as the participants."
"rgkarim","8","3","14","23 March 2012"," Does It Satisfy Your Hunger?
","On this hot day I decided to cool off by going to my favorite thing of all time, that's right a movie. This week's flick I decided to check out was the Hunger Games, the movie based on Suzanne Collins' book. Now despite the international sensation that is the book, I wondered just how well the movie would live up to the hype and excitement that has built up over the past few months. Right now I'll tell you it is a decent movie, but for me did not live up to the craze. <br/><br/>Perhaps the first thing I should say in this movie is how spot on the acting was for every character. As we saw in X-Men first class, Jennifer Lawrence's acting ability is incredible and very believable. Lawrence seems to have a knack for playing classic characters, and she managed to fill the very big shoes of the main character Catniss. Starring opposite of her is Josh Hutcherson who plays Peeta. Hutcherson was a good pick for this role as his work in the past has required him to play that quiet, awkward, nice boy who seems to get caught in the most unfortunate situations and still come out okay. The duo seemed to have a natural chemistry for their roles, and their interactions mirrored what they read in the book. The mentors of Cinna (Lenny Kravitz) and Haymitch (Woody Harrelson) were also well done. Harrelson in particular captures the drunk, desperado quite well, yet portrays the concerned and caring tutor at the same time. It still surprises me how much of a chameleon he is as well. As for the other contestants, the casting did their jobs well and managed to select the right people in both look and attitude, especially Rue (Amandla Stenberg). Yes there are plenty of other actors to mention, but I only have limited space so I'll end this part with saying Stanley Tucci) was the perfect choice for Caesar, and his cheesy smile fit right in with the setting. <br/><br/>But Robbie did they stick close to the story? Yes, they did, for the most part anyway. The crew in charge of this movie managed to adapt the book well, especially with the scenes and sequences focusing on the games. A lot of the man vs. nature element, or in this case woman vs. nature is captured with the camera work in the right angles to make one feel as if you were right there with Catniss. Most of the character interactions are shown as well, though a few of the extra actors have some laughable moments where they overact. What the movie lacks from the book however is a lot of the memories and internal thoughts that Catniss has, which as we know is kind of what the book focuses on. Parts where she is sitting in a tree, combing through the woods, or even sitting in a cave were a little less interesting without realizing what was going on in her head. Had they had that internal conflict it would have probably brought a little more understanding to some of the scenes, but again it's a movie and there is only so much more you can do. <br/><br/>What else do I have to say about this movie? Well for one thing let's talk about the action. Depending on what you consider good action will determine whether or now you are impressed with this movie. Those looking for exciting, fast paced, weapon on weapon action will not be impressed with this movie as there is very little combat between the contestants. The little amount of combat there is a little difficult to follow, as the camera shows only glimpses of the fighters as it zooms around like a chicken with its head cut off. I suppose this is to avoid showing graphic kills on young kids, which is a good thing, but if that were going to be the approach I would have just skipped this scene. However, those who are looking for more the survival action and clever use of environment for killing, will be satisfied with this movie. Regardless of the action, the pace of the movie is good, not too fast and not too slow. All of the emotions you read in the book are in the film as well, and there were plenty of times I saw the audience quiver, cry, and cringe at the various scenes in the movie.<br/><br/>To wrap this up, Hunger Games is a good movie that is definitely one of the better book adaptations I have seen in a while. With its fantastic acting, beautiful scenery, and accurate representation of the book, this film definitely deserves some attention. However, it still wasn't worth the hype for me and still has some things I missed from the book. Action wise it was okay, but again I'm more for fast paced action as opposed to the survival action seen in this movie. My final scores for this movie are as follows:<br/><br/>Action/Sci-fiction: 7.0-7.5 Movie overall: 8.0<br/><br/>I would say it's worth a trip to the theater and a good movie to see with friends, significant others, or even by your self. Until next time though this is Robbie K signing out."
"whitecoffee7","8","3","14","23 March 2012"," Good movie but the book is a masterpiece!
","Last night i went to see the movie which i was expecting like crazy after i read the books. To my personal opinion the 1st book is an absolute masterpiece so i had a lot expectations from the movie. From the very firest second it was obvious that they would go it by the book. Very good location, very good actors and actresses. Jennifer is amazing as Katniss, same goes to Josh and Liam! Speaking in generally i'd say that for someone who is fan of Hunger games the movie is good enough but i have a huge objection about the script. Very weak script. First of all i think they shouldn't change the way Katniss got her pin. Secondly they forfeit the best lines from Peeta and Haymich. Lines such as Haymich's Stay alive and Peeta's You came here to finish me off sweetheart?, should remain while it's not clear if there's a romance between Peeta and Katniss cauz in movie it's Haymich who's throws the idea to Seneka in order to protect katniss. Despite the negative points you still feel the spirit of the book, while everyone, from first to the last cried at Rue's death scene! You could hear people whipping...So, just go for it and may the odds ever be for movie's favour!"
"caseynicholson","10","2","8","17 November 2014"," This Film Continues to Impress Me with Each Viewing
","I recently watched the first installment of ""The Hunger Games"" again in preparation for the upcoming third movie in the series. This was my third viewing of the movie, having first seen it in the theater and then having watched it once again before its ""Catching Fire"" sequel.<br/><br/>That said, this most recent screening convinced me further that this movie is something really special. And I say that as someone who was very slow to warm up to the franchise at all. I almost didn't go see the film when it was in theaters in 2012, simply because the subject matter sounded gross and silly to me. That was partially due to a misconception. I had heard that the film was about a group of teens that are forced to kill one another, and it is indeed just that. However, I mistakenly took the title of the film to mean that there was also cannibalism involved, which there is not. In fact, the title is a bit misleading, as the ""hunger"" aspect of things doesn't play a major role in the plot of the film.<br/><br/>That said, the film is actually very far from anything of the horror genre, and certainly is not a gory ""torture porn"" flick in the style of some popular horror movies of the last decade (""Hostel""; ""Saw""). Instead, what we have here is a dystopian story that blends sci-fi with fantasy, all while staying relatively down to earth. The characters are human and relatable, even while the plot is far fetched.<br/><br/>In fact, the out there aspect of the film's plot is perhaps the biggest hurdle one might face in enjoying it. When I first saw the film, it was the bizarrely unbelievable element that was hardest for me to appreciate. In summary, far off in the future (or perhaps on a different planet--we're not really told if this is the earth we know), a peasant revolt against a ruling class of nobility is ultimately squashed. The punishment for the revolt is mass enslavement coupled with a grotesque annual bloodsport in which contestants are drafted from the country's various ""districts"" to compete in a winner-takes all fight to the death. We soon learn that this contest is televised and seems to be mandatory viewing for the entire population, and that the event has been going on for 74 years now as a yearly reminder of the cost of the rebellion.<br/><br/>That scenario is hard to appreciate if you tend to not appreciate fantasy, and as such the film suffers from a similar problem that other films in the dystopian genre suffer from. Films like ""Red Dawn"", ""V for Vendetta"", and ""Clockwork Orange"" all ask us to suspend critical thought for a moment so that we can imagine life in a strange world where common sense seems to have fallen by the wayside. ""The Hunger Games"" is no different, and it can be hard to imagine a world that works so strangely as the one Katniss finds herself in. But then again, common sense doesn't always reign in the world we actually live in, and perhaps that's part of what makes stories like this so popular.<br/><br/>Whatever the case, once you get past the oddity of the plot, the film is a masterpiece. Granted, it's a masterpiece in a very different way than classic films might be. It would be wrong to assume that ""The Hunger Games"" is the same sort of film as ""The Godfather"" or ""Gone With the Wind"". But ""Hunger Games"" nevertheless is masterpiece material in the way that it draws you into its bizarre world. The film both tells its story convincingly, but also makes you care about its characters in a way that is rare. You empathize with the characters in the film, in spite of their world and their situation being so very different from your own.<br/><br/>All that said, I've given this film a 10/10. I really think that in twenty years time, this film will stand out as an icon of its genre, perhaps akin to the way the ""Terminator"" films stand out for those of us who are children of the 80's. It's certainly worth your time to watch this film. So, go watch it.....and may the odds be ever in your favor!"
"hoxjennifer","9","2","8","9 November 2014"," Pleasantly surprised!
","I'm not one to jump on the bandwagon, so when all the hype about the Hunger Games books and movies came about, I wasn't eager to delve into it. It took me 2 years since the release of the first movie to actually watch it - and I was pleasantly surprised. (Keep in mind, I haven't read the books, but I did have a general understanding of it.) <br/><br/>I can't comment on the accuracy of the movie-book adaptation, but as someone that hasn't read the books - yes there were a few question marks going through my mind at some points - but overall, I felt that the movie conveyed the subject matter effectively and was easy to understand. I got the general sense of the movie - and I knew there were questions to be answered, but I also knew that there would be sequels to the first that might answer my questions. The acting was superb, costume and makeup absolutely stunning (the portrayal of people in the Capitol had always intrigued me) - and I saw some comments about the shaky camera...I watched this on a small screen, so it didn't affect my viewing experience. I think it was appropriate for conveying a sense of urgency in this movie and showing Katniss' perspective while not detracting too much from the movie itself.<br/><br/>I found myself really wanting to read the books and reading up on the Hunger Games universe to know more about the world itself. If a movie- book adaptation can make me want to know more about the book, having not read it first-hand, I think it's a job well done."
"KatieB181997","8","2","8","18 October 2014"," Great adaptation of one of my favourite book series
","I don't know why this film got so much criticism when it first came out. I was in the middle of reading the first book when I saw the film and I wasn't expecting to enjoy it but I can say that it was much better than what I expected. Of course it doesn't include 100% of the book but then again which book adaptations do? The plot is set in the distant future where every year a male and a female between the ages of 12 & 18, from each of the 12 districts, are sent to fight to the death in the 'Hunger Games' to win money and food for their district. When Katniss Everdeen's younger sister gets picked to fight, she volunteers in her place. There are very talented actors in this film. One who stands out to me is Jennifer Lawrence, who plays Katniss. I had never heard of Jennifer before so this is the first film I had seen her in and in my opinion, she is the perfect person to play Katniss. Josh Hutcherson, who plays Peeta Mellark, is also great in this. At first, I didn't expect him to be so good, as I had seen him in his other films and I thought him more of a comedic actor but I was wrong. Both Jennifer and Josh understood their roles and showed it perfectly. Gary Ross is also a good director and knew exactly who and what he wanted in his film which is important in directing. If you want a better understanding of this film, I would suggest you'd read the books written by Suzanne Collins. They're the main reason why I love this film so much. I would recommend this film to fans of action and adventure as this film is full of it."
"rawiri42","9","2","8","15 October 2014"," Wow!
","My title sums this movie up. I haven't read the books but I notice from other reviewers who have that the film is an excellent graphic portrayal of the original work of fiction so I will accept that as fact.<br/><br/>The story is bizarre in that a nation could tolerate such a barbaric pseudo-entertainment for 74 years without someone putting a stop to it but then this is fiction! The change to the rules after 74 years is, to say the least, fortunate - particularly for Peeta (Josh Hutcherson).<br/><br/>Again, another reviewer said that Panem is supposed to be a futuristic version of the USA and that didn't surprise me at all. The CIA has been manipulating both domestic and international affairs for decades and so the manipulation of what is supposed to be a straightforward competition didn't surprise me one bit. Unfortunately for them though, Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) was just that bit too smart for them - even right at the very end.<br/><br/>All the actors played their roles excellently although probably the most experienced of them all, Donald Sutherland was, I felt, a bit flat. But, of course, that may be how the writer and director wanted him to be - although, if it was, why use such a capable actor? <br/><br/>One question that comes to mind is, if Panem is supposed to be the world of the future, can we look forward to going back to almost Elizabethan pompery with ridiculous wigs, make up and facial hair for the gentry and poverty for the working classes? If so, I hope I don't live that long!<br/><br/>A gripping movie that I will watch more than once again."
"freeist","8","2","8","19 July 2013"," Very faithful adaptation actually supplements the book.
","""The Hunger Games"" seemed a natural book for a movie. Written by Suzanne Collins, the book was already cinematic. Still, Hollywood is full of egos trying to one-up each other in creativity, and this usually spells doom for book adaptations.<br/><br/>Fortunately, director and screen writer Gary Ross was wise not to tamper with the book's winning formula. The plot: a female teen protagonist, Katniss Everdene (Jennifer Lawrence) living in an impoverished dystopia is forced to participate in an annual gladiatorial games against twenty-three other teens. It had vivid characters from Katniss on down, her ally, Peeta, their mentor, the disturbed but sympathetic Hamish and all the other characters minor and major. It had great action, it had depth, and had social commentary with the contestants having to gain sponsors while murdering each other on camera. The plot, the characters, are almost exactly what you find them in Collin's work. If you hadn't read it, you can pick up the story fresh from the movie and miss almost nothing.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, the movie isn't limited, as the book is, to Katniss' first person account. Ross takes advantage of this and shows you what's happening out of the Katniss' sight. All of his additions improve the story and give it a wider scope. You could vividly see this society operating around Katniss, and it is one of the best futuristic depictions I've seen since Blade Runner.<br/><br/>I did have a few small quibbles with it. The film started out a little too weepy.I thought of Katniss as more stoical and I don't remember the beginning being so wet. The movie needed make the audience like her as soon as possible, I guess, but it really does lessen the impact of the tears later on, when the character does have a real tragedy to cry about.<br/><br/>My other quibble was with President Snow (Donald Sutherland). There was nothing wrong with Sutherland's performance, but his character seemed more like Colonel Sanders than Josef Stalin. People didn't respond to him with the restrained terror that would have sent the message about him home.<br/><br/>I disagreed with those creative decisions, though it's probably only my preference. However, I highly recommend this movie. It's a rarity: well conceived and thoughtful action adventure."

","I love the Hunger Games because it is one of the most original films I have come across. Jennifer Lawrence plays Katniss very well, especially in the part where Rue died. She sang the lullaby very well, even though she said that she was a horrible singer. You could easily believe that Katniss and Prim were sisters in real life, as in Jennifer Lawrence and Willow Shields looked exactly like they were sisters. I could easily have seen the Hunger Games 10 times and still love it every time. Isabelle Fuhrman played Clove very well, what I also found was that Katniss and Clove were alike in the way they looked and their personalities were also alike. What many people thought was that Clove and Katniss must have both volunteered because Careers always volunteer,while Katniss volunteered for her sister Prim."

","What ""The Hunger Games"" depicts is so realistic that the movie itself seems redundant: a society divided between the haves and have-nots, a major event to pacify the masses, and violence used as entertainment (with people desensitized to the inhumanity therein). It reminded me of Norman Jewison's ""Rollerball"", which also depicts an ultra-violent sport that constitutes the entertainment in a totalitarian future.<br/><br/>The movie itself isn't any kind of masterpiece, but it should force the viewer to stop and think for a minute. Much like Fritz Lang's ""Metropolis"", it poses the question of how any society came to be what it is: everything may look fine and dandy, but how authentic is it? <br/><br/>I had never heard of the series until the first movie came out (and that weekend I went to see the Polish movie ""In Darkness""). Now that I've seen it, I can solemnly recommend it."

","When a friend mentioned to me a trilogy of novels that she'd recently gotten into—yes, Brittany, I'm talking about you!—I didn't know what to think. These books (the first of which is titled The Hunger Games) were an odd mixture of teen romance, brutal gladiator-style death match, and satire of the widening gap that separates those of us who are wringing as much out of every paycheck as we can with those who own toilets made out of solid gold. Okay, so that's an exaggeration, but I quickly discovered something about these novels that seemed to appear out of nowhere and take popular culture by storm: they're great.<br/><br/>I mean that. Even though I might have a quibble with a plot point here and some piece of character development there, The Hunger Games series as an intelligent—and often stark—exploration of the reality TV culture that defines our society.<br/><br/>Fast forward two (or so) years. It was inevitable that the books would be turned into movies, and the world held its breath as news of controversial casting choices and what appeared to be questionable alterations to the fabric of the source material surfaced. And here we are: the movie has been released, the dust has settled, and we've been given the opportunity to lay our eyes upon the finished product. And guess what. It's great.<br/><br/>For director Gary Ross and everyone else involved, they were working with a story so crisp—so inherently engaging—that the whole thing seemed to be a paint-by-numbers affair. If they could stick to the narrative and add in a little directorial flair when the occasion called for it, everything would be just hunky dory.<br/><br/>For better or worse, that's exactly what they've done. Some people might complain about the implementation of the ""shaky cam"" technique employed for the full duration of the two and half hour film, but I found that it to add to the sense of dread that's expertly built from the very first scene. When we're introduced to the twisted world inhabited by the evil Capitol and the corresponding Districts (who exist only to provide said Capitol with resources to keep it going), it's clear that The Hunger Games is a good old-fashioned David-versus-Goliath death match with clear lines drawn between the good guys and the bad.<br/><br/>And the conflict proceeds just as it should. It's a fast-paced, gladiator style bloodbath that keeps its audience coiled in their seats. Even if you've read the novels you're still waiting for some of the marquis moments from the story to unfold just as you'd imagine them (and, familiarity or not, most of them turn out to be just as shocking as the first time you re-read the same paragraph over and over to try and process what you've just seen was actually taking place).<br/><br/>Success though it is, The Hunger Games isn't flawless. For my taste, Haymitch isn't portrayed as the binge drinker that I'd envisioned (he's an alcoholic, sure, but he seems a little too I don't know ""with it""), and a few scenes seem to have scaled back for the sake of keep the runtime reasonable. Of particular note is Katniss' introduction in the Capitol; the grandiose spectacle described in the book turns out to be little more than a fleeting ""hurrah."" The final moments in the arena also feel somewhat rushed.<br/><br/>Still, there's emotional gravity to spare, and even the stoniest heart will find him/herself practicing the three-finger salute on the way home from the theater.<br/><br/>The future of the franchise seems to be in good hands, and I'm primed and ready for Catching Fire to be developed. If The Hunger Games is any indication, it'll be one of the great sci-fi/action sequels to come along in the last few years."

","I will preface by saying I am not a kid, and also, I am a science fiction fan. That means that on the one hand, I would not be entranced by the ""youth-oriented"" aspects of the film but on the other hand, I am open to fantasy story lines. On that note, I would say that the whole setup is preposterous to the ""nth degree"" and seems to be a pretext for mayhem. In that sense it is like all the post-apocalypse films which essentially use that as an excuse for all sorts of fantasy exploits. For example, in the first Mad Max it was never explained as to what the heck had happened to Australia to allow for the anarchic situation. Hunger Games, too, is unsatisfyingly sketchy and non-credible in attempting to explain its setup. Once we accept it, however, and can ""get on with it,"" I felt the movie was extremely well-done. The casting of Katness was perfect, as she could carry the weight of the role, and since I figured that it would not be *******SPOILER***********possible for the sympathetic heroine to cold-bloodedly kill the other youngsters I kept trying to figure out how it would resolve given the directed for only one survivor. The futuristic sets, costumes, etc. were very well done, as was the whole ""steam punk"" look to it.

But they have struck gold here for what is a very modest price - well under $100 million when the average blockbuster is more than twice that. Even the special features DVD commentary admits that it turned out far better than anyone expected.<br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence's performance as Katniss Everdeen has to be the breakthrough of the year. Faced with the impossibility of transferring her lengthy monologues from the book, the film instead uses facial expressions quite brilliantly - the selfish contempt she feels for her mother, the shock when she sees Peeta with the Career Tributes - it's all there.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is exceptional too - my personal favourite being the district 12 mentor Haymitch who is portrayed much more sympathetically than the book - and in greater detail. We get to see his shrewd machinations that save Katniss on multiple occasions.<br/><br/>And of course, no review is complete without mentioning the glorious scene near the end where you actually feel sorry for Cato, as he finally realises he's just an expendable fairground attraction, ""one more kill, it's the only thing I know how to do"".<br/><br/>In contrast to other films of this type, Hunger Games is quite chilling in its realism because what was portrayed has in fact happened before. In ancient Rome, children were forced to fight as gladiators, in front of a crowd who bet on the outcome."

Until they fight each other to death, the rule is kill or be killed.<br/><br/>The story of the film is really well thought out.

","""The Hunger Games"" was an amazing movie, the director (Gary Ross) had amazing ideas, and they picked great actors. ""The Hunger Games"" was a well-funded movie, they spent tons of time and money working on this movie. ""The Hunger Games"" is based off of a book written by Suzanne Collins. ""The Hunger Games"" is just the first book in is series, there will be more movies coming later on.<br/><br/>""The Hunger Games"" is based off a book and was written by Suzanne Collins and was sold to millions. It became a top seller, Suzanne Collins also wrote many other books such as, ""Gregor the Overlander"", and Fire Proof. Suzanne Collins made about $12 million off of the hunger games alone. She also helped in making ""The Hunger Games"" movie, so the movie was more accurate to the books than if the author wasn't helping. <br/><br/>The director chose good actors to play in ""The Hunger Games."" They chose Jennifer Laurence for the main character, Katniss. They also chose Josh Hutcherson to be Peeta Mellark. They both have played in other movies, so they have the experience being in movies.<br/><br/>There are more movies to come, for those who loved ""The Hunger Games."" Since Suzanne Collins wrote two more books called, ""Catching Fire"" and ""Mocking Jay."" Those two other books are going to come out a movies later on. ""The Hunger Games"" made about $155 million, so the next movies are destined to make that much, or even more.<br/><br/>Some people say that you have to read the book to make the movie seem good but, the movie stood out on its own. I read the book, and there were some differences between the book and the movie, but you don't have to read the book to make the movie good.<br/><br/>Did you think the movie was good, well funded, and had good actors? If you watch the movie before you read the book, you should read the book after so you can get into the rest of the series. In the future, when the rest of the movies come out, they probably will make over $1 billion dollars, looking at how much money they made in ""The Hunger Games."""

","""The Hunger Games"" was a great movie, that could use some little fixes. I'm a magnificent fan of ""The Hunger Games"" because I've read all three of the books twice. I liked the actors, the story line, and the action scenes.<br/><br/>Essentially, I thought the actors fit the role immaculate for the people I imagined in my head as I was reading the books. Jennifer Lawrence did a great job for Katniss in my opinion, I think she is a very great actress. I also really liked Josh Hutcherson as Peeta, he did very well at the romantic scenes with Katniss. The director, Garry Ross did a great job finding a great cast.<br/><br/>Additionally, the story line has a very good plot. The movie follows the book fairly well. Although, the concept is pretty morbid it's still a very intreging movie. A well known quote from the movie and book is ""May the odds be ever in your favor"" Effie Trinket. <br/><br/>However, the movie could have used a higher budget. The camera work wasn't so great, but they still had some great scenes and the camera work was fine. Over all the movie is really great. <br/><br/>Furthermore, the action scenes were Exquisete. Garry Ross did a good job of capturing the action scenes from the book. Nevertheless, the books scenes were a little more gruesome; but I think the director made a good decision by making the action scenes in the movie less gruesome than the books action scenes. <br/><br/>Moreover, how did you like the hunger games? I thought It was a great and I hope you liked it too. I recommend you read the books, because I enjoyed them undoubtedly well. I can't wait for the next movie, ""Catching Fire"" to come out November 23, 2012."

Already knowing what happens, I thought I'd get bored after half an hour -- but I really didn't! It's a great film, and thoroughly entertaining. The cast is fantastic, with talented Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss Everdeen, experienced Josh Hutcherson as Peeta Mellark and heart-throb Liam Hemsworth as Gale. The plot, written by imaginative Suzanne Collins, is completely heart-stopping, leaving you on the edge of your seat throughout.

","One of the things I liked the most about reading 'The Hunger Games' was the intensity of how it was written. Feeling the story seemed maybe even more important than reading it, so when I went to see the movie, my expectations were very high.<br/><br/>On the upside: Great performance by the main characters, excellent visuals and well directed.<br/><br/>On the downside: The book gives a lot of context as to how the characters feel and how things have come to be the way they are. The movie changes a number of things to make it at all possible to show the story and for me the choices made took down the quality of the story a bit. To give at least some context, it took the movie a while to get really started and even despite that, some of the characters, again in my opinion, didn't really develop in depth the way they should.<br/><br/>Long story short, I liked the movie and thought it was a nice adaptation from the book, but it lacked a bit the intensity from the book."
"kirksworks","8","2","8","3 September 2012"," Jennifer Lawrence makes it worth seeing
","In general I enjoyed ""The Hunger Games,"" but as dystopian films of the future go, it is no better or worse than many. It's a genre that hasn't had a lot of success over the years. Of course the quintessential dystopian story is George Orwell's ""1984,"" but the film versions haven't faired that well either. The problem with films like ""Soylent Green,"" ""The Handmaiden's Tale,"" ""Brazil,"" ""Logan's Run"" and many others is that convincing world building with intelligently thought out societies and all the visual material that goes with it is very hard to do. They tend to go over the top, pounding our heads with the message about the dangerous direction our world is headed. As well, they mostly fail to make the characters believable, not only by the overdone dialog and over the top performances, but by ridiculous costume and makeup design. ""The Hunger Games"" completely falls down on those latter two categories. The makeup and garish costuming for the people of the totalitarian state of Panem is so caricatured and manicured it reeks of Hollywood production design. Wes Bently's beard is the worst offender. <br/><br/>On the other hand, ""The Hunger Games"" succeeds in some ways beyond the others because of one thing, Jennifer Lawrence. She's an interesting young actor. I've only seen her in a few films, but found her always believable. If you replace her in ""The Hunger Games,"" with someone who was originally considered for the role of Katniss (Abigail Breslin, Saoirse Ronan, or Emma Roberts for example), it's difficult to say the film would work as well as it does. Not that those other actresses aren't talented, or couldn't do a good job in the role, it's just that Lawrence seems to be perfect casting and she runs with the film. She really anchors the film by underplaying. Also when her insecurities and unlikable characteristics surface, her movements and line readings come across as completely genuine. <br/><br/>The same can't be said about most of the other major players, particularly Wes Bently as Seneca, Elizabeth Banks as Effie, Stanley Tucci as Caesar, and Woody Harrelson as Haymitch. Although Harrelson at least has a bit of a character arc, he and the others mostly play their characters in broad strokes, often the problem in these dystopian films. Donald Sutherland as the president fares a bit better, but his role is written that way. Josh Hutcherson as Peeta, the boy from Katniss' district 12, unfortunately doesn't succeed in making us deeply care for him or make us buy Katniss' affection for him. It's difficult to say what it is about him, because his performance isn't bad at all. Perhaps he was miscast. He just lacks something that would make me warm to him. His scenes with Lawrence seem to lack the needed chemistry to ignite the on screen romance. <br/><br/>What did work far better, however, was Katniss' relationship with Rue, played by Amandla Stenberg. Rue's demise was the only one to elicit emotion in me. Although Rue is still not much developed as a character, she's a nice surrogate little sister for Katniss. Script-wise this works because we already understand Katniss has special warm feelings for Primrose, her younger sister (Willow Shields), having taken her place as her district's female tribute for the games. Stenberg is so remarkably cute that we can't help but fall for her. Her demise is sad indeed, and given weight by the well of emotion from Lawrence. <br/><br/>The rest of the tributes are undeveloped, just bodies to get knocked off one by one. This is a film that could have used more time to develop them. That would have upped the stakes if we understood them better. I've never read the book, but I would imagine they are developed further in it. The script was very manipulative in how the announcements kept changing the game rules right up to the last minute. <br/><br/>What I found a bit disturbing was the idea that Katniss just follows the rules of a dictatorial regime and wins, with only one moment of rebellion when she and Peeta consider a double suicide instead of one of them having to kill the other. The revolt in district 11 at the death of Rue seemed to be quickly vanquished. It lasted maybe 35 seconds on screen. The idea of Katniss and Peeta returning to their district as heroes because of appearing and surviving a game show seems to me to be the ultimate in giving oneself over to the regime. It sets up the sequel, probably with Primrose, but is that reason enough to end the film this way? The ending seemed to glorify the games, which essentially, are just a futuristic variation on TV's ""Survivor."" <br/><br/>The visuals for the cities and trains were wonderful, but the dog creatures seemed wasted. We couldn't see them well enough to get an idea of how vicious and nasty they were. Then, after chewing up one guy they run off, likely programed to do so. That brings me to the idea of the strategically positioned help modules and tools (very much like ""Survivor""), such as the mini parachute with medicine and the packets of items each district needed, or hindering the tributes by starting forest fires, or adding dogs. This made the controllers of the game a bit like the Greek Gods, helping or adding roadblocks along the way. I kind of liked this, but it seemed a bit contrived the way they used it.<br/><br/>I suppose I had a number of negative things to say about ""The Hunger Games,"" but much of it is offset by Jennifer Lawrence. The film is very much worth seeing for her. I'd watch it again just to study her performance. I also liked the music by James Newton Howard. It really did add a glimmer of hope to a troubling world vision."

","i understand my opinion may be considered less important as i'm admitting to not having actually read the books, however there always is some problem with film adaptations of books, as many people who truly 'loved' the written series look too deeply for differences. this is fair enough, however the writer of the book is generally present on set and has a say in the direction, as well as the fact that perception plays a huge role when reading a story - you can create the setting in your own imagination, the characters come across in a certain way personal to you, different parts have more significance - and it must be remembered that everyone sees it differently.<br/><br/>my review on the film will be solely based on the film (obviously, as i am yet to read the books).<br/><br/>AS A FILM, the hunger games was truly captivating. 9/10 is a high rating to give, but throughout the movie i could actually feel every single emotion being portrayed on screen.<br/><br/>i may have rated this a little lower (no lower than an 8) if i had expected it to be anywhere near as good as it was. i was sceptical about it as i thought this was the sort of film i typically dislike - tedious, too long, too much action and not enough emotion - but i was sorely mistaken. regardless of usually not enjoying action scenes, the ones in the hunger games were tense and exciting. there is no more i can say.<br/><br/>additionally, the acting was brilliant - i got that at the end of the film we weren't supposed to be able to tell how katniss truly felt about peeta, and i loved the way she spoke her lines in the interview scene after the competition. i can't wait to see how things turn out.<br/><br/>this review may be a little messy as honestly i'm still a bit amazed at the film, but definitely one of if not the best film i've seen. ever."

They missed the opportunity to use the ""reality look"" they did so well in moments of introspection and Katinis's helplessness and juxtapose that with how the Capital was presenting the games (like an action movie). That would have served to strengthen the ""horror"" of the games and would also have shown us why the Capital residents are so caught up in the glorified violence of the games, and not just serve as a way to explain what Tracker-Jackets are.<br/><br/>More importantly, it also would have broken up the monotony of the tone - I get that director Gary Ross wanted to pull any pleasure out of the games and make sure we all understood they were evil and to feel icky about them, however I think Jennifer Lawrence did a great job conveying that anyway and we wouldn't have lost any of that feeling.<br/><br/>It feels like a missed opportunity to me."

Jennifer and Josh portray their characters to a tee. everything is explained great so even if you haven't read the books, its easy to understand - no confusion whatsoever. a decent film adaptation doesn't leave people who haven't read the books, confused. only reason I've not given it a 10/10 is cause I would have liked a bit more blood and gore cause I'm weird and like things like that. Ta for reading, much love x"
"Cgosen","8","2","8","30 March 2012"," An unbiased review
","In a few words: Surprised and Great. I am writing this review because I believe this film should be judged BY THE FILM and not by the book. I did not read the book so I believe that my review will be fair. So, without further a do...<br/><br/>Overall I was very happy with the film. I did have my doubts going in, whether it was from reading others reviews or seeing what my friends wrote, but at the end of the movie I can honestly say it was a very good film.<br/><br/>Here were some of the things I did like: For a movie that was over 2 hours long it certainly did not feel like over 2 hours. The movie kept my attention very well. There were many times where I was incredibly anxious because I had to know what happened next. I thought the leading roles were well chosen with none of the characters seeming fake. Normally I do not pay much attention to costumes and scenery but it was hard not to in this film. They were excellent and very well thought up. To end the positives, I would like to add that the whole movie flowed together very nicely.<br/><br/>Some things I did not like: Shaky camera. Sometimes it is Okay to have a shaky camera (i.e. Bourne movies) but at times in this film I felt it very unnecessary. I found this annoying especially in the beginning but towards the end it got much better. I think as time went on it seemed more appropriate, but when we are trying to get to know the characters in the film I would advise against it. Another part that bothered me, but only somewhat, was the ending. I felt it ended very abruptly. Although the closing scene left me wanting more I know that they could have brought the film more to a close while still leaving me wanting more.<br/><br/>Overall I was very happy with the film. Again, I did not read the books nor talk to people who had read them. I wanted to be surprised by the contents of the film and at the end of the day I very much was.<br/><br/>8/10"
"maverick494","Null","2","8","30 March 2012"," Y'all gonna hate me: it's better than the book!
","Like so many, I read THG when the hype started to swell and while I liked the book, it had some problems that prevented me from loving it. Enter the movie. Since most movie adaptations from books are worse, I initially didn't have very high hopes for it. The fact Jennifer Lawrence was cast didn't ease my mind either, as I have seen what big movie franchises can do to decent actresses; compare Kristen Stewart's performance in The Cake Eaters to her performance in Twilight for an instance. I rest my case. <br/><br/>Then reports started coming in about excessive shaky cam usage. About Jennifer being ""too fat"" for the role. Key passages left out, etc. I decided to ignore all that and give it a shot. <br/><br/>Well, I was pleasantly surprised! <br/><br/>THE GREAT: - Jennifer Lawrence really does deserve all the praise she gets for her acting talent, because she really delivers in this. When she shoots, you believe she is a great archer, when she whimpers, you feel her pain and when she cries she seems genuinely upset. She conveys layers of emotion with a single look. I love how she doesn't have the blank stare many young starlets have. This movie rests on her shoulders and though everyone else did a good job, it all would have fallen apart if it weren't for her. <br/><br/>And to all who call her ""too fat"" you know that if she had lost a ton of weight there would be trashing going on about her promoting an unhealthy image. Damned if she does, damned if she doesn't. For the record I think she looks lovely, a breath of fresh air in an industry populated by people as fake as those in the Capitol. <br/><br/><ul><li>Jennifer made Katniss seem like a real person of flesh and blood. In the book, though I like the narrative, Katniss comes across as inconsistent. Very capable one moment, an emotional wreck the second. In the movie they have really found a balance. She shows emotion and it seems fitting because she's only 16 and not raised to be a killer. She has the intelligence to be clinical about many things, but she shows emotion in matters of the heart. She's capable and likable. I didn't always feel that way with the book, but I did with the movie. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The editing. It was very natural. The shaky cam didn't bother me at all, in fact it added to the realism. Cuts were clean, not dolled up with cool effects. Some people complained the early kills were hard to see, but I liked how it was done. You could see the desperation and the swiftness and viciousness. Alive one moment, dead the other. No glamour. Just like in real life. I love how the movie does not indulge in gore, unlike many others. Deaths aren't glossed over, they are presented just as they are. Which makes the whole story even more tragic.</li></ul><br/><br/>THE GOOD: - Set, costumes, special effects. It looks like a different world, but recognisable at the same time. Believable. Never once did I feel like I was watching actors in costumes. Everyone seemed right where they belonged. The effects aren't the best you've ever seen, but they get the job done. - Supporting cast. All very capable actors who know how to deliver their lines. I didn't really buy into Rue's performance at her last scene, but that's a minor thing. <br/><br/>THE BAD: - Personally, nothing about this movie is bad. Personally, they fixed a lot of issues I had with the book. I preferred Katniss & Peeta's relationship in the movie over what's described in the book. If I had to name one thing it's that I would have liked to see more of their training. <br/><br/>CONCLUSION: -A very faithful adaption that stays true to the book without having to sell its soul. In fact, it improved upon it. Great main character, suspense, action. Definitely a favourite of mine."
"nickmesafilms","7","2","8","29 March 2012"," The Hunger Games (2012) - Make Way for the Game of the Century! The World Will Be Watching!
","Adapted from the highly-successful book franchise by Suzanne Collins, the highly anticipated ""The Hunger Games"" makes a fresh start to a successful movie franchise. So, here's the good news to all fans of the books, the movie is a success from start to finish. Set in a strange world in the future where the Capitol selects a boy and girl from twelve districts, and they are forced to fight to the death on television, Katniss Everdeen has volunteered to take her sister's place in the latest match, and might take the biggest challenge of her entire life. Jennifer Laurence delivers one of the best performances of her career as Katniss, bringing the perfect mixture of sharpness, cleverness, and powerful enthusiasm to the big screen. Josh Hutcherson is also really good for his performance as Peeta, a contestant who remembers Katniss, and Liam Hemsworth as Katniss' oldest friend. We also get some stellar performances by a remarkable casting ensemble. Elizabeth Banks as the director of the District 12 group, Stanley Tucci as the games' ringmaster, Donald Sutherland as the evil president, and Woody Harrelson in a nomination-worthy performance as a previous Hunger Games champion with a taste for the drink, are all just brilliant in their own special way. Yes, this movie is 142 minutes really long, but you will be entertained a lot by this movie, you won't care if this movie takes forever. Director Gary Ross makes the perfect accomplishments to keep this movie relative to the books. Stellar art direction, enchanting costumes and makeup, and breathtaking visual effects and sound, help you get captured in the wonders of this movie. But most of the credit has to go to Jennifer Laurence, in her winning and powerful performance in this movie. Whether you're a ""die-hard"" Hunger Games fan, or if you never read any of the books, ""The Hunger Games"" is still an entertaining ride from start to finish that has everything to offer from a talented director, wonderful visuals, and a breakthrough performance by Laurence. This is the best movie of 2012, so far! ""The Hunger Games"", in my review, ""a groundbreaking feast, what a journey!""."
"brian-yankee","7","2","8","29 March 2012"," Good...but not as good as it should have been
","I saw ""The Hunger Games"" movie two nights ago. I'm a fan of the books so I was eager to see the movie. For whatever it's worth, here's my review: The camera work - all that constant herky jerky stuff and extreme close ups (especially in the first half of the film) was very annoying - almost headache-inducing. When the camera movement slowed down and the shots widened, I was finally able to get a sense/understanding of the characters and their setting. Before that it was all just a meaningless blur.<br/><br/>A little more time could have been spent on Katniss' back story and her relationship with Gale. If I hadn't read the books, I wouldn't have understood the depth of that relationship. The same can be said about Katniss' relationship to the rest of Distruct 12 and her life there - a little more time spent on that would have filled out her character more and provided context and understanding for her rebellious behavior. <br/><br/>I wish that District 12 didn't look so much like the leftover set from Deliverance (I swear I saw a shot of the same porch where the banjo playing mutant kid sat). The set is too 1930's West Virginia than ""sometime in the future"". It's too easy to resort to that tried and true stereotypical image rather than coming up with something more 'realistic"" for the period that the book is set in.<br/><br/>Very good casting. Jennifer Lawrence is very good. I expect she'll be event better in the next one. Woody Harrison is surprisingly good as Haymitch -not what I expected but good. The guy who plays Peeta is little more animated or interesting than a mannequin, but he's adequate for the role. The rest of the cast is fine - nobody's particularly great or particularly horrible and they all fit their characters well.<br/><br/>I don't think that director Gary Ross has much imagination or comfort when it comes to the action sequences. He takes the ""If we move the camera around a lot and do a bunch of quick edits, it will be REALLY EXCITING, right?"" approach. I also don't think he completely up to the task of imagining a future that is a realistic blend of the old and the new (although I do like the way that the capital city and its residents are portrayed). It's too bad that he's been signed up for the next one. It's a good movie, but it could have been much better with a better director.<br/><br/>A couple of flubs I spotted - A cannon sounds when each of the participants dies EXCEPT when Rue and the kid that threw the spear die...no cannons for either of them."
"dmasursky","9","2","8","29 March 2012"," Terrific adaptation, and yet
","I really enjoyed the movie - it's beautifully made, wonderfully acted, and very well adapted from the book. Jennifer Lawrence carries the movie, and does a great job. I liked the scenes that the movie added, like the Gamemakers during the game - something the book couldn't have included, because it's all from Katniss's point of view. That said, I do have a some complaints:<br/><br/>For an almost 2 1/2 hour film, it doesn't feel very epic. The pacing is a little off. (SPOILER ALERT) The climax, when Cato is killed, feels rather muted and not very dramatic. Because you spend the book inside Katniss's head, the fear, anxiety, and, especially, the urgency of her situation are much more powerful than they are in the movie. <br/><br/>In general, the relationships Katniss has with other characters, especially with Peeta and Rue, are understated compared to the book, and don't come across as strong, as complex, and as important as they are in the book<br/><br/>A couple of very significant things have been left out, which makes the movie less intense, less moving, and less meaningful compared to the book:<br/><br/><ul><li>Madge, the mayor's daughter, gives the mockingjay pin to Katniss before she leaves District 12, and insists that she wear it in the arena. We later discover that the pin is the symbol of the rebellion. In the movie, Katniss buys the pin from a junk dealer in the market, so it's significance is completely stripped away. I can understand the film needing to eliminate some characters, but this scene in the book is 1/2 a page, and very important, so it seems an odd deletion. (SPOILER ALERT) Even stranger, Cinna, who we later discover (in the second book and presumably in the second movie) is also involved in the rebellion, gives the pin to Katniss to wear on her uniform in the arena - this scene IS in the movie, but it doesn't mean the same thing.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Katniss sings in both the book and the movie, to Prim and to Rue. It's sweet. But in the book, it's especially poignant and significant because singing is something that represents Katniss's father, with whom she was very close. He taught her to hunt and to recognize edible plants (central to her survival in the Games), and he taught her a bunch of songs which appear over and over in the books. Losing him is one of the defining moments of her life, and it greatly shaped her character. This entire relationship is eliminated from the movie - no flashbacks, virtually no references to him in dialog. Discarding this important person takes some of the heart out of the story and out of Katniss's character.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The cave scene in the movie is well done, but it leaves out a great deal about both the history of Peeta and Katniss, and several elements of their developing relationship. Perhaps most significant is Peeta telling Katniss how he fell in love with her - in the movie, he tells her she sang the Valley Song at school. In the book, he explains that his father was in love with her mother, but her mother married a coal miner (someone below her station) because when he sang, the birds stopped to listen, and when Katniss sang the Valley Song in school, the birds stopped to listen. The scene is the book is very important and meaningful, but in the movie, it's just sort of cute, because they left out everything that was weighty and significant about Peeta's story.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Another important aspect to the Peeta and Katniss relationship that the movie eliminates unnecessarily - when Peeta gives Katniss the bread, 1) she suspects (and the reader knows) that he burned it on purpose so he could give it to her, despite being harshly punished by his mother, and 2) she was completely at the end of her rope and starving, and his kind act saved her and the lives of her family members (her raison d'etre throughout the entire series), both by providing immediate sustenance, and, perhaps even more importantly, by giving her hope (hope - which happens to be a major theme in the series - the movie even adds a terrific scene, where President Snow explains the role of hope to Seneca Crane). The deliberation behind Peeta's action is left out of the movie completely, though it is central to the way Katniss sees Peeta and, perhaps more importantly, central to the way the reader/viewer sees Peeta - several movie reviews I've read talk about how insubstantial Peeta is, and I think it's partly because the film misrepresented this very important part of the story.</li></ul><br/><br/>Also, they left out some great lines - when Peeta tells Haymitch ""She has no idea the impression she makes."" and when Katniss tells Peeta, ""You're not going to die, I forbid it."" I know they can't include everything, but certain lines of dialog are so memorable and so representative of a character or of a relationship, they seem almost mandatory!<br/><br/>Again, I thought the movie was great, and it's making oodles of money, so clearly fans like it too. But, in my opinion, it does not adequately capture what makes the books so compelling and resonant and emotionally satisfying."
"blackfurcifer","9","2","8","29 March 2012"," Color Me Surprised....
","At how much I liked this movie... and how terrible the reviews on this site are. <br/><br/>I honestly liked this movie - its the best I've seen so far this year, and better than most of the hogs-wash that came out last year.<br/><br/>I did not read the books before seeing this movie, I didn't have the time or the interest. I've decided to give them a shot now. I loved the emotions this flick brought out in me. There were many times that I wanted to turn to my companion (who had read the books) and beg to find out if my favorite character was going to die in front of my eyes, the child/teen actors were that inspiring. <br/><br/>But I would like to address two things: If you go into any movie expecting it to be EXACTLY like the books (or how you picture them in your mind), I frankly don't see how you can like any movie adapted from a book. LOTR was the only one to ever pull it (mostly)off and there were still things left out. Learn to see it as a different take on the same thing. With this movie, the screen writer was the author (Did you scroll up to check?) and that is very obvious from how much I've read of the book. Anyway, after fuming over the earlier Harry Potter movies due to book inaccuracies I've learned to see movies as themselves rather than rips off a novel - I've come to like them better. <br/><br/>In comparison to HP movies, this movie was very understandable if you pay attention to what is said - I was not left confused at all. I was interested to find out more. The HP ones seemed to leave a lot of lose ends - I went with people who had not read the books and they were confused by things that were detailed in the books.<br/><br/>For those comparing it to battle Royale - even if it is like that movie, does that mean it was really so terrible to rate 1 and 3 stars? I saw Battle Royale a year ago and loved it. Frankly after leaving this movie I felt this one to be pretty good for what you could call a spiritual successor to that foreign film. But... most of the people I've tried to describe this movie to compare it to running man. So what if this plot has been used before? If they do it well, who cares? Pot Lids or Bows, I don't care; when the movies are this thought provoking. <br/><br/>I rate this nine stars - One star off due to the abundance of shaky cam running and super close ups, though I understand why they was used. Honestly when ever it was extremely close up I feared for what the main characters and I couldn't see. On the plus side, shaky cam during some of the battle seems probably helped to keep the movie PG-13, which was the demographic the book was aimed for. Helpful that.<br/><br/>I hope this is the lead in for a year of good movies - if they are this top notch then we are in for a pretty good year! :D"
"ricisbest","8","2","8","28 March 2012"," Refreshing, hopeful adaptation of a teenage novel.
","When it comes to film adaptations of successful (some only financially)novels, I'm one of the first to groan, and I'd argue with good reason too with some of the trash that has been produced in recent years - mostly novels with an intended teenage audience such as myself. I'd normally sit watching the film picking out parts that have been done differently in the book and complain to anyone that will listen. HOWEVER believe me when I say the hunger games is different.<br/><br/>The main problem for me in films of this line, e.g the most recent Harry Potter films and even the twilight saga, is the awful, awkward dialogue that is near painful to watch. It's hugely refreshing to see none of these forced, clichéd lines in this film. Gary Ross and Billy Ray do a great job writing the script whilst not losing the essence of Katniss. Bringing in Suzanne Collins was also a great idea, I'm sure she helped in changing the story slightly to suit a film yet keeping all important details the same.<br/><br/>The imagery in the film was just fantastic, my favourite part in the whole film was at the start, where your given a brief tour of district 12 as Katniss ventures through the district out towards the woods. It's more perfect than what I'd imagined whilst reading the book and really shows the desperation and poverty of these people. The Reaping was the other part I loved, the way it was done was brilliant and it helped you to identify with these people, the graveness of their situation and the cruel, threatening dominion the Capitol exhibits. The costumes were also notably well picked out in this part, the best outfits of all the people were all a dull, faded grey colour. This draws parallels with concentration camps in Nazi Germany and creates this sense of despair which even as part of the audience you feel and you pity these people.<br/><br/>The Acting in this film is almost flawless also, I'm such a sceptic when it comes to child/teenage actors but pretty much everyone in the cast plays their role brilliantly. A huge amount of credit to Jennifer Lawrence who fully embodies Katniss Everdeen and personifies every thing written about her in the novels. After pulling off a brilliant performance in Winters Bone and now this, I fully expect her to grow from strength to strength and have a very bright future ahead. The other mention-worthy performance in the film was by Stanley Tucci as Caesar Flickerman who stole the show in each scene he was in. The cast all gelled exceedingly well together and it was an all round great performance from everyone which made the film a much more pleasant 2 and a half hours.<br/><br/>The only complaint I had was the violence. I feel slightly cheated by how much we actually get to see. It is avoided with clever camera shots which dart around but in my opinion not enough. I'm not looking for excessive gore, I just think a little more may have been useful in keeping the audience drawn to the seriousness and desperation of the tributes. However I do appreciate that they obviously wanted the film available to a younger audience and adding in this violence may have increased the certificate.<br/><br/>All in all it's a very good film and even better when you consider they've adapted it from a successful book with a cast full of young, teenage actors. It's definitely worth a watch and I recommend it fully."
"gillianjaplit","8","2","8","28 March 2012"," Great adaptation, intense, and suspenseful. It delivers well for its book fans.
","I read the Hunger Games a few years back and instantly became hooked on the series. When I heard there was going to be a movie, I felt super excited and also worried because as we all know, most of the time it comes out crappy (for example: Golden Compass *sigh* so much potential).<br/><br/>In this case, the movie came out great --- for an adaptation. Probably one of the best book to movie results I've seen so far. For those who have never read the book, it'll come off as action-filled and exciting (and not just another 'sexy-hollywood-mtv-teen-movie' bull). For those who read the book, it'll be more than satisfactory considering a lot of the dialogue and scenes are the same as the book, seeing as it wouldn't need editing for movie-sake. There are some subtle changes, but nothing to make you rebel against them.<br/><br/>Cast is good. Lawrence plays a great Katniss: strong, awkward, but holds lots of presence. They're Peeta however didn't make me giddy like the book version did. Gale is Gale, all angry and bitter. And so on.<br/><br/>The style of the movie is awesome, love the shaky cam and the minor score/soundtrack bits. But the shaky cam does get a little out of hand to make sense of what's going on in some action scenes. Note: I didn't see one Mockingjay though, which was weird.<br/><br/>All in all, I'd definitely see it again, buy it on DVD, and then watch it some more. I am a book fan so I will say that it could have been better, longer if anything. But hey, even if the movie was spot on, we'd all say that anyway because we imagined it better in our heads while reading.<br/><br/>Hunger Games, take my money."
"DJRMewzique","9","2","8","27 March 2012"," An Absolute Triumph.
","As a pop culture junkie, I have been waiting for this film for a very long time. Just like that other big YA series about dead people and really hairy men, I had never even heard of ""The Hunger Games"" until they started discussing the movie. But the hype certainly peaked my curiosity, strengthened by the casting of Oscar-nominated Jennifer Lawrence in the title role. Yep, March 23rd was reserved a long time ago for ""Hunger Games."" Due to the absolutely incredible response and pre-sales of tickets, seeing it on opening weekend didn't happen, but the few days of delay hardly hurt. With phenomenal reviews and most considering this one of the best book-to-screen adaptations in recent history, the monumental, record-breaking $155 million box office take over the weekend just flamed the roaring fire of anticipation.<br/><br/>And yes, unlike most other films with this much hype, ""The Hunger Games"" is one of those rare films that should have been buried under it but instead, not simply rises above, but easily surpasses all possible expectation.<br/><br/>We all know the general story of it being about a bunch of kids thrown into a televised reality show which pits them against each other to the death as a way of repenting for the war-like sins of their forefathers. However, it is not an exploitative film about kids killing each other, but rather an absolutely thrilling film about class, survival and the basic good and evil of people.<br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence proves that her Oscar-nominated performance in 2010's ""Winter's Bone"" was not a fluke. Playing Katniss with an absolutely even perfection of awkwardness, shyness, remorse and bitterness, she turned a potentially very unlikeable character into someone we can all relate to, whether you're the thirteen year old girl who devoured the books...or a thirty-seven year old man who had never even heard of them. She is, in a word, captivating.<br/><br/>But not only does Lawrence shine. In a role that could have just been a waste of a cute guy, the extremely cute Josh Hutcherson (""The Kids are All Right"") as Peeta proves he has far more to offer than just an extremely handsome face but some real acting chops to boot. In a much more minor role, but still incredibly memorable, Liam Hemsworth is just a feast for the eyes as Gale Hawthorn as is the incredibly delicious Alexander Ludwig as the evil Cato.<br/><br/>Lest we forget the adults in the film, all of which are played by outstanding actors in their own right, and every single one of them at the top of their game. Stanley Tucci reigns as the host of The Hunger Games, Elizabeth Banks shines as Effie Trinket, Donald Sutherland is statuesque as the president, and in a completely surprising left-of-centre role, Woody Harrelson continues to dominate the screen as mentor Haymich Abernathy. Not to mention, I don't think Lenny Kravitz has ever looked so handsome as he is playing Cinna.<br/><br/>All this to say ""The Hunger Games"" is an absolute thrill ride from start to finish. It made me laugh, it made me cry, and it enraptured me completely. Are there aspects I wish I understood a little bit better from reading the book? Sure...but that's why one has literate friends. There are mild imperfections, but all are easily forgiven by otherwise strong storytelling, excellent direction, perfect performances, incredible costume design and art direction and astounding cinematography and effects.<br/><br/>""The Hunger Games"" was like watching the merging of ""Survivor,"" ""Lost,"" ""American Idol,"" ""Big Brother,"" ""The Truman Show"" and the Academy Awards into one spectacular event. The mere grandeur of the film leaves me confused as to how anyone could walk away even remotely unimpressed when the execution is perfection.<br/><br/>Certainly one of the best films I have seen in a long time, the easily the best """"hype"" film since ""Avatar,"" ""The Hunger Games"" has easily left me starving for more. When ""Catching Fire"" comes out next year, you can bet I'll be getting my tickets real early."
"Allswell007","Null","2","8","27 March 2012"," pretty good but not great... over hyped
","I'd have to classify this movie as the quintessential ""pretty good but not great"" film. It's engrossing but yet remarkably superficial in terms of character. It's an odd blend. I've never read the book so, there where no expectations or nuances available to add depth for me. I found the overall premise to be quite silly to be honest but once reconciling that, I bought in to the concept. Jennifer Lawerence is wonderful and really succeeds in making the viewer empathize with the lead character. It's the rest of the ensemble that are shallow as can be. The cartoonish elite government type officials, lack of coherent development and really no stand out action sequences really holds this film back. I'm sure the books deliver more because something this telegraphed really shouldn't be able to inspire the fan base that has rushed out to see and hype this movie."

"haleyjean1285","6","2","8","25 March 2012"," Visually amazing, but hollow.
","Spoiler Warning! I went into the film with such incredible expectations and as a huge fan of the book series. The film was good, but did not quite meet my expectations. I feel that as far as casting, direction, and effects it was pretty spot on. The way the movie was filmed added a lot of drama and suspense. I don't think a single person wouldn't have their heart pounding as Katniss raises up into the arena! I will definitely say that the movie up until the point of the Game starting cannon going off was spot on. The emotion and plot were almost exactly what were in the book. I wish the meaning of the Mockingjay pin had been explained and that Katniss' relationship with Peeta had been a little more developed. In the book she is a lot more conflicted on whether to trust him or not and in the film she just appears to not like him. Haymitch was also a little nicer than he was in the book. In the book you are never sure if he likes Katniss or not.<br/><br/>As far as the games were concerned: it just felt way too rushed. There should have been less scenes outside the arena and more focus on developing the characters within the games. There was no time to develop Katniss' relationship with Rue or even Peeta for that matter. By the end of the Games in the book, the reader is very convinced that Katniss really does love and care about Peeta but that she's just not fully aware of it. By the end of the games in the movie you really aren't convinced she cares for him at all.<br/><br/>The cave scenes were too short not because we wanted more romance... but because those are the scenes where Katniss' tenderness shines through and where you really get to know Peeta. The whole plot line with his leg was completely botched. He was supposed to have a gaping hole in his leg that required medicine to heal blood poisoning. He was supposed to be on death's door. Katniss' retrieval of the medicine was not as heroic if you didn't believe he was dying.<br/><br/>Finally the ending was just not dramatic! Peeta was supposed to be bleeding to death because of a wound from one of the mutts. They cut out my favorite scene when they are lifted into the hover craft and Peeta is whisked away for surgery. Katniss goes berserk, not knowing what's going to happen to him and you are really convinced she does in fact love and care about him. In the film he doesn't lose his leg, that scene is completely cut out, Katniss and Peeta don't appear scarred or as if they have been through anything traumatic. Their reunion is nowhere near convincing that they are in love. If I lived in the Capitol... I would not have been convinced.<br/><br/>Overall, I was pretty disappointed. Not that I need violence to enjoy a movie, but the horror of the games just wasn't portrayed convincingly enough and just hope and pray they do an even better job with Catching Fire."
"ajdavis0408","7","2","8","24 March 2012"," It was alright, go see it in theaters, don't buy it on DVD/blu-ray
","I am an avid fan of the Hunger Games novel, but this movie did not come to par with the books. Some of the story's more in-depth moments were stripped from the movie, and the lines that were added into the movie, that were not in the book, made me leave the moment that I was caught up in. Overall, it was decent, and worth seeing in theaters, but not buying on DVD/Blu-Ray. The acting was also not the best. In my opinion, Liam Hemsworth was not a good choice for the role of Gale. He didn't seem too in with the moment, and I was very aware that I was watching Liam Hemsworth, the actor, not Gale Hawthorne, the character. Woody Harrelson did a good job, and Josh Hutcherson and Jennifer Lawrence were not too bad either. The producers/director did a good job of putting in small touches to scenes to show key features in Katniss' life as well, such as the fact that her mom is very weak, and hasn't been there for her children ever since their father died in a coal mine explosion. Some parts seemed to rushed, such as Katniss' time with Rue, which seemed much longer in the novel, and the end was incredibly rushed as well. The end of the film was probably wrapped up in about 6 minutes... not very pleasing. But away from the cons, and pro to seeing the film is the special effects. Obviously there nothing special, but if your a fan of CGI, there's ton to be had in this film. So lets go over pros and cons to seeing this film...<br/><br/>Pros: Good Story, good special effects, Woody Harrelson, a few of the young actors were good, specifically Jennifer Lawrence, Josh Hutcherson and Amandla Stenburg (Rue). good job touching on the smaller parts of Katniss' life.<br/><br/>Cons: Took out some of the in-depth, background story scenes of the novel. Some of the lines were very cheesy and unreal, Liam Hemsworth=crap, and the scenes with Rue (i.e. her death and the attack on the supplies) were rushed, and the ending was rushed as well.<br/><br/>So, 7/10! Not too shabby!"

I thought he'd be great and he just wasn't. 2) Not enough time was devoted to many parts of the movie. It felt rushed, especially at important parts of the story (it'd be a spoiler if I said where) 3) Like #2, they tried to pack too much into the plot. It really could have used another half hour to be a little more thorough. 4) Cinematography was awful. Often the camera seemed out of focus from my view in the theater. Too many close-ups and the resolution just seemed off. Didn't look like HD. 5) Could have used more dialogue. Main characters barely spoke to one another. 6) Capitol scenes seemed very cheaply done and the editing was sloppy, as many have already said. <br/><br/>I was mildly disappointed but the movie was still pretty good. Definitely worth my $5 at the matinée, I just loved the book and the movie wasn't as good. Acting was spot on for the most part."

","Loved it I am a 23 year old who read the books over a year ago and loved them to death. I read all 3 in 3 days they were so good and so was very excited to see the movie. Its always interesting to see what view of the story the movie will take.<br/><br/>Now I reread the book right before watching the movie and so I caught all the little changes. And yes the books are better than the movie but thats almost always the case.<br/><br/>Despite all that it was a great movie, one that i would definitely watch again. The acting was great and whenever I read the books i will see Jennifer and Josh as Katniss and Peeta. They noted all the important aspects of the book though they didn't go into a lot of depth. Someone else commented that they didn't focus enough on Gale and Peeta's relationship with Katniss, but to me the romance triangle was never the primary point of the book, so it didn't bother me that much. Also seeing as it was already 2.5 hours, there wasn't much they could do. I hope they split the last the next two books into two movies a piece though.<br/><br/>Overall the effects were great, lots of action, a great story line and great actors. Loved it and will definitely pre-order the DVD :) However to anyone who hasn't read the books, I highly recommend you do so that you have a better understanding of the movie."
"thosefries","10","3","15","25 March 2012"," Amazing!
","This movie was great. Besides the fact that it was a long movie, I enjoyed it. At first, I wasn't so sure about who had been cast, wasn't thinking about their acting skills. I was thinking about looks. I went into this movie extremely excited but also a little nervous that it wouldn't live up to the books. Of course, Suzanne wouldn't let her movie fail, because of the person she is, but some people these days. Once it goes into a movie they don't think about details. I was upset that they didn't weave the flowers into Rue or use the tributes eyes for the mutant wolves but those are just tiny things. I was glad they didn't mess up the huge parts. I do hope for the best, that they will make the second movie as good as the first. The one thing they could've done a bit more though, was used soundtrack music. Wish they would've used the music during the movie, not just in the credits. That's the one thing I would like to see in the future. But other than that, I wish them good luck. They have big plans set out for them ahead."
"pitatski","10","3","15","25 March 2012"," To those who are disappointed book readers..
","I have read the book and loved it and I have seen the movie and I love it more.. You know why? Because it was a great adaptation from the book. I know most of the book readers are disappointed because roles were omitted (like Madge) and scenes were omitted but to tell you the truth, you can't fit in all of those in a 2 hour movie! At least the movie was 2 hours unlike Twilight.. Gary Ross focused on the important things and roles.. If he would 100% percent copy the story from the book, it would be chaos.. and it would take at least 5 hours.. and i do understand why the cams are shaky.. It's not because they want us to be sick.. It's for us to feel what the roles are feeling in the film.. So to those who are disappointed, please think thoroughly.. look for valid reasons why the film went that way or this way.. Don't just blurt out your emotions just because you got disappointed because scenes have been omitted. In fact, they have added scenes that were not in the book, right? That was a good move because as for me, I did wonder what the gamemakers do.. How the mutts were created.. How Seneca Crane died.. And because of the movie, now I knew..<br/><br/>Suzanne Collins won't like the movie to be released if she did not approve of it, right? Adaptation of Hunger Games is way better than Twilight's.."
"yuliajonas","8","3","15","25 March 2012"," an intense adaption
","As someone who is generally skeptic when some Hollywood-person attempts to do any kind of adaption for a novel I like, I was terrified when I heard they were filming The Hunger Games. In my mind I already saw squealing teenage girls with ""Team Peeta""-shirts leaving the theater in tears for I was completely sure: if they do the Hunger Games they will exploit the hell out of the love story until the political content and the suspense are practically abandoned. Today, after seeing the movie, I can gladly calm anyone who shared these fears. While there were several changes from the book most of them were understandable and probably necessary but all in all it was a good, solid adaption that exceeded my expectations by far. Let me list the best and the worst aspects: Ironically, some of the best aspects of this movie are the things that WERE'NT in it. <br/><br/>+1. No inner monologue. Instead of having a constant babble in the background this movie has perfected the art of ""show, don't tell"". It is not necessary to tell us the details about district 12 because we see them firsthand. It is not necessary to have an inner monologue because we see how Katniss feels and what she is going through. When I left the theater I was pleased with how little the characters had spoken - simply because it wasn't necessary because a more subtle and effective method was used. <br/><br/>+2. No focus on the love story. I was surprised and incredibly pleased by how little importance was given to this. Actually I expected them to milk the love story for all it was worth and really dig into the love triangle in order to appeal to teenage girls. But it was downplayed and subtle which made sense: in the arena Katniss isn't even capable of falling in love since she is so focused on her and Peeta's survival. While she befriends him and at some point seems to enjoy kissing him, love just isn't an issue for her and she only really explores the possibility of loving Peeta in the next novels. <br/><br/>+3. Jennifer Lawrence. When I first saw that this young woman was going to play Katniss I had serious doubts about this casting choice. I thought she didn't look starved enough,her face seemed too round - I was very nit-picky and kind of paranoid. After seeing her act however I almost feel guilty about the way I thought about her. She did a great job, her acting was very intense and she portrayed Katniss almost perfectly. I also approved of the casting of Harrelson as Haymitch. I always imagined him looking a bit different but the actor really caught the gist of Haymitch and his performance was enjoyable. Effie was good, too. <br/><br/>+4. Interesting additions. Even though they weren't in the books I liked the scenes inside the Gamekeeper Control Room. The movie wasn't exclusively from Katniss' point of view. They wanted to show the impact the Games had, the political decisions behind it and the way this worked in general. When I read the books I always wondered what the control rooms would be like and this movie gave an accurate answer. And Seneca Crane's last scene was smashing. I also liked the general strangeness of the Capitol and its citizens. Their looks and behavior met and surpassed my expectations.<br/><br/>Negative aspects: <br/><br/>-1. Haymitch sends Katniss a message. This was such a blatant mistake and I really had to roll my eyes at this one. It is so obvious that stuff like that would NEVER be allowed in the games. All it would take is for a mentor and a tribute to learn some basic code and the mentor could inform the tribute about everything ""Go west, there's water"" or ""Peeta is lying in the mud. Find him."". Of course I can see why it was necessary: since there was no inner monologue the fact that Katniss's love for Peeta is merely for the show and the fact that this was also brought on by Haymitch had to be shown in a different way. Still, it really bugged me. <br/><br/>-2. Peeta. Maybe this is just me but Josh Hutcherson kind of bugged me, too. He comes off as weak and kind of whiny and always looks like a frightened little rabbit. And while it is true that he didn't have any extreme combat skills in the book Peeta wasn't exactly a weakling either. He was smart, kept hold of his moral values and his priorities... He was strong and kind of balanced in an emotional way - something that Katniss never truly accomplished. In the movie he annoyed me most of the time. <br/><br/>-3.Toned-down violence. It was to be expected. The fighting scenes still felt very intense. Still, sometimes it got kind of noticeable that the gore was missing. <br/><br/>-4. Minor differences. Peeta doesn't lose his leg and it is never really made clear that he was very close to dying which flushes a lot of suspense down the drain. Sometimes things looked very different from the way they were described in the books even though there was no need for that. Like the cornucopia or Katniss's interview dress... Madge doesn't appear. <br/><br/>Still, I thought all of this was forgivable. All in all I was surprised by how well this was done. This was not the teen-flick I was expecting and for that I am very grateful. It stayed true to the book while also adding interesting scenes. This, dear filmmakers, is how you adapt a book."
"ihatespike","8","3","15","24 March 2012"," A timid but firm first step towards a powerful trilogy.
","I am already a fan, but I will try to make this review as fair and as clear as possible.<br/><br/>The Hunger Games is about a great deal of things, but on the surface is this: survival. Those who enjoy dystopian stories may find the Hunger Games to be similar, and yet the style and voice are fresh enough to appeal to the youth. So where does this film fit in? Somewhere in the middle; you don't have label yourself a critic or a fan or a casual viewer to enjoy this movie-it stands on its own.<br/><br/>Our protagonist is Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence). She is neither acidic nor saccharine in behavior; she is simply naturally reserved, and perhaps a little sullen (with good reason). Her character is well-played and strikes to the core as realistic; for that alone the audience is able to cheer for her. If she's is genuine, so too are her dire circumstances, and so too is the weight of her success. The supporting (and talented) cast fall into place comfortably; not once did I cringe at an ill-spoken line or a poorly-cast character. Certainly there were changes made from book-to-movie, most if not all were to aid the audience's comprehension, as we no longer have Katniss' first-person narration to explain plot points to us. The art direction was in most areas commendable, and in others simply adequate, the music score was unique and subtly haunting, and the camera work to be honest flipped between lousy and decent. I recommend you sit a fair deal away from the screen since most of the intro scenes are choppy. I assume this was done to hurry things along and add to tension but I felt that swift, steady shots would have sufficed. The violence in this movie is sensitized at just the right level (which is refreshing, since most film-violence is usually melodramatic or mindless), and is a unique blend of toned-down bloodshed with an intense feeling of moral disgust. As for my complaints, there is the aforementioned shaky-camera in some scenes, the too-rushed character interaction/development (at least on behalf of characters who won't return for the sequels), the omission of a few bits of back-story and artistic design that I felt would have enriched the story more for those who haven't read the books (and a few times their omission made the film seem a little too edited), and there were a handful of scenes that could have used dramatic embellishment and yet went without.<br/><br/>All in all I give it an 8 out of 10; it stands the test of translating from one form of media to another, it gives us a taste of both the love and the humanity within such bleak settings, and it wets our appetite for the chaos to come. Let the games begin."
"Jsparrow-325-13040","8","3","15","23 March 2012"," Definitely worth seeing
","I'm going to start this off by stating, ANY book is better than the movie especially one that is as well written and detailed as Hunger Games. That being said, I thought the attention to detail was amazing from the color of Katniss reaping dress to character descriptions, hair color, skin color, etc which a lot of movies leave out. The group I was with contained people who read the book and people who did not. The people who did not read the books understood everything that was going on. The games themselves could have had alittle more time dedicated to it but I understand since the movie was already 2 1/2 hours long. The acting was incredible and was completely satisfied as a previous fan.<br/><br/>Also, for those that said they sold out by the PG-13 rating, you have to remember these books are written for YOUNG ADULTS, so therefore that is the audience that is targeted, not just to get more money.<br/><br/>Overall, for the rating, the amount of time, the director and actors did an excellent job of adapting such an incredible,detailed book."
"elie-fares16","8","4","23","21 March 2012"," May the Odds be Ever in the Favor of The Hunger Games
","For legions of people, The Hunger Games is the most anticipated movie release of the year. And for a movie released so early in 2012, that's saying something. Based on the book of the same title, The Hunger Games stars Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss Everdeen, a sixteen year old girl living in a post-apocalyptic America where hunger and oppression ruled, where hunting for rodents was the way to keep your family alive and where every day represents a fight for your life.<br/><br/>This post-apocalyptic America is the country of Panem, governed by the Capitol which oversees twelve districts, making sure they are stripped down to the bare necessities. Those twelve districts had been thirteen that rebelled against the Capitol's oppression. They lost the war and are still paying the price, the heaviest of which is the annual Hunger Games which require each district to send a young man and woman, for a total of 24, to battle each other to the death. There can only be one victor. ""May the odds be ever in your favor"" is the sentence the tributes keep hearing as if odds will help them on the brink of death.<br/><br/>When her sister is chosen, Katniss volunteers in her place and is taken along with the male tribute of District 12, Peeta Mallark (Josh Hutcherson), to the Capitol where they are groomed like lambs for slaughter in an attempt to make an impression which can make it or break it for them once the games fall upon them. And fall they do, with devastating consequences. <br/><br/>To see the Katniss Everdeen of your imagination after reading The Hunger Games books be incarnated so perfectly on screen by Jennifer Lawrence is a joy to the eye. Lawrence struts through every scene as if she was Katniss and Katniss was her. She exuberates confidence, sentimentality, fragility, innocence, worry, love and pain. Widely known for her Oscar- nominated role in Winter's Bone, Lawrence is still in the same vein in The Hunger Games. This time, however, she manages to polish the sides of her performance, nitpicking until she truly becomes flawless. In Katniss, Lawrence gives you a heroine you want to root for with all your heart. It doesn't even feel forced, it's simply natural to feel invested in the primal force that Lawrence conveys to Katniss. And it is then that you realize the brilliance of Lawrence's Katniss. She has managed to make her character one that is driven by principle.<br/><br/>Director Gary Ross manages to not let the movie's extended run at 140 minutes affect it negatively. The Hunger Games doesn't let down. It keeps picking up, bring in gut-wrenching revelations and action sequences one after the other. Ross uses the action of the movie to serve the characters, not drown them. He keeps the suspense going throughout. His camera-work is also highly interesting, with lots of focus on his characters' faces, giving them a more humane appearance and seeing the struggles in them easily. Co-writing the movie's script with the book's author, Suzanne Collins, he stays true to the book's essence. Even though some sequences have been shortened and some have been omitted, the feeling of the book remains there, present for you throughout to sink your eyes into.<br/><br/>At the center of the deathly games is a growing love triangle between Katniss, Peeta and Gale (Liam Hemsworth), a friend of Katniss from District 12 who's lucky enough not to have been chosen as tribute. Liam Hemsworth quickly establishes himself as a forceful character, with the limited screen time he gets. Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) is highly relatable as the man secretly crushing over Katniss whose only memory of him is him helping her in a time of need. But the greatest triumph in this regard for The Hunger Games is focusing less on the love triangle than other movies targeting the same audience, making you really not care about either Team Peeta or Team Gale. At the end of the day, the only team you want to be on is the movie.<br/><br/>The Hunger Games is an unflinching adaptation of Suzanne Collins' book. In many ways, the book was more suited for a screen adaptation because it is that fertile for the imagination. The movie does not falter. It's a more serious movie than many might think it could possibly be. It is gut-wrenching at times and heavily sincere at others. It takes you on a roller coaster ride that you never want to let go of. In fact, not wanting to let go is most evident when, after 140 minutes, the movie suddenly ends and you remain in your seat wanting more. Fans of the book, rejoice. The Hunger Games does not disappoint at all. It's a haunting tale that, coupled with a chilling score by James Newton Howard that serves as a brilliant auditory backdrop the darkest of scenes, will leave you mesmerized by how real it feels and how good it turned out to be.

","2012 has been a lame year for movies so far, until not! The Hunger Games is the best movie I have seen this year! The Hunger Games is a mix of political philosophy meets survivor which meets a love triangle. The story's subplots are mixed into an excellent story. The main plot is about a futuristic society where the capital's government selects from twelve districts one young boy and girl to be in a modern day version of the show survivor where the contestants fight to the death. The government creates the show as a punishment for the rebellion against the government. The president wants to create a Machiavellian concept of hope and fear and hope to subjugate the public. The story creates intrigue of what is the government going to do next with the show. The game provides much movie action were the reality show is a much more violent version of survivor. There is a love interest with a boy who loves a girl which is in love with another guy. Action, intrigue, and forbidden love the three pillars/themes for a great story. The movie is well acted and directed. I give the hunger games a nine out of ten. I love this movie."
"eastwood-azad","8","3","16","23 March 2012"," Thoroughly Entertaining!
","If one were to watch Gary Ross' ""The Hunger Games"" with a preconception that it is another one of those action films targeted at teen audiences, then they might just be disappointed. Sure, the film has a lot of tense moments, and there's some decent action too, but that isn't what it's built upon.<br/><br/>""The Hunger Games"", based on Suzanne Collins' popular novel, is a very mild satire of a few of today's social issues. The few things sarcastically lampooned in the film are reality television, the class system and perhaps even sports-rigging. The two different sects of the Panem society (that's what North America is called in this future) are clearly in contrast to each other. While the elite wear weird apparel painted with ridiculous patterns and combinations of color, the other's wear dull and boring clothes. What shows class differences better than fashion?<br/><br/>The film has a plot that might sound silly, but it fortunately isn't depicted in a naive manner. Every year, from each of the 12 districts of Panem, a boy and girl between the ages of 12 and 18 are selected to compete in an event known as the Hunger Games. Twenty four of them will participate, twenty three will die and the survivor is the victor.<br/><br/>The lead character in the film is Katniss Everdeen, played by the pretty Jennifer Lawrence, who gives a commendable performance. If what Suzanne Collins depicted in her book (I haven't read it) was a strong-willed, courageous girl, then the casting has been perfect. Stanley Tucci gives another one of his admirable yet unimportant performances like in 'Easy A' and 'Julie & Julia'.<br/><br/>It is an interesting thing that Jennifer Lawrence's character in this film is similar to Ree Dolly, the role she played in the 2010 thriller 'Winter's Bone': a responsible and caring daughter/sister.<br/><br/>I observed that some people felt the film was too similar to the 2000 Japanese action flick 'Battle Royale'. I honestly don't think that film was about an oppressive government or a civilian uprising (which, most probably,are what the next two movies will be about).<br/><br/>I'm already excited about 'Catching Fire', mainly because the sequel will center around the consequences of the events in this film. I also hope this franchise doesn't lose its sheen like Twilight or The Chronicles of Narnia."

Exciting and the people playing the characters who have long been in my head (ever since reading the book) perfectly fit their roles.<br/><br/>I would have never guessed Woody could pull it off, but he did!

Jennifer Lawrence, is as always amazing, in her portrayal of Katniss Everdeen and I found Josh Hutcherson pretty good as Peeta Mellark.It just felt like some one told them, ""you've got two hours to give as much info as as possible."" I think that they also could've made it a little more violent (cause the book certainly is).

","Most films that come out these days are terrible, and only focus on Special Effects and poor storyline. The Hunger Games, however offered pretty nice effects such as the scene with the forest fire, and the Capitol Blimp flying over District 12 at the beginning of the film.The Movies story ( Based on the Books) was unique and interesting, and the characters were more developed in the book than in the movie. Jennifer Lawrence plays the star role as Katniss Everdeen, a mature teenager who watches over her sister, and when her sister is picked for The Hunger Games she volunteers, Jennifer Lawrence is amazing in this film. In real life Jennifer Lawrence is funny, and Quirky. This movie, you would not expect her to be like that at all. This just shows how good of an actor she really is. Josh Hutcherson, also plays a good role in this film as Peeta Mellark, Josh Hutcherson as grown as an actor since i first saw him in "" Bride to Teribthia"" ( Not sure if i spelled that right =)) Josh has gotten a lot better at acting, and I think the two of them in The Hunger Games was entertaining, The Hunger Games is an Entertaining and Thrilling movie that anybody could watch and enjoy. NOTE: For those who are complaining the books are better, That is most likely true, but i thought seeing the Hunger Games with sounds, and visuals was amazing and would be great to see for any Hunger Games fan or Action Films, Drama Films fans."
"rpounders1","8","2","9","14 April 2012"," Very well done
","I cannot say that this movie is in my top 100 but I can say I didn't mind the price of admission. The hunger games had a very well written script, good acting and very well done editing. I was impressed to say the least. I liked it's originality and it kept you on the edge of your seat. Most movies that take time to develop the plot put you to sleep until the action kicks in, this movie was the exception. It did take time to develop the plot, but the entire time it kept you involved, something very lacking in the crap that comes out of Hollywood lately. Understand this, I appreciate a movie that is entertaining, which most movies made now adays are, but this movie made you think, and I love movies that make you think. I would give this movie better marks if it weren't for the silliness of the trained since birth ""warrior section"" which is typical plot fodder, or the ""Hey, let's see how weird we can make people look in the ""upper class"". This movie is really well done, and make the viewer use their brain, and if that is the type of movie you are into, then this is the movie for you."
"Lewsir","7","2","9","14 April 2012"," A reflection on us?
","I thought it was a reasonably good movie, compared to most I see. I thought the acting was reasonably good, the casting, direction, costuming/makeup well done. I agree with many here that the camera work was pretty annoying. I thought some of the special effects were pretty good.<br/><br/>But what really hit me was the feeling of sitting there, watching the whole reality TV thing (or ancient Rome thing) taken to its logical conclusion, and that I'm actually part of the voyeuristic problem, because I paid my $10 to watch other people being killed. If you could do it (and I think you could), I think it would be very cool to have a scene where the camera pans around the audience in the film, watching raptly, but the camera continues to pan around the actual theater where we were all sitting and have us see ourselves for what we are - not much better than the people in the capitol feasting on the carnage. (Incidentally it doesn't help that many people here on IMDb have complained that the killing scenes aren't clear enough!) I find the whole thing pretty unsettling. I suppose that's the author's intention - I will now read the book to see if I can discern such a motive...and I will keep looking around the reviews and boards here to see if anyone else has this reaction - so far I don't see it. Maybe we're all too jaded to worry about that?"
"pieter-vlekken","7","2","9","13 April 2012"," Decent movie
","I'm a typical 21 year old student. I thought I'd see some lame movie for teens, but I was pleasantly surprised. I saw the movie WITHOUT having read the books first (I think you need to judge a movie on its own, not versus a book. Just like any another movie).<br/><br/>The concept isn't that original throughout time, but it is original in this setting. Put some people in a cage, and the last man standing wins. First time I've seen that idea with children though. The acting was great. Jennifer Lawrence does a great job, and so do other actors.Even Lenny Kravitz delivers a good performance. The main plot seems (as unlikely as it sounds) believable. I had heard about horrible and gruesome details, but that's just wrong. The makers don't hide that children die, but they don't show it in a gruesome way either. <br/><br/>The camera-work and overall directing of the movie are really good as well. But, there are some issues. The entire movie just seems to short.A longer movie (or possibly 2 parts) would've been justified. The love subplot is unbelievable. At least in the movie. And, the movie seems to go a bit downhill near the end. So, conclusion: good movie, but not great."
"safra176","8","2","9","12 April 2012"," its okay.
","It was a book first and I read them all. This movie is better then twilight but not as good as harry potter. It was not exactly like the books but its hard to make it just like the books. Most people that I am seeing that are writing reviews on this movie have not read the book so they don't understand why so many people love it. They thought the whole movie was weird, like why make kids fight to the death. It's explained so read the book. In this movie things were not right there in black and white some people did not get that as well, you have to think a little bit why things happened they way they did just because its not directly said does not make it bad. The one thing that bothered me was it just did not show how gruesome it really was. The games are bloodthirsty, sick, psychotic. Did not show that as I thought it would. It did not to be rated R but it just needed to show how the kids suffer in the games. A few things were changed that did not bother me minor things. It was not the best it could be but when you read the book you will understand that they can't do everything exactly like the book. Also Gale was not talked about enough. Gayle would always call katniss, katnip. He liked her and you knew it. Gale plays and important part later in the story so why they cut him out, Idk. The movie was boring at the beginning, like the book but it is showing you who katniss is. Before you see the movie read the books otherwise you will not understand the point of the book. You would think the book is okay because of the movie which is wrong. READ THE BOOK THEN SEE THE MOVIE."

","I often try to watch the movies of a series first and then read the books as the books are often a lot better than the movie which it ruins it. Personally, I have not read the book, but several of my friends have and I can tell they are not able to enjoy it at the level I did.<br/><br/>The length of the movie is great, the first half keeps you hoping you haven't reached actually reached half way, and the second half is full of suspense and action. However, there were two major flaws, at least for me.<br/><br/>1: The first half of the movie more or less focused on the importance of getting sponsors. Everything they did was to make an impression, impress, and hope for the sponsors to help them in actual Hunger Games. Again, this was the WHOLE second half of the movie. What happened? They got TWO things from the sponsors. I would have thought based on half of the movie, the Hunger games would revolve a lot more around items from sponsors. And may I add, neither of them were vital. Some healing lotion for a burn wound, which sure, could have caused an infection later on, but it couldn't have been THAT bad since she was running a lot after she got it. And soup. Yes warm delicious soup. Just tasty soup that he had one sip of (though I guess they finished it, they just didn't show it?). But the point is, there wasn't really any real contribution from the sponsors, which is again, as I've said several times, was the plot of the first half of the movie.<br/><br/>2: The filming. Oh god the filming. It's like you're sitting on a roller-coaster sometimes. I felt nauseous, I actually thought I was because I was excited, but it turns out it was the filming causing it. I had to stand up and look away from the movie a couple of times and regain my status quo. I wasn't the only one that had to do this either might I add.<br/><br/>Despite these two flaws, I still enjoyed it thoroughly. Perhaps not worth an eight, but from personal enjoyment, I'll give it an eight."

","""May the odds be ever in your favor.""<br/><br/>Check out my full review at: http://reelstorymovies.blogspot.com/2012/04/hunger-games.html<br/><br/>The Hunger Games was a disturbing sci-fi dystopian tale of futuristic North America, that has been replaced by Panem, a country made up of 12 districts ruled by a dictatorship called the Capitol, who yearly pits one male and one female (ages 14-19 years old) from each district against each other in an arena in a battle to the death until one child remains.<br/><br/>Visually, the movie is beautiful and has cool special effects as described in the young adult novel published with the same name. However, the disturbing plot is the less brilliant aspect of the film. The movie takes a long time to get into the meat of the story, namely, the Hunger Games. Much of the time, the film feels more like someone is reading you a (more boring) book instead of actually watching it.<br/><br/>This is not a compliment. The movie feels like it follows very closely with the book (something I have read), but there are parts where instead of connecting emotionally with the characters and really feeling the fear, the exhilaration, or the remorse of the ""games"".<br/><br/>Part of the problem with the film is that much of the book consists of Katniss, the lead character, and her thoughts and emotions running through her. The author, Suzanne Collins (a writer for Emmy-nominated children's hits Clarissa Explains it All and The Mystery Files of Shelby Woo among other things) uses the countless thoughts and emotions surging through Katniss' brain to tell the tale of her emotions and of how she copes with the horrors of living in the impoverished Seam of District 12, how she disobeys the Capitol by hunting in the off-limits forest nearby her home, and her feelings towards marriage, raising kids in a terrifying world like Panem, and her interests in two male friends.<br/><br/>These thoughts were not provided in the film to its detriment. Collins captures in her novels so seamlessly who Katniss really is that as readers we can relate to her, feel for her and understand her fears in such a world, whereas the movie feels more emotionally distant. It's much harder in the film to really understand these ""kids"" fighting against one another and oftentimes as observers, the viewers are more just watching what goes on, on the screen and reacting.<br/><br/>The movie lacks character development and love interests between the main characters. It struggles to really connect viewers to the grotesque acts on the scene and it really hurts the movie as a whole.<br/><br/>Still, millions of viewers have flocked to the film the past couple of weeks, as it has earned over $250 million at the box office in its opening two weeks, however, the film was a bit disappointing in some of the areas that are most important areas.<br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence plays a terrific Katniss Everdeen and Woody Harrelson gives a memorable performance as the bumbling drunk, Haymitch Abernathy. The others give an average performance and are forgettable.<br/><br/>For me, I left the theater feeling disappointed at Gary Ross' attempts to re-create the same feeling Collins created in her novels. Instead of feeling for these poor kids, I feel nauseous.<br/><br/>My Score – Overall Rating: 6.75 out of 10 Plot: 7 out of 10 Character Development: 6 out of 10 Acting: 6 out of 10 Audio/Visuals: 8 out of 10"

","Happy Hunger Games! May the odds be ever in your favor!<br/><br/>The most anticipated movie of 2012 has finally hit to big screen with a great bang and continues worldwide. The first installment of the trilogy, The Hunger Games is undoubtedly garnered great popularity .<br/><br/>The movie depicts on the Hunger Games, an annual festivity of the oppressive Capitol where every district must provide one boy and one girl called tributes to fight one another in an arena televised, depleted with obstacles to venture until last tribute standing wins. An annual reminder that districts are totally at Capitol's mercy and not to repeat the past uprising.<br/><br/>The book itself shows violence, watching bunch of kids competing and kill each other to garner the much coveted price, their lives. To keep true to the pages of the book, the movie revealed it but lessens it. The movie encompasses drama, adventure and romance. The scene where the actual game started was totally climactic, bloody and intense. The good thing is although climactic, the sound is partially deprived to lessen it realistic perception of violence.<br/><br/>I really admire how the director was able to interpret the role of Katniss since the book was mostly of her feelings and thoughts. Katniss struggles on issues on trust, handling of rebellion, and hope. At first,she is bothered if she could gain trust to Peeta in the first place they will soon kill each other. The time has come that Katniss thought she was betrayed not knowingly, Peeta makes her safe from the Career Tributes. In the end, they ended up as star-crossed lovers. It is quite disappointing some parts were left out. There is no existence of Madge in the movie, the one supposed to give Katniss a mocking jay pin not a vendor in the Hob and her only friend, the red-hatted Avox, which seems to have part in Mockingjay and no Peeta's father. Their are some of skips like in Katniss is about to die starving for water, District 11's bread given to her after the death of Rue and Peeta's prosthetic leg which are also important to spice up the movie. But overall, actors absolutely portrayed their role very well, staying true to the pages of the bestselling novel. Actors were perfectly fitted to the characters of the book.<br/><br/>The movie is so good but the book is a way better. It is crucial to read the book in order to convey its message, somewhat feel the impact, to understand some part of the book and feel the imaginative aura.<br/><br/>The effects are stellar every battle realistic and genuine.<br/><br/>It depicts in ravage and systematic violence. The movie/book didn't provoke any propensities to its audience/reader. Its main character particularly Katniss, take a stand to rebel the on power against the Capitol. Despite of playing with vigor and forced to commit violence, she acts to commit sympathy. She took care of the corpse of her little ally, Rue and felt guilty for killing the boy from District 1 which she didn't know at all. This could be the sign of her rebellion against the tyrannical government. Also, She and Peeta tried to swallow poisonous berries when the game makers revoke its previous rule that only one will be proclaimed as victor. The game will lose its integrity if there is no victor. That was the reason why they became the victor.<br/><br/>All I can say that the movie is outstanding. It is good that there's another installment of The Hunger Games trilogy to look forward for. Deserves 8.3/10."
"joopitar","7","2","9","9 April 2012"," A worthy adaptation
","I'll start off by saying; I have been a long time fan of The Hunger Games book series since my girlfriend recommended it to me. I read them all cover to cover within a week and a half, and I am not even an avid reader. In short, the books are highly addictive, and very thought provoking.<br/><br/>When I heard that a film was in production for the first book, I was scared they would turn the whole thing into a ""Twilight Phenomenon"", a bad movie for 12-year-old girls to scream and rave about. And how wrong I was, this film is a very good adaptation of the book! I particularly enjoyed the added perspective of the game makers, which is something not detailed in the book. I thought the use of flashbacks to explain Katniss' family situation was appropriate and helped with the pacing of the film. Jenifer Lawrence was perfect for the role of Katniss; every wince of pain, every nervous line, every forced smile was very convincing.<br/><br/>My only complaint with this film is Garry Ross's use of shaky cam throughout the action sequences; I understand he was trying to emulate the book's first person perspective, but I felt that it was over done, to the point of nauseating. Some sequences were hard to follow because you couldn't physically see what was happening. On the other hand, if the camera work had been steadier, the action would have been shown in much greater detail and brutality, bringing the film's classification closer to an ""R"" (or MA 15+ in Australia), which in my opinion would have been in keeping with the book's graphic and brutal style.<br/><br/>But never the less, this is a worthy adaptation of an amazing novel; acting is brilliant, sets are convincing and characters were very true to their ""written word counterparts"". Despite some nauseating camera work, I thoroughly enjoyed this film and recommend it to anyone over the age of 13. But most of all, I recommend reading the books, they are well worthy of your attention."
"moviegirl181","9","2","9","6 April 2012"," The best film adaption! -Amazing
","What a fantastic movie! As a big fan of the Hunger Games series by Suzanne Collins, I went to see the film adaption and was so pleasantly surprised. Director Gary Ross has done an exceptional job bringing the fantastic beginning of the epic trilogy to the screens and producing it in such a way that it will leave the audience hungry for more! <br/><br/>The Hunger Games of 16-year-old hunter, Katniss Everdeen who lives in the fantastical and futuristic world of Panem. Every year, there is an important and popular television show called ""The Hunger Games"" where two tributes (one male and one female) from each of the twelve districts and made to compete to the death for the entertainment of the ruling and powerful, Capitol. Katniss Everdeen, a courageous and independent girl who has to hunt food to feed her family finds herself being the tribute from district 12, the poorest district if Panem where most of the civilians live in poverty. And there, the audience goes on an epic adventure.<br/><br/>In a way, the movie ""The hunger Games"" was amazing and could be better than the book. The setting and sceneries were beautifully filmed. Gary Ross got is absolutely right with the way the districts, the Capitol and the arena of the games were supposed to be like and this brought so much life and beauty to the movie. The extra scenes added to the movie where we could watch the actions of the game-makers as they plotted the games, the commentators and the reaction of the audience in the district and the Capitol gives more insights that the novel. I was really impressed with the cast, Jennifer Laurence as Katniss Everdeen, Josh Hutcherson as Peeta Mellark, Woody Harrelson as Haymitch, Elizabeth Banks as Effie, Lenny Kravitz as Cinna, Stanley Tucci as Caesar Flickerman (my favorite) and all the tributes. All these actors played the character the way it was supposed to be. The action scenes were brilliant ; the fight in the Cornocopia, the hounds, the attack of the tracker jackers, etc. could have not been more better. Gary Ross ignored a few minor which will be noticed by those who have read the book but the end result was brilliant and epic as the storyline was so well explained. The Hunger Games is the best film adaption I have ever seen! <br/><br/>I cannot express my thoughts more by saying that The Hunger Games is a must-see and is guaranteed to disappoint anyone!"
"maureen56239","8","2","9","5 April 2012"," Am I the only one who it was actually pretty good?
","First off, I just want to say I absolutely LOVE the books. They are fantastic. Of course a movie will never be as good at the book, this is just a fact. But I thought the movie was really really good! They stuck to the plot line very well. I mean of course there were many things missing, and some of the things that were missing were BIG things. I also thought they could have put more time into some of the scenes for example Rue's death could've been just a little more dramatic and taken a little longer. But for the most part I thought it was pretty acceptable. However I understand that you cannot fit a 371 page book into 2 and half hours, and for what they did, I thought it was pretty well made. I think people are being just a little bit too judgmental about it. I loved the movie!"
"aharmas","9","2","9","4 April 2012"," Amazing and Deeper Than Expected
","Collins wrote, and a very talented of professionals have turned into an experience, a film that combines both spectacle and very piercing social insight about what societies have been, are, and could eventually become.<br/><br/>In this oppressive universe, humans have been degraded in more than one way, and every year, as punishment their precious children are subjected to savagery than we can hardly fathom, but in the end it's just a reflection of what society already does, feasting upon the misery of many, and sometimes, it's broadcast in order to appease the despair and negative that otherwise would overcome us if people actually opened their eyes.<br/><br/>Our heroine discovers she must fight hard to get to the end in one piece; wondering at various time where she stands, and when she will lose her humanity, her ability to value her and others human life. Others have phrases expressing than hunting a person is no different from hunting an animal, but she refuses to agree with that.<br/><br/>Much more effective than her turn in ""Winter's Tale"", Jennifer Lawrence is perfect as the young woman who conveys through her expressions and actions what her world has become. With some impressive production design, we are also able to witness and evoke our own reactions to a world where excess is part of the luckier classes' lifestyle.<br/><br/>The suspense is sometimes so intense, one can barely hang in there. With some very good editing, we are spared some graphic moments, but these don't lose any of their impact because we still ""see"" clearly what is going on. The film works really well as a unit, but the smooth set up and transition is in place for what promises to be a very interesting turn of events in the upcoming two thirds of the trilogy.<br/><br/>""Hunger Games"" is a magnificent film."
"MC1-Bjornson","8","2","9","4 April 2012"," Game On
","""The Hunger Games"", Rated ""PG-13"" for Adult Situations, Mild Language, Some Graphic Violence. Running Time: 2hrs.&22mns.<br/><br/>My Take *** (Out of ****) <br/><br/>It's been about four months since I last reviewed a film about a dystopian future. Stories like this are great at making social commentaries about a caste society's impact on people. During the McCarthyism of the 1950s, Ray Bradbury and other science fiction writers used the conventions of these dystopian worlds to discuss ideas and morale tales with their readers. The format was a way to discuss war, sex, politics and religion by dressing these stories up in such a way that they would be passed off as ""fantasy"" or ""make-believe"" to get around the era's intolerances for points of view that were considered inappropriate or even un-American. Today it is easier to openly discuss these grand themes people without fear of prosecution. People are hungry for these kinds of stories and I suspect they will never be out of vogue.<br/><br/>Proving my point, ""The Hunger Games"" currently has the third highest grossing opening weekend at the U.S. box office (following ""The Dark Knight"" [2008] and ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part II"" [2011]).<br/><br/>Based on the young adult novel of the same name, ""The Hunger Games"" takes place in a future that is far beyond its post-apocalyptical origins. Where the North American countries once were is now the nation of Panem with a grandiose capital and elite ruling class. Far beyond the city limits are 12 impoverished districts.<br/><br/>To keep the districts in check, the ruling class has devised ""The Hunger Games."" They serve as both a harsh reminder of the previous world, before the ""ages ago"" post-nuclear horror, and to quell any potential uprising against the elitist government. Through a lottery, each of the 12 districts must offer both a boy and girl between ages 12 and 18 as ""tributes"" to fight each other to the death in a woodland arena until only one child.<br/><br/>This being a form of reality entertainment, tributes require sponsorship endorsements much like NASCAR drivers do. The financial and popular support from the viewership helps to foster an interest in the perils of our youthful gamers. Anything for ""must-see TV,"" I guess. These gladiatorial games are televised live to the world with cameras hidden throughout the arena to capture every single movement from every single participant. Safeguards and arsenals are in place to keep the ""tributes"" on task and prevent their escape.<br/><br/>Skilled archer and hunter Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence, ""X-Men: First Class"") is very protective of her younger sister Primrose (Willow Shields, ""R.L. Stine's The Haunting Hour""). So much in fact, Katniss becomes is the first volunteer to enter into The Hunger Games in lieu of her sister's defining lottery drawing. Also from District 12 is the dopey-eyed Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson, ""Journey 2: The Lost Island""). The two kids are acquainted with each other, yet Peeta has underlying feelings for Katniss. How will this impact the outcome of this year's Hunger Game? <br/><br/>President Coriolanus Snow (Donald Sutherland) leads Panem mercilessly, though he projects a public image of calmness and congeniality. He is not too thrilled about how the Head Gamemaker Seneca Crane (Wes Bentley, ""Underworld: Awakening"") is handling the affection between Katniss and Peeta in front of global viewers. After all, there is world to keep in line.<br/><br/>Suzanne Collins wrote the original novel. She was reportedly inspired to write the book by flipping through television channels. She noted a reality show on one channel and a military invasion on another. With some Greek influence added, she was able to conjure a story about loss, heroism and also make a social statement on poverty, starvation, oppression and the devastating effects of war on people.<br/><br/>The themes from Collins' book are present in the screen adaptation and are handled well. The culture of the goal-mining District 12 reminded me of Amish communities in terms of plain dress and simple living. It is interesting to note the book is published by Scholastic, which from my childhood were the books that you used to send away through a grade school book order. Funny to think Scholastic are now the ones behind a teen-aimed fable where young people carve out each other's entrails on live TV in return for riches. My, how times have changed.<br/><br/>In spite of the positive reviews and strong box-office numbers, ""The Hunger Games"" is drawing criticism on allegations of racism, sexism and unrealistic body image. I don't think the movie intends to be anything more than a commentary on social classes, such as wealth and poverty. These have been absolutes from the dawn of the world.<br/><br/>Though it is a good film, ""The Hunger Games"" feels a little incomplete. The set-up is good, but I know there is more to this story. The novel is followed by two sequels ""Catching Fire"" and ""Mockingjay."" As of this writing, the second book will be made into a movie and released in late 2013 and I have no doubt a third movie will be made. I suspect when ""The Hunger Games"" is viewed in the context with the other two stories it will be more rounded and complete.<br/><br/>""The Hunger Games"" is a satisfactory fable with solid performances and good action. It's refreshing to see a movie targeted at teen audiences that is witty and engaging. The ""Team Edward"" film series springs to mind. After all, the themes of war, starvation and poverty are a stark contrast to ""Does my sparkly vampire boyfriend like me?"" ""The Hunger Games"" does things right and whetted my appetite for more. I'm sure the upcoming installments will be the payoff. So far, the trilogy is off to a decent start."
"nightowl227","8","2","9","3 April 2012"," It was amazing, and pretty close to the book
","My views on this movie are completely different than most fans'. I read so many reviews saying how bad and how much a disappointment this movie was and I have to say that I completely disagree. I loved the movie, and I've wanted to see it again since I saw it on opening weekend. I think the problem is that so many of the fans go see in thinking that it's going to be exactly like the book, and the truth is, it can't be. It can't be exactly like the book unless its x amount of hours long. They can't get every scene, every thought, and every line into 2 hours. It's impossible. So I think the reason why I love it so much is because I went in as if it was just another movie, as if it wasn't a book at all. I didn't go in with low expectations and didn't go in with high expectations and I think that made a difference. I mean, don't get me wrong, that's not to say that I didn't compare it to the book. I did and I thought it was very true to the book. I was really excited when I found out that it was 2 ½ hours long and even more so when I found out that that's including a 20 minute cut (which I hope will be on the DVD release, like an extended version.) A lot of people said that it felt rushed to them and I didn't get that feeling at all. I thought it had a perfect pace. The beginning of the movie was very heart-wrenching, the reaping, the goodbye'severything was just so depressing and amazing at the same time. It was better than I expected it to be. There were some scenes that were so emotional that I was shaking, trying so hard not to cry. I remember shaking excessively while watching the reaping, it was just really emotional, and heart –wrenching. It really got to me. And there were other scenes where I literally stopped breathing because it was so intense and suspenseful. I really like Jennifer Lawrence's portrayal of Katniss. I thought she did phenomenal, and I truly believe that there isn't one person out there that could have done better. Before I saw the movie, I read a review that said that she was Katniss. And I didn't know exactly what they meant by that until I saw the movie. And, let me tell you something, SHE IS KATNISS. SHE DID AMAZING. There's a lot of controversy going on saying that she wasn't skinny enough and that she had too many curves and honestly—that didn't bother me. Her portrayal of Katniss was amazing and to methat was all that mattered. I thought Josh Hutcherson did amazing too. He was Peeta, just like Jennifer was Katniss. I was very pleased with all the actors and how they portrayed their roles. Although Woody Harrelson's portrayal of Haymitch wasn't myfavorite but I overall, I think he did good. There were things I didn't like about it. But I think I have more good things to say about it than bad things. I loved the Capitol and the Capitol people. The movie is in the third person point-of-view and that had its pro's and con's. I thought it was cool seeing the behind-the-scenes stuff, like seeing the Control room in the Capitol, and seeing things you didn't get to really read about in the book. That was definitely cool. But you know since it wasn't in Katniss's perspective, it did change some things, and the feelings you felt reading the book weren't as intense, you know? It worked though, how they did it. The cinematography was really cool. The way they filmed it made you feel like you were there, which was cool at some points and at other timesit was a bit annoying. Like in the beginning of the movie, the camera was shaking quite a bit but it either got better throughout the movie or you just got used to it, not quite sure. I didn't think the relationship between Katniss and Rue was really developedwhich was a bit of a bummer and I wished their scenes together were longer but the scenes they did have were really good. Once they got in the Arena, things really started getting intense. At some points, I stopped breathing. The killing scenes were good. My favorite scene is the Tracker Jacker scene, which is one of the scenes where I literally stopped breathing. It was so intense! Overall, I thought it was a great movie and I thought it was really close to the book. And I can't wait 'till Catching Fire comes out!"
"japamo","8","2","9","3 April 2012"," ""The Hunger Games"" is a Well-Constructed ""Chimera Movie"" Largely Supported by Jennifer Lawrence's performance as Katniss,
","So what is a ""Chimera"" movie? Well, in Greek mythology a Chimera is a fire-breathing monster composed of a lion's forequarters, a goat's hindquarters, and a snake for a tail. If you prefer, it's an outlandish ""Frankenstein monster"" creature, made of wildly different parts. Therefore, I define a ""Chimera"" movie as one created from wildly different but familiar movies. Besides ""Truman Show"" ,""Wizard of Oz', ""Logan's Run"" ""The Running Man"", and ""The Most Dangerous Game,'' let me add to this laundry list by mentioning other movie and literature references like Shirley Jackson's short story ""The Lottery"", ""Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome"", ""Gladiator"", ""Spartacus"" and other Roman Empire spectacle movies, ""Alice's Adventures in Wonderland"" (Elizabeth Banks's character Effie Trinket reminded me of Helen Bonham Carter's Queen of Hearts), ""Robin Hood"", and ""Romeo and Juliet"" (especially toward the end of the movie when game contestants and ""star-crossed lovers"" Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) and Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) consider eating some berries).<br/><br/>Okay enough of that. Movies borrow all the time. What's important is that they use their borrowings well. So, does ""The Hunger Games"" (hereafter THG)utilize its myriad movie parts wisely and effectively? I believe it does, and that it does so due in large part to Lawrence's fairly nuanced and commanding portrayal as Katniss.<br/><br/>Without repeating too much of the plot (I hope) since other posters have done that quite efficiently, I felt that Katniss exhibited the proper mixture of tension, resourcefulness, courage, and resoluteness to make THG's portrayal of a sadistic, decadent United States of Dystopia more than halfway believable. We get a glimpse of her pre-Games struggle to keep her and her impoverished mother and younger sister Primrose (Willow Shields) fed and alive with her archery skills. We appreciate her desperate but noble and prudent gesture to volunteer to take Primrose's place in the Games (because we suspect the fragile, terrified Prim would easily have been eliminated). We understand her brusque, standoffish demeanor as she negotiates the pre-Game trials and trainings and subtly introduces us to this bizarre world of the garish elite that control the human sacrifice games. We get hints of her sly intelligence and tenacious will to live as, despite her fiery pride, she does listen to former Hunger Games champion and dissolute current sponsor Haymitch Abernathy (Woody Harrelson) to curry favor with these grotesque aristocrats in order to improve her odds. She does the same with fellow District 12 contestant Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) with whom she shares an ambiguous supportive and dismissive relationship; in other words, are they just acquaintances forced to be uncertain allies under cruel circumstances, or are they becoming friends or something even more? Does Katniss have a plan to defy Panem's masters (her shooting the apple from the roasted pig's mouth during training and her three finger salute to the districts watching the Games sure seem like it) or is she trying to get the odds of her survival more in her favor? Katniss's tantalizingly elusive performance sells us on the seriousness of her strange predicament, and so we become invested in the workings of THG's deliberate, patchwork plot, and the fates of its characters, primarily Katniss's.<br/><br/>Without Katniss to guide us, I'm afraid that THG might have become more sluggish under the weight of its movie and literature borrowings. With the possible exception of Peeta, the rest of THG's characters, I feel, get scant time to develop their motivations and goals. The other Games contestants (except maybe the crafty but soulful Rue (Amanida Stenberg)) are simply one-dimensional, sketchy victims. How about learning a little more about them? Lenny Kravitz's sympathetic sponsor Cinna has only about a couple of meaningful interactions with Katniss as he helps her overcome her insecurities and doubts. Banks' Effie gives us just a fleeting taste of the flaky, superficial decadence of Panem's (is that short for Pan-Empire, or All-Empire?) elite. Regarding our introduction to the destitute District denizens, besides Katniss and her soul-sapped family, we barely meet Katniss's handsome beau(?) and fellow hunter Gale Hawthorne (Liam Hemsworth), who seems to be introduced mainly for a potential menage a trois with Katniss and Peeta. As for Panem president Coriolanus Snow (Donald Sutherland), he is genteelly, quietly menacing and inscrutable, which is okay, but it would have been nice to have at least a couple more scenes to establish a little bit more about his character.<br/><br/>THG also seems to have logical inconsistencies. The main objective of the Games is straightforward enough (be the sole survivor), but the rules are certainly arbitrary and changeable from moment to moment. Furthermore, the Game creators are omniscient controllers. Even if a winner emerges and the populace is entertained, the President could arrange to have the winner executed sometime later. Some ""hope""! So why participate? Personally, if I'm a contestant and likely to die anyway, I would defy this rigged deathtrap and die on my own terms. I am surprised that Peeta didn't share that sentiment.<br/><br/>It doesn't really matter. THG is a sturdy, involving movie that combines adventure, romance, danger, and social commentary in an agreeable, palatable, almost unsettlingly innocuous way. Without Lawrence's Katniss, I would have rated THG 6 stars. With Katniss's complex but commanding character, THG deserves 8 stars. She manages to make us squirm a little about our ironic enjoyment of kids being compelled to kill each other for the pleasure of a corrupt administration, and to make us reflect a little (though not as much as it could have) about the savage, violent inequalities of our present governments and societies."

","This is my first review, thought to give it a try; especially because there are so many different reviews...<br/><br/>Also with different aspects: 1. those who compare it to Battle Royale: This movie is almost epic, at least is has a better story, character development and depth than Battle Royal; so if you liked Battle Royale, this is even a better movie...<br/><br/>2. those complaining about the shaky camera: I didn't like it to, but forget about it - it is only in the build-up of the movie (first 30 minutes or so), then the camera work gets normal.<br/><br/>3. those who read the book: It is not as deep and the time line and some things are not like in the book - like in all movies based on good books... You just cant compare reading and using your own imagination with a movie; but it still is a good movie...<br/><br/>4. For those who watch a lot of movie: Battle Royale meets In Time and the whole thing is done better ;)<br/><br/>To sum up: I really enjoyed the movie and am hoping for good sequels ;) <br/><br/>PS: Finally the youth of today has something better than Twilight to watch ;)"
"midiwall","9","2","9","1 April 2012"," Perfect support for the book!
","There are two groups of people that will watch this movie. Those that have read the book first and those that haven't. It won't be worthwhile to read the book _after_ seeing the movie.<br/><br/>The short form here is do NOT see the movie until you've read the book. Period. If you see the movie first, you will be lost, confused and have NONE of the depth that the book provides.<br/><br/>There are a bunch of folks out there that are dropping super-low ratings about the movie here on IMDb and other sites. They're being very elitist and poor sports. The movie is an excellent _augmenter_ to the book, it is not (and is not meant to be) a replacement for the book. _No_ single-sitting movie can replace the depth that a book can provide you, and the days of the mini-series are long gone.<br/><br/>I won't drop spoilers here, but there are certainly things (and fairly key plot points) in the book that are glossed over, or eliminated entirely. That's a sad point, and will leave the non-book readers wondering what all the fuss is about.<br/><br/>Bottom line - READ THE BOOK FIRST and you will LOVE the movie. We did."
"Davi-188-595015","9","2","9","31 March 2012"," Simply amazing movie.
","Now I haven't read the book or knew much about this movie other than reading the reviews and synopsis beforehand. What I can tell you is that I watch a ton of movies. I actually find it hard to find movies that I haven't seen.<br/><br/>I thought everything about this movie was perfect and I'm left off with the feeling where I can't wait for the sequel. Thus is my first review on here because I felt I needed to add a review after reading a bunch of bad reviews on here. Those bad reviews MUST be people who purposely write bad reviews to lower the score of a movie.<br/><br/>I read people complaining about ""people who haven't read the book aren't going to understand why it's called the Hunger Games"". A: it's not important (right now in this first movie at the very least), B: unless you're not very smart you'll figure out why yourself quickly, C: who cares.<br/><br/>I literally think this movie was perfect. They took out all of the unnecessary parts and you're left with a work of art. I think the sequels will fill in those remaining details and new stories.<br/><br/>I also heard someone compare it to Battle Royale. That movie was cool but doesn't even compare to this, that movie was just a lil too far fetched. Also heard a comparison with Runningman, a great movie for its time. I loved that movie too and watched it along with every other Swartzenager movie ever made. Hunger Games is better.<br/><br/>It's most certainly worth your time. It's not gory because it doesn't need to be. It's got action but it's not overkill. Its got romance but not too much (im your typical guy, don't really dig girl flicks). This movie touches base with a lot of genres.<br/><br/>Everything is just perfect."
"iammabuqing","8","2","9","31 March 2012"," Last man no choice, the first man choose
","Jennifer Lawrence(Katniss) attracted all my attention. She is brave, focused and logical. The action to be a volunteer to replace her sister proves her audacity without a word. I was surprised when she became outraged when Peeta revealed on -air his long-time unrequited love for her(i didn't find that sweet but immature instead). She doesn't want to be perceived as weak. She has only one goal in the mind-to win the game and come back home. She knows what she wants and try by all means to get it since day one (when she almost forked mentor's hands). She is real, not pretentious and is in stark contrast with other tributes who tried to win others favors by flattering and fake confidence. She honesty to admit not knowing how to make friends already wins her alliances and supporters. She is morally upright and honest. People love her because who she is, not who she pretends to be. In fact, her mentor Haymitch Abernathy tries really hard to mobilize resources and convince the ""upper class"" weirdos/game planner/autocrats in the Capitol to not let Katniss die. He sends her life-saving medicine and guidance to win/after winning. Cinne, Katniss's stylist helps her to win people's attention and supports her throughout.<br/><br/>Coming out of the game alive needs extreme mental alertness(sleeping on the tree at night). Not killing other people does not mean people don't want to kill you. The only time Katniss kills is to defend herself when she is being attacked. She reacts really fast and has very good self- defense techniques except when she was almost killed by the tribute from district 2. Katniss does not disclose emotions yet take people's true love seriously. That is not to say she is emotional and contain those feelings without expressing them. She is just very logical/focused/goal- oriented and not love-awakened because I cant see her true feelings during the entire movie, not Gale, not Peeta. (a little perplexed when she kissed Peeta-aha). Interestingly, cold and logical people are usually depicted as serious goal-getters. Although Katniss fits into that category,yet kissing, sporadic sudden softness in her eyes and trembling insecurely before the games starts gives a whole different dimension to her character.<br/><br/>The game is not fair and the tributes audiences are constantly being manipulated. Adding high-tech beasts (i was terrified when that three dogs first appeared, luckily i have someone by my side), parachutes robots and forest fire from the fancy monitoring headquarters is a fantastic juxtaposition of the real working world,isn't' it? The adding of game provisiosn to create the image of two star-crossed young lovers is actually the best possible outcome of Haymitch 's effort in helping the two protagonists, which is contrasted with the ignorance from the authorities.<br/><br/>To be extremely focused/ambitious/brave/competitive, she deserves all the respect and final win. Actually i think she would make a very capable female investment banker too. This is a very good career prep movie for banker-to-bes. ..lol..jk...."
"zardoz-13","9","2","9","31 March 2012"," The Games We Play
","Futuristic science fiction yarns are usually dystopian. ""Pleasantville"" director Gary Ross' adaptation of the Suzanne Collins bestseller ""The Hunger Games"" sticks to the formula. Mind you, when we think about the future, we often dream about hopes fulfilled, life idyllic, etc. In dystopian science fiction, everything is a nightmare. In ""The Hunger Games,"" America—as we know it—has long since collapsed after a devastating civil war. The post-apocalyptic society that emerges from the ruins—Panem—resorts to an annual televised spectacle as a way of controlling the masses. Twenty-four preteens and teens slaughter each other in a ritualistic sacrifice until only one survives. The Collins' novel appeared in 2008. Whether she knew about the sensational Japanese actioneer ""Battle Royale"" is anybody's guess. In ""Battle Royale,"" an entire class of high school children is gassed and shipped off to a remote island. They are armed to the teeth with every kind of weapon known to man and forced to kill until only one is standing. ""Battle Royale"" was an audacious epic that went into graphic detail about violence. ""The Hunger Games"" qualifies as a superlative thriller that softens the content of the violence. Make no mistake; children die in ""The Hunger Games."" This PG-13 rated kill-or-be-killed opus cannot compare with ""Battle Royale"" in terms of sheer violence. No, I haven't read the novel, but friends have assured me neither Ross nor co-scenarist author Suzanne Collins have deviated drastically from the source material. Despite its distant futuristic setting, this exhilarating escapade is first a commentary about our current obsession with televised survival games. Second, this sci-fi fantasy recognizes of our insatiable bloodlust. Spectacles similar to ""The Hunger Games"" occurred as back as the Roman arenas where gladiators fought to the death. Games of survival have been with us the dawn of time. <br/><br/>Each year, the twelve districts that make up the nation of Panem randomly select two youngsters between 12 and 18 years of age. The districts send one boy and one girl each as ""tribute"" to represent them in the homicidal games. Indeed, once the children arrive at the opulent Capitol, they are decked out in elaborate costumes and paraded around in chariots before a massive audience. An even larger audience watches them 'live' on television. We don't learn much about the government. Later, these contestants are shown how to wield swords, knives, bows & arrows, but they are not allowed to field firearms. Not only do experts train them in the use of these lethal weapons, but they also have others who coach them so they may attract patrons. These patrons are often useful. Sometimes they deliver crucial gifts during the game. These gifts almost always prolong survival. One wise mentor advises his student to treat the game as much as a popularity contest as a fight to the death. The other thing that will stand out is the way that the adults dress in ""The Hunger Games."" They look like they've received invitations for The Mad Hatter tea-party from ""Alice in Wonderland."" Stanley Tucci looks hilarious in his huge wig but has the time of his life chewing as Caesar Flickerman. He plays the equivalent to a talk show host.<br/><br/>Our heroine, Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence of ""X-Men: First Class""), comes from an impoverished, Appalachia district where the men still plunge into the bowels of the earth to excavate coal. She is depicted as an underdog from the start and demonstrates how luck rather than physical strength enables her to survive. Actually, Katniss was not the chosen one. Instead, the lottery that the officials staged amid much pomp and circumstance at the district level picked Katniss' 12-year old sister Prim (Willow Shields) as the tribute. Since she volunteered to replace her sister, Katniss is allowed to offer herself as a substitute. As the young man who accompanies Katniss to the Capitol, Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson of ""Bridge to Terabithia"") is the son of a grocery store owner. Effie Trinket (Elizabeth Banks of ""Man on a Ledge""), Haymitch Abernathy (Woody Harrelson of ""Zombieland""), and Cinna (Lenny Kravitz) advise them in their respective roles as mentors and coaches. Peeta suggests they present themselves as 'star-crossed' lovers since he has a crush on her. Predictably, Katniss objects. Nevertheless, Haymitch persuades a stubborn Katniss to participate in the deception. You see, Katniss has feelings for a guy back home, Gale Hawthorne (Liam Hemsworth of ""Knowing""), who loves her. <br/><br/>Compared with most of her adversaries, Katniss is better prepared for the ordeal. She has spent considerable time hunting in the woods with a bow & arrow. We see her spear a bird in flight with one of her arrows. Later, she gives the adults a shock in one of the best scenes when she loosens an arrow into an apple. The most exciting scenes in""The Hunger Games"" take place in a forested stretch of woods. Of course, this leafy arena is not altogether genuine. Seneca Crane (Wes Bentley of ""Gone"") supervises the games and orchestrates them from behind the scenes. The kids are loaded into tubes that lift them to the surface around a gigantic cornucopia piled high with supplies and bristling with weapons. Haymitch warns Katniss to head for the safety of the woods. Casualties are always heavy at the cornucopia. Later, he explains, she can pick up a weapon. Katniss follows Haymitch's instructions and scrambles into the woods as the carnage commences. The next time Katniss sees Peeta, he is roaming with a band lead by the pugnacious Cato (Alexander Ludwig of ""Race to Witch Mountain"") who kills without a qualm. He enjoys snapping necks. Naturally, to align our sympathies with Katniss, she starts out as an underdog and benefits from a couple of patrons. The interesting thing is that physical strength is not synonymous with winning the games.<br/><br/>Make no mistake, ""The Hunger Games"" is going to make Jennifer Lawrence as popular as the ""Twilight"" movies made Kristen Stewart."
"cat_ranchero","8","2","9","31 March 2012"," An entertaining film which (I'm sure) will be a hit
","This is a very well made film with some nice CGI in places, although I did feel it was a little over-used in a couple of scenes. There are so many similarities (in part) to other films it's hard to know where to start. I guess 'Battle Royalle' is a pretty good start, although I could see influences from; 'The Truman Show', 'Rollerball' (the original one) and 'The Running Man' in there too. I did get the impression that there is a lot more explained in the book than there was time for on the screen because I did feel I had missed out on a few plot points here and there. These particularly surrounded the relationship between Katniss and Peeta; I won't discuss it here as I don't want to go putting down spoilers. Over all though, the 142 minute running time seemed to pass quite quickly (always a good sign) and so I'm happy to deem this one Recommended.<br/><br/>My score: 8.2/10.<br/><br/>IMDb Score: 7.8/10 (based on 56,220 votes when this review was written).<br/><br/>Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score: 85/100 (based on 239 reviews counted at the time of going to press).<br/><br/>Rotten Tomatoes 'Audience' Score: 87/100 (based on 84,278 user ratings counted at the time of going to press).<br/><br/>You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster."

","I'll start by saying everyone has their own opinion, if you don't agree with mine, I'm sorry, you don't have to read this review.<br/><br/>That being said, the Hunger Games series is one of my favorite series, and ranks among Eragon and the Lord of the Rings for my favorite (in part because Collins' writing style is much more entertaining and easier to follow). That being said, I had high expectations for this movie and I am generally very critical of movies that are based off of books. I was mainly concerned with how they would manage to portray much of the content which takes place within Katniss' head as the book is written from her point of view.<br/><br/>I was not disappointed. Jennifer Lawrence did an amazing job in portraying Katniss, and if you read the book before seeing the movie, her facial expressions and reactions to each event throughout are EXACTLY what they should be.<br/><br/>I would say the book-to-movie ratio in terms of quality is comparable to Harry Potter. Read the book, and enjoy the movie!"
"viperpitdriver","10","2","9","29 March 2012"," Great Film, Awful Premise!
","O.K., I witnessed the Hunger Games! I will say that the movie itself was very well acted, the special effects were awesome, and the overall cinema was outstanding on par with any other major production, with standards well above most films. But my dad use to tell me that you can't make a silk purse out of a sows ear! I find the subject matter deeply disturbing at a moral and ideological level. I'm not going to spoil this film, but suffice to say that the author has some serious psychological issues and everyone in the movies food chain including the publishers promoters, teachers, and school administrators should seriously justify why kids killing kids is an appropriate theme for adolescents or any one else for that matter! In addition to murder, butchery, and mayhem, there are scenes of dictatorial state run lottery to kidnap innocent children from towns and subject them to an annual gladiatorial game from which 24 children ages 12 to 18 are forcibly removed from their families and sent to battle among themselves to the death for the honor of the state. This is without a doubt the most blood thirsty and morally bankrupt story I have ever witnessed. No matter how well crafted or technically written the premise is still flawed by the sycophantic wonder that would make even Adolf Hitler blush! I find that I truly hate the post-apocalyptic ""Panem"" culture to such extreme that were I a citizen of that land it would be non stop war with all their inhabitants from the central city of useless idiots and deviant corrupted socialites, to the victimized out-lands which blithely accept their fate to auction their children to the butchery and death of the games. It would not take 74 years to realize that the state and the games are an affront to any civilized sense of decency or humanity. The fact that the story justifies the killing of 1,700 children in their history as a form of healing or reconciliation for the sins of the father is an amazing tragedy of enormous proportion. Yes, it is just a story, but a sick one! Where is the outrage? Yet all through the story the characters are as quietly resigned as the sheep that watch this film. I should hope that I live in a real world that would defend our children from this brutality with more courage than the actors or audience could muster. Or at the least be among the few that would gladly eat the grapes of wrath to deny the state its victories much like the tales of Masada. At least to have death with dignity and the right to define ones own life if not in death with the personal destiny that does not benefit the state. But far more preferable it would be to serve the state its hemlock. Far better to destroy the madness than to let generations suffer a fate worst than death. To hell with Caesar! As for the author she needs to seek professional counseling and along with her all her co-conspirators. This book and film are a subtle form of child abuse and corrupting young minds with this filth ought to be a capital crime. To all the sick twisted freaks that dreamed this insanity - ""May the odds ever be in your favor""! P.S.: I am known for liking almost anything Sci-Fi, but this story is the exception to the rule. I will read all three books, borrowed of course! And I will definitely write more extensively against its failings wherever feasible. If need be I will be the sole dissenting voice against this insult. Who knows there maybe even an ""Anti-Hunger Games"" book. Certainly a manual for the liberation of Panem and all her Districts! A dissident's guide to District Freedom! Or a Guerilla Freedom Fighters Field Manual! And a message for everyone else, Wake UP!"

","The movie was quite good but it seemed so drab compared to the book.The book was so much better.They cut out so many scenes and what happened to the mayors daughter?Katniss doesn't buy the mocking jay pin,the mayor's daughter gives her the pin!So I'd say that the book was way better than the movie.Even if you don't compare the book to the movie,the movie wasn't all that good.The train journey to the Capitol was so short and so were the training sessions.Now,here's what I think about the games.The games seemed so short,like they were two days when it was actually 2 weeks.Although,some scenes were really good and funny.The movie's soundtrack is really good,it has Taylor Swift and The Sting.So the movie was actually good,but I expected so much more.Yes,I'd love to watch the movie again.""Happy Hunger Games & may the odds be ever in your favor"". :)"

","Good movie, I liked it and would recommend. But I wouldn't recommend for younger teens or pre-teens. It's a dark movie. Almost amazingly dark for a story aimed at the younger crowd. I just don't see the need for writers to glamorize murder to our children.<br/><br/>The story moves nicely in the movie. And the actors play their part quite well. I was told by a few that did read the books that it didn't follow the books very closely at all. Not much more than just the general idea of the story and most parts. Many details were changed, it seems for time or some other director driven reason.<br/><br/>Go see it, but don't take your kids."
"goarf0","6","2","9","25 March 2012"," not bad
","The only 2 complaints I have really are... Why did they let Michael J. Fox work the camera? Seriously, it was pretty shaky; especially during the action scenes. This is the only reason I gave it a 6, it was quite annoying.<br/><br/>(spoilers, kind of.) also I wish they had the old lady give her the pendant and explain the meaning of it instead of her just buying it then her sister gives it back. The could have given her 40 seconds too.<br/><br/>Other then that I liked it. It did seem a little fast paced, especially the final battle (which they removed his armor from the book :( ). Says I need 10 lines so guess I will express how I wish they gave more detail in the movie. This would've failed cause they would probably only get just to the hunger games in the first film if so. Then that would have made it fail."
"nik-estep","7","2","9","25 March 2012"," Good Movie, Not Sure it Matched the Book
","Any movie based on a book is going to be different. I know that, so does everybody else. There were deviations in the movie that I understood (the source of the mockingjay pin, for example), but there were deviations that I really don't understand (all tributes in same hovercraft to arena, Peeta not being drugged, the medicine for him curing him completely, Cato not getting body armor). To me, the biggest problem was the fundamental point of the book. A boy and girl, supposedly in love, beat the Capitol at their own game. How many kisses were there? One? No lips? Katniss isn't on stage to show her reaction when Peeta admits his love for her? Peeta himself wasn't very convincing. In my opinion, there was no ""star crossed lovers"" evident between those two, so in my opinion, the movie created a different dynamic between them that does not support the plots of the next two books (next three(?) movies).<br/><br/>If I had not read the books beforehand, I think the movie would have been somewhat confusing. I commend their additions of the game room, President Snow and Seneca Crane's discussions, showing Haymitch getting gifts, and their use of Caesar to explain some things to the audience, but the movie moved very fast, skipped a lot of stuff, and I think in general would have left an uneducated viewer a little lost. I was absolutely in love with the style of the film and its interpretation of Panem, the Capitol, the arena, etc. I give it a seven as a result, despite the reservations voiced in the first paragraph."
"tichwick","7","2","9","24 March 2012"," The Hunger Games was a good representation of the Book. But may not have been a good movie by itself!
","I figured out what was wrong with ""The Hunger Games"", it was too much like the book, and not enough like a movie. the way books are written is different than the way movies are made. when a book is made into a movie it can't be directly ported, it needs to be adapted. when I watched ""The Hunger Games"" the movie didn't seem to flow. I think this is because they didn't adapt it from the books enough. you can't just film scene by scene from a book and and expect it to work in a movie, just because it worked for the book doesn't mean it's how it should be done on screen. when a book is written, the story is told but with a movie it is different because the story must be presented completely visually more or less. although the ""The Hunger Games"" portrayed all the Scenes from the book well, it did not feel the way the books felt. I give it props for being in line with the books, but certain things have to be different from a book in order to be a good film. it just didn't feel right. I'm not saying to cut scenes out I'm saying there is a better way of making the movie flow, that is different from the book. for a person who hasn't read the books, who doesn't understand everything thats going on, this movie might not seem very good, this is the fault of the movie makers. I honestly almost wish I hadn't read the books, so I could see what impression I'd have gotten when I saw it. but I wish I could have both views..."
"Fever","7","2","9","24 March 2012"," the book was better
","**spoilers**<br/><br/>I read the trilogy recently--it was phenomenal. Being excited for the movie, I wasn't quite sure what to expect. Lost details and forgotten back stories are almost guaranteed. However, after seeing it, I honestly don't know how I feel about it. While it generally followed the book, a lot of things got lost in translation. Most of the cast was perfect: Katniss, Gale, Effie, Cinna, Cato, (the jury is still out on Harrelson as Haymitch). But Rue was terribly disappointing. She wasn't at all who I imagine, it was a terrible choice. As far as the details of the story, I found it funny how Katniss found water right away, never appeared hungry or thirsty and her injuries were more flesh wounds. Did anyone notice that she didn't lose her hearing after the explosion or Peeta didn't lose his leg? The Avox was never addressed... why? And what about the riots in District 11? What happened to the bread they gave Katniss? The muttations were disappointing too. The book described them as being morphed from dead tributes, an excellent twist; while the movie interpreted them as CGI-created wolf things. If you haven't read the book, go see it. If you've read the book, I'm afraid you'll be just as perplexed as I was. It was very similar to how I left ""New Moon"". That feeling of what? how could they forget so much? Just as the Twilight movies got better, hopefully these sequels will improve as well."

I understand making the movie PG- 13 since many kids read the book including me who was only 13 when the movie came out. They did a great job at making it PG-13 and keeping it to the story."

","I'm afraid to say it, but The Hunger Games left me starved of intrigue and commitment. Jumping on the Lord of the Rings > Harry Potter > Twilight bandwagon, the film is based off a series of popular books (that I hadn't heard of until the film arrived) and follows a young girl sent into an arena of death against other children for the entertainment of a tyrannical, self-obsessed higher society.<br/><br/>Sounds pretty grim right? Unfortunately The Hunger Games feels terribly insecure, lacking self confidence in what it can and cannot show to a 12A / PG-13 audience, and decides to meander around and waste excessive amounts of time. This is not the worst crime however, since it was expected, the worst flaw with the film is its lack of confidence in explaining itself. The plot literally makes stuff up continuously, like a child improvising a story: ""Oh, oh, now we have fireballs that appear out of nowhere! Now they make these huge monsters appear with magic! Now they get help from the outside cos they're the main characters!"" What the heck is any of this?? I didn't understand how it was happening as none of it was explained, great plot-holes loomed constantly, and with a run time of two hours and twenty, you'd think they would get around to some exposition!<br/><br/>The film also has some of the stupidest villains I've seen in a long time. We are talking 1980s cartoon villains. Not so much how they look, I dug that (even though The Fifth Element's designs by Jean-Paul Gaultier did it so much better) but how their entire society was hinged on a massive flaw i.e. The Hunger Games. Gladiatorial combat is no new concept, but it is particularly stupid when the dominant masters train up the helpless, angry majority. A majority prone to riots. Not just that, but thinking giving these poor people ""hope"" is a good idea? Hm, let's see: hope + training + wilderness survival (thanks to being shunned and native to the wilderness) + hero worship via Hunger Games = bad, stupid, retarded idea. Not to mention our heroes in this story trump them at their own game in such a ridiculously easy fashion, means they are completely useless as antagonists!<br/><br/>Anyway, I've gone on about the flaws since there are a lot The pros, well, I do like the concept (despite it being terribly implemented here) and the ""Capitol"" high society characters had some funny lines from time to time, and leading star Jennifer Lawrence was convincing as a young but strong female role model.<br/><br/>I'm sorry, but The Hunger Games strikes me as a ""for the fans"" production, I was disorientated by the insane camera work in the fight scenes (it made Transformers and Batman Begins feel like cruise holidays) and disconnected by the shallow explanations."

","After reading ""The Hunger Games"" novel, I gave it a solid 4 stars out of 5. I had a very similar reaction to this movie, an indication of the faithfulness of the book-to-film transfer.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""The Hunger Games"" sees Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) & Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) thrown into a battle-to-the death with 23 other young people as a result of a ""1984""-like dystopian society bent on total population control. Living in a society completely controlled by ""The Capitol"", Katniss & Peeta struggle to survive in the deathly competition while at the same time sending a message of hope to the thirteen districts watching the Hunger Games event.<br/><br/>In terms of being faithful to the book, this movie succeeds tremendously. Director Gary Ross takes a great written story and adeptly adapts it to the big screen. All the major events happen as written by Suzanne Collins, while even the minutiae is, for the most part, accurate. There's really nothing to get upset over in the translation, besides (of course) the usual pairing down of some background dialogue to keep the film from going even longer than its 2 hours, 22 minute runtime.<br/><br/>The casting/acting is also quite well-done. About the only cast member that didn't potentially live up to the billing was Liam Hemsworth as Gale. Other than that, I really enjoyed the two leads as well as the auxiliaries such as Donald Sutherland, Woody Harrelson, & Elizabeth Banks, to name a few.<br/><br/>Basically, ""The Hunger Games"" movie succeeds because of the strength of the original story and the faithful adaptation of that story. Because this is (at heart) a young-adult story, a lack of deeper character development & plots prevents me from giving it a full five stars (fair or not). Other than that, though, there is nothing else negative I can say about the experience."

"The-Sarkologist","5","1","3","30 January 2017"," The Running Man Was Better
","I have managed to resist watching this series ever since a friend attempted to ram it down my throat. Mind you, some people have a really annoying habit of not taking no for an answer, and these people are generally known as sales people – I believe one of the keys to being a successful sales person is the mistaken belief that a no is in fact a yes that needs to be drawn out a bit more. I guess that is why there is also this mistaken belief that when a girl says no what she is really saying is 'maybe, I just need to be convinced'. Okay, my friend is nowhere near that bad (nor is he a salesperson), but I happen to be one of those people who, when somebody is trying to persuade me to do something that I don't particularly want to do (such as buying a bottle of coke from the service station), then I end up becoming even more resistant.<br/><br/>Anyway, I finally decided to watch this film, and I have to be honest that it really didn't impress me. Okay, it wasn't bad, but it certainly wasn't anywhere near as good as some people have made it out to be. In fact, right from the beginning my thoughts where basically that this was just another version of The Running Man, however I enjoyed The Running Man so much more. In fact, the ending of this particular film seemed to be somewhat of a let down – it was anti-climatic. Okay, there are three more movies in the series, however even when we have a series of movies, I am still somewhat expecting a climatic ending.<br/><br/>So, the Hunger Games, as you have probably already worked out, is about a dystopian society where everybody is kept under control through an annual game where two children from each of the twelve districts are nominated and then sent to fight to the death. Mind you, that didn't particularly seem to be a very effective method of control, particularly since it was only held once a year, and it was also pretty clear that a lot of the districts really weren't very keen on sending their children off to die (since there were some districts that seemed to always win). In a way the Running Man was much better, and even the way our society use of sport works a lot better than this idea of an annual game. Well, they also have police who brutally suppress riots, but this seems to go against the President's belief that hope is a much better way of controlling people than fear.<br/><br/>That is true, it is just that this film doesn't really portray it all that well. Sure, this may be a dystopian future, but the thing is that these novels are supposed to paint a picture of the world in which we live in today, and the reality is that hope is a much better way of controlling a people than fear. As they say, Americans don't see themselves as oppressed because they all see themselves as temporarily embarrassed millionaires – in a way there is this belief that everybody has the opportunity to become wealthy, they just need to find the right idea, and the right time, to get there. The problem is that this is a very individualistic view of society, but then again this also works well because if we view everybody as a competitor, or a potential competitor, then we are less likely to band together and work towards the common goal of improving life for everybody.<br/><br/>Maybe this is why unions don't work so well in certain environments because everybody is competing against everybody else for the lucrative management positions, and because everybody is a competitor – they have the job that should have been mine – then they are less likely to band together and work out that it isn't each other who they are fighting against, but the powers that be that keep us fighting amongst themselves. This is another reason why sports work so well as a method of keeping people under control – sporting rivalries result in competition, and even bitterness towards those who do not support your team. However, in the end, do you actually get anything if your team wins? No, you only get bragging rights, and in the end bragging rights are simply not going to improve your quality of life."

","The Hunger Games is a film set in the dystopian future of which was north America but is now called panem, the main plot of the film is 24 kids from each district (there are 12 districts) ages 12 to 18 are randomly picked and then sent to fight to the death in an arena which is broadcasted all over the districts but before that they are put on a train where they travel to the superior city ""the capitol"" this is where the tributes will train to prepare for The Hunger Games. After a week of training the tributes are taken to the arena where there is 60 seconds before the killing starts, as the bell rings all of the tributes either run to gather of just run away. The camera work in this film is OK but there are some times when the cameras are very shaky during the kills or the running, this can be nauseating at times but you soon get used to it. I didn't enjoy the film that much (hence why I'm giving it a three- star rating) due to the fact that there are so many films that follow the same plot, but on the lighter side of things Jennifer Lawrence (Katniss) played here part really well as her acting was very good. I would recommend this film to anyone who likes dark movies or enjoys fast paced action movies. I don't really think that the plot is very believable due to the unbelievable coincidence that The two lovers in the film were chose to fight each other, and 2. That the rules changed for the FIRST TIME allowing the two people from one district to be the victors and my final reason why this story is unbelievable is that at the last minute the rules were changed back to only one victor being allowed to win so Katniss and peeta decided to kill themselves at the same time, but the capitol didn't like this so AGAIN they changed the rules back to the two victors being allowed instead of a game maker just killing either Katniss or peeta at random. In conclusion I give this film a three out of five-star rating and would recommend this film to ages 12-16."
"risner-87312","4","1","3","6 August 2016"," Clumsy transition from book to film, but it had its moments.
","In a world that exists at some point in the future following the destruction of all current civilizations, a country exists in servitude to a dictatorial ""capital"". In this world all resources are funneled away from the people who produce them, an oppressive government uses starvation and hunger as a weapon of intimidation and subjugation. In this world an annual gladiatorial completion is held pitting children from ages 11 to 18 against each other in a free for all death match that serves to entertain the tyrannical ruling class and to further demoralize and depress the subjugated masses. <br/><br/>While the story in and of itself is well conceived in the novel; which seeks to dispel the myth that we cannot control our own destiny and to also prove there is no limit to how far someone can for family, the transition to film was lacking. While many of the actors and actresses such as Donald Sutherland and Elizabeth Banks played their parts well, some of their younger cast mates didn't fully bring their performances home. Josh Hutcherson (who played Peeta Mellark) for example had the habit of never changing his facial expression throughout much of the movie which had the effect of stripping his character of emotional value and had me rooting for his romantic rival Gale, played by Liam Hemsworth, the entire time.<br/><br/>What was great about the film was the set pieces, costumes, and lighting all of which helps pull you as the viewer in a little deeper. The setting for the opening of the film in District Twelve really does have the drab and run down feeling of a nearly abandoned coal town in the Appalachians. The dull lighting and crumbling buildings help you to understand just how hard life is for the people who have to live there. This contrasts starkly with the lavish clothing and bright glass buildings in the ruling capital. These glaring contrasts do more in my opinion to underscore the struggle in the story than any other component of the film.<br/><br/>While it was not the best film it certainly did carry a good message of perseverance, determination and ultimately a ""we do crazy things for family"" type message. The ultimate theme however is about destiny. When the main characters make the conscious decision to end their own lives both as a final defiant act and as a means of protecting the people they care about they demonstrate that no matter how out of control life becomes there is still some measure of our future that is in our own hands."

","I didn't think Katniss Everdeen is beautiful at first. She is like a Asian girl, so I thought she was exotic. The set of this film is fiction and the situation will never happen to us, but the society in this film is too scared. I'm not sure, but its model may be a colony of western country or USA. However, there is a completely different point. The colonial was not white people, but people who live in Panem is white people, so this is includes irony, I think. I sad Katniss Everdeen is not so beautiful, but as the story progress, I think she has a brave heart and is cool person. <br/><br/>Most of fighting scene is grotesque, but a triangular relationship between Katniss,Peter and Gale is pure, so don't miss it."
"NateWatchesCoolMovies","8","1","3","21 May 2016"," Solid, carried by Jennifer Lawrence
","I have never read the Hunger Games books, and didn't rush out to see this first instalment when it was released. I have this thing where I sometimes resist a largely popular project simply because it's buzzing so much hype. There's a word for that that I resist even more, which starts with H, but good luck getting me to admit to that. Anywho, I did watch it one day on netflix, loved the hell out of it, and have seen every subsequent entry, up til last year's final one. It's damn great storytelling that soars on a brilliant extended performance by Jennifer Lawrence, who is the actress of her generation and a genius of the craft no matter what anyone says. People called this a slick version of Battle Royale, and while that may be true, it's certainly not a bad thing, and not the sole extent of what the franchise achieves. There's stinging social commentary which both condemns and makes satirical light of modern North American culture. It examines the power of propaganda for both good and bad ends. It looks at the abuse of power, and the potent rise of fascism and fear tactics, and how quickly they can become commonplace. And this is all in a young adult orientated film that stars a strong, unhindered female protagonist. Gives you hope for the world. Lawrence is powerful as Katniss Everdeen, a young woman chosen from her district to compete in the much celebrated and very violent Hunger Games, a death tournament which serves as a purge and reminder to the citizens what it cost them to rebel against their oppressors years before. This is all at the behest of mega villain President Snow (Donald Sutherland oozes quiet malice with every articulate and icy syllable), who lives in the wealthy and decadent capitol city of Panem, a dystopian version of North America. Along with Katniss there's also Peeta (but no hummus) a local baker's boy played by Josh Hutcherson, who really struggles to match the skill level of almost everyone around him, especially Lawrence. They are thrust into the posh and stylized razzle dazzle of Capitol life as they train for the ruthless games, watched over by previous Victor and proud alcoholic Haymitch Abernathy (Woody Harrelson), as well as preening diva Effie Trinket (Elizabeth Banks channelling Marie Antoinette crossed with a poodle). The film takes some time to ramp up to the games, but as soon as it does the events unfold in breathless fashion set against a lush wilderness background, each and every member fighting tooth and nail to stay alive against both each other and the obstacles which games masters have placed in their way. Anyone with an intense fear of wasps will want to be warned. A clever riff on the talk shows of our climate is shown, as the competitors are quizzed by Ceasar Flickerman (Stanley Tucci) a manically hopped up pop personality with a hairstyle that would make a samurai jealous and teeth so white they get accused of stealing Oscar nominations. Tucci is truly a well of energy and the proceedings go electric whenever he's around. Watch for Paula Malcolmson, Liam Hemsworth, Wes Bentley, Toby Jones and Lenny Kravitz as Cinna, a kindly fashion guru who takes a shine to Katniss and designs her a dress to end all dresses. Lawrence carries the entire thing on her mockingjay wings, making Katniss a spirit of unrest, a true symbol of hope and above all, a scared girl tossed into events she can't possibly imagine navigating. Her performance is most of what makes these films so solid, and they couldn't have made a better casting choice. Be sure to stay for the credits to hear 'Abraham's Daughter', a fittingly grandiose original song by Arcade Fire."

","I am always wary when I hear that one of my favorite novels is finally being made into a feature film. That being said, I was pleasantly surprised by how well this book translated to the big screen. Although many of the finer points and nuances in the book had to be skimmed over or removed, I didn't think that detracted from the bold ideas of the story or the detailed nature of the characters.<br/><br/>The casting was spot-on, in my opinion. Although Wood Harrelson is not usually one of my favorite actors, I think he did an excellent job in the role of Haymitch. The rest of the cast was perfect, with the standout, of course, being Jennifer Lawrence. Elizabeth Banks as Effie Trinket was genius casting. Banks took a character that begins a bit two-dimensionally in the novel and transformed her into something effervescent yet heartbreaking that burst from the screen. She became my personal favorite through the film (and the films that followed).<br/><br/>There are sweeping statements that could be made about this movie's critique of society and commentary of the state of human nature, the nature of politics, and life in general. Those are very obvious from even the dust jacket of the book, and even the first few minutes of the film. I won't attempt to expound upon that here. Take the movie as an action-filled fun-fest or as an in-depth treatise on the decline of American society. It's equally enjoyable as both. Also, I found it best to watch the movie after reading the book first. I'm always hesitant to recommend that as it usually leads to disappointment knowing what could have been. In this case, it adds enjoyment being able to fill in some blanks and mentally add back in some omitted details and subplots.<br/><br/>This movie and it's sequels are some of the best I've seen in the genre. Highly recommended."
"simontaylor-44498","8","1","3","3 April 2016"," The Hunger Games
","Based on the Suzanne Collins book of the same name, The Hunger Games is the first in a four-part adaptation of the book trilogy. It introduces Panem, a region split into twelve districts who are all ruled by the Capitol. In retaliation for a historic uprising, the Capitol holds an annual Hunger Games in which a boy and girl from each district fight to the death in a custom-built arena. The victor gets glory for their district, and all citizens are expected to remember Capitol's strength and provision.<br/><br/>This first movie sees Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) enter the arena alongside Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) on behalf of District 12. It's very faithful to the book, and fans will approve of the treatment. The only significant change is the expansion of Seneca Crane's (Wes Bentley) role as as Head Gamemaker. In my view, this is a sensible and necessary change, allowing the audience to see the deliberation that Katniss presumes in the book, deftly switching from a first person narrator to an omniscient audience.<br/><br/>The movie does well to incorporate the backstory of the Games, and Katniss, with relative smoothness and clarity. It also does extremely well with the setting, with district, arena and Capitol all transposed brilliantly from page to screen.<br/><br/>Due to Katniss' standoffish, independent nature, it's difficult for the audience to connect with the lead. This is through no fault of Lawrence's, but is a challenge presented by the character's personality. Where Collins used first person to get us inside Katniss in the book, the movie offers no real way to get closer than arm's length of her, threatening our investment in her future.<br/><br/>The characters are very well cast. Not just Katniss, Peeta and Gale (Liam Hemsworth), but other key supporting characters like Cato (Alexander Ludwig), Effie (Elizabeth Banks) and Rue (Amandla Stenberg). In fact, the only surprise was Haymitch (Woody Harrelson), who was slightly more dashing and less Father Jack than expected. Having said that, he played the part well.<br/><br/>Though the movie covers all of the main plot points, what it's missing is the brutality of the source material. Though the violence was necessarily toned down to comply with age ratings, you can't help feeling this is a sanitised version that lacks the same bite.<br/><br/>The ending fails to inspire. It's abrupt but unsatisfying. Either a more rounded climax to close this first chapter, or a cliffhanger to lead into the next movie, would have strengthened it. Instead, it rather suddenly stops.<br/><br/>Overall, The Hunger Games is a sound adaptation of the book, with excellent casting and setting, but the change in media erodes the connection to Katniss and the brutality of the Games, which are so very important."

","I've read the book after seeing the movie. At first I was quite impressed by the film, but after I read the first book I saw a lot of exciting moments missing in the movie. The haven't shown all of the excitement and adrenalin. After reading the book and re-watching the movie, there were scenes that became clear. What I mean is that without reading the book you might not even understand some scenes, especially the younger viewers. <br/><br/>I also think that most of the emotions weren't shown in the movie. The main characters were talking in a cold tone in the entire movie, not that they were smiling and laughing all the time in the book, but there were a lot of times when Katniss wanted to cry and she was hiding or waiting until dark, but in the movie she had the same face all the time. No emotions represented! Excluding the few moments on crying and fighting that just came out of nowhere. And they didn't show probably half of the moments when Katniss was hurt and trying to stay alive by heeling herself with what she knows, but instead they just send her the sponsor gift right away. <br/><br/>I can say that the storyline was well told, but they haven't focused on the important moment like the fake love story by Katniss and Peeta. They showed more of how they represented it then the fact it was an act all along. I didn't even understand it until I read the book. You can be impressed at first with only watching the trailer, but after reading the book you can see the connection between everything. Like Rue for example - in the movie she just spies on Katniss and out of nowhere she gives her advise and a few minutes later she dies. While in the book it's explained who Rue is, where she's from, what she knows, why Katniss is sad when she dies and how she thinks of her until the last rows of the last book. <br/><br/>Every story is like a puzzle, but in this movie the important pieces are missing and you can't see the picture. Same in the movie - they haven't made a clear and visible connection between the scenes and the story is unclear at times. <br/><br/>I also think that they've put the camera on a too big close up of Katniss. They did that not only because she is the main character, but in the book she is telling the entire story. But they could have shown more of the other characters - their training, their interview, etc. <br/><br/>This is my opinion, I hope it was helpful."
"borab7-907-936610","4","1","3","28 January 2014"," Ladies and gentleman, I present to you: The romantic screwup of yet another action movie
","Don't get me wrong, I like romance movies very much. I just can't stand romance movies that were supposed to be action movies. I don't want to use 'inappropriate' language, so I'll say they screw action movies up by toning the action element down for the sake of female audience and lower age restrictions, and you'll understand what I meant to say.<br/><br/>Hunger Games is yet another example of that happening. I haven't read the book, I don't know how it is, but I assume it's at least as romantic as the movie. But I can say that they missed lots of opportunities to make the movie more harshly realistic. I'm talking about Game of Thrones type of realism: Have you ever said ""That's nowhere near as bloody as it should be."" while watching GoT? No. I have during Hunger Games. Seriously, how does a spear not be able to penetrate more than 3 cm into a human body? Why don't soldiers of such an authoritarian state use firearms against dissidents? Why does a character so devoted to victory perform a funeral at the middle of a Hunger Game? Why has the state not let the dissident lovers die? Why does no one exploit others' love for them?<br/><br/>It all ends up with the cliché where the lovers save each other, and the world. It all ends up with the 'horror movie character willingly goes into the room where the weird noise is coming from' type of realism where people like me swear at their screens.<br/><br/>I also just noticed that the movie is labeled as ""Sci-fi/Thriller"". Nope. Sci-fi elements are limited to holoprojectors and conjuring fireballs via the use of computers, which is in limited use. And if you are thrilled by this movie, you are 12, in which case this may be an appropriate demonstration of the concept of dystopia."

","I was corralled into watching this movie by my visiting 11 year-old niece, who'd already seen it twice before and of course couldn't help herself giving me prior notice of key moments usually just a few minutes before they occurred on screen. That said, she also helped explain some of the vagaries of the plot and characterisations as the movie progressed, making it a quid-pro-quo so far as I was concerned.<br/><br/>What I got from my viewing was a sort of near-future version of ""Lord Of The Flies"" crossed with ""Big Brother"" (referencing both the TV reality show and of course Orwell's novel). It is a bit slow to get going, as the characters are introduced to the viewer, then stays in low gear once the young sacrificial lambs are selected for training before some excitement is generated in the ""last man standing"" last hour battle-royal between the combatants. Actually this section reminded me of nothing so much as a classic episode of the original ""Star Trek"" where Captain Kirk is marooned on a strange planet to fight a one-to-one battle with an alien opponent.<br/><br/>To be honest, there was a bit more action and drama in James T's adventure than the youngsters' here. Each time a major crisis was averted, a new one would manifest itself, computer-game style, usually created by the games-masters conjuring up new perils at will for the young hero and heroine to fight. The young actors playing the main parts to me didn't seem especially memorable although in a screenplay where they mostly get to run and fall down a lot, perhaps I'm doing them a disservice. There's not really much depth in the portrayals from the older actors too, Woody Harrellson getting to play ""larger-than-life"" as the youngsters' grumpy, soused mentor although of course he's won over to their side quickly and easily enough, while Stanley Tucci gets to ham it up almost as outrageously as he did in ""The Devil Wears Prada"" as a TV show interviewer.<br/><br/>I guess it was hard for this movie to fail commercially given the literary following amongst teenagers the source novel has attracted in a similar way to the Harry Potter films. I personally prefer films of this type to be more fantasy and less ferocious, (some of the on-screen violence must have been border-line excessive with the censors) and about 40 or so minutes could easily have been edited down to make a tighter, more coherent and satisfying movie, but I've certainly seen many worse ""teenagers"" -type movies, although unless young Erin is really stuck for company, I'll not be queueing up to see the sequel any time soon."

Her sponsors send her a useful care package for her wounded leg via guided balloon.<br/><br/>After the wasp incident, Katniss is in real trouble with hallucinations and indecision. On the other hand, she does get rid of some opponents.<br/><br/>Katniss avoids, then defuses, a major trap back at the games entry point.<br/><br/>She loses an ally (Rue) from district 11 and eliminates an enemy. Afterward, she flashes a sign to the district 11 observers. They go into rebellion mode. The motivation for this linkage was absent. Katniss' district 12 mentor Haymitch suggests to the powers that be an alternative involving two survivors.<br/><br/>She takes a huge chance to get medical supplies for Peeta, and gets into a nasty knife fight for it. Saving Rue ended up saving Katniss, and one more competitor is eliminated.<br/><br/>After Peeta's and Katniss' last human competitor is dead (or so they thought), they have to contend with an engineered, quite nasty pack of dogs, plus one wounded competitor re-surfaces. Peeta and Katniss prevail. Then the game runners revoke the two-survivor exception. Nice.<br/><br/>----Scores----<br/><br/>Cinematography: 7/10 Fine except for the sections of hellishly amateurish jerky camera movements and the ever so poor framing.<br/><br/>Sound: 8/10 Mostly fine.<br/><br/>Acting: 7/10 Sutherland, Tucci, Lawrence, Harrelson, and Hutcherson were fine, given the screenplay. Many of the supporting actors were not that good.<br/><br/>Screenplay: 0/10 Yikes. The logical failures here are endless. The two-tiered society consists of many entitled high-tech parasitic consumers and few no tech impoverished producers. There is no way for the advanced materials used by the parasites to be produced, replaced, or upgraded. Where does the food and drink come from? Either there is a huge non-depicted segment of Panem society (doubtful) or the whole setup is just what it looks like: impossible, unmitigated nonsense. The opening remarks by President Snow were odious beyond belief, and would be sufficient to engender new rebellions, except for the abject poverty and lack of means of the downtrodden."

","I liked the first part of the film, as I thought that was accurate apart from the mocking jay pin, as the pin had a lot more significance than what was shown in the film. <br/><br/>But I thought the arena part was rubbish. People said the film had lots of gore and violence and revolved around the love storyline, but the arena part was way too short to concentrate on this. I know the film has to use a lot of cut down information but the arena part was pretty much the same length as the non- arena part!

You'd think by now Hollywood realized that people HATE when the camera angle is changed every second and the cameras are operated by geriatric Parkinson's patients, but apparently their egos won't permit them to get back to normal filming.

It does take a while to get going it's true and I'd never read the book and wasn't sure about the premise - pitting 12 - 18 year old against each other to the death. It is a very odd film, like Big Brother with extra-ridiculous tasks. The contrast between the Districts and the Capitol are well done - dowdy one, ridiculously coloured the other. The whole bit of the actual chase is a little less than thrilling, though it does have its moments. They obviously spent a lot of money on it and you can see where. I found the ending a bit obvious. And the bit at the beginning with the heroine and her what you think of as her 'beau' is a bit wasted, because it doesn't really go anywhere. The acting's okay, given what they've been given to work with. It just feels overlong, over-hyped and could have delivered so much more.

"rparham","6","1","3","11 November 2012"," Decent but unspectacular YA adaptation
","With the Harry Potter films over and Twilight concluding soon, Hollywood has filled the financially lucrative void with its latest Young Adult series adaptation, The Hunger Games. The Hunger Games is a stronger than the first Harry Potter film, but is still only a decent but unspectacular film, with a lot of ideas at the core, but not quite mining them all to success.<br/><br/>The film opens at some point in the future, where society has collapsed and the country is split into 12 impoverished districts while the control is located in the resplendent Capitol. In the past, the Districts had rose up against the Capitol, but had been put down, and as punishment The Hunger Games was born: a televised competition where one boy and one girl from each district are chosen annually to fight one another in a bloody tournament where only one survivor can go home. From District 12, Primrose Everdeen (Willow Shields) is selected, but her older and tougher sister, Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) volunteers to take her place. Also selected from District 12 is Peeta (Josh Hutcherson), who holds a secret crush for Katniss.<br/><br/>At the Capitol, they participate in a series of training exercises and public ceremonies leading up to the games, groomed by Cinna (Lenny Kravitz) to create a memorable impression on the crowds whom they will rely on as potential sponsors for weapons and supplies during the games. They are also given survival guidance by Haymitch (Woody Harrelson), the last winner from District 12 who is now a lush, using his position largely as an opportunity to avail himself of food and drink. Katniss quickly proves an impressive find, and gamemaster Seneca (Wes Bentley) tries to influence President Snow (Donald Sutherland) to make a few adjustments to the games due to her, but Snow is not so taken, seeing her strength and willpower as dangerous. When the games are finally underway, in a wooded landscape, Katniss must summon all her strength and resourcefulness to survive the elements and her fellow players.<br/><br/>You would have to have been living under a rock for the last decade or so to not recognize the Hunger Games is a cautionary tale about modern reality TV taken to the Nth degree. It is most successful when the characters are being featured on a talk show, hosted by an over-the-top Stanley Tucci, which resembles today's fluff interview programs such as The Tonight Show and Entertainment Weekly, biting satire which hits the mark. Tucci and his co-anchor, portrayed by Toby Jones, commentate and reflect on the games as if people's lives weren't in the balance, giving us a glimpse at what could, unfortunately, be our future. Unfortunately, the background of the dystopian world the characters live in is underdeveloped, leaving a lot of questions concerning how the Capitol maintains control of the people unexplored.<br/><br/>The Hunger Games doesn't really tread any ground that hasn't already been well-worn by other works, including The Running Man, Battle Royale and more. The idea of man's inhumanity to man being treated as entertainment is certainly not groundbreaking, but in the world of YA literature, it seems, everything old is new again. However, the decision to go for a PG-13 rating dulls the film's potential edge. While it doesn't completely shy away from the violence inherent in the story, shaky camera motion and quick edits keep the audience at arm's length from the true viciousness of the concept that is really worth exploring. <br/><br/>The film also suffers from a bit too much from archetypal characters. Katniss and Peeta are both somewhat naive, innocent and inherently ""good"" individuals. Aside from a young girl named Roo (Amandla Stenberg) who is befriended by Katniss, almost all the rest of the participants in the games are bloodthirsty jackals, reveling in the murder of the others. Most of them are merely fodder for the story's eventual parade of death, but the few that stand out are ""evil"". We can't help but root for our heroes, they are among the only relatable people in the story. As with other stories targeted at a teen female audience, there is the seemingly inevitable love triangle between Katniss, Peeta and another boy from District 12, Gale (Liam Hemsworth). For the most part, though, this is just window dressing to the film, a storyline that may have more meat in the source novel, but here lacks depth. Gale and Katniss relationship doesn't have any chemistry to it, and Hemsworth's scenes are minimal. Katniss and Peeta's relationship isn't any deeper, and several of the scenes where they begin to connect romantically are manipulative and ineffective. The two don't come across as being attracted to each other, but merely going through the motions the screenplay has laid out for them.<br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence, who came to notice from her work in Winter's Bone, impresses as Katniss. She provides us with a girl who is alternately strong, scared and thoughtful. She is the film's anchor, and when the Hunger Games works in its second half, it is often due to her performance. Surprisingly, the most engaging relationship in the film is between Katniss and Cinna, with their parting scene one of the emotional high points. Josh Hutcherson does give Peeta a nice dose of naivete, but he proves a tad underwhelming in the role. Stanley Tucci chews the scenery with great aplomb in his moments, Wes Bentley comes across as a man who is a bit too easily manipulated for his own good, and Donald Sutherland gives President Snow and quiet degree of menace.<br/><br/>I give credit to The Hunger Games for addressing ideas and issues relevant to the current state of society, but the package that it is delivered in ultimately proves a bit underwhelming. With the ground- work laid, perhaps the next installment will be a stronger film and build on the base of The Hunger Games."

Having not read the book I can only say that the movie sets up its premise in a matter that is not quite believable. Unfortunately by the end I found that I was not much more attached to the characters than I was at the beginning.<br/><br/>Bottom line: the acting is decent, the story somewhat predictable, the concept fairly novel to the mainstream audience (which seems to account for its success), and the movie is aimed at a teenage audience (who I believe would enjoy this more then me at my ripe old age of 28).<br/><br/>I'm pretty surprised the movie was rated so highly by both critics and people here on IMDb."
"WaxBellaAmours","7","1","3","18 May 2012"," If you read the book, it's pretty much more of the same in this adaptation
","While Suzzane Collins' remarkably addictive, intense and (mildly) controversial ""Hunger Games"" seems like something that would work well on the larger-than-life big screen, the new film adaptation suffers the same flaws of pretty much every Hollywood adaptation of a massively popular literary series: it's engaging enough but never really has a life of it's own. If it was allowed to truly break free on screen, without the demands of many eager fans and blockbuster-hungry studio executives demanding faithfulness to it's source, it could've been something much darker and crazier than the rather cautious film we end up getting in. How exactly are you convinicly going to show a bunch of kids ruthlessly hunting down and killing each other with a PG-13 rating? <br/><br/>While Gary Ross is an able filmmaker who has shown bursts of creativity in previous works, is clearly playing by the book here. He stays very faithful to the narrative flow of the novel, with little of the major plot points out of place and only the occasional slight deviation of certain passages for the occasional dramatic effect. It ends up feeling frigid, never quite gaining momentum as it uses the plot outline of the novel more like a crutch rather than a jumping-off point. While it's certainly accessible enough for Newcomers and satisfying enough for (most) fans, it won't quite wow those who have read the book religiously or those who have no connection to it's literary source and are expecting a special cinematic experience of the film instead.<br/><br/>Perhaps since the screen adaptation automatically puts it's heroine, Katniss, in the third person, rather than as a narrator, the story loses a bit of it's immediacy and the character loses a bit of the emotional weight when we're just watching her story instead of living it. It's no fault of the actress embodying her, as Jennifer Lawrence brings that well-rounded steeliness that made her so captivating in her breakthrough role in Winter's Bone, a character that feels perhaps just a bit too similar to the one she's playing now. While Lawrence sounded great on paper, she seems just a bit too mature as an actress to really liven up a role that needed perhaps someone a little more unknown, younger and, pardon my diction, hungrier to feel honest. Her performance is certainly deft but rarely surprising, and she feels more like a surrogate for the audience rather than a distinct personality on her own right.<br/><br/>Although Katniss's character is slightly less compelling here than on book, that wouldn't matter if the actual Hunger Games we're as visceral and provocative as they would seem to be when projected on a much larger canvass, given a sense of right-in-front-of-your eyes shock that Collins' words could never quite convey. That, however, is where the superficiality of the film becomes most apparent. Gary Ross proves to be a decent storyteller but a rather hackeyned action director, mostly constantly swooshing the camera around when the shot is wide and using endless quick-cuts during the close-ups, inspiring a sense of mild vertigo rather than genuinely felt adrenaline. Both the predictable nature of the action sequences tied with the faithfulness of the script to it's source makes the whole Hunger Games feels rather predictable and illussionary as it would be on liveTV, not quite devolping the kind of eerie mood and ominous atmosphere that would've made the desperate, creul and just plain evil nature of the whole thing seem all that more horrifying. <br/><br/>Really, though, was it reasonable to expect that? Hollywood taking on an untested literary sleeper and trying to turn it into an even more lucrative, blockbuster is never a sign that there are major artistic risks to be made. So you pretty much get what you expect with The Hunger Games. And by all accounts it's a fairly engaging, easy-to-swallow piece of entertainment, if too slowly-paced and long for it's own good. However, it should've been more invigorating and just plain crazier, both physically and emotionally, than this rather tame and self-conscious book reading we get instead. In order for these films to work, the filmmakers have to get out of their comfort zones and let the more dangerous aspects of Collins' novel (there a few) really take center stage. It would be nice if these films we're meomorable on their own right, not just as a companion piece to it's literary source."
"davidgee","6","1","3","29 April 2012"," Kids killing kids - a worthy theme?
","I wasn't going to see with this and I kind of wish I hadn't. It's hard to believe this is the next Big Thing, after Harry Potter and the TWILIGHT series. Stanley Tucci, hosting the TV reality show in which kids hunt each other to extinction, combines everything you hate about Simon Cowell with everything you hate about Louis Walsh! Jennifer Lawrence occasionally has the arresting beauty of the young Elizabeth Taylor.<br/><br/>Even if you haven't read the books on which this highly-publicised series is based, it's fairly obvious from the start who's going to survive and who isn't. A thin storyline doesn't really justify stretching the film well beyond two hours. The ending suggests that creepy President Sutherland (Donald, not Keifer, looking like a throwback to Abe Lincoln) has got some more gruelling games up his sleeve for Volume Two. Don't think I'll bother.<br/><br/>The killing scenes - knifings, bludgeonings and arrows-through-the-heart - are not too excessively detailed, but there's no escaping the fact that this a movie about kids killing kids. Leaving aside the obvious borrowings from RAMBO, THE RUNNING MAN and PREDATOR, this is a disturbing theme for a movie to emerge from the country that went through Columbine and other high-school and college massacres. And it's especially disturbing to be watching it in the week when a Norwegian right-wing lunatic is on trial for murdering several dozen students."

","TO make sure, to be fair, I will say I never heard any Hunger Games books before I saw this movie. So I had no idea what it was going to be like. I didn't even saw the trailer before going to see it. So with a fresh mind I sat into my seat with my wife, my aunt and my brother in law beside me. Movie started and the first thing i noticed was the shaky camera. It made very uncomfortable to watch the movie, I was looking around and found some people looking around too. I was confused, should I stay or go. I was the one who dragged everyone to the movie, I can't leave. So I had to sat down for the entire painstaking 2.5 hours.<br/><br/>The plot was like The Running Man on baby formula. Kids are selected from different zones to fight & die for a reality television show. For me it's a worn out idea, there are many other films made on the same storyline, like Battle Royale, The Tournament, The Long Walk and so on.<br/><br/>The Acting was good, I liked Jennifer Lawrence, and couple of more actors. But I was not able too see much of the acting because of the shaky cam, it was all blurry, couldn't see the facial expressions or other details.<br/><br/>Violence was not there. There is more violence in the cartoons these days than this film. And they are saying they used shaky camera to avoid getting a higher Sensor Ratings, I pity on people who buy that.Although, it was kids kill other kids film, there was no emotional attachment with the characters. When a little girl died of some poison, I heard someone crying behind my seat, a 40 something old lady was all up in the tears, I looked towards my brother in law, we shared a big smile. I mean there was no emotions attached. I am an emotional guy, I cry whenever I get a chance, i.e. Saving Private Ryan, Million Dollar Baby and list goes on, but this film don't have it. May be the people who read the book are pre-attached with the characters and just waiting them to be dead on the screen and start crying, is a whole different story. But for a first timer like me, it was a joke. If the comedy was intentional, it was the best comedy I saw in years, but it was not.<br/><br/>Direction was bad, very bad. I heard the director is going away, good news for the series lovers. Shaky Camera, no emotional attachment with the characters, no character development, plot holes, unclear, no edge in the film, very smooth going, there was not a moment in the film when I cared for anything, if a girl is going to die, even if all the cast was dead and everything get destroyed, I wouldn't care.<br/><br/>I am giving this a 6 rating, because my wife loved it. she will kick my b*** if I give it a lower rating like -10 or something."
"griffolyon12","10","3","18","23 March 2012"," An Enjoyable Sci-Fi Thriller!
","With The Hunger Games, audiences are treated to a dystopic sci-fi adventure that is suspenseful from the first frame to the last. A simple story of a fight to the death between twenty-four kids between the ages of 12 and 18 may seem like a gory blood fest, but the story never glorifies the violence and is more about survival rather than killing. Director Gary Ross keeps the story with heroine Katniss Everdeen through a clever use of close ups and out of focus background, rather than often revealing what is transpiring all around her. This is not an entertainment, and it is not intended as such, but rather as a harrowing journey of wills that ask the audience members to often wonder how would they respond if they were forced to kill to live. Overall, The Hunger Games is a well made sci-fi thriller that features larger than life situations with genuine suspense that does not let up, and really expands and visualizes the world of the novels by Suzanne Collins in a satisfying way that makes The Hunger Games worth watching for the thrills and thought it provokes.<br/><br/>I give The Hunger Games a 10 out of 10!"
"GeneralBrae","10","3","18","23 March 2012"," Have Twilight and Harry Potter finally met their match?
","I have been building up to this release for longer than in can remember for any other film, and as a massive Harry Potter fan, that is truly saying something. I can still remember the blog post I wrote on the day Lionsgate announced purchasing the film rights - not to mention the excitement! For this reason, I approached the cinema with some trepidation - so often a film I've been excited about has fallen short of my expectations. However, 2 hours and 20 minutes later I dragged myself from the cinema, already planning my next visit at the weekend. <br/><br/>Lionsgate have truly achieved a feat of film making with this title. Even for someone like me who knows the books inside out, it was an emotional roller-coaster. Any doubts I had about the casting were blown aside and the incredible attention to detail were enough satiate even the hungriest appetite. The adaptation - presumably helped in some extent by Suzanne Collins's involvement with the screen writing - is beautifully done, coping with the time constraints that have so often proved the downfall of a book adaptation being dealt with with great panache and style. <br/><br/>For those of you worrying that the film maker might have foregrounded the love element between Katniss and Peeta, rest assured, there is nothing Twilight-y about this. It is represented almost perfectly from the books. Instead of the love story though, the really important themes are brought out in grand style. The modern ""game show"" influence is clearly shown through cut scenes showing the game makers manipulating the arena to force the contestants together and force conflict. The mechanism of the games is much more clearly shown than in the books, and for me (one of those people who reads books and watches films for their themes!), this is really what I wanted out of this film.<br/><br/>However, please don't misunderstand me. As a visual spectacle the film is remarkable and would be a great ""popcorn and Pepsi"" viewing. Also the sci-fi subject makes it great for kids who will not understand or care about the deeper undertones of the story.<br/><br/>There are also a couple of places in the film where it is set up for the sequels and the significance of Katniss and Peeta's actions for the dominance of the Capital are clearly shown.<br/><br/>In summary, this is a remarkable production. It will work on all levels for any age group or breed of film-goers. Whether you want to come away feeling some great epiphany about our (and I have to say this at great risk to my reputation, particularly America's) society works, or just with a stupid look on your face at the quality of the graphic detail, this is a must see film.<br/><br/>P.S. If any responsible parents are out there reading this to try and find out if it's alright to take their 10 year old to see it, there are no real bloody moments. There is some close up of a burn wound, an injury to Peeta's leg, and a corpse disfigured by 'wasp' stings. Also there is a scene in which a young girl is killed, but again, this is not graphic and is more emotional. I do not think it likely to perturb most children. However, I'll withhold my address in case you find me to be wrong!"

","Yesterday, I saw the midnight premiere of The Hunger Games and I have to say this movie did not disappoint. The action sequences were good, and the story line was almost exactly the same as the book, probably because Suzanne Collins co-wrote the screenplay. The best performances in this movie came from Woody Harrelson as a drunk trainer, Stanley Tucci as a slightly gay commentator and Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss Everdeen. The only problem I had was this movie was some of the characters weren't developed enough, or at least I felt that way. For example, Cato said three things then died. Also, the great Claudius Templesmith only said a few words and mostly just was a shadow under Ceaser Flickerman the whole movie. Hopefully this movie will succeed and become the next Harry Potter."
"garnettr-969-575225","10","2","10","23 April 2012"," The best film of the year no, century hell the best film of the millennium. this FILM is the victor
","This film had great press coverage, and it sounded like my sort of film. I wanted to read the books, but I decided it would be worth it to watch the film first. I LOVED the film. It is not the next harry potter/ lord of the ring/ twilight. It is BETTER than all of them put together. The film starts brilliantly. After a rebellion, the world has been split into 13 districts (this confused me during the film though, it seemed to swap between 13 and 12 districts. As a point of explanation, the barely mentioned district 13 was destroyed before the events of the film.) district one are the rich people, people who live in luxury, whereas district 12 are poor, a third world country, to put it simply. Each year, a boy and a girl from each district are forced to compete in ""the hunger games"", basically a fight to the death in an arena that the government controls, until there is a victor, the one survivor. The whole thing is turned into a massive event and TV show. The Main character, katniss, 16 years old, is from district 12, what a surprise. Guess who gets picked to take part in the hunger games? The main characters 12 year old sister, who wouldn't last 5 minutes in the games. So, in a heart-breaking scene, katniss volunteers to take her sisters place. Now bear in mind I NEVER get emotional at films if I haven't read the books first (or is about animals) I was almost in tears at this point, 10 minutes into the film. And I was amazed, at the emotion I already felt for these characters. Then is the juicy part, in the weeks running up to the ""games"", the tributes train, katniss training together with her fellow district 12 tribute, peeta. And these 2 have a past, as he once saved her from starvation and it turns out he is in love with her or seems to be. Throughout the film, it does seem uncertain whether peeta loves katniss, or if is an act. During the games, the tributes can get help from sponsors on the outside, weapons, food or medicine. And during the weeks running up to the games, the tributes are watched, given scores, and the tributes do interviews, and katniss gets the persona of katniss the girl on fire. It is a great set up to the games Now I don't want to go into the games themselves, too many spoilers involved, but I can tell you that it is an emotional roller-coaster that will have you on the edge of your seat from the second they get into the arena, if not from the start. Just suffice to say that katniss suffers injury, loss of friends, betrayal, traps, danger, a fearsome alliance, a trained warrior determined to kill her, and the people in charge of the games who do NOT want her to win and are prepared to play dirty. I will say that there are 2 AMAZING scenes that are still with me, above the rest. There is a part where a friend dies, which is done beautifully, and the climax is epic remember, there can only be one victor... Also, I have now read the books. Usually, my advice is that if you have read the book, don't expect the film. To be fair, there isn't much new, and all the new parts are covered, at least in part in catching fire. I have to say that for once, the books and film are almost equal. I mean, a film can never match a book, but this is the closest it has gotten, with it being VERY similar to the books, with just enough improvements to make up for the bad changes (be fair, readers, how on earth can the hounds be any good on screen with the whole eyes part, I love that part of the books, but it would never have worked and most of the removed parts are for the best, other than that they got rid of the avox. They also downplayed gale, for now.) I would HIGHLY suggest watching it. If you do, all I have to say is happy hunger games and my the odds be ever in your favor"
"esme-ash","10","2","10","22 April 2012"," Just what I was hoping for.
","When I watched the trailer for The Hunger Games, I knew that I had to read the books first, so I did- and it took me two days to read all three. They were so all-consuming, so gripping that you just had to continue reading on until the end. <br/><br/>Going to see the film was almost another way of being able to read the first one again. All the cast were fantastic- just how I imagined them to be, Peeta and Katniss were perfect, and once again, the whole story pulled me in within minutes.<br/><br/>I know there are a lot of people coming out disappointed, and complaining about the 'shaky hand cam' etc., but I think you have the option of going to see the film in two different ways- with or without reading the books first. IF you've read the books, then you'll know that the shaky camera is portraying how Katniss felt in the woods, the intensity of her time spent in the hunger games. I can see how for those people who haven't read the book will come out a little confused, but they've just seen the skinny version of the full-fat book that we've read. <br/><br/>It was fantastic. My expectations were high, and they were exceeded! If you've read the books, you MUST go and see it, to relive what you read. If you haven't read the books, just go in with an open mind, and remember that it's based on a book- with so much detail, they didn't have time for everything, but it didn't matter.<br/><br/>I was so happy when I came out of the cinema,; I thought it was brilliant."
"comrademoses","8","2","10","14 April 2012"," Plainly said, a great science fiction film
","I am a fan of the Hunger Games trilogy of novels. The writing is crisp and the pacing is perfect. I'm not here to review the novels, however. I'm here to give you my opinion of the film. This is something that a lot of people don't seem to understand. In the transition from the medium of the novel to the medium of the film, not EVERY little detail can possibly make it in the transition process. It's a totally different artistic medium. The advice I want to give everyone reading this review now is: do not judge the film from the perspective of a fan of the novels. Judge the film for what it is: a film. Judge it on it's own merits. This is how I judged it, and I came out of the theaters thoroughly impressed. First of all, every actor/actress fulfills their role perfectly. The casting was absolutely fantastic, and finding the right people to fit the right role is one of the intrinsic steps to ensuring that your film will be great. Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss Everdeen is perfect. Katniss truly feels like the strong, daring girl that she is. Of course, Woody Harrelson as Haymitch was a no-brainer. Josh Hutcherson and Liam Hemsworth play their roles as the lead male protagonists of the series, Peeta and Gale, quite well. I would also like to give props to Amandla Stenberg for her heartfelt portrayal of Rue, Lenny Kravitz for his SPOT ON portrayal of Cinna (my personal favorite character of the entire series), and Stanley Tucci for his endearing role as Caesar Flickerman. The film, thematically, is about a tyrannical state which seeks to maintain ownership of it's citizens. The society is structured into 12 different districts, and every year two ""tributes"" from each district are chosen at random in order to battle on live television against one another in the annual ""Hunger Games""competitions. The winner receives comfort and peace for the rest of their lives, and that district which he/she is from receives benefits as well. The Hunger Games themselves are a message from the state, called the ""Capitol"" in the film, to the people of the 12 districts. That message is, essentially, ""We own you"". It's a message that is perceived to be necessary, being that there was a rebellion against the Capitol historically. The Hunger Games is a science fiction tale about rebellion against an oppressive government entity, which while isn't a particularly original concept, is explored with great skill in the novels, and in this film as well. It's a film which is skillfully made. It espouses individuality and freedom, and it espouses it with a tale that is engrossing and entertaining. Please see this film, and I implore you to read the books as well."
"dancestar82098","7","2","10","13 April 2012"," Overall good, with some gaps
","Let me just start off that I am a fan of the book series. I find that they are so well written and I hoped that the movies wouldn't ruin it. <br/><br/>Cast- I thought that the casting was very well done. I was skeptical about Jennifer Lawrence being cast as Katniss, but overall she did a phenomenal job with the roll. Josh Hutcherson was perfect as Peeta. He had something about him that made him very similar to Peeta. <br/><br/>Pros- The sets were wonderful. District 12 was perfect, just what you'd imagine from reading the book. The Capitol was more extravagant than you could have imagined and the arena was perfect. The cornucopia was also perfect. Once again, the casting was great. The archery and the use of weapons was also quite well done. Rue's death was also done well. The scene with Katniss shooting the arrow into the apple in the pigs mouth was spot on. The first meeting with Rue in the trees with the tracker jackers was also very well done. The costuming was perfect; almost exactly what was described in the book. <br/><br/>Cons- The movie was a bit rushed at points. They didn't elaborate much on the experiences Katniss had at the Capitol. Also, the whole ""star-crossed lovers"" theme was almost completely lost, at that was a key point in the book. Another big problem was that in the movie, you really couldn't tell that the tributes were dehydrated and starving. That is a main part of the story and I'm not sure why the director didn't make that a key part in the story line. You also couldn't tell how sick Peeta was, I'm not sure if you'd even know he was sick from watching the movie. It would have been hard to follow if you hadn't read the book. They also rushed many of the tributes deaths. The whole story with Rue was rushed in the movie as well. Katniss' loss of hearing was also completely left out; I honestly don't really remember a huge explosion at all. The mockingjay pin was also given to Katniss in a different way. The story was not completely finished in the movie and you didn't know that the Capitol was angry with Katniss and Peeta.<br/><br/>I personally did love the movie and found it was a good portrayal of the book, but I feel the director could have done a better job. This movie could have been phenomenal and it wasn't. They left out a lot of violence and they took what should have been an R rated movie and turned it PG-13, so there was a larger audience. Any true Hunger Games fan would have rather seen it as an R rated movie, so not as many key points were left out and violence as well. I think it's a movie worth seeing, but it definitely isn't amazing. I hope that Catching Fire and Mockingjay will be done a little better."
"mmablaster","9","2","10","13 April 2012"," Suspense Packed Action Movie
","The Hunger Games isn't a perfect movie, but what it does best was keep you on the edge of your seat with suspense. The build up to the action was great, you start rooting for the main character in the movie. I also thought the movie was well acted, with Woody Harrelson, Jennifer Lawrence, and Donald Sutherland doing great jobs. <br/><br/>I wish they would have just done a rated R version of the movie, or release an un-rated DVD. Some of the action scenes in the beginning they have the shaky cam going which gets annoying. The love story drags a little. <br/><br/>The people comparing it to Harry Potter or Twilight probably haven't seen Hunger Games. Besides a the love story, and the fact there are some teens in the movie, Hunger Games is completely different. Hunger Games much more violent, suspenseful and raw. It is actually closer to The Running Man."
"Smartie15","10","2","10","31 March 2012"," Not disappointing at all
","This movie was so good that my review might not even do it justice. I will try as hard as I can to show you exactly why I love this movie. My first reason for adoring this movie is the cast. Jennifer Lawrence (Katniss Everdeen) is such a great actor. She portrays that while Katniss can be tough and brave, she is also passionate, loving and determined. Josh Hutcherson (Peeta Mellark) is also a character with lots of depth. He shows that Peeta is smart, clever and obviously very passionate about Katniss. Also other characters with less experience did amazingly well. (Rue and Prim.) <br/><br/>Another reason I loved this movie was because of the way they made it so unique. It follows the book on a lot of really important details. The book was so different than anything I had ever read. The way that everything fell into palace amazed me<br/><br/>This movie was definitely not all hype, in my opinion. This movie was one of my favorites. If you want a completely real, thrilling, emotional adventure, go see The Hunger Games!!"
"kirensokhal","10","2","10","31 March 2012"," Brilliant adaptation!
","I've watched the Hunger Games twice now and loved it both times! Amazing adaptation of the book, even if it missed out some parts of the book, it made up for it definitely in the climax of the film. I've read a lot of negative reviews from very 'small minded' people and think that they don't see the bigger picture. People keep comparing it to battle royale but it's nothing like it!! I think that true fans of the book will appreciate the 2 and a half hour long extravaganza especially with the cave scene, and Rue's scene (which I cried at both times). Overall, a fantastic and tasteful adaptation that does the books justice. The talented actors ( Lawerence, Hutcherson and Banks in particular) capture the characters mood perfectly, with the men of the hunger games excelling in the looks department ;) Definitely worth a watch, but read the books before watching the movie :) This is a film that will keep fans hungry for more!"

","I admit - I loved this film. Although the camera was unnecessarily spastic at times, and some of the special effects (see: Fire Dress) could have been a bit better, overall I can't remember something so original and groundbreaking since Star Wars. I love that we have a new story - finally - not just another well worn comic book character filling the screen. The movie was long, but I enjoyed the entire thing. I appreciate the adaptation of the novel, the casting, the lighting, the edit, and the lack of pop songs gumming up the soundtrack. This movie met and exceeded my expectations - and I was expecting a lot. Kudos to Gary Ross, Jennifer Lawrence, and especially Suzanne Collins."
"MahnoushG","10","2","10","28 March 2012"," Futuristic world were children are picked from the ages of 12 to 18 to fight in an arena to the death.
","Okay first and for most, a huge thank you to Gary Ross for making this amazing phenomenon story into a movie. It is an extremely hard job to do that. I loved every second of it. Jennifer Lawrence is an amazing actress, I know she was going to be amazing the minute I watched ""The Winter's Bone"". You can feel every emotion, every feeling and sentiment through her performance. Many critiques pointed out her body as not being ""Hungry"" enough. I DO not agree with that, she is fit enough to portray Katniss, obviously she hunts she has muscles and even to bring this up as an issue is just ridiculous.<br/><br/>Furthermore, everyone in this movie did an excellent job and oh my god JOSH HUTCHERSON wow he really is Peeta. In general, I believe, the movie was really true to the book yes there are parts of it that are new and parts that we expected them to be in the movie but trust me I know hopefully they will build that up in ""catching fire"". Overall I give it 9/10 and it DID truly live up to my expectations and I think people need to be less picky."

I loved seeing the capitol people and there costumes!! I knew before I went to see it that they would not be able to add all the details and the people so over all what they decided to add and delete worked great!!

"theinaniloquent","8","2","10","26 March 2012"," ""The world will be watching""
","Set in a future where the Capitol selects a boy and girl from the twelve districts to fight to the death on live television, Katniss Everdeen volunteers to take her younger sister's place for the latest match.<br/><br/>The movie was fantastic, truly. If you've seen the Harry Potter films or even (gag) the Twilight series, they do not stay true to their source material. This movie adaptation was definitely the best, and here's why... If you've seen (again) the above movies, or even more, the directors add pointless stuff, even removing your favorite parts. Hunger Games surely is to blame for this, as any other; but thing is, they add things that actually WORK and remove things that wasn't even needed in the first place. Sure, there was a few flaws in this department, but overall I congratulate the filmmakers for making this work, unlike other films... The acting in this film was incredible. This is the first movie I've seen with Jennifer Lawrence and she did a beautiful job. She clearly plays a very subtle way but, if you've read the books, this is how Katniss really is. She stands out in every scene she plays in. So, in my opinion, Jennifer Lawrence IS Katniss, and she did a great job. Josh Hutcherson did a great job with Peeta, Woody Harrelson did a great job with Haymitch, and Elizabeth Banks did a great job with Effie. The only complaint I have with the acting is Liam Hemsworth's role as Gale. Other than him, everybody did a good job... The screenplay was actually excellent. Other movie adaptations make up their own words, and use completely other quotes that do not match up with the characters. Hunger Games, yes, is a victim of this crime but thankfully, they decided to almost use all of the words from the book; the important ones that is. It made the film more faithful, and it made the film more enjoyable, in my opinion... The next department I have lots to say about. Everybody has been complaining about this, and I have no exact idea why, so I wanted to make it more understandable about how I feel about it. The action sequences, the violence.. The book was surely a violent novel, and it had lots of crazy situations going on. If the book didn't somehow get consumed by 'tweens' then the ""problem"" wouldn't be here, but people are complaining of how brutal and dark it is not. I completely disagree with this statement, as I was actually surprised of how dark and violent the film was. The movie was filmed shaky, as in to disguise the gore and violence, but the stuff is still pretty visible. I'm actually pretty disturbed at how people are complaining about how they want to see more gore and violence within a movie about children killing children? Makes no sense... This leads me to the next big complaint: the shaky cam. Here's what I believe: the first, say, 10 minutes are the only minutes to be complaining about a shaky cam. The following is either to disguise the brutality or just a few seconds of moving the camera around. I actually sat there observing the issue, and had to question how people are still complaining about this. I've seen far too many films with shaky cams, and when I hear the term, I would never even place this film in my mind... The next thing I'd like to talk about is the style of the film. The futuristic look was actually really good. The districts looked poor and dirty, which was how I envisioned it from reading the novel. The capitol was rich and mean, and was polluted was strange-looking characters, which was how I envisioned it from the novel. I loved how they tried to keep it as close to the novel, and to be honest, none of the complaints about the film are credible, because they did a fantastic job creating the world as we envisioned it... The next (and last) thing I wanted to review is the changes from novel to the big screen. The biggest change, or the hardest thing to do, was to tell the story differently. The novel was actually from Katniss's POV, and creating a film without hearing Katniss's narration is pretty hectic. This was the best change, because I have no idea what I would've done. The next change was the presence of the gamekeeper, Seneca Crane. The book never even talked about him much, and his name wasn't something to be remembered, but the director decided to use him as to make Catching Fire happen. It worked, too, because I loved to see him on the screen. He made the film greater, and the little talks between him and President Snow were awesome to see. The other changes were very subtle, and only the die-hard fans would take notice. By the end of the film, they went over my head and my anticipation for Catching Fire rose...<br/><br/>VERDICT: I recommend this fan for anyone. Whether you've read the book or not, you'll be pleasantly surprised on how this ""teenage"" dystopia story is, as it builds tension and surprises all around. If you hate shaky cam, which many people seemed to be oh so sickened by, then maybe you should stay back, because I hate to see people bash on the film for a minor difference. If your a die-hard fan, then it's going to be a love it or hate it, because while it changes some things that could get you worried, it does is subtly and keeps the parts that matter. If you LOVE to compare movies, then I suggest stay away. The novel maybe was inspired by, but not simply copied and pasted from, Battle Royale, but the differences are there and this is so much better. Everything is all there to make this the best movie adaptation ever. 10/10."
"Kendyll","8","2","10","25 March 2012"," Good, but....
","The movie was awesome. The actors/actresses fit the roles PERFECTLY (cannot stress that enough) and really got the true feelings across to the audience. The biggest thing wrong with the movie, though, was the camera-work. It was very choppy and I couldn't focus...it really was bad. I was also disappointed that they missed very many important (I thought) scenes from the book. (Don't worry, I won't tell you what they are.) If you haven't read the book before you watch the movie, you'll think it's amazing. If you've read the books, you may find out they missed your FAVORITE scene (they missed mine...) I wished they would have had a part 1 and part 2, because there was way too much information thrown into a short period of time. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE the books. The movie was great. There's just some things that I didn't like... I'm still buying it when it comes out on DVD though! :)"
"nikolaischillersdeathnot","6","2","10","25 March 2012"," The New Big Franchise?
","""The Hunger Games"" is a movie that has been anticipated for some time now. I will say right off the bat, that it does not live up to the hype. The ending noted this, as it was rather anti- climactic. As for the shaky cam and choppy editing, it did get a little annoying at times. Not as annoying as Woody Harrelson's hair of course, but definitely distracting. What I found rather odd is why the people in the Capitol were so privileged. Did they work for the government? I guess you could assume that, but the film doesn't bother to explain much of the back-story to the Hunger Games and the new government order. I will say one thing: the costumes. Since everyone looked like either a Lady Gaga impersonator or a Who, the fact the Americans are so openly against gays and transvestites, there is no way that anyone in the future would dress like that. Plus, the visual effects were a little off. Even the fire looked like an FX effect. Yes, it is, but it should't be so obvious. The ending is rather anti-climactic, and I felt that we didn't get much insight on Katniss (Lawrence), as apparently her ----- died in a mining accident. But this is discovered with shaky cam, choppy editing, and in the middle of a tense situation that is completely irrelevant to the reveal. I felt information was sort of shoved in between the battles. There are a lot of problems with this film, and I definitely don't think it's the next Harry Potter franchise, (in quality terms, anyway) but it does have its pros. Jennifer Lawrence was good, and the film did offer some very high tension scenes. The violence is kept at a minimum, so if you want a death game movie with gore and blood throughout, I suggest the Asian masterpiece, ""Battle Royale."" The only good thing that will come out of this film is a better franchise than the current ""Twilight"" and a high hope that American producers will cancel their remake plans of Battle Royale, as they fear people will express distaste for it since it is so similar to the current Hunger Games franchise. It's like trying to remake ""Paprika"" when ""Inception"" was just made. People won't like it. This movie is worth watching in the theaters, but definitely not something special. Unoriginal concept is already driven by stuff we've seen before and the inevitable romance sub-plot. I do like it's stance on the current day media towards the end, and how they eat up all that crap with celebrity marriages and what not. Although, that's its only true saving grace, as the film came off as pretty average. C+"
"Gowienczyk","7","2","10","24 March 2012"," The film has an interesting setting, style and succeeds with pacing, and characterization.
","Unlike some veteran reviewers, I pretty much knew I was going to like The Hunger Games. This is mostly due to my own enjoyment of dystopian and post-apocalyptic settings in general media. But, to counter my own statement of enjoyment, I didn't know how much I would like this, my bar was set pretty low at 2.5, which is the minimal passing score for my rating scale. The reason behind this is behind few exceptions I hate the genre of fiction known as young adult. It's simplistic, pandering, insulting and cliché. It simply is and with writers like Stephanie Meyer this can not be dismissed as a radical bias as there is some truth to it. But I did pick up the Hunger Games novel about a month ago and I ended up being interested on how it was going to be adapted. Let me say this before I say anything else, I believe Jennifer Lawrence is a talent that can't be denied. Calling her talentless, unemotive, stale or any negative term is just objectively wrong. If you don't think so please do yourself a favor and go watch Winter's Bone and to a lesser extent, The Burning Plain or The Poker House. Both were movies that really got me excited for her as a performer. This girl has range, ability and method and while in The Hunger Games it doesn't show completely, she does show the characters three dimensions. The plot is paced very well, with minor inconsistences with camera steadiness, but it does add some thrilling action-esque feel to the scenes even if it sacrifices emotion and reaction. At the end of the day, I can agree with Catherine Reitman on Josh Hutcherson being miscast. I do think higher of him then others, but he just didn't fit or he didn't for me. I also think Wes Bentley just didn't stick either, in appearance I think it was great but when he opened his mouth it seemed dreaded with blandness. I imagined the character presented would of had a thinner, more suave voice and characterization. But otherwise it was only a minor thing that irked me. Everyone else but these two sank into their roles, especially Woody Harrelson and Elizabeth Banks; whom I didn't even recognize until the ending credits.<br/><br/>The film has an interesting setting, style and succeeds with pacing, characterization and only falters when it comes to some blurps that can't be helped either due to casting or source material. This is probably the most finely crafted young adult thing I have experienced since maybe Brian Jacques adapted Redwall to the television screen."

","The movie tries to have a certain blend of drama(romance), and fighting which I think is good for any movie. As the trailers will show the main star of the movie volunteers in because her 12 year old sister was selected to fight in the Hunger Games. Another teenager, a male, was also selected. Neither one likes the idea of having to kill anyone, which makes things difficult when the other competitors have no issues about taking a life.<br/><br/>Action:The action scenes were done really well for most of the movie, but there were times when the camera was jumping around too much, and it was to see exactly what was going on. I would understand a little more if these were genetically altered super people, but they are not. While athletic compared to most people, there is no reason for the camera moving so fast at times, that it is hard to see ""exactly"" what is going on.<br/><br/>Drama:Some of the scenes feel forced, and drawn out. I really saw no reason for the young lady to be attracted to the co-star. I found him particularly whiny at times to be honest. Even some of the women were in the theaters were sighing in frustration when a dramatic scene went on for too long.<br/><br/>Overall the movie does not disappoint, and it seems there will be a sequel. I am not just saying that because there is novel that this came from, but the the guy who I consider to be the true villain in the movie was not happy. I expect for him to try to get revenge."
"saadgkhan","7","2","10","24 March 2012"," Its Jennifer Lawrence who Holds the movie with her incredible portrayal of Katniss Everdeen
","The Hunger Games – CATCH IT (B+) Based upon the popular YA Novel ""The Hunger Games"" about post apocalypse world, where America is split into 12 districts and every year two under 18 participates from each district participate in the deadly game of survivor to death till only one left alive. The Hunger Games has taken world by storm ever since its sort out to the Next Twilight Franchise. I've read the first chapter of the novel and I must say it's indeed one of the best foam of literature I've ever read. Now back to the movie, The Hunger Games starts really fast and within minutes it establishes the New World for us & the reason behind conducting the Hunger Games every year. Once Katniss Everdeen volunteer herself as a tribute to save her sister the movie gets little slow as we expect the hunger game to start sooner but in that time director took time to establish the new world and people of the Capitol. Who have become heartless & cari-creature of the nature, they enjoy in suffering of the young adults. The movie really picks up once the Hunger Game starts and from there till the end there is not a single dull moment. I also think that by not showing a single scene from the Game sequences in the promotional campaign has helped the movie a lot. As we don't have a single clue what will happened in the movie once they enter the arena. <br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss Everdeen is a perfect choice, she is innocent, naive yet strong hearted. There are moments in the movie when you see how incredible artist she is ... whether at the Reaping, when she volunteer herself or when she remembers how Peeta had thrown burnt bread at her in the rain when she was starving or when she attacks Peeta after he says he had crush on her or when she climbs the tree to save her life from other tributes or when a young tribute dies in her arms. There are many moments like these which showcase her enormous talent. Now let's talk about Josh Hutcherson Aka. Peeta, I think Josh is a one note actor who always played lonesome/misfit whether it's Bridge to Terabithia, The Kids are Alright or now The Hunger Games. I wanted Peeta to be someone who can stand next to Katniss at least in physicality... at times he looks really shorter & immature in front of her. Though he played his part well so I won't say he was bad but a perfect casting for Peeta would have taken that actor to stardom like R-Pattz. Liam Hemsworth had rarely any screen time but he was very calm & settled. Alexander Ludwig, Leven Rambin & Isabella Fuhrman as villainous tributes were great. Stanley Tucci, Elizabeth Banks, Woody Harrelson, Donald Sutherland, Lenny Kravitz & Wes Bentley were great. Overall, the Hunger Games is a good movie which stands strongly upon Jennifer Lawrence's shoulders. It's not a typical formula love story and the ending doesn't leave a single clue for the sequels so it would be really interesting to see how story progresses with these characters for those who haven't read the books yet."

","So first things first, wow. I went to the midnight premiere last night and it was just perfect. Now of course there a few things that they could have dine differently, such as adding the line ""it was all for the games how you acted?"" and ""You've got about as much charm as a dead slug"" but it didn't make the movie any less enjoyable. <br/><br/>Scenes like the riot in district 12 after rues death and then showing Seneca Crane's death were perfect additions that set up the next movies and i am extremely happy that they got added to the movie. <br/><br/>Peeta and Katniss were absolutely perfect. The relationship between them in the movie was spot on. You could tell that Peeta was always in love and that there were moments that you could tell that katniss actually meant it while there were some that you could see she didn't which is exactly what I imagined. Cave Scene melted and broke my heart. And Peetas camouflage was brilliant!! <br/><br/>Elizabeth was the perfect Effie and Woody was the perfect Haymitch and together they created a great atmosphere. The careers were cast perfectly! I loved the bitchiness of clove and glimmer. I loved the flirtiness between Cato and Glimmer. Rue's death is a major tear jerker. I haven't cried that much in a LONG time!! Jennifer is Katniss. There is no doubt about it. I don't know that the movie would have had such a large impact without her. She was flawless.<br/><br/>There are few little things that I didn't love, such as how easy it was for Katniss and Peeta in the arena to find water and food because in the book there was so much struggle. I wanted to see the Mutts have the dead tributes eyes, i understand that would have been hard but i just wanted to see it happen. Also when they have won the games and peeta gets taken away from Katniss and he almost dies and she just goes crazy! That would have been excellent to see. Plus some extra lines that could have been said that would have enhanced it a bit<br/><br/>But those are also things that I am totally fine with being excluded because of course certain things can't make it into the movie!<br/><br/>So ya overall it was undeniably one of the book-movie adaptation as well as one of my favorite movies I have witnessed.To say I have finally seen this movie is a dream come true and i recommend it to everyone!"

Although overly long by about twenty minutes, from Romeo and Juliet through Deliverance and Hanna, the story embraces the humanity of its characters without forgetting about plain old action. <br/><br/>Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) has volunteered to take her sister's place in the Hunger Games, where a girl and boy are selected from each of twelve districts to compete in survival games from which only one combatant will remain. Taking her cue from her Oscar-nominated role as a teen saving her family in Winter's Bone, Lawrence as Katniss has the grit to shoot squirrels between the eyes and the tenderness to be an advocate for her loved ones at the same time. Katniss's no nonsense common sense is refreshing as it was for Hanna in last year's teen survivor tale. <br/><br/>The weight of the games (teens murder each other, after all) is almost overshadowed by the allegorical implications such as contemporary repressive governments and nations lusting for their reality shows.<br/><br/>Not for nothing are the contestants brought into the arena on chariots and at one point fight animals ferocious as the lions to which Christians were fed. The presence of two young lovers called ""star-crossed"" pays the appropriate homage to the Bard while the forest stalking nods to The Most Dangerous Game. It's all brainy, nail-biting entertainment.<br/><br/>""Welcome! We salute your courage and your sacrifice and we wish you Happy Hunger Games!"" Snow"

","The Hunger Games was the first book I have ever read from start to finish in my entire life. I thought that the movie trailers looked stupid before I ever even picked up the book. However, I did not want to trash talk my friends, who had read the books, without having any idea of what their infatuation was. So one day I decided to read the first chapter of the book in order to have some clue before I could just say ""You guys are retarded and so is this book"". Its not that I do not read, I have tried to read many books recommended to me before and nothing ever makes an impression. I thought this book would be the same as all of the other books I have tried and trashed in the past, but I was SO WRONG! After something like three pages into the book, I was hooked. I ended up finishing the whole trilogy in one week -- which was hard with work and three kids -- I just could not get the book out of my head. As soon as my kids were asleep, I would read until my eyes became too blurry to read anymore. I would go off of only a couple of hours of sleep each night and eat while I read as well. I finished all three books before the movie came out in the theater and became excited for the movie to hit the big screen.<br/><br/>-- This is where the review starts -- I have always heard that the movie adaptations are never as good as the book, so I read all of the spoilers in order to prepare myself for any disappointment. What I was not prepared for was the fact the the directer was a complete ""sell out"". All of the things I liked so much about the books were ripped away for the big screen adaptation.<br/><br/>I knew that they had changed her mocking jay pin before I saw the movie. But what I did not know was that they took a very important heirloom -- which, in the book, was given to her by the daughter of Katniss's district's mayor and her only companion which she had contact with in her grade at school -- and turn that heirloom into a souvenir from a box filled with them at a local store, taking away all sentimental value. This set me off right from the git-go. Regardless, I tried to keep an open-mind and enjoy the movie.<br/><br/>I know they are trying to fit a lot of content into a short amount of time, so I expected a rushed pace. I had thought that the movie would take a break at some point and give the audience an introduction to the characters and allow them to get attached to them. I also thought that the violence would be reflected very well in the movie which would give the audience a since of awe for these characters which they felt connected to. Instead, I saw a continuously rushed movie with no character attachment what so ever and no display of real violence. In the book, Katniss comes so close to death from dehydration, during her first few days in the arena, but she keeps going and you really get a good since of her character and her willingness to survive.<br/><br/>By mid-way through the movie, I knew that Lion's Gate had ""sold out"" the vision of the books for the sole purpose of making money rather than art. I can only look at Lion's Gate and Gary Ross as corporate monsters who would cut every corner possible to make an extra dollar. I remember thinking about how the movie ""Scarface"" had to challenge group after group to try to keep an R rating, so their movie could be shown in theaters. The makers of ""Scarface"" ended up winning their battles and instead of putting out some cheesy cut version of their movie, they ended up leaving every gruesome shot in their film and it is a classic movie even now.<br/><br/>This movie does not deserve the positive reviews that it is getting. They have taken a great movie about an innocent girl who slowly realizes the corruption and evil of the world she lives in, and turned it into another movie about a three-way love triangle (another unoriginal way to get more team Edwards and team Jacobs gossiping in their nail salons).<br/><br/>In the books, Katniss slowly recognizes how much of an evil and greedy beast her government really is and how the citizens of the Capitol see the tributes as contestants on a game show or something rather than the real people they are. Watching the movie, I felt like the books view of those citizens in the Capitol; I could only the tributes as a bunch of actors making a movie. I felt no connection to them what so ever. And when Rue died in the movie, I really could not have cared less; where as in the book her death his gripping and tragic.<br/><br/>That's why I gave this rating a ten, so I could sell out to a larger audience and have more people read this review who otherwise would have ignored this negative review."

"Reel_starz","8","2","11","25 March 2012"," Jennifer Lawrence, Gary Ross and the audience emerge from The Hunger Games victorious
","In recent years, the young adult sphere of pop culture has been dominated by a certain boy wizard and, more irritatingly for those of us who aren't tween girls or their middle-aged mothers, vampires and werewolves named Edward and Jacob. Now, at last, another is breaking into their ranks, a sixteen year old girl with a braid, a bow and enough spirited determination to conquer the world: meet Katniss Everdeen, the girl on fire.<br/><br/>As Harry Potter's legacy officially ends with the eighth and final movie of the franchise having bowed last year, cementing J.K. Rowling's landmark series as the cornerstone of the childhood of a generation, and the world eagerly anticipates – or dreads – the release of the last Twilight movie, Gary Ross offers us his fine cinematic adaptation of The Hunger Games, the first chapter in Suzanne Collins' bestselling trilogy about a dystopian future where teens are forced to fight to the death by a government that controls its citizens with an iron fist. The director of Seabiscuit brings Collins' story to life with a serious-minded verve and intelligence that distinguishes it from other young adult-oriented fare, assembling an almost pitch-perfect cast and treating the source material – and its fans – with a respect that feels increasingly rare in an industry that often seems to value easy money and marketability over true quality, especially when it comes to potential franchises.<br/><br/>The temptation to churn out a cheap, lazy cash-grab a la the Twilight movies must've been there, given that audiences would've flocked to the theaters regardless, but the filmmakers evidently cared about the movie beyond its obvious box-office potential. They take the pulse-pounding intensity of the books and successfully translate it to the big screen, staying true in spirit but displaying a great willingness to tweak and embellish the story when necessary. Among other changes, by expanding the point of view beyond Katniss, the movie offers a wider perspective, something new that could not be found in the book. It feels like a genuine, standalone movie rather than a paint-by-the-numbers adaptation, a distinction that the Harry Potter movies, for all their artistic merits, never quite mastered. Aside from some memorable performances, those films never provided anything that the books didn't. Furthermore, though as someone who has read the books, I could be wrong about this, The Hunger Games does a good enough job of establishing its characters, story and tone internally that it should work for those coming in cold as well as long-time fans.<br/><br/>Instead of going for sweeping and epic, Ross smartly focuses on the intimate, human aspects of the story, using a sometimes shaky camera and concise editing to create an almost documentary-like feel. He pays as much attention to the quiet scenes, such as a moment near the very beginning where Katniss comforts and sings to her younger sister Prim before leaving to hunt, as he does to the action scenes, which are sporadic and avoid self-indulgence, neither glorifying nor glossing over the violence. The music, composed by T. Bone Burnett, eschews the bombastic punk rock one might have expected in favor of a sparse, folksy vibe that reflects both the rustic simplicity of Katniss's District 12 roots and her inner desperation as she fights for survival; a few techno beats are thrown in as well whenever the action moves to the more advanced, futuristic Capitol. The costumes and sets also help realize the world of Panem in vivid detail while toning down the more outrageous elements of Collins's descriptions, particularly when it comes to the over-the-top fashion tastes of the Capitol residents.<br/><br/>At the center of it all is Katniss Everdeen, played by a forceful but artfully restrained and nuanced Jennifer Lawrence, who appears in nearly every scene and, coupled with her Oscar-nominated performance as the similarly strong-willed and independent Ree in Winter's Bone, is establishing herself as a consistently compelling actress and a screen presence to be reckoned with. Passionate, complex and quick-witted, Katniss is willing to do whatever it takes to protect the people she loves, even if it involves violence or means putting herself in danger, but she doesn't descend into the emotionless, sexless (or sexed-up) killing machine cliché that seems to pass for a strong female character in action films nowadays. She's a heroine worth rooting for.<br/><br/>Though Jennifer Lawrence is undoubtedly the star of the movie, she's joined by a host of talented, well-chosen supporting actors. As Peeta Mellark, Katniss's fellow District 12 tribute and sort-of love interest, Josh Hutcherson displays the appropriate amounts of charisma, sensitivity and conviction; he's come a long way since he first appeared in movies like the mostly forgettable Will Ferrell vehicle Kicking and Screaming and Zathura and continues to prove himself to be one of the most promising actors of his generation. Elizabeth Banks is almost unrecognizable under heavy, purposefully crude makeup as the shrill, peppy Effie, and Woody Harrelson and Stanley Tucci are both as magnetic as always as, respectively, Katniss's and Peeta's perpetually drunk mentor Haymitch and Caesar Flickerman, host of the Hunger Games telecast.<br/><br/>Movies geared toward young adults or teens tend to be dismissed as escapist, mindless fluff not worthy of more serious consideration. Though it's hard to tell whether The Hunger Games will break this mold and be embraced as fully as the Harry Potter series, which found admirers among the young and old, critics and general audiences, was, it has an edge and intelligence that make it hard to resist. Sure, there are more pointed, hard-hitting social critiques out there, and it isn't as bleak or gritty as some might have liked, but as engaging entertainment that doesn't just ask viewers to turn their brains off, it more than delivers."
"ttffnet","8","2","11","25 March 2012"," Quite good considering limitations
","I had already prepared myself for the possible let downs (e.g. the fire entrance on the chariots and Katniss' back story in district 12) so considering those I thought the movie was quite well done.<br/><br/>Make up and costume really stood out to me and the addition of Caesar giving the audience hints as to what the canon meant etc. was helpful and tactful given we couldn't be given a constant Katniss voice-over. <br/><br/>Seneca Crane's death was well done too and despite the PG-13 rating, I felt no NEED for more violence.<br/><br/>Being a HUGE Peeta fan i was quite disappointed that the cave scene was not as great as I had played out in my head, but then again the movie had to be a certain length.<br/><br/>What was lost, as in many book to movies, was the essence of the book. I felt that much focus was on Katniss in the novel and when I read the book I felt more involved in District 12, in the hunger games. With the movie I felt like one in the Capitol and was not able to fully grasp the horrors and shock Katniss experienced as well as I did in reading the novel. <br/><br/>However I think the movie is a great complement to the book as it added a new dimension to the book instead of panning out everything I already knew. I am definitely looking forward to the following movies seeing as how the rebellion has already started so early on and hope that the chemistry between Peeta and Katniss is much more evident in the coming films!"

Some totally convincing, and believable characters, showing a surprisingly deep portrayal of the good and bad sides of human nature. Great music that did not sound contemporary. Great editing, flow, and buildup. Lots of cinematic feel in the filming that had just enough realism to make the movie's world believable. Great artwork and design of a dystopian society, down to lots of small details that really bring you into that world. It was also really great to see science fiction that does not have totally dumb camp moments. This movie gets a zero camp factor. It did not fall into that place where the characters are contrived to be like the cool popular trendy kids in our world. They fit into their world. One of my favorite movies."

"humewg","9","2","12","26 March 2012"," Amazed they pulled it off
","When I ready The Hunger Games, I was amazed with the complexity and depth of the plot and the characters. I hoped from that day on that the story would be picked up by one of the cable networks and turned into a 3 season series, or 3 mini-series. I was convinced that there would be no way to tell the story in a 2 hour or so movie. <br/><br/>I was right that a lot of the back story would have to be left out of a movie, but the writers, director, and especially the actors (Jennifer Lawernce is outstanding as Katniss) were able to pull the story from the pages of the book and put it on the screen. The only reason I did not give the movie a 10 rating is because it was impossible to bring everything over. This may be the best movie adaptation from a book I have ever seen. If you have read and liked (or more)the book(s), I cannot help but think you will like the movie. If you have not read the books, do not worry, the movie has everything in it you need to know to understand the world in which the story takes place (and I suspect you will want to go get a copy of the book for yourself.) <br/><br/>I highly recommend this movie to all."
"Sanpaco13","9","2","12","26 March 2012"," So much better than the book
","This movie stays very close to the book's sequence of events and I enjoyed it much more than reading the book. The problem I had throughout the books was the abundance of insights into the illogical hormonal thoughts of a self-pitying teenage girl. The movie didn't have any of that. Much better :)<br/><br/>On top of the story, the performances were incredible. It is interesting to see so many supporting characters played by big actors (Woody Harrelson, Donald Sutherland, Stanley Tucci, etc.) while the main characters are played by lesser known actors. I thought all the actors played very well to their characters."
"gran_taire","8","2","12","26 March 2012"," Too many people are missing the subtextual undercurrent.
","Saw the Hunger Games yesterday, and I thought it was pretty damn good. I attempted to read the book three years ago in Europe, alas it fell into the River Thames, so I never got past about 1/3 of the book. I found the movie to be an excellent adaption of what I had read though. Okay so everyone's complaining about how it doesn't make sense. Think about it like this, the whole movie has a heavy subtextual undercurrent much like that of Orwell's 1984. It is commenting on what our future could be if we continue to rely on material goods and the media. People these days are so involved with their televisions, to quote The Wombats - ""we kiss with one eye on our TV set"". People living in shantytowns have plasma TVs in the movie. What do you think that's trying to say? People are saying the concept is much too violent, kids killing kids. Well thats the whole friggin point of the movie! It's supposed to be controversial, or else the movie wouldn't have a message about our future. Do you remember Golding's Lord of the Flies? That was kids killing kids too, but not because they were forced to, but because they WANTED to. The point of Lord of the Flies was to point out that no one, NO ONE, as innocent as they might be (English private school boys) have a capacity for evil. It's human nature. And they made me read that at school when I was 13. The film is rated PG13 (M here for mature in Australia), so I don't know why parents are getting their panties in a knot when they take their 7 year old daughter to see it. The shaky camera is one slight criticism, but overall that does have a nice effect too. I think adds a kind of 'amateur' dimension to the movie, and especially the fighting. Acting was superb and directing was perfect.<br/><br/>Overall, 8/10. Freaking fantastic movie, possibly may even become a classic. No Oscar winning flick, but definitely entertaining and spellbinding."

That sound design was genius, and don't get me started on the fashions. It was incredible and I highly recommend to each and everyone of you.

The special effects are pleasing. Some of the elements are hard to believe, that is to be expected from this type of movie. Only downside is, once it gets going, it never slows down long enough for a bathroom break. Can't wait for the next two in the series.<br/><br/>Overall, I give this movie two thumbs up. It is worth the trip to the theater or at least renting / Netflixing. I would not recommend that you take the little kids to it (below 10 years) due to some graphic scenes and an overall gloomy mood."
"nallen2005","10","2","12","25 March 2012"," What a movie!
","This movie was great! The action, the excitement, and the laughter all in one! It sucked though, because not all the deaths could be shown like they were in the movie (like how in the book Thresh killed Clove with a rock, but the movie he kill her by smashing her head into the Cornucopia). , I was sad when Rue died (I didn't cry, but I was sad). So the movie was amazing and I think it'll be the next big thing since Harry Potter ended. I thought at first Percy Jackson would be the next Potter movie, but that was ruled out back in 2010 when I saw the movie. But still it rocked and I can't wait for Catching Fire!!!!

","I must say, I have been waiting for this film since the summer. In addition I read the Hunger Games two more times so that I would know what would be happening and that I wouldn't miss a single detail. The film stayed true to the book, but I would have to say that it did speed up some parts that should have not been missed out on. The movie was mostly in the point of view of Katniss and it took us in her journey, which was well thought out and it showed on the screen. *spoiler alert*the ending part was not close to the book's ending at all and it upset me, because this was a very important piece of information. But all in all, this movie was excellent and stayed true to what it was meant to be. I still say that reading the book first is better because you will have some background knowledge and usually the book is better than the movie. Now I can not wait for Catching Fire! (Nov.22nd.2013) P.S. do not listen to things about the Hunger Games if you have not read or seen the movie. (you never know till you don't try) :D"

I must point out that I have not read the books so I can't offer an opinion on whether they were true to the books etc. What I can say is that this movie takes you to a wonderful trip into a new world and that even though the main actors are not well-known, they make you like them... heck, I even shed a tear or two!!<br/><br/>I would have liked a little more background in general as I kinda had the feeling the movie went off on the assumption that most viewers would have read the book.

"shadow051","6","2","12","25 March 2012"," Splendid.
","I stumbled into my local Odeon outlet completely blind as to what to expect of 'The Hunger Games', as, having never read the books, I would have been. Only obtaining some minor information beforehand apart from The Guardian's review, I was prepared for anything.<br/><br/>What I got was a well executed blockbuster.<br/><br/>In a bit more depth, The Hunger Games was well acted and put together, unlike so many other films on the market today. The plot-line was heavily similar to Koushun Takami's 'Battle Royale', one of my all time favorite novels, however, until the day comes that it gets a GOOD film adaption, The Hunger Games makes a good substitute.<br/><br/>In order to keep the age limitations down to a minimum, it was obvious heavy camera shake was employed, although, in some circumstances it made me doubt the sobriety of the cameraman. Also, this focused the story more on survival and love elements, which were pulled off reasonably well. However, despite its 2:20 running time, I felt some characters were really just placed to die, and I found I didn't care for them due to lack of character development. I reckon The Hunger Games would probably benefit more from a mini-series, but as I said, all round, It was all very slick."
"academywinner","8","2","12","24 March 2012"," so close to perfection, if only!
","I've read and loved the books, the Hunger Games being my most favorite. I more or less have it memorized. I am a tough critic when it comes to book to movie adaptations, however I'm not nit-picky when it comes to every little detail. I'm writing this review because I think this movie missed a MAJOR part of the heart of the novel. I loved so much about this movie, which is why I'm so disappointed practically the most important aspect (Peeta/Katniss's relationship) was so underdeveloped. <br/><br/>The cinematography was irritating at times. I understand why they did it during the reaping to avoid a more mature rating, but at the beginning when we're being introduced to district 12 it was so shaky I was getting dizzy. <br/><br/>Overall I loved the casting. Stanley Tucci was probably the most perfect of all, absolutely everything I could have asked for. Elizabeth Banks, Lenny Kravitz, Donald Sutherland and Woody Harrelson were all very solid. Liam Hemsworth did great as the protective, brooding Gale. Each of the tributes were very much like I imagined them. I was so unbelievably thrilled Josh Hutcherson was cast as Peeta. I couldn't imagine anyone else to play him. I had really high hopes, and wasn't disappointed by his skills, just that the screenwriters barely gave him a chance to use them. While I thought it was cool they showed the game-maker Seneca Crane, he ended up with way more screen time then Peeta, a far more important character. We barely get to see the story of how Peeta helped Katniss. The cave scenes were so cut off! I understand they couldn't put the whole week or however long was written in the book, but that whole part of the story was so rushed we almost wonder why they bothered putting it in at all. The aspect of how worried Peeta is for her, how she's conflicted as she kisses him as Haymitch instructs wasn't there. The little things that made us love the charismatic, passionate and sweet Peeta Mellark were nowhere to be found. And now to Jennifer Lawrence. Obviously, she did a fantastic job as a whole with Katniss. Capturing her fire, anger, fear, determination and pride. But at the fault of the screen writers, not well done was her chemistry with Peeta. We know she doesn't love him like he loves her, but the things that she feels with his sacrificial love weren't anywhere to be found in her eyes, or expressions. All we see her do is feed him broth with an impatient kiss, and patch him up and they were on their merry way. I'm wondering even if the cave scenes had been longer played out, if any sparks at all between them would be there. Because, Jennifer is 21, mysterious, and to be blunt, sexy. Katniss is a young, wiry half starved 16 year old. Josh is 19, adorable, broad chested, and charming. Peeta is 16, stocky, and every bit as lovable. Again, I'm not saying Jennifer wasn't a great Katniss because she did it pretty darn well. But youthful Josh fits Peeta to a T and Jennifer is a brilliant, all grown up, gorgeous woman. Something about them just didn't match up, or feel right. I think the most of the blame goes to the screenwriters, but I can't help but wonder if there might have been a just as good younger choice for Katniss so the perfect Peeta/her chemistry could have been there. <br/><br/>That being said, overall this was one of the closest book to movie adaptations I've ever seen. The emotional/disturbing content of the Hunger Games was done excellently. I just hope the screenwriters give Josh Hutcherson a chance going in to the sequel, because if they can't get their relationship right the rest of the series will be a waste."
"fatewinks","7","2","12","23 March 2012"," An exceptional adaptation of the book!
","I have read all three novels in the Hunger Games series and I loved each of them. I feel that this film portrayed some things perfectly, while completely missing the mark with others. The casting is spot-on for almost every character. Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson really impressed me, as did Stanley Tucci, Woody Harrelson, and Lenny Kravitz. The only character I feel they didn't portray accurately AT ALL is President Snow. I envisioned President Snow to be theatrical like the other people of the Capitol, but more creepy and evil. They did not portray him this way in the movie at all. In fact, his character is exceedingly boring and flat in the film. <br/><br/>I also feel that there was not enough relationship development between Katniss/Peeta and Katniss/Rue. It seems like this always happens in film adaptations, I'm not sure why it is so difficult to incorporate more bonding between characters in movies based off of books. I really liked the relationships between the careers, however. Cato and Clove were better than I imagined. I do not like how the camera was shaky for the majority of the film, especially during fight sequences. I guess they thought it would be ""more effective"" that way, but it isn't. I was worried that they were going to cut the ""nitty gritty"" out of the story. They didn't cut it out, but they sugar-coated it. The point of the games is that they are gruesome, violent, and in-your-face. The fight sequences would have been effective if they had not purposefully drowned them out with jerky camera movement.<br/><br/>I am on the fence about Rue's death scene and Katniss singing to her. It made me tear up, but it could have been so much better. Katniss should have sang the entire lullaby to her instead of singing part of it and it slowly fading as Rue passed. I loved the uprising scene, it made me cry and gave me chills. I also loved the scene with Clove/Katniss and Thresh saving her and killing Clove, it was very powerful. I did not like the genetically engineered dog mutations at all, but I really loved Cato's acting when they were standing on the cornucopia and he was holding Peeta in a headlock and he started crying and talking to Katniss. I was very pleased with that. For the most part, the movie was very good! I can't wait until Catching Fire! I hope this review is helpful to fans of the book who are debating whether or not to see the movie."

","The screen writers, producer and director assumes the movie audience has read the books. Very little character development. Key characters missing altogether. If you haven't read the books several scenes may have you asking ""What was that about?"" This movie is a good visual to book one but several changes annoyed me. Ho-hum on the CGI. The news media is making a big deal about this movie being about kids killing kids. Isn't that happening in our lives now. To me this movie the books are about government control. Hunger games are about penalizing its citizens for an uprising 74 years ago. Basically, be happy we are only killing off 23 of your children each year, we can do worse."
"Movie-Inspector","8","1","4","31 December 2019"," News: Battle Royal is a rip off too!
","If you read the bad reviews you realise that most of the reviewers claim that The Hunger Games is a rip-off of Battle Royal. Alone from this I know that the reviewers are young and Asian-fanboys. There are some stories written many years before Battle Royal was made that got the same topic: gladiators in a sci-fi context. So Battle Royal is nothing else as a rip-off of lets say of The Long Walk (1979) or The Running Man (1982) by Richard Bachman aka Stephen King. Anyway, the production and acting of The Hunger Games just plays in another dimension compared to the ridiculous bad acting and production of Battle Royal. Watch The Hunger Games if you are into Dystopian sci-fi, but you probably did it already I bet, and watch Battle Royal to see something really bad and called cult by some lost souls who certainly got somehow the notion mangas are literature."

"kybrady-31550","10","1","4","1 December 2015"," Hunger Games Review
","Going into the theater, I had not read any book in the series let alone know anything that was going to happen. All I knew was that a bunch of kids were forced to kill each other on live television. The only reason why I went to see this movies is because it is rated PG-13 and my little sister couldn't see it without me. I had low expectations thinking that anything my little sister liked wasn't going to be enjoyable for me. I was very wrong in assuming that. While some say that the first half of the movie is boring, I disagree saying that the first half builds the suspense of the Hunger Games and sets the story up nicely. Once the Hunger Games started, I was hooked. This is the only movie I have ever seen that actually had me at the edge of my seat. Since I didn't read the books, I kept asking my sister questions which she refused to answer because she didn't want to ruin the movie for me. I loved this movie so much that I read all three of the books in less than two weeks. From a film student's analysis, there are some things about this movie that were great and some that were not. The casting and acting in this movie were perfect. I feel like each character was played by the best actor possible and that each actor played the character as well as they could have. Jennifer Lawrence does an amazing job of portraying a stoic and dark Katniss Everdeen. The acting is even more impressive when you see interviews of Lawrence and she is the exact opposite of Katniss. Josh Hutchinson has the build to play Peeta because he is a shorter man but has some strength, like the book describes. Also, Liam Hemsworth plays an acceptable Gale as he is an intimidating figure who is seen as a love interest for Katniss. When it comes to how the movie was filmed, there were some good things and some bad things. One of the negative things is how the movie was filmed with ""shaky cam"" in mostly every shot. I understand that it is supposed to give the movie a more realistic feel but there are some scenes where the camera shaking could cause some nausea, in particular the opening Cornucopia scene. In order to keep the movie at a PG-13 rating, they can't show the gruesome deaths of all the Tributes so for a minute or two as the carnage begins, the camera is shaking non-stop and cutting from shot to shot very rapidly. They hide the violence but the viewer could have a hard time following what is happening. The whole thing happens too quickly for the mind to process. One positive is that the establishing shots are done very nicely. In the beginning of the movie, they show the slum that is Katniss' District 12, and the audience can tell right away how bad the living conditions are. On the contrary, upon arrival to the Capitol, there is an establishing shot that shows how big and lavish the city is in comparison to the other Districts. A final example of a good example shot is when the Tributes enter the arena. The shot shows the Tributes, the Cornucopia and a little of the woods which covers most of the arena. Something that this movie does well is the use of lighting and colors. While in District 12, the lighting is always dark and gloomy to show how dreary life is for Katniss and her fellow District 12 inhabitants. When Katniss and Peeta get their first exposure to Capitol life, they are overwhelmed with different, bright colors. Everyone that lives in the Capitol has a unique sense of fashion that has brilliant colors and over-the-top accessories. The style is there to show the wealth and elegance of those in the Capitol as opposed to those in the outlying Districts that only wear clothes that resemble rags. The entire Hunger Games arena lacks color and is pretty bland looking. A possible reason why that was done was to show that even though the Capitol hosts the Games, they still involve Tributes from the lower Districts. I enjoyed the book and the film both and for different reasons. Like with most adaptations of novels to films, there is the argument that the book is better than the movie. The book goes into more detail about certain situations but with the movie, they cannot copy the book exactly due to the time restraint. If the movie wanted to copy the book exactly, we would be given a 5-6 hour film. The film did the best job it could in including all of the key components that would allow the series to continue into three more movies. Even watching the movie after I read the book did not make the experience worse for me but actually allowed me to enjoy it more as I was able to understand things I missed the first time through."

","""The Hunger Games(2012) is a hugely successful teen movie directed by Gary Rose. This movie is based on the bestselling novel by Suzanne Collins. Casting Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss Aberdeen and Willow Shields as Primrose Aberdeen was perfect and their acting was very impressive. What's more, the development of the story was quite fast.<br/><br/>The film is set in North Carolina in the Southeastern United States. Jennifer Lawrence play Katniss, who is a brave and strong woman because she volunteered for hunger game on behalf of her younger sister.<br/><br/>There are 12 districts in this movie. Every year, one boy and one girl from each district draw a lottery for the Hunger Games. When selected, these 24 participants have to vie for survival. In other words, they have to kill each other until only the last person survives. <br/><br/>When the lottery is started, Primrose Aberdeen (Willow Shields), Katniss's younger sister, is selected. So, Katniss volunteers to take part in the game on behalf of her sister. Her male counterpart, Peeta Mellark (Hutcherson), is also chosen to participate in the game. Eventually, Katniss and Peeta from district 12 head for 'Capitol' to compete for their survival.<br/><br/>The best part of this film is the casting. For example, Jennifer Lawrence acts wonderfully as Katniss Everdeen and so does Willow Shields who plays Primrose Everdeen. In particular, Jennifer Lawrence portrays the tough and strong feature of the main character well. In contrast, Willow Shields (Primrose Everdeen) looks so vulnerable, specifically, when she was selected as a participant of the Hunger game.<br/><br/>The plot of the film was also interesting. The development of the story was quite fast. This kind of fast development was captivating and I felt thrilled throughout the whole movie. However, the movie omitted some important parts of the novel. <br/><br/>It's a lot of fun because of this film's CG and fast development. The film's CG makes it more exiting. This film makes interesting points about the brave woman. Jennifer Lawrence perfectly acts as Katniss. This is a film that is guaranteed to make audiences excite. In addition, they can look forward to the sequels Catching Fire (2013) and Mockingjay (2014)."
"charliep14","8","1","4","20 November 2015"," Fun movie, good set up of the characters
","Watched this movie a couple of times over a few years. The first time was a delightful surprise. I had discounted Hunger Games as adolescent but ended being very much captivated by the Games and growing fond of the Catniss in particular.<br/><br/>Subsequent viewings make the games less enthralling - at the end of the day Battle Royale does it better - but the movie absolutely works as a set up piece for what is to come in subsequent movies. The world is clearly defined, the politics and intrigues well positioned and the characters are introduced strongly in a way you understand and want to root for them. <br/><br/>This + a good cliffhanger ending make it a solid movie."
"barbagvido","8","1","4","18 November 2015"," Better than you would expect
","I'm a book reader and I liked the book very much so I had high expectations for this movie. If you think this is another boring teen movie with sci-fi and fantasy elements, you're wrong. The story is pretty interesting and it's also great as an adaptation. While it's not as brutal as the book, it has almost every plot point and book fans will not be disappointed. The story will probably remind you of Battle Royale, but it doesn't make this movie bad. Performances are great and it really feels real. Some people complained about Gary Ross' direction and all that shaky cam. While I'm not the fan of shaky cam, it kinda worked here because it doesn't look like typical sci-fi blockbuster and it gave a more realistic note to the movie and it also helped cover up some more graphic moments in the movie. I didn't really like the visuals and it's still hard for me to believe that the budget was 78 million dollars but I could deal with it. After all, this is a very good and emotional movie and very faithful to it's source material."
"seannasuti","9","1","4","14 November 2015"," Proved that 'The Hunger Games' could stand toe-to-toe with 'Harry Potter'
","I'll admit I laugh at the fact that every single 'Hunger Games' film released to date, when viewed on the IMDb mobile app, leads off with a negative user review. So to serve as a means of contrast with these negative reviews, here's a positive review of the first 'Hunger Games', directed by Gary Ross.<br/><br/>Now I'll fully admit that this film did end up getting out-shined by its far superior sequel, 'Catching Fire'. But that doesn't mean that this film is as bad as some have put it out to be. Through Gary Ross' solid direction, the film does its job of establishing the universe of Panem and its characters and overall both the story and characters are well-written, especially when compared to other 'Young Adult' franchises like 'Twilight' and 'Divergent'. It also helps that the film has a terrific ensemble cast highlighted of course by Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss Everdeen, who pretty much carries the film by herself, even in a film that also features names like Stanley Tucci, Woody Harrelson, Donald Sutherland, and Elizabeth Banks. <br/><br/>A lot of criticism towards this film mainly revolves around the fast editing and shaky cam, primarily during the Games themselves. Personally it didn't really bother me but I understand where others are coming from. That was definitely one thing that the sequels did improve on. But even with that in mind, 'The Hunger Games' was a solid start to one of the few 'good' film franchises based off of a Young Adult oriented book series."

","The Hunger Games is a really great film, which has a brilliant cast to go with it.

It is also quite different to how I imagined it would be after reading the book, which was good because I felt more unaware again. The sound track is really accurate with the film and sets up the mood perfectly, helping the audience become more captivated. The ending of the film also leaves you very intrigued and I was left waiting, rather impatiently, for the next film to be released in the next year!<br/><br/>The Hunger Games is a great film which is definitely worth watching and will stay with you long after the film has finished!"

I personally feel like the rolls were given to the correct actors. This movie could only have been better if it had more reactions from the parents side. I feel like Katniss's mother was plain and seemed a little to calm given the circumstances. On the other hand the stone cold reactions of president Stone was great! He was everything that his character should have been! He showed no remorse and therefor filled the characteristics that were given to him through his name."
"as-mail2012","6","1","4","7 January 2015"," Panem et circenses
","Overdone reality. Every year TV shows are becoming crueler, fashion is becoming more freakish, social contradictions are aggravated more. Susan Collins' world is an amazing combination of the fiction about future, legends of the past and realities of the present. The story about young Katniss Everdeen touched deeply many people around the world and of course big hopes were pinned on the screen version.<br/><br/>I read The Hunger Games in 2010 and it was my favorite book. So I was waiting impatiently for watching this film for two years. And when I watched it, it didn't look like I'd imagined.<br/><br/>The script. Well, it's hard work to rewrite not very big but rich in events book in a two-hour film. But I can't tell that they did it well. However, I rate it as higher-than-expected. I thought scriptwriters would cut much more scenes but they only deleted some episodic characters and focused us on really important moments.<br/><br/>But whether were they able to show the story?<br/><br/>Born from the ashes a post apocalyptic state Panem with the shining Capitol and enslaved twelve Districts. Hunger, poverty, silence as only available act of the volition. In the spotlight the girl who was going to die for saving her little sister and the boy who was falling in love with heroine and who had saved her once. Die was cast and they both went to the grand capitol for making a show for its perverse residents and dying on the Arena for their entertainment. «The Hunger Games» – the story without semitones. This was the first spark; the Girl on Fire kindled it in people's hearts. And this was the thing which was missed – the fire. Despite of persistent book following they lost the point with chasing the details. No contrast, no fear, many questions and no sense. The world was gray and didn't aroused any emotions. <br/><br/>Cast. Nobody looked hungry. At all. But OK, you can say that it's not important how they looked like but how they acted. Well, if glared eyes and frozen faces with open mouths were the best that Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson were able to show - it's disappointing. Maybe J.L. had a couple of good scenes but that's all. Now she is very famous and she's one of the best young actresses, she really can play brilliant. However, in this film she was awful. The only character in all film who was really great was Haymitch Abernathy. Woody Harrelson was the only actor who tried to play at least.<br/><br/>Cinematography. What was doing on? Was the camera tied on the rope or was cinematographer drunk so his hands was shaking overtime? I had a headache, it was terrible!<br/><br/>Music. This was the thing which saved the film. There were no needless songs, no pompous tirades. Music sounded naturally and moving where it should be. It made the film atmosphere and it was magnificent.<br/><br/>Well, the odds were in the film favor because of many fans all around the world and because of simple pattern of the story that teenagers like - there were defiance to the system, love story and the choice. But there wasn't anything new or anything significant. It's so wailful, when a good book becomes a popular film because then it often loses its heart.<br/><br/>I think the film was quite well but nothing else."
"p-jonsson","5","1","4","25 August 2014"," Okayish but really, why the hype?
","I had not really bothered to put this movie on my to-watch shelf since I felt it was not really my cup of tea but when my wife and oldest son wondered why we did not have it in our collection I thought, well, okay let us get it then. Actually I got the set with the two movies that have been released and yesterday we watched the first one.<br/><br/>Well, as far as I am concerned, it is not a turkey, it is rather ""okayish"" but I certainly do not understand all the hype. It is really far from a great movie. But then, I am probably somewhat biased since, as I wrote above, I did not really think this movie was my cup of tea. Anyway, it starts of with a lot of scenes in ""wobblycam"". I have not met any person outside of the movie industry and self-proclaimed so-called ""critics"" that actually likes it when the camera wobbles around, scenes are blurred and you generally get nauseous by watching. Bad start! The backbone of the story is ludicrous to say the least. Part of the world leaves in luxury when the rest is starving. Been there, seen that. Every year a seemingly random selection of kids, not adults but kids, are selected to fight to the death under some silly pretext of ""preserving the peace"". As I said, ludicrous. The entire air of ludicrousness is enforced by the wacky costumes, makeup and hair styles of the people in the capitol. As I science fiction and fantasy fan I could easily live with this but, sadly, the movie made me only mildly interested in following the characters to the end.<br/><br/>The acting in general is adequate but nothing special. Having said that it must be difficult to actually make anything out of some of the silly roles in this movie. I for sure would laugh my head off every time I entered a scene with all of those ludicrous (yes I know I have used that word a lot in this review, live with it) costumes. The main characters act like the children, with absolutely no clue what they are doing, that they indeed are. This is of course entirely in line with the story but still, the main character is spending a lot of the time running away and sitting around looking startled, sorry or depressed when the games start. I have to say that, at times, the movie felt a bit boring. I have liked several movies that are very slow but here it simply did not sit right.<br/><br/>The games themselves with those dickheads in control and the changing rules, well they were mostly frustrating.<br/><br/>This movie, to me, is a movie for a young adult audience. I have not read the books and I can see how this kind of story would work for a YA book. Personally I was not unhappy having seen the movie and now, having watched the first of the movies I will watch the rest as well but for me it was okay as a two-hour diversion, nothing more."

Well it's simple: The Rich are bastards. The Rich ignore The Poor just so the former may live their lives in lavish excess and plenty while everyone else starves. The Rich are totally oblivious of the sufferings of The Poor and are more easily distracted from real world problems than a pixie in a jewelry sto... ooooh, shiny!! Not only that but the beauty standards of The Rich are just sickening; they think they are pretty... but we all know they look like clowns. <br/><br/>Then there are the People In Power. The People In Power are not just bastards, they are pure evil. They exploit The Poor to maintain the lifestyle of The Rich and will do absolutely anything to maintain the status quo, murder included. And they don't even do it themselves but make The Poor kill each other. Why? Because The People In Power exercise shameless victim blaming, so according to the ""logic"" of the Hunger Games - as explained by the People In Power - The Poor earned their plight. This evil is so institutionalized that the power to screw with The Poor even comes with a nifty Copy & Paste interface, used with smirking glee several times during the narrative. <br/><br/>And this has been going on for no less than Seventy. Four. Years. Only if you read the books before you see the movie can you understand why this is happening.<br/><br/>Enter The Heroic Underdog that is pure in heart, self-sacrificing, skilled, defiant and - most important of all - beautiful. She plays the game(s) of the People In Power, excels at them without actually getting her hands dirty and soon there is unrest among the oppressed masses that are The Poor. Do I need to mention that that People In Power explicitly hate pure, self-sacrificing, skilled, defiant and beautiful Heroic Underdogs that cause unrest and threaten to overthrow the system?<br/><br/>The story is the theories of Karl Marx, heavily condensed to their simplest, most romanticized form. The disguise is paper thin: it is upper class vs. worker class as per The Communist Manifesto & Das Kapital For Teens In The 2010's. The workers are fed up getting used and abused, but are constantly quelled by the upper class. Enter the worker class hero that is the spark to the upcoming revolution... <br/><br/>The rest is just some tastefully hidden violence to pad it out as a two hours teen action flick and drive home the point that the upper class really is The Evulz (as my teenage daughter would express it).<br/><br/>Who should see this film? If you like stories of the ""system is corrupt and needs overthrowing""-genre... go for it. If you want to see rich, arrogant, gloating jerks get their comeuppance... this is just up your alley. If you want a movie with refreshingly strong female characters that your daughters and sons can watch without you worrying about stale gender roles... yes, this is it!<br/><br/>Just don't think too much about the insane, over-the-top premise or you get an otherwise decent film ruined for you. I couldn't avoid that. But that's just because I'm getting too old for this flick."

"ktsmileyster","7","1","4","2 January 2013"," Peeta (and Cast) Satisfy Fans' Hunger
","The odds were definitely in the favors of the movie creators of the Hunger Games. Making 155 million dollars opening weekend, the Hungers Games exceeded fan's expectations. The film's accuracy to the book's text, written by Suzanne Collins, pleased the massive numbers of dedicated fans. The talented Jennifer Lawrence plays the main character Katniss Everdeen, a young girl who lived in District 12, the poorest of all districts, with her sister, mom, and best friend Gale Hawthorne, played by Liam Hemsworth. Lawrence made an outstanding performance which perfectly displayed Katniss' traits of bravery, stubbornness, and survivalist instincts. The story takes place in Panem, a post- apocalyptic country located on the continent of North America. The Capitol, an extravagant and lavish city which dictates the country, hosts an annual game show called ""The Hunger Games"" in which tributes are picked from each district to battle until death in the man-made and controlled arena. Katniss and Peeta Mallark, played by Josh Hutcherson, are selected from District 12 to participate in the games and must try to survive the cruel Capitol imposition that traditionally kills twenty- three people, leaving only one victor. One can assume that a plot set in a futuristic Utopian world has to be intriguing, but somewhat difficult to produce. The movie realistically portrays Panem through the intricate set details of the arena and Capitol. Many were excited to see how the game arena would be portrayed since the book described it as a force-field covered area, strictly controlled by the Gamemakers, with a Cornucopia center. The Cornucopia was where the games began and contained necessary weapons and tools. This part was disappointing because, in the movie, the Cornucopia was just a large, metal, box-looking structure. Aside from that, the set was extremely well done. Furthermore, the graphics of the fighting scenes did not fail to impress audiences. From Katniss' bow and arrow shootings to the chase of the mutated wolves, watchers were completely soaked into the movie absorbing the intense action-packed scenes. However, the film was comical at certain parts, mostly due to Katniss' sometimes awkward personality. The make-up of the cast members was also astonishing. It was elaborate and creative, but not overdone and frightening. Exemplary examples include Seneca Crane's beard and Cinna's eyeliner. Overall, the movie was marvelous and I applaud the cast for an outstanding job imitating an accent that has not yet been heard."
"samdaniell","5","1","4","9 October 2012"," An OK Movie.
","One of the most successful movies of this year and also one of the most loved. Most of the hype was surrounded because its an adaptation from one of the franchise of the novel which were equally successful, and was not a big surprise when it became a big money earner at the Box Office.<br/><br/>The story takes place in the future in a place called Panem which is divided into 12 districts. Each year two young representatives from each district are selected by lottery to participate in The Hunger Games. The 24 participants are forced to eliminate their competitors while the citizens of Panem are required to watch. When 16-year-old Katniss's young sister, Prim, is selected as District 12's female representative, Katniss volunteers to take her place. The first half of the movie is about surroundings and the preparation of the event. The second half deals with the real game and the action. Often compared (wrongly) with the Japanese action movie 'Battle Royale', which is a far superior movie, both are different. <br/><br/>The script seems rushed where it has to be clear, and slow where it had to be really fast. Also the direction seemed a bit bad. Acting wise the movie revolves around Katniss, wonderfully played by Jennifer Lawrence. She is one good reason to watch this movie. Although its not her best performance, we can see her amazing screen presence in almost every frame that she is in. The rest of the cast just does what they are required to do. Cinematography and editing is just fine. And the make-up in this movie is really wonderful, one can hardly recognize Elizabeth Banks. I know most of you would not agree with me but the movie is just watchable. To be frank don't watch it with high expectations!!!"

For one thing, it kinda felt too rushed to me (seeing as the book was a whopping 384 pages, not a short book by any means) and to me the movie just wasn't able to convey all the same emotions experienced while reading it. Having said that, I do think that they did a good job of portraying Gale, Prim, and some other key characters accurately. I do kind of wish though that a little more was put into Thresh and Rue (though they did do a fair job with her) and I would agree that it was kinda violent, though it was only semi-realistic for the most part (for obvious reasons of course). Over all though, I would say it was a fair movie, though I much prefer movies like The Chronicles of Narnia, the Lord of the Rings, and Pirates of the Caribbean."

","Like ""The Truman Show"" ""The Hunger Games"" depicts a world in which real people are plunged into an enormous TV set that replicates specific environments, and then filmed 24/7 with numerous hidden cameras.<br/><br/>However, the similarity ends there as this movie is not about a relatively benign show with an unassuming and oblivious star. The ""stars"" of this show (the ""Tributes"") know all about these terrifying ""games"", and their likely fate.<br/><br/>The ""set"" of ""The Hunger Games"" is a far more dangerous environment, where violence and death at the hands of the other ""Tributes"", or ""natural causes"" (i.e. hazards introduced by the shows' producers), is never far away.<br/><br/>In this respect ""The Hunger Games"" is more akin to a futuristic ""Gladiator"" - a blood-thirsty spectator game where the Christians (or in this case the ""Tributes"") are cast to the lions, all in the name of entertainment for the masses.<br/><br/>Unfortunately ""The Hunger Games"" possesses neither the intrigue, subtle hints and slow revelations of ""The Truman Show"", nor the double crossing characters, grandiose battles and epic storyline of ""Gladiator"".<br/><br/>For me it is a better than average sci-fi movie that could have delivered much more than it did - I wanted it to be great but the formulaic and predictable ending belied the intensity of some the earlier moments, whether that be the central character, Katniss, rushing forward to volunteer for the games in place of her sister, being hunted down by an alliance of other Tributes, or comforting the sweet young dying Tribute who befriended her.<br/><br/>As this is the first in a sequel of films it may well be that as the overall plot unfolds this proves to be a more worthy film as the first in the series, rather than a stand-alone movie.<br/><br/>Taken as a stand-alone it introduces us to a compelling and chilling idea that gives us a good story line, some well executed scenes and a few memorable characters, which, for me, just scrapes it into the 7/10 league."

","i haven't read the book, and i am judging this solely on the movie i have watched. i had been watching this movie for only 10-15 minutes when i started comparing this movie to the running man with Arnold Schwarzenegger.and this feeling kept me through whole movie.and honestly i don't know about the book hunger games,haven't read it (but i heard it is great one to read)but i kind of liked Running man better. There are few points of the movie i don't really get - i'll try to be short- why are the fighters aged from 9-19 years old?why not,i don't know for instance 20-40,and how much chance does really a 9 year old have in this brutal-killing game?secondly when bunch of other contestants cornered up on the tree Katniss(girl from district 12)they couldn't come up with nothing else then camping under the tree?-i found that completely stupid. they also said in the beginning that a lot of contestants would die from starvation,dehydration etc.-they seemed quite good to me like they just had a cup of coffee and a sandwich.-finally the biggest problem i have with this movie is that nothing happens in the end-in the running man there is some kind of twist they actually do something about the show,rebel...here they just win it and that's it by the end of the movie i didn't care a bit if they would win or die.i give it 5 but only because first lest say 30-40 minutes were somewhat fine and i enjoyed a little watching them prepare for the games and because this movie reminded me of the running man ,i like the whole plot in the movie but that's it."
"Gotmoviespop","9","1","4","20 August 2012"," Pretty Good, But You Should Read the Book First
","""The Hunger Games"" was a fairly good movie even without reading the book, but most of the negative reviews are posted based on the movie out of context. The movie was close to the book aside from a few major lapses. For example, I think it was strange that Kantiss had gotten the MokingJay Pin from the Hob, rather than it being given to her by Martha. Martha plays a key role in ""Catching Fire"", and it's important for her and Katniss to be friends in ""The Hunger Games"". I also didn't like how the pin was kept a secret in the beginning of the games. In the book each tribute is allotted one item from their district to take into the arena.<br/><br/>All in all, the Hunger Games was a good resemblance of the book, and I would recommend the movie to friends and family. Be warned though, it's a tad violent. The Actors and Actresses play the characters great, and I'm excited for ""Catching Fire"". But seriously, you should read the books first (helps a little with any confusion.) :)"
"tkell31","10","1","4","18 August 2012"," Entertaining, but too PG
","I had high hopes for this, but in execution it turned out to be merely entertaining. Entertaining isn't bad, but other than the acting it isn't much better than your normal Hollywood action movie with good production values. It seemed like, to me, that by trying to accomplish too much they neglected the fundamentals of good movie making...develop the characters. The secondary characters have almost no depth or explanation for their actions. Why did Pete join the alliance? why was there even an alliance in a fight to the death? Why didn't he hack the others up when they got stung by the wasps? Why did Ru elect to help Kat? How did Ru's district partner know about Ru and Kat? Why would anyone trust the kids from the military district? Why did the trainers like Kat so much? Why was Kat like a mom to her sister? Not all those are directed at character development, but I think it is pretty obvious many parts are glossed over or explained with a very brief flash back.<br/><br/>The other main complaint I had is how the ""hunger games"" actually turn out to be. It starts off with a bang as multiple contestants appear to ignore the advice they were given and start fighting immediately leading to half the contestants getting killed in the first 30 seconds or so. However, from that point on it gets petty contrived and at times silly. Katniss, being the ""good"" one, doesn't hurt anyone that hasn't already hurt someone else. Her main skill seems to be hiding in trees and she gets saved on at least three occasions for no real logical reasons and not due to any skill of her own. All in all a fairly weak protagonist. One of my pet peeves is the talking kill, in this instance the girl who gets a knife to Kat's throat, but instead of killing her decides to chat for five minutes until someone comes along and kills her, but lets Kat live. I get that many people wont care about that, but to me a great movie doesn't need to rely on silly tricks to reach the conclusion and also will tackle the occasional thought provoking issue (in this case, would Kat have killed anyone who didn't ""deserve"" it in order to win the contest?). <br/><br/>I did enjoy the way the media was portrayed given what was at stake, the acting was very good, and of course the plot in general was good. My understanding is there is a sequel in the works to tackle the real issue, a society where kids are forced to fight to the death in the first place. Maybe that is why this wasn't as good as I thought it would be, the bigger issues are still to come. All in all I expected a stronger heroine and more substantial secondary characters."
"silentman01","6","1","4","12 August 2012"," Didn't live up to the hype but still good
","When word was going around about ""The Hunger Games"" trilogy (being someone not familiar with the books), I thought I would give it a shot when it came out since Jennifer Lawrence was in it. Then came the insane Box-Office earnings and rave reviews from most parties. My expectations, as a result, were heightened. However, for me, the hype did not match it's reality. I am not saying that it wasn't a good film, it just wasn't as good as I thought it would be and I think it was so because it really did not put much detail into the many aspects which define the sociological order that exists in this dystopia. This is personified in an event which is based on the idea of a celebration dedicated to nothing other than constant revenge being undertaken by the powerful on it's powerless to serve as a reminder to the consequences of their actions. <br/><br/>I know that most people (who have read the book) would not hold this critique into consideration coming from someone who has not read the prose. Most of the film's fans,however, are thoroughly satisfied due to it keeping true to the original material. To me a great adaptation does not necessarily need to replicate it's source but also give a perspective of the film-maker on it to be really considered to be a piece of art he/she can call their own. Even though the film is directed well by Gary Ross, the lack of that insight into the mechanisms that rule this dystopian futuristic world would have been appropriate and would have been a film which he could call his own. Probably the next installments will delve into that aspect a lot more to make it a better film than it is.<br/><br/>Despite this flaw, I found the movie to be very enjoyable and would watch the sequel. Gary Ross (who, unfortunately, won't be back to direct the second installment) does tell the story he wants to tell very effectively with the use of Flashbacks and skillful editing despite the material lacking proper character development. A lot of people are saying that it lacks this insight into the characters due to it being the first of four films, but that for me is no reason why it could not be delved into since it has been done with such a series before.<br/><br/>The star of the show was Jennifer Lawrence who continues to awe us all with her versatility and maturity on screen at such a young age. She really gives us a glimpse into what her character is all about and does it with a guile that is synonymous to the most seasoned actors. Unless, God forbid, some unforeseen tragedy befalls her, I think we are really witnessing the growth of a great actress for the future who will give us a career with performances to remember. Even though this performance is nothing compared to her brilliant breakout role as ""Ree"" in ""Winter's Bone"", it brings out her versatility as she plays the different facets of her character with admirable realism.<br/><br/>A lot of people have been comparing this film to ""Battle Royale"" and I can't blame them. ""The Hunger Games"" even though it deals with very different schematics to that of the Japanese film, the portrayal of darkness in Takashi Miike's film was far more resounding giving it a more realistic perspective to society's degradation than ""The Hunger Games"" did. I am no sadist, but I think another flaw of ""The Hunger Games"" was that it really did not delve into the darkness and brutality which is the signature of such an event to a level which was required with such a premise. I guess if it was Directed with a darkness which is a signature for Director's in the East, it would have not been as accessible in theaters as it was, thus would have definitely deflated it's monstrous earnings (In hindsight, a wise business decision). Despite it's flaws (ones I consider to be), the film is really enjoyable and does have some very gripping scenes which complement it's material. Not a must-see, but I promise you would be entertained if you do."
"GTeixeira","6","1","4","8 August 2012"," Entertaining on its own, weak compared to the book
","In a futuristic world the former USA is now Panem, which is divided between the Capitol (who governs it) and the 13 Districts. At some point a revolt broke between against the Capitol, resulting in the destruction of the 13th District and the start of the Hunger Games, in which a male and a female teenager from each district is thrust into an arena and forced to fight to the death like modern gladiators: a constant reminder of the Capitol's power. The story follows the couple from District 12, Katniss and Peeta in the 74th Hunger Games.<br/><br/>First of all, I have to point out that the book is told from Katniss' point-of-view.<br/><br/>The change they made in narrative hurts a lot the movie, as it makes no effort to try and find an alternative. It took away a lot of the emotional depth, lacking Katniss' emotional turmoil at the arena, her conflict regards her own emotions towards Peeta and her observations regarding what's happening around her. The tributes, too, are less developed and Katniss' relationship with some (the District 11 ones especially) is somewhat more shallow; making it so we don't connect with them as much as we do in the novel.<br/><br/>It also takes alway much of the political and social insight on the Capitol and the Districts, which is the books' greatest intelligence. They left out many concepts such as the Avox and the Capitol's exploitation of the Districts. Their caricature of our world, both present and past, is what makes the 'Hunger Games' more than just a normal teenager novel and makes it thought-provoking too.<br/><br/>Now, what the movie did. The shaky cam, the director's 'answer' to the POV, not only fails at its goal but also takes from the actual movie-goers entertainment. The whole character development is almost null, they totally changed Haymitch's character (in the book, he is pretty much a self-destructive drunkard which is caused by everything he witnessed in the past as a former tribute and mentor in the games) and Peeta's actor was just terrible (I didn't like Peeta in the books either, but he was a lot better than this).<br/><br/>For the good: Jennifer Lawrence is wonderfully cast; she does a very good Katniss and actually tries to convey the internal turmoil of her character despite the problems the adaptations offers. Effie Trinket was really well-done, Donald Sutherland (despite the small role) is ideal for transmitting President Snow's eerily calm and manipulative nature (which will be seen more in the sequels), and I liked how they expanded on Seneca, who was almost non-existent in the novel. The action scenes, while short and slightly impaired by the shaky cam, are still well-done; and Rue's death, while not as impacting as in the novel, is still a touching moment (the addition of the rebellion was a nice touch too, foreshadowing some of the sequel's events).<br/><br/>The visuals are good as they managed to capture the right imagery for the Capitol and the District 12, as well as their inhabitants.<br/><br/>Conclusion: The movie is still tense and a lot of fun to watch. It's a very flawed adaptation, and the book's fans will probably not like it very much, but as a stand-alone it's well worth a watch."
"myc4971","6","1","4","6 August 2012"," Could have been far better! Missed a lot of points then won some...
","After reading the plot from IMDb, I actually thought this has some promise. Movies about dystopian future are generally very interesting because they tackle issues that currently pervades our present society but in an exaggerated manner. The story has a distinct point of view that is very much culturally relevant. <br/><br/>I tried hard to stop myself from reading the book before watching the movie because I wanted to keep an open mind. But halfway through the movie, I just realized that there's particularly missing in the movie. Something just doesn't add up. I don't get how a girl from extreme poverty would have the grace and restraint that Jennifer Lawrence is portraying. I just don't get the power of connection between Peeta and Katniss. It just didn't make any sense to me. Other characters, aside from Katniss, also seemed to be made out of cardboard and seemed to be placed just to define who Katniss is. Bottomline, there was no one I cared for in the movie except for Katniss. Which is weird. Even the impact of Rue's death was just a total miss. <br/><br/>Then I read the book and everything became clearer. Everything was more pronounced. Each character like Effie and Haymitch had depth and layers. There was so much in the book that I felt that should have been explored in the 140 minutes of the movie. I don't buy the idea that they had to leave out so much because there's only so much they can show in the movie. Surely, LA Confidential was able to achieve that, Lord of the Rings, To Kill a Mockingbird, No Country for Old Men, etc...<br/><br/>And of all the things they have to cut off, why leave out the back stories of the characters that will make them more ""human"" and realistic to the eyes of the audience. Why leave out the nuances of the characters that can ultimately define the character. Effie, Peeta, Haymitch and Rue were so multi-dimensional characters in the book that the movie just wasted the opportunity to give the film more depth and texture. Even the Katniss in the book was so different from the film. In the book, it was more believable that Katniss actually ""feasted"" on the food upon seeing it in the train whereas in the movie, she didn't even touch a thing. That actually shows character and where she came from. For crying out loud, she's from a place where she dreams of food everyday!!! And it's instances like that which actually makes the character more believable. <br/><br/>There were more things that the film that left out. There's one thing that the film made sure it hits right on target: Art Direction. However, it's all eye candy. Truly, a missed opportunity. And I'm just purely disappointed that this is coming from the same director that gave us ""Pleasantville"", one of my favorite films of all time which so cleverly discussed the themes of tolerance and finding oneself. <br/><br/>I suspect the studio had something to do with the direction and they wanted to go the commercial route. But cmon, The Hunger Games is a young adult novel and it successfully navigated through dark and adult themes, so why can't the movie? Surely, the market that was targeted by the book is the same market who will go see the movie. <br/><br/>Despite being disappointed by the initial serving, I hope it gets better on the next installment.<br/><br/>If you're thinking about watching the movie (who hasn't at this point in time?), go watch it but I highly encourage you read the book if you're left unsatisfied."

","If plain entertainment is your cup of tea and you are in your teens, and if you take lightly to kids killing kids in a game intended for entertainment for the masses, then go for it. Apart from some good acting by the pleasant looking Jennifer Lawrence, whose character development this movie revolves around, there is not much to commend in it. A shaky, inconsistent and incoherent plot, only a couple of good dialogs and jerky action scenes are what characterize it. There are no really good ideas in it, and a couple of very bad ones. The first bad idea is that a contest in which all but one of the participants are killed by the others can be called any sort of 'game' by any stretch of imagination. The correct term is clearly 'war' if the movie is to be taken seriously. (Perhaps in the post- postmodern dystopia words have entirely new meanings, or totally hazy meanings.) The idea that games can be a substitute for war is a good idea, but only if these games are not fatal, or are fatal only exceptionally. The other bad idea is that children are forced by lottery to participate in this death contest (notice that nobody volunteers, and the only exception is also motivated by the desire to save her sister). This is similar to the 'archaic man's' (Jung) worst habits of trying to please the gods by ritual human sacrifices that were almost never voluntary. The popularity of the Hunger Games books and now this movie could be that it stirs that archaic visceral excitement of seeing people being sacrificed as tribute or to please the powers that were presumed to be, so that those powers (gods) give the cult, community or tribe a bountiful harvest so that they don't go 'hungry'. Let me bring some rational balance here by pointing out that these archaic practices did work in exceptions, and only if a powerful person of the community sacrificed something voluntarily with a pure heart and impeccable motive. In all other cases, it was a perverse ritual that had bad consequences for the community, but which was not to be realized by the perpetrators of the ritual. Does watching this movie ring a bell?"

","First of all, I loved Jennifer Lawrence in this; this girl can really act and is definitely going to be a good actress. The best moments of the film pretty much all involved her and she takes this from just an OK film to something pretty good (although it was a slightly sub par performance compared than her in Winters Bone, but that's probably to do with the script). I'm definitely a fan of hers. <br/><br/>The film was fairly unique, and much better than the usual teen fair. The concept kept you interested and things definitely got a bit dark, more so than normal in a run of the mill kids film. Surprisingly, the pacing of the film was excellent, as it never really felt like 2.5 hours long, at all. I've always found that to be a good trait of a great film. <br/><br/>I wasn't really moved by the ""big emotional scene"", because I never really cared for any of the characters outside of Katniss. There wasn't enough character development for me to feel connected to them. A bit surprising given the almost 2.5 hour run time, you figured there'd be enough time for more character development. Admittedly, it did seem to work for some of the younger kids in the audience (who probably read the book and had the background I lacked). However, the scene directly after this did hit home (for me anyway), as it really underscored the bleakness of the films sci-fi future.<br/><br/>The hype machine on this was clearly in over drive. I enjoyed it, but it's definitely not as good as it's been touted. It was fairly predictable as the ending was never really in doubt and there were few scenes that really blew me away.

"jeffcour","7","1","4","10 May 2012"," Very good adaptation!
","First, let me say that I am age 42 and I devoured the book in FOUR DAYS. It was that intense and personal. I was so looking forward to the movie, because I heard Susan Collins herself was helping write the screenplay in order to get a faithful adaptation. This is NOT just your average teen-angst soap-opera barf-o-rama like Twilight. This is intense, violent, addictive, guttural, emotionally-charged stuff. The book is phenomenal. The movie tries its best to get there, and although it is immensely exciting, it falls short on a few points. Here is my interpretation: <br/><br/>THE NOT-SO-GOOD:<br/><br/>1) Katniss' internal monologue is gone. The greatness of the novel lies in the mystery of the Capitol, the oppression, the visceral terror of the annual Reaping, the deadly perils of the Arena and unease of not knowing WHAT was coming next from the sadistic Gamemakers. This was because the book is told entirely in first person from Katniss' narration. It is vividly personal. The entire story involves her reactions to and wonderment about the brutal things that are happening to her. The movie goes more behind the scenes and delves more into the Gamemakers and the political personalities that inhabit the Capitol. This does our heroine a disservice, and leaves those who haven't read the novel wondering what the heck is going on a lot of the time.<br/><br/>2) That damn ""jiggle-cam."" In an effort to evoke a sense of ""immediacy,"" I guess, the filmmakers employed a hand-held camera for about the first 45 minutes. Once Katniss arrives in the Capitol after the Reaping, it goes away, thank god, and you can put away your Dramamine.<br/><br/>3) Gale's character, so enjoyable in the novel, is wasted and flat in the film. He's like a cardboard cutout of himself. The whole love-triangle thing that Katniss employs to survive the Arena with Peeta is played way down.<br/><br/>THE GOOD:<br/><br/>1) Jennifer Lawrence as kick-ass Katniss, the Girl On Fire. 'Nuff said.<br/><br/>2) Rue's death at the hands of the boy from District 1 in the Arena, because Katniss is a split second too slow in firing her arrow at him, is as emotionally devastating in the film as it is in the book. You know it's coming, but you still don't want it to happen. Katniss has become protective of her. She reminds her of her own sister. Rue is only 12. She's a beautiful, innocent child. This scene alone illustrates, in a nutshell, the utter absolute cruel inhumanity of the Capitol, keeping their 12 districts in line by having children kill children on live TV and call it a ""Holiday."" It's clear that this is one of Ms. Collins' favorite scenes, because it is a lavish and beautiful tragedy.<br/><br/>3) The action is fast and furious. Donald Sutherland as President Snow. Woody Harrelson as Haymitch. Lenny Kravitz as Cinna. ALL excellent.<br/><br/>Enjoy! Happy Hunger Games! And may the odds be EVER in your favor..."

I like those ""population reborn"" movies in general.<br/><br/>But it was too SLOW for me. Was hoping for a more dynamic chain of events and a slightly different ending.<br/><br/>Example: the funeral scene could have been shorter. (I don't consider this a spoiler, as there can be only one winner in the Games anyway).<br/><br/>All in all - you can go see it in the movies: won't be bad.

"amahlanand","7","1","4","9 May 2012"," This is definitely out there
","A 'Hunger Games' virgin would be bewildered at the concept of the story. Importantly however, the film is given context and grounding for those who have not read the novels making it comprehensible as a story, even if you don't warm to it as a premise. <br/><br/>Reading a novel, specifically one full of minute details which can make a large difference to perceptions, will almost always supersede the film if every detail is not treated appropriately and as a 'virgin', you get the impression that there remain some grey areas and potential plot holes, but nothing leaves you utterly perplexed. Ultimately though, you come to realise that the 'Hunger Games' is not as much about cruel commerciality than about hope and inspiration in a dystopian, empire type world. The plot becomes more sophisticated and grows on you with time. <br/><br/>The realm itself is depicted magnificently in a futuristic, fantastical and fashionable way, the latter part being most peculiar yet still visually appealing. The usage of CGI was brilliant in highlighting the stark contrast between the dictatorial, advanced 'Capitol' and the backward, subordinated 'Districts'. <br/><br/>Such young adult novel film adaptations are often fraught with castings of young 'hunks' or 'princesses' who are on the screen more for looks than acting but this film sets itself apart through some particularly good characterisation from Jennifer Lawrence ('Katniss Everdeen') as well as old timers such as Elizabeth Banks ('Effie Trinkett') and Woody Harrelson ('Haymitch Abernathy'), both of whom portrayed oddball, quirky sort characters which needed some thinking out of the box.<br/><br/>Certainly, fanatics of the novels would be more than pleasantly receptive towards the cinematic adaptation but expect non-fanatics to be walking out of the film thinking 'what was that all about?' It's definitely unique and beats 'Twilight' on screen hands down, but the content still remains a touch overwhelming and outlandish for 'virgins'."

Because I'd already read numerous reviews from friends who had told me how sh*t it was.<br/><br/>So instead, I went into this movie trying to see the good in it..<br/><br/>Sadly, there wasn't much.<br/><br/>The execution is just poor. Whoever directed this should not be put in charge of any sequels if they hope to engage any further.. Edit: oh, it's the Pleasantville guy, well that must be his once off! The acting also is not much better, some of it very forced!<br/><br/>This is.. a survival movie, based apparently on a book (part 1 of a trilogy) but at no stage did it really give a sense of urgency, or real fear for one's existence. There was no feel of attachment to any of the characters, including the main pair who made Anakin and Padme's wooden romantic engagement in Star Wars look positively the greatest of all time (please note sarcasm)<br/><br/>Some actors of T.H.G, read like a cast list from Marvel movies: Jennifer Lawrence (Mystique from X-Men: First Class) who by the way, acts almost identical in both movies as an outsider.. Liam Hemsworth (ok, not Marvel, but brother of THOR) ;) The two German scientists from Captain America: Stanley Tucci and Toby Jones (the latter, I don't think utters a single word!)<br/><br/>A redeeming face amongst the latter cast is Woody Harrelson. I actually sat up and started to take notice somewhat of what was going on, til I realised he wasn't going to get much more.. Another highlight is: Amandla Stenberg.. who plays Rue. Her only other appearance of note so far, being the young ""Cataleya"" in Columbiana. In both she doesn't have enough screen time!<br/><br/>The rest are pretty much, no names or TV actors. The guy who played the pervert son in American Beauty, the mother of the Cyclon in Battlestar: Caprica. Oh, Donald Sutherland is in this.. but he's such a by product of the film, that he's out of place, or out of touch with what is going on, muttering through his scenes as his wades through the greenery doing nothing much.. Equally, there's Elizabeth Banks who just looks and plays a ghastly personality.<br/><br/>The bloodshed truly feels PG, and the NYPD Blue (showing my age) camera work is so disconcerting.. Used to cover up (in latter Transformers it was lazy CGI) but in this film horrific killings, that were most of the time unseen, and barely heard. Apparently this film is banned in Vietnam due to the violent scenes (wtf?!)<br/><br/>IF you want to see real survivor films. These are the ones to see: THE TOURNAMENT, PREDATORS (PREDATOR is on a whole other level) and the ultimate school Japanese thriller: BATTLE ROYALE.<br/><br/>Please just read the book, and perhaps wait til someone accidentally hires the movie (acquires it) and you're caught out watching it. Or let your youngin's watch it, as it really is, I guess made for them, and I can see why. Poor Jennifer Lawrence, actually RICH Jennifer..

"TheXeroXone","7","1","4","21 April 2012"," Stop Shaking the Damn Camera
","Who'd have ever thought that the USA would have to import its violence. But its true. In the quest to ever lower the bar for how far Hollywood will go to grab a buck, they finally made a movie about children slaughtering each other with a PG-13 rating.<br/><br/>How did they accomplish this? By shaking the camera mercilessly and never showing any actual penetration. In effect, its about as violent as any three stooges movie without the zany sound effects. Dogs mauling kids; either off-screen or in the shadows. Killer wasps; more shaky camera work and muddied CGI. If it wasn't for the cannon blasts signifying the deaths of the contestants, there would be no way to know what happened to most of the characters in the arena.<br/><br/>I'm not saying this movie is stupid, its actually pretty good. Its just not a good action film and its almost too juvenile for what should be a more dramatic piece. The violence is all done off-screen or through the use of shaky cameras so there's no sense of imminent danger. The other sacrifices are ignored so entirely that there's no feeling that the main character wouldn't make it to the end. There is a scene where a friend of the main character is impaled with a spear and there is no weight to the scene or the memorial scene that follows, its just another minor character dying off screen.<br/><br/>This movie is more of a satire on reality TV game shows, but they don't do enough viewer reaction to important scenes (as they did in The Truman Show) to really monopolize on that satire. Only one scene attempts to capture that moment, but the gestures expressed between the character in the game and the audience are lost to those that haven't read the book. If you wish to find a better satire of reality TV game shows and socially acceptable violence, I recommend the movie Death Race 2000 with David Carradine and Sylvester Stallone.<br/><br/>The best reason to see this movie is Woody Harrelson's character of a psychologically damaged and alcoholic winner from a previous tournament. He steals the show in every scene he's in.<br/><br/>Its good, but it could have been better."
"racolvin","9","2","13","26 March 2012"," Camera Movement, too much of a good thing.
","Let this be stated from the very beginning, this is not a remake or a copy or an adaptation of Battle Royal. But instead is an adaptation of a Susanne Collins book of the same name. As for the film, regardless if you have read the book or not, everything is placed in a clear and concise manner that will play to your enjoyment and amusement throughout. Granted, seeing as this is a book adaptation, there has been some artistic leniency in which to cover some material in the book in a different way, but that should only really bother only the most die hard of fans.<br/><br/>The only aspect of this film that I feel detrimentally works against it is the cinematography, it is panicked and quick moving between different distances. Artistically, I feel I understand the effect that they were attempting to go for, seeing as this is a post apocalyptic film, they went with an established camera style to help convey this overall theme. (Look at most apocalyptic zombie films and the like, and the camera moves the exact same way.) However, the consistent camera movement has little to contrast with limiting the viewers ability to sit and absorb the scenery. This is what I personally found that this constant movement made some parts of the film visually and mentally exhausting."
"Casablanca3784","10","2","13","26 March 2012"," A Brilliant Screen Adaptation from a Knockout Novel
","What a movie! I read it, enjoyed it even though it was gruesome but the movie was as good, if not better. The screen adaptation from the novel was superb and the cinematography exceeded all expectations. I thought I was able to visualize THE CAPITOL in the book but was wrong. The film's portrayal was absolutely mind-blowing. I can think of no one more perfect to play Katniss Everdeen than Jennifer Lawrence. She was to ""Games"" what Vivian Leigh was to Scarlett O'Hara. PERFECT MATCHES. Someone else who amazed me. The character named Caesar Flickerman,the Master of Ceremonies of the televised orgy of death, Stanley Tucci. Come Oscar time in Feb.'13,he's gonna make some noise. One thing for anyone who hasn't read the book but will see the film.You already know it's all about sanctioned ""kids murdering kids"" supposedly for the entertainment of all in the 12 Districts of Panem.However where does ""Hunger"" come in? Why not call it, ""The Competitive Games"" for example. Remember Malthus's theory about population outlasting food supply? It causes mass starvation.But if 24 tributes fight to kill each other and one is left standing, isn't there more food to go around? And if those tributes are of child bearing ages (adolescents and teens) and they propagate, then their children must eat too. Hence, just one of 24 must be allowed to survive to preserve that vital food supply.I did not mean the aforementioned to be a spoiler--I do not think it is--but that title ""HUNGER games"" had to be clarified. That ends my clarification without any film details divulged. See this movie. It truly is brilliant."

","Every time that a movie based on a book comes out, people start to compare both as if they were supposed to be the same. Thats pretty much impossible cause the film is actually the director s vision of the book and obviously not everyone feels the same things reading a book or watching a movie. Now I have to admit that every bestseller turned to movie is suspicious to me ( we have things like Eragon ( uninteresting) The Golden Compass ( it ends when its starting to get interesting) or Twilight ( unbearable unless you are a hardcore fan) so I was expecting a so so movie with The hunger games. Thats why I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. It has an amazing performance from Jennifer Lawrence to start with, the custom design is awesome, the score is excellent and there are some lines in the movie that really caught me. If this was an R rated movie probably it could have been a little better but the final result is an entertaining and well worth movie"
"racheyun","10","2","13","24 March 2012"," I was drawn in!
","It was pretty good, maybe not as good as I expected. Somehow, it was better, and worse. They had good ideas, showing District 12 while the Hunger Games were still going on and showing Gale's point of view at times. They also show the Gamemakers planning attacks on the tributes. Yes, I was disappointed they didn't show fighting and death and all that, though.The camera was purposely shaken which wasn't the best. It was very intense, but it had no humor, like Peeta plays at times in the book.The actors were good and Rue's death was extremely sad but it was also beautiful, like I saw when I was reading.Overall, it was a very satisfying movie and I was drawn in."
"caleb-crocker","8","2","13","24 March 2012"," A good start to a great story.
","It's unmistakable that this movie will go down as one of the great fantasies of our time; however, there are a few things that must be pointed out. Despite Jennifer Lawrence presenting (in my opinion) the best performance of her life, Gary Ross tried too much and too little at the same time. Diverging from the violent nature of Suzanne Collins' original story put a big damper on the overall feel for the oppression of the Capital (all to keep profits up by keeping the movie PG-13). Overall though, the movie stayed true to the book as any adaptation I've seen prior. The energy output of this all star cast is amazing, despite the lack of ""action"" in some sequences. All and all, a great movie that begs the question: ""What will become of Katniss Everdeen?"""
"Christo1995","9","2","13","24 March 2012"," Absolutely Amazing, You'll Leave Wanting To Read The Books!!!!
","I had been waiting for this movie to come out for several weeks, I was unsure about the outcome of the movie and was worried they wouldn't do a good job, but was blown away the minute I was in the cinema. From start to finish it was enthralling and exciting. They stuck to the book almost 95% and had minor changes like the deaths, but it's for guidance reasons. If you have read the book, I believe you should be pleased minus the little things like what I stated above. And *SPOILER ALERT*, Rue's death, was absolutely perfect, I literally had goosebumps. Also the Reaping was brilliant. So well done to the director and crew members for making such a great movie *END OF SPOILER*<br/><br/>So altogether, this movie is definitely worth seeing. But do not go into the cinema not knowing what the story is about otherwise you will get extremely confused. Also what other reviewers are saying about the movie being cliché, do not worry, they are not the main things to focus on, the acting and storyline is brilliant you wont care about the little clichés. trust me i've seen it, read the books and loved both.<br/><br/>10/10 for a great movie of 2012."
"devastationfilms1","9","2","13","23 March 2012"," awesome awesome awesome
","I am making this a 9, and not a 10, simply because they made it PG13 and not R, to make more money. Yeah sure, they skipped out on a lot of the ""specifics"" of the child brutality, and the paragraphs of brutal murder and killing, but I'm critiquing the FILM....not the book. If you went to this Film, and critiqued it from the book,....you're stupid.<br/><br/>This movie has a ton of emotion and a lot of ""edge-of-your-chair"" moments. The directing was superb, and the Acting was absolutely top notch. Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson really matched up quite well.<br/><br/>The costume and set designers really did a fantastic job as well. The hideous attire, and furnishings, really made me feel like we were in the absolutely messed up world of the future. I think they could have touched up on how the country got to that state a little more in the beginning,....but 2.5hrs is long enough for me.<br/><br/>Anyways, the Cinematography was very good, most of it looked hand-held to me (which I love, but thats just me) So it really added a ton of suspense. Some people don't like it. I do.<br/><br/>Overall, it was a 10 star film, but it could've had a little bit better dialogue at certain parts. I definitely recommend this film to anyone thinking about seeing it."
"cadillac20","7","2","13","23 March 2012"," An Adaptation That Delivers
","There's hardly been a film I've seen in the past couple years that's been more anticipated than The Hunger Games. The beloved trilogy of novels has been in the works for the cinema for several years now and if you couldn't judge by the number of tickets in pre-sale, then just go online and search for the legions of fans eagerly awaiting this adaptation. With that said, this would have been an easy film to mess up. We've seen it with Twilight and Percy Jackson. Luckily, THG is more Harry Potter and less Twilight.<br/><br/>For the uninitiated, The Hunger Games takes place in a futuristic America renamed Panem, where The Capitol is home to the rich and powerful and lords over the 12 outer lying districts of Panem. Because of past transgressions, each of the districts is forced to give up a male and female between 12 and 18 to fight to the death in the titular Hunger Games.<br/><br/>Where THG could have gone wrong, it mostly gets things right. The pacing is relentless, the characters are well acted, Katniss is a very strong heroine, and the film doesn't shy away from places it could. But let's delve into some of these. First, for fans, have no fear, this is the movie you'd hoped for. All of the truly important elements are translated well here, from the downplaying of the romantic angles to the action being brutal and justifying the source material. As a fan of the book myself, I am happy to say I was pleased. Of course, the soul of this is Jennifer Lawrence, who does Katniss justice. At times a strong, brave leader, and at others vulnerable, this is the kind of role model that should be painted in these films. In another review, she was compared to the main character of Twilight, and it's a just comparison. Katniss is a very well balanced human, done even better as embodied by Lawrence, who channels some of her academy-nominated role from Winter's Bone here. To call her inspired as the choice for Katniss is an understatement. Watching her, you'd think this was the role she was born to play.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast fares well, though they seem to come and go in flashes. Josh Hutchinson is great as Peeta, standing his ground opposite Lawrence in a part that is almost equally as well played. The bigger stars here do their roles justice and are suitably entertaining, with Elizabeth Banks as Effie and Woody Harrelson as Haymitch both stealing some of the show in their respective parts, which both add some humor to the film. Donald Sutherland also stands out, as he usually does, as the devious President Snow. He's a suitable villain and one that is actually expanded upon from the book, which is nice.<br/><br/>The pacing is a bit of a double edged sword. The film does a good job of not lingering on anything. There's little melodrama here, and that makes for a good, fast paced, exciting film. At the same time, the film moves at such a pace, and provides us with so much info, there is rarely time to catch your breath. Even the early parts are so filled with information and detail, that you feel as though they don't quite reach the emotional peak you'd hope they would. We do get glimpses here and there, and it helps that Lawrence has such great range in here role that she gets the right emotions out. But it also feels as though characters are rushed through. Haymitch never quite comes across as the emotionally damaged character he should be, instead coming across as the necessary mentor/teacher figure. That isn't to say Harrelson plays him down, because he still does a great job. But the character just feels like it never quite goes to the places you might hope he would.<br/><br/>However, the quibbles with the film are minor. It is, again, an exciting movie that translates well. The futuristic America designed by Suzanne Collins is fantastically realized and the games themselves are every bit as exciting as you'd hope. Fans won't be disappointed, and if you're not a fan, this movie should be a good way to turn you into one."
"IloveBeaubeau","8","2","14","24 March 2012"," My first movie in 5 years!
","First of all I am a cheap skate with a 4 year old, and I haven't been to the theater in 5 years. I waited more than a year for this film after I read all 3 books in the series in one week when I first bought my Kindle Christmas of 2010. <br/><br/>True, the movie doesn't develop the characters' relationships as well as the novel does, but what can you expect for a 2 hour and 20 minute film? It would have been better if AMC had developed a year long novella for book one alone. You don't really get to see the depth of Katniss and Gale's relationship and the romantic tension that was in the book. Same goes for the angst and romantic tension that Katniss and Peeta shared for days in that cave. Oh, well. The relationship between Katniss and Rue was rather abbreviated also, but the emotion of the death scene was so powerful that I was choking on my tears and trying to keep quiet.<br/><br/>I have to admit that I have never seen a Harry Potter or Twilight film in full. I have either fallen asleep or simply changed the channel. I have never been able to get into those films ever, especially Twilight with their cheesy plots, corny romance, and terrible make-up and lighting. I did catch the last Twilight film, and fast forwarded most of that movie. <br/><br/>I liked this movie because it did highlight the main points in the book, but in order to showcase the characters and their relationships they would have had to make a 6 hour movie, which would have been impossible. My husband also read book 1, and was riveted by it and both of us are not really readers. He was disappointed in that there were no guts and glory as he's a 53 year man and ex-killing machine by way of the U.S. Army so he would have given the film a 6. However, I thought the actual killing scenes were adequate enough without all the gruesome guts and blood. The last fight scene should have been more climatic as it was in the book. <br/><br/>The overall look of the film was rather colorless and dreary. Reminded me of Twilight and the Potter films. Didn't like it. I expected District 12 to be cloudy, drab, and colorless as it was portrayed in the film, but when they got to the scenes of the Capitol, I expected more vibrant colors. There were too many purples. Should have been more greens, oranges, blues, and reds. More primary colors and more sunny days. Same for the scenes in the open fields during the games. I wanted to experience the hard sweat and heat of the day that I imagined as I was in when reading the book. I am tired of colorless films. Real life has sunny blue skies, movie directors! Last movie I saw that portrayed the beauty of sunny days and heat was the Rum Diary with Johnny Depp. Even the last Star Wars movie with Natalie Portman had more color and beauty. <br/><br/>In the book, Cinna was alive and flamboyant. Lenny Kravitz was a huge fail. When I imagined Cinna when I was reading, I always pictured someone big and cheerful like Sam Champion, the weather guy from Good Morning America. Kravitz was dull and lifeless. Johnny Depp would have been perfect in a cameo role! What were the casting directors thinking? And what happened to President Snow? He's supposed to cry bloody tears? I like Sutherland, but a more sadistic looking actor and someone whom I always envisioned to play Snow would have been Malcolm McDowell who is totally creepy in a good way. <br/><br/>The casting of Katniss and Peeta was perfect. Jennifer Lawrence is like a young Renee Zelwegger. She doesn't have to say much, but every look conveys what she is feeling. I wasn't so sure about Josh Hutcherson, and had read that Alex Pettfer was being considered for Peeta, but Josh did an excellent job and comes off more likable and amiable than Katniss as it was in the book where you end up actually rooting for him rather than the handsome and studly Gale in books 2 and 3. <br/><br/>All in all, very satisfied with Suzanne Collins' film adaption, and can't wait for the 2nd and 3rd installments. I am expecting the second film to be very political and civil war-ish as the books, which I won't be looking forward to as much. However, the 3rd installment I am excited for and hoping that they really showcase the angst and love that Katniss has for Peeta. I hope movie two really emphasizes the unrequited love that Peeta has for Katniss. Hey, after all I am still a female.<br/><br/>Anyway loved the film, but loved the books more. I was shocked and a little embarrassed that I had fallen in love with the Hunger Games Trilogy after finding out it was in the children's' section. I hadn't read any type of book since finishing grad school 13 years ago. Makes me want to read another trilogy again! I was so excited to find out shortly after reading the Collins' trilogy a movie was being made that I wanted to travel from D.C. to North Carolina to check out the scene like a teeny bopper! Can't wait for the 2nd film."

I am currently reading the 2nd book in the series and have been in love with this series for weeks. The movie is a lot more enjoyable for people who have read the book. I know this because I went to see it with a few friends, half of them had read the book, and they much preferred it to the others.<br/><br/>The others still enjoyed the movie though! The movie has missing pieces here and there, where in the book everything is explained. Also, I feel the main actress was not quite right for the role. But an amazing performance by Josh Hutcherson, he's is a very talented actor who will go far. I am a bit shocked by some of the hate this title is getting, I don't think it's deserved!

"plasticanimalz","8","2","14","24 March 2012"," I Thought it Was Great
","OK, it's not going to win any Oscars, and there were some things in it that I would have liked, but I thought they did a really good job and gave me what I was picturing it was like. First of all, Jennifer Lawerence was amazing and did a great job. Elizabeth Banks was also really great as Effie, and those two stood out the most for me. One thing that I would have liked is if the movie was a bit more graphic, and violent, like the book, which would have added more emotional impact, in certain areas. Like, I wanted her to say she was going to ""Cut up Katniss' pretty little face,"" or whatever the line, because it made me hate her, and then there was more impact when Trash killed the girl. Stuff like that. It's not that I am looking for violence or gore, actually, I'm not into that stuff, but that is what me feels so desperate to know what happens to Katniss, and hate the Capital, etc. But, someone made the point that they needed to tame it down to keep it PG-13, and since my friend took four 11-year-old boys to see it, I can understand the ratings concern. Even though they were also a little bummed it wasn't as graphic as the book.<br/><br/>I did think the way they portrayed District 12 was really good and that did set up some emotional aspect, but I did think it could have used a little more, so you would get more of a sense of what you felt in the book. Though, I did still cry when Rue died, but not quite as much as when I read the book.<br/><br/>Also, I pictured Cinna a bit more feminine and less macho. It almost made it seem like there was some sort of romantic link, which you did not get in the book. I also wanted to see her other groomers. I thought it would have added something to show how ridiculous the Capitol was, but also give some sympathy to show how oblivious they are in the Capitol. Some guy saying they need to hose her down twice, in the movie, didn't really work for me. Just did not have the same impact."
"Cindi_parks","9","2","14","23 March 2012"," Not what I expected but still pretty good
","The cinematography took some getting used to especially in the beginning shots of district 12. It was shaky and the lack if a soundtrack felt odd for such a big budget movie, but I wonder- was that the point? I am not sure if this is true or if I just got used to the camera work but it seemed like the shots in district 12 were more gritty, reminiscent of indie films and then once they get to the glitz of the capital it seemed like the cinematography changed to match the beauty of the Hollywood films we are more used to. I may have imagined it, but it seemed to add to the reality versus the fake beauty of the capital. Beyond that the movie stuck extremely close to the book which makes me wonder if those who claim that they didn't have even read the books since they came out."

"destroyah25","9","2","14","23 March 2012"," let the games begin
","First I would like to say that I have not read any of the books but would like to. I would first like to say that I believe the plot is very well done in the movie, and some of the greatest parts are actually leading up to the games, and not during the battle itself. That being said the battle scenes, and many other scenes during the battle is excellent and very attention holding. The acting in this movie is also superb lead by Jennifer Lawrence, whom I believe is a very strong up and coming actress, and has been very impressive in not only this, but in x-men first class as well. All the cast though compliment each other extremely well and do a great job keeping the viewers interest and making a good emotional tie. My personal favorite aspect of the movie however though is the soundtrack. The music really stands out in many scenes, and really gives a push in some of the larger scenes. It is probably in the top 5 movie soundtracks I have ever heard. The only problem I have with this movie is the camera angles. Through most of the movie it isn't a problem up until the games start. When that happens they do a lot of fast moving and scrolling that is hard to follow. In some scenes I enjoyed it as a simulation of adrenaline rush or stunning. In some bigger scenes though its hard to follow the action though based on some of the characters looking similar in the fights. Overall though it is a movie I will be seeing again, and cant wait to see how the sequels turn out. So let the games begin and may the odds always be in your favor 9/10."
"okieiceman","9","2","14","23 March 2012"," Well done and worth the price of a ticket..
","I will keep this Short. Well cast. story line is followed very close to the book. Some characters not included though that would have made it better over all which is one reason I kept my rating as a 9. It is hard to but a book into a 2 hour movie and not lose parts of the story line that prove to be important especially if there is to be a sequel or two which I am sure there is being as how this is the 1st book of a trilogy. The relationship between Katniss and Peta and Gail was not fleshed out enough which is a mistake because it is so central to the book series. This is perhaps my biggest disappointment. I think the theme however is too adult for the 14 and under crowd although the violence is kept very mild by most standards. It is played out but not overly graphic. The language is mild and there is no great sexual overtones which is refreshing. My summary is go and see it. It is well worth the cost of a ticket."
"lonelyboy2216","8","2","14","23 March 2012"," put down your book and accept it for what it is!
","After watching this movie, i was surprised to hear so many complaints about the movie.so many were disappointed. I was NOT one of those upset people. I really enjoyed the movie. i was actually surprised of how much i enjoyed the movie.<br/><br/>If you haven't read the books or don't know what this movie is about, here is a basic summary: In a futuristic society, each district must send one male and one female between the ages of 12 and 17 to compete in annual televised game show, called the hunger games, to compete to death until there is one teenager standing. <br/><br/>In my opinion, the movie was everything i expected and more. i read the books two years ago and anxiously waited for the movie to come out and i was not disappointed. The acting was incredible, the story-line was well thought out, the costumes were amazing (and even Oscar-worthy), and the setting was a sight that was breath-taking.And Rue's scene was so powerful. That was the scene i was most looking forward to. The only big criticism i is the camera-work. it was little shaky at times and didn't make the picture clear. Although, i understand it was like that for the purpose of the blood and gore. in order for the PG-13 rating, he had to find some way of making it so there was still a lot of violence and blood but maintained that PG-13 rating. so i could live with that.<br/><br/>In conclusion, i will say it was different. Some people are going to really criticize it and others will think it was brilliant. in my case, i thought it was brilliant. I will be seeing it again in theaters, which is something i rarely do, and maybe own it on DVD. When you go see the movie, don't point out every little thing that was different from the book to the movie. they got the key points and thats what matters."
"mvrkfncb4","8","2","14","23 March 2012"," A Thrilling, Dazzling, and Faithful Novel Adaptation
","Suzanne Collins's THE HUNGER GAMES is a very content-heavy novel, so naturally bringing it to the big screen would be a feat worth sweating over. While certain scenes were rushed and aspects from the book weren't developed as much as I would have liked, I was still completely captivated and loved the movie. <br/><br/>In terms of performances, everyone (and I mean everyone) knocks it out of the park. I will list the main roles, to save us all the reading time: Jennifer Lawrence carries her role as protagonist Katniss with grace, vulnerability, and fire (pun intended); Josh Hutcherson (someone who hadn't even crossed my mind to play Peeta, and, when cast, made me apprehensive) truly did Peeta justice, with spot-on facial expressions and a quiet ferocity; Liam Hemsworth played Gale wonderfully in the small number of scenes he had; Elizabeth Banks made Effie annoyingly likable (you want to hate her, for she is essentially an archetypal Capitol citizen, to say the least), plus everything I'd expected and more; Lenny Kravitz was fantastic as Cinna (the moment before launch into the arena is truly touching); and Donald Sutherland is wicked yet subtle as President Snow. I have to commend Woody Harrelson as Haymitch, too; his performance was honestly exactly how I'd imagined Haymitch, and one of my favorites. <br/><br/>As for the direction, I applaud Gary Ross; he truly knew what he was doing. The designs and atmospheres of each scene were impeccable, and further enhanced Collins's world. Granted, the pace felt a tad rushed at times, but it wasn't anything major enough to truly take away from anything. One of my major directorial complaints (though I understand it to an extent), was the camera work, especially near the beginning. It was almost nauseating. I do understand, however, that it was meant to mimic the intimacy between us audience members and Katniss, for the novel was written from her point of view. It does go on to (for the most part) level out, though certain scenes later in the film (during the Games, namely) practically require this sort of shooting style. <br/><br/>The violence was one of the major aspects of the book I was wondering how Gary would handle. For the most part, it is implied and shown only in bursts when necessary, though there are still disturbing scenes and moments, some, ironically, including no violence but truly highlighting just how violent this country actually is. Don't get me wrong, though--there is still an abundance of thrills and action. <br/><br/>All in all, THE HUNGER GAMES is a solid, thrilling, and dazzling film, one fans of the novel will likely enjoy and a truly telling spectacle concerning how far we're willing to go to be entertained."
"violetruth","8","2","14","22 March 2012"," a near perfect adaptation
","i've seen it twice now. overall it was a very good adaptation as far as story structure goes. they changed a few things but unlike some popular movie adaptations where you question the change, for HG it makes a lot of sense. it tightened the story at the right places. sure you'll miss the characters/ scenes that didn't make it in but it wasn't something that crippled the significance of the story.<br/><br/>also the additional (non-book) scenes are very good, i highly appreciated them, the way they fleshed out Seneca Crane's role, and started to feature President Snow more as the true dangerous menace that he is. plus the inception of the uprising at district 11 which will foreshadow events of Catching Fire and Mockingjay is very well done, in fact it didn't stick out as odd, its more like its expected that it be happening then instead of something new when Katniss hears about it in CF.<br/><br/>acting wise everybody is a 10-- nay 11-- across the board. even the smallest bit parts wasn't something done half-heatedly. physically they may not have been an exact match with the book description but they lived and breathed their personas to a T. it didn't matter if Katniss wasn't small and scrawny or that Haymitch didn't have a curly brown mess on his head, the fact is that they embody that all elusive aura of the characters, convincing us that for the next 2 and half hours, our beloved book characters are alive in all their glory up on the big screen.<br/><br/>if there's one thing i really appreciate about how this movie was adapted it was that Gary Ross managed to have us see and hear through Katniss's POV several times during the film, whilst not sacrificing the valuable 3rd person perspective that adds dimension far beyond Katniss's perspective.<br/><br/>of course like any adaptation its not without any gripes, although surprisingly they were something more trivial compared to problems from other adaptations. i will say i was a bit disappointed with the Capitol's appearance as a whole. there's something about it thats sorely lacking in its visualization compared to how it was in the books. perhaps it was the lack of the glorifying, flashy, stylized excess that was one of the most obvious quality of book!Capitol. the strange thing about the film version, is that all the elements are there-- the grandeur of a futuristic city, the near-grotesque beauty of the Capitol residents, the incredibly progressive technology, but for some reason they failed to gel together for film!Capitol. to me, it didn't look like it was much different from the squalor of District 12, they just hid it behind fake facades, garish clothes and heavy make-up. <br/><br/>perhaps it was Gary Ross' way of purposely not glorifying something that has misled so many people in real life (because he did go through the effort of showing a ""behinds the scenes"" setting versus what Panem residents see on screen) but judging this on the merits of visual storytelling, that sparkly grandeur was important for the Capitol because it emphasizes the incredible gap between its life versus life at District 12.<br/><br/>btw, the rating for this film is PG13? eh, could've survived on a PG rating. they've downplayed a lot of the blood and gore from the story-- and the HG book isn't even that intense in terms of violence-in-books scale. for those looking forward to Cato's end the film version was a bit of a let down. he barely got mangled i think.<br/><br/>oh and some scenes with a hand-held camera was too much. too shaky Gary! yes it should feel like it a war zone but good heavens i didn't need to feel sea-sick for some of them.<br/><br/>parting sentiments: JHutch is Peeta --this is epic and scary in the McKellen-is-Gandalf proportions. that is one UGLY Cornucopia. poor pit bull terriers, they will get even less love after this. watch out for Catching Fire foreshadowing on Peeta (one of the shockers i totally welcomed haha!)"

One can get a headache from all the moving around. I did love the Katniss en Rue scenes! It was beautifully made by everyone. And all the costumes! So much color going around.

"srg9523","9","2","15","24 March 2012"," Leave your worries about this film at home...and get ready for a thrill ride.
","When I first read this book, I became a fan before I was even finished, being way too obsessed, looking for people to talk to about it, telling other fans that I wasn't sure what my favorite part of the book was, since the book has so many terrific things in it. I didn't expect this film to have the same effect on me. I thought it would be a 'good film', and did not think it would have nearly the same throat-grabbing effect the book did.<br/><br/>Now comes the part where you're thinking, ""Well, did it have that effect on you?"" Yessir. Yes'm.<br/><br/>In some ways (read carefully now, this will blow your mind), Mr. Gary Ross (Congratulations by the way Mr. Ross), has made a movie that is like the book...only more so.<br/><br/>Let me try and address the main things people will be concerned about, without spoiling too much.<br/><br/>The Story/Plot: This 140 minute film felt more like an 80 minute film, not letting me look at my watch even once, expect during the credits to say, ""Wow, it's really 2:30?"" Ross keeps this ball rolling. Many were frustrated at certain details left out from the book, or perhaps a lack thereof on focusing on said details. People, this is not that kind of story. Ross and the others figured that out at some point while sitting down and planning, and said to each other, ""Guys, this is the Hunger Games. If we spend too much time pausing to share pages worth of background and details that were mostly told by Katniss, it's going to put the brakes on this movie so many times, and people looking for an intense, heart-pounding film to truly do the attitude and intensity of the book justice will be sorely disappointed. Let's focus on the chain of events, letting the blanks fill themselves at the right times."" If Peter Jackson had squeezed in every detail from the ""Lord of the Rings"" books into the films, there would have been five movies, each about four hours long. Let this movie breathe and grow and assault you (in a good way) like it did me.<br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss Everdeen: Some say Lawrence was too old to play Katniss, or couldn't do it because she was blonde (Really, guys?). Others such as myself, may have found Jennifer a slight tad, well, shapely to be playing the part of a skinny starving sixteen-year old bent on survival and feeding her family. Within the first five (ten?) minutes of the film, watching Katniss tip-toe through the forest and using hunting techniques that made her an obvious pro at hunting game, I was pretty convinced. About ten minutes later she (SPOILER) at the Reaping, which had me further convinced. And then we see her with Peeta (Good Job Josh Hutcherson), Haymitch, and Cinna, and I am even more convinced at this point. Jennifer Lawrence is Katniss Everdeen. I wonder if her technique as an actress will continue to grow and develop, pushing the standards forward in Hollywood for the first time in fifty years. I honestly think the biggest complaint I can make is that I expected her braid to be longer. But her using that mean bow of hers a few times will make you lose focus on her hair (Seriously though, a blonde can't play Katniss?).<br/><br/>The Games: Oh yes. The games. Are they really over already? Why hasn't 'Catching Fire' been made yet? The games are spectacular, bringing to you 'behind the scenes' material that you couldn't get from the book (This is partially what I meant when I said the movie was like the book, only more so), temporarily leaving Katniss or the whole Arena for brief moments to enforce the atmosphere of this story. Seeing Haymitch's dedication to keeping his tributes alive for instance, in a way you couldn't see from the mind of Katniss. From the Cornucopia to the Final Hovercraft, you are THERE. The first scene at the Cornucopia is fantastic, by the way.<br/><br/>I'm already getting tired of TALKING about the film, and I'm already wanting to go and see it a second time (and even a third). Sort of like wanting to read the book again.<br/><br/>But this is just one man's opinion. Go see it! <br/><br/><ul><li>R.</li></ul>"
"FilmFanatic03","9","2","15","24 March 2012"," An Imposing Film
","I will firstly say I have not read the book, but what appealed to me was the content of the film. This has exceeded my expectations of how effective and impactful the film is. This film is so engaging, you constantly try and put yourselves in the characters position and try to imagine how they would be feeling and how you would deal with the situation. The pre-game part of the film has a steady pace, nothing riveting but a good enough pace to set up the main characters etc. But as soon as they enter into the arena....It goes up a whole new level. It is so tense, whilst I assume watching it a second time it may not be as tense, you can never stop thinking, ""what would I be like in that situation?"" Jennifer Lawrence was brilliant in this film, I knew that this film would be good because she can act. Josh Hutherson wasn't bad, he fitted well into the film. The camera style was very modern, fast paced and had a lot of quick editing. I can't give too much away but I can say it will keep you at the edge of your seat! The murders were very quick, but still effective. It was quite shocking but yet again, you keep thinking to yourself, ""would I kill people?"" or ""how would I feel knowing I can be killed any minute?"" It is a really engaging film with the right amount of pace and action at the right time. They made it feel real, not manufactured emotions or clichéd moments, but it was very gripping and enjoyable. Don't be sceptical just because of all the hype, it actually has a reason and has the right to receive all the hype: Because it's awesome."
"ritas223","9","2","15","24 March 2012"," Disgruntled Viewers...Dig Deeper!
","I saw the film last night and was pretty content with the adaptation. <br/><br/>Then I got home and began reading the reviews...<br/><br/>I'm shocked at how closed-minded people are to the necessary changes in the film. Since the book is written from a first-person point of view, the movie would obviously not be able to convey all of Katniss' thought. (i.e. how her relationship with Rue paralleled her and Prim's, and how betrayed she felt when she discovered Peeta with the Careers)<br/><br/>Unlike most other series, the makers of Hunger Games had a huge advantage: all three books were published before they began shooting, and they were able to begin developing these plot lines in the first film, instead of waiting around. I found this to be a great addition to the plot. <br/><br/>There were many comments about the lack of explanation or focus on certain aspects, and it seems that people who have read the books were worried than those who didn't read the book would have a hard time understanding. This isn't the case at all. The movie uses a lot of symbolism instead of dumbed-down verbal explanations, so as long as the viewers are devoted to watching the film, they should grasp even the smallest hints the director included. <br/><br/>The acting was beyond my expectations. Jennifer Lawrence gave an incredible performance that was very true to the character. The casting for this movie was well-done! The actors stay very true to the characters. <br/><br/>My recommendation to all of those who, like me, read the books: be open minded! Don't expect the book to be a script, and pay attention to the symbolism used in the film, as it offers a lot of insight to the story."
"nicholascremin","9","2","15","23 March 2012"," Best book adaptation I have seen!
","When I the movie started, I was a bit worried. A few main things were left out right away. Yet as the movie went on, things started to make sense. The things left out were minor details when it came to the series as a whole, and if those things were added the movie would of not have as good of flow. <br/><br/>One of the best things about the movie had to be the cinematography. It was extremely raw and not touched up during certain scenes, while in others it was extremely touched up and all blemishes were removed. This was one of the many ways they were able to show contrast between the settings. <br/><br/>The action scenes were very fast paced and at times it was hard to tell what exactly was going on, but this was expected so the movie wouldn't be rated R. <br/><br/>The actors did an amazing job at their roles and acted just like their book counterparts. The set and costume design made the movie appear mostly how I imagined it when I read it. I would not recommend taking young children, due to the amount of violence and because they will not understand the deeper meaning of the work."
"Maylett19","8","2","15","23 March 2012"," The Hunger Games
","I saw this movie at a pre-screening and was pretty impressed. The movie follows the general events of the book very well. Obviously, things have to be cut in order to make the movie. The details of the events were not quite on though. I don't think anything major was changed but it did bother me that some small things didn't match up. Why can't they make the events perfect with the book? They had the author working on writing the screen play! I had just read the book the week before so it was fresh on my mind. As long as you don't look for all of the differences, you should be just fine.<br/><br/>One thing that I didn't like was the way they shot the movie. At times, I felt like the movie was shot from someone's iPhone because it was so shaky. I had a hard time following some scenes as the camera was just bouncing all over the place. Surely they could have done better there. Peeta was a bit of a surprise to me as well. I expected Peeta to be a bigger, stronger guy than was actually portrayed. He is supposed to be ""strong"" but when comparing him to some of the other guys, he just didn't cut it.<br/><br/>I would suggest that you read the book before seeing the movie. There are some things that weren't covered by the movie that I feel you would need to know in order for things to make sense. Especially the turmoil that goes on in Katniss's own mind through out the games. For example, the strategy that Katniss and Peeta use. They decide upon playing up the romance aspect in order to get sponsors. They don't explain that in the movie. So it is hard to understand the quick transition from nothing to madly in love. Also, the reasons that Katniss teams up with Rue and why she feels the need to.<br/><br/>Like I said, the movie was well done and as long as you don't compare it to the book too much, you will really enjoy seeing it."
"maggiesilva2000","7","2","15","22 March 2012"," The Hungry hunger games
","******CONTAINS SPOILERS******************<br/><br/>The Hunger games is a movie i've been waiting for with very much excitement and now that I have indeed seen it, it almost seems like there's not much left to do.<br/><br/>It didn't let me down, I think it is a faithful adaptation, is has rising tension, it has dramatic moments and it shows the story well, not leaving holes for things that weren't explained, waiting for people to read it from the book like so many adaptations did in the past.<br/><br/>It shows very well the sacrifice and the suffering from those involved in the game and all the scenes added, regarding president snow and head game-maker, as well as all the scenes in the room where the game is made are very smart and well played. i've read some critics saying that is cuts off the action, taking you away from the games, but I think that it is a nice addition, because being faithful and having a life of its own is a rare thing that comes in this movie. Making three apart from each other worlds was actually a winning situation as well, doing the district 12, the capitol and the games, was a hard task, done very gracefully in my opinion. But it ha flops as well, it's not free of bad aspects, but they are not to destroy the movie experience as a whole. First, I have to say that the camera is really to shaky. It has been mentioned and it is true, sometimes you barely can understand what's going on, you just know someone is getting killed as the canon makes its terribly frightening sound. One other thing, the killings are emotionally hard, rue's scene in particular, but I do think that an R rating would help the movie, giving as even more dramatic look to the games, because the careers looked to much like the gang from ""mean girls"",not really people killing each other. Before they were reduced, they were all too happy and hysterical for what was going on, maybe they should be a little more restrained. The part where katniss gets a bad burn is very simplified.....she almost dies without water in the books, it's much more suffered. Overall, the dramatic part could be even bigger and grander with a R rating. And for the last thing, being outside of Katniss head is a plus for most of the movie, as I said before, even as well as Katniss and Peeta have been cast ( great performances really) this part of the story suffers from leaving her mind.<br/><br/>It's hard to understand her motivations, it's hard to know if she likes Peeta or not. Katniss turns out to look a lot softer than in the book, being all fuzzy about Peeta and looking too honest, never mistrusting him like it happens in the book. It's hard to follow this, and some critics have said that they didn't understand how she went from hitting him to kissing him so much, so I believe this part needed a little more explanation.<br/><br/>Also Peeta turns out to be a little too cheesy about Katniss, not that he is not in the book, he is, but it looks like all his character is in the movie is a crazy lover stalker, and the pacifist,ironic,sensitive Peeta gets a little cut out, because this movie is all about Katniss- centralism, even the part where the score before the games begins is different and makes Katniss stand out in the points more than Peeta and his pacifist drawings get cut out. But apart from that ""the hunger games"" is a great experience, well- paced, thrilling, touching - it has all that counts to become a great hit, no matter what Hipters non-sense negative propaganda is going on about it, comparing it to Twilight ( yeah, because the love triangle occupies five minutes of the moviemakes sense) or saying it is a rip off from Battle Royale ( a bloody Japanese movie about a secret operation, so secret as a television reality show),go see it with an open mind and take your conclusions ! AND MAY THE ODDS BE EVER IN YOUR FAVOR. <br/><br/>8/10"

The hunger games, two and a half hour film that alternately touching, exciting, and visually overwhelming is. The scenes where Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) comes from is a poor neighborhood in the woods. But where Katniss gets as she arrives is a colorful and original surrounding filled with beautiful scenery and costumes.<br/><br/>Dictatorial style architecture and 18th century forms makes the image of the capital: Capital.<br/><br/>Even actors like Stanley Tucci and Toby Jones play their supporting roles with contagious joy.<br/><br/>Director Ross takes the viewer seriously: not a moment is the public inundated with information, because he was confident that we can think for ourselves. This is beautifully done! The film shows merciless the cruelty behind reality shows. The film shows a connection between inequality and riots, and that the theme of the movie very actual is in the world. <br/><br/>This movie is going to be one of THE movies released in 2012."

"mariablanco-56359","9","1","5","16 June 2015"," The Hunger Games vs. Divergent
","Thinking about the Hunger Games unavoidably makes me remember the film Divergent. Both films are two must-sees among teenagers. Added to this, the Hunger Games and Divergent are based on a best-selling book and were two blockbusters when they were released on the big screen. These movies full of exhilarating scenes share things in common but also differ in some aspects.<br/><br/>Similarly, in both films citizens are split up into groups depending on their ""qualities"". Added to this, both blockbusters belong to the ""futuristic revolution"" category because in the Hunger Games Katniss, who is the main actress, starts a revolution against the people who control the districts; and in Divergent the protagonist is born with some qualities that are forbidden by the government so she hides them, which is a sign of corruption. Although the two films have a love story, these stories are different, just because in the Hunger Games Katniss is not really in love with Peeta but she pretend to love him to survive, and in Divergent Tris and Four are truly in love. On the one hand, the Hunger Games does not stick to the book because some important parts are left out and some parts have not been correctly interpreted by the director; but on the other hand, Divergent is really faithful to the book so its writer -Veronica Roth- is happy about her book being released on the big screen. Even though these films might seem clichéd they are action-packed but also include many moving scenes so, overall, they are a good choice for an afternoon's viewing, being my favourite: Divergent, as I prefer a true love story played by a star-studded cast. To sum up, if you have enjoyed the Hunger Games series, I strongly recommend you to watch Divergent."
"sophie-252-668587","9","1","5","1 March 2015"," The Hunger Games- Review
","The Hunger Games- A movie worth watching or a waste of time? <br/><br/>Oh my god WHY do we have to watch that? It is just soo overrated and not even exciting at all"". That was exactly what my friend said when we watched The Hunger Games"" in class. Well, opinions might differ in this point but there is no doubt about how successful the movie was. More than 600 million dollars were gained by people watching the movie in the cinema and Katniss Everdeen, who is the female main character, is said to be one of the most successful heroines in American cinema history. <br/><br/>The Hunger Games"" is a dystopia playing in the future. The world is divided into 12 districts (that used to be 13) and the Capitol, that can be seen as something like a capital. While the people living in the Capitol and the first districts live an easy life having everything they want, the people from other districts live in extreme poverty. In Panem (this is how the districts and the capitol are called) a TV show called The Hunger Games"" takes place annually. For this show two teenagers from each district are chosen by chance to fight against each other in an arena in order to survive- only one can win and receive fame and honor. When 16-year old Katniss' sister Primrose is selected, she decides to volunteer to prevent her from having to take part. Personally I have to say the film surprised me in a positive way. I have never really been a big fan of fantasy movies, but this one really fascinated me. Besides, the blockbuster does also also have aspects of typical romantic movies or dramas. Even though it has a lenght of round about 140 minutes it does not get boring at all. For some people the movie might be too brutal and some scenes might even be inappropriate for younger people watching it, what I can totally retrace. I would have recommended to make an R-rated version and a normal one so it is your decision whether you want to see those scenes (like where people are killed and you see lots of blood) or not. Furthermore, the actors are well chosen and able to play their roles convincingly. Even though The Hunger Games"" is a dystopia, I could really put myself into the actors' position because of the realistic portrayal.<br/><br/>To summarize, the film really convinced me and I would definitely recommend you to watch it."

","""Winning will make you famous. Losing means certain death"". ""The Hunger Games"" is a dystopian science fiction film published in 2012 which is based on the same-titled novel by Suzanne Collins. The movie's director is Gary Ross and the cast includes in the major roles Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss Everdeen, a 16-year-old female tribute from District 12, and Josh Hutcherson, who plays Peeta Mellark, a baker's son from the same district. The story takes place in a dystopian future in the nation of Panem in North America. There is only one rule: Kill or be killed.<br/><br/>Set in a futuristic North America known as ""Panem"", the Capitol selects a boy and a girl between the ages of 12 and 18 from each of the twelve outlying districts to compete in the annual ""Hunger Games"", a televised fight-to-the-death. When Katniss's 12-year-old sister, Primrose Everdeen, is selected as District 12's female representative, Katniss volunteers to take her place in the Game. She and her male counterpart, Peeta, are then rushed to the Capitol, where they undergo intense training before being thrust into the arena to fight to become the winner of the seventy-fourth annual Hunger Games.<br/><br/>Thrilling and superbly acted, especially Jennifer Lawrence plays her role as Katniss Everdeen very convincingly. The Hunger Games captures really everything: from dramatic violence, over raw emotion, to high tension. Even if the movie runs about 2 1/2 hour in length, there is no second of boredom, it is constantly exciting and heart-breaking. Thanks to the special effects, the action is totally believable.<br/><br/>The film is well worth seeing. It will touch your heart and make you cheer for ordinary people like Katniss! It will catch your attention throughout the movie. Don't miss it!"
"beresfordjd","7","1","5","4 January 2015"," Good but...
","I have to say I came late to this film and overall it was enjoyable. Jennifer Lawrence deserved the plaudits heaped on her and I was surprised to see Josh Hutchinson come out of it so well. I was not keen on the art direction as far as make up was concerned - the weird-shaped beard was impossible for anyone to maintain and the ""futuristic"" hairstyles just looked ridiculous. I liked the premise but for Jennifer's character to manage to survive without hardly killing anyone was a cop-out. Yes she caused a death and retaliated and killed someone but I think if she had gone after some of the other tributes then it would have been more realistic. It will be interesting to see how they make the sequel and what the jumping-off point may be. My main complaint about this film is the amount of hand-held camera-work. As someone else pointed out it is nauseating seen on the big screen - believe me it is the same on a home TV. A very unnecessary technique too much employed in a lot of modern films. It adds nothing."
"tduncan64","9","1","5","16 December 2014"," This may contain spoilers
","First off let me say that this movie review is meant for the people that have read the books and watched the movie after reading the books or vise versa. The Hunger Games is a televised death match that came about when thirteen districts rebelled against the Capitol. The absolute best way to describe a district to you would have to be saying that a district in this time frame is like what a state would be to the United States of America in our time frame. The Hunger Games came about when the districts lost and District 13 was destroyed. The punishment from the Capitol was to destroy District 13 and also every year host a televised death match. This death match consisted of pulling out 2 random names of children from the ages of twelve to eighteen. There would be two drawn out from each district. One of the tributes would be a boy and one would be a girl. There would be twenty-four total tributes drawn and they are immediately taken in the hands of the Capitol guards.<br/><br/>In the 74th Hunger Games, Primrose Everdeen was drawn as tribute in District 12. Her sister, Katniss Everdeen, the protagonist of the movie, volunteered as tribute for her. She is immediately taken into the hands of the Capitol moments after the boy, Peeta Mallark, was drawn as tribute. They are given a couple of minutes to say goodbye to their family and friends and then they are taken to the Capitol to prep for the Hunger Games.<br/><br/>Let me get it off my chest that not one movie ever will ever do its book justice. This is because there is so much detail that goes into a book to make it make you see the scenes and play them out in your mind and movies show that for you. You don't have to think of the scenes they are right in front of you so your attention to detail will not be that great when watching the movie. Saying that I will say that this movie did do the book justice in the detail parts of let's say the cornucopia. This was one thing in my head that I could not wrap my mind around what it could look like and the movie showed that very well. If you don't know what the cornucopia is then it is the beginning of the hunger games where all of the supplies are stacked up and all twenty-four tributes are put into a circle around this pile of supplies. Every tribute is an equal distance away from the cornucopia.<br/><br/>My absolute favorite part of the movie that matched up with the book had to have been when one tribute died. This very tribute had grown extremely close to Katniss and the death of this person threw Katniss through an emotional loop. Saying that she held somewhat of a funeral there in the arena and gave a sign to the district of the fallen tribute holding up three fingers. This later caused a fight to breakout in that district because everyone got on board to rebel against the capitol in that district. That being said, that sign from Katniss could have been the turning point in the whole series on the topic of rebelling because that is what caused it.<br/><br/>One thing that I did not like with the movie that I know they could have done better and a lot of other reviews agree with my views is that it did not seem like the two tributes from district twelve were ""starving"" or fighting hunger like it said they were in the book. They both looked healthy as horses in the movie and that is just one of many small things that do not match up with the book.<br/><br/>All and all I really do not have any bad things to say about the movie. This is because like I said before it is really hard to make a movie play out exactly how the book wants it to because there is so much detail that goes into a book. This is an overall great watch and if you do watch it, I strongly recommend reading all of the books that way when all of the movies come out you can compare them like I am doing so right now. Overall I give this movie a nine out of ten stars."
"adamscastlevania2","7","1","5","27 August 2014"," The broken, slightly troubling premise aside this is still a worthy watch
","(61%) Just like ""Battle royale"" (which got there first), this fails to make its perplexing plot make a whole heap of sense, as the question ""Why are they getting little girls fight to the death again?"" never really became apparent. That aside I do get the appeal of its source, so when it's aided by rising star Jennifer Lawrence's fine acting ability, with good solid support, a fair amount of action, and decent character development resulting in a very watchable sit. The direction though is far too wobbly and slack at times, and it's a fraction too long, but the mild violence did upset the daily mail which is never a bad thing. For a movie based on a book aimed at teens this is somewhat better than I had assumed."

The concept of Hunger Games is particularly disturbing. The games themselves are presented as almost a logical leap forward for today's reality shows. You'll also see some nice CGI and some well done action sequences.<br/><br/>I haven't read to book The Hunger Games are based on, but this hasn't bothered me. However, after watching it and realizing that i'll have to endure several more movies before the ending did bother me. Besides, i haven't seen any higher message the media have been droning about."
"chirpyfeminist","7","1","5","27 March 2014"," Clumsy story-telling but JLaw saved the day
","I didn't read the books, so am not drowned in disappointment.<br/><br/>But yes, many reviewers are right, flawed script, flawed directing.<br/><br/>Agreed - stupid shaky cam belongs to 90s art films, and should stay there.<br/><br/>I do respect Collin revising the story to fit the movie format. It's a technical necessity.<br/><br/>JLaw is strong and natural. Katniss portrayal is vivid. JLaw deserves all the fame and glory.<br/><br/>Explaining a general confusion/ complaint:<br/><br/>Why the kids gang up during the race - grouping-up is a 'natural' social behavior in Darwinian games. In (stupid) reality shows like Survivor, participants tend to pair up with the strongest possible to eliminate the weakest first, before final battles between the strongest. In THG, Rue is the hunted weakling. Katniss is also classified as a weakling because she is not a preemptive killer.<br/><br/>Sociopaths or everyday narcissists need to win and to dominate at any cost. They tend to view kindness and compassion for fellow human beings as weakness. They have contempt for - and will eliminate such 'psychological weaklings' just for the ""gene pool weeding"" reason alone. <br/><br/>The THG world has a mad, fascist-like ""Capital"". So within the story context, contestants ganging behavior made perfect sense.<br/><br/>Is the world we live in as ""evil"" as that? Do incumbents gang up and scapegoat minority individuals, do wall street rich gang up to become richer, do powerful countries gang up on weak isolated countries?<br/><br/>Some find the THG citizens' treatment of children gladiators as entertainment just too inhuman and unbelievable. <br/><br/>Not long ago, ""fringe districts"" children and unarmed civilian women of our world were mass-sacrificed in the name of peace. The crimes against humanity still not acknowledged, justice still not done, after 70 years. Isn't that unbelievable?<br/><br/>Are we still pinning all the blame and evils on a few scapegoat figures, so that we don't have to face the rot within?<br/><br/>So the ""Capital"" citizens, the most powerful people on earth, their indifference and ignorance on the rest of the ""districts"", their choosing to not care about a few ""fringe scapegoats"", is very, very contemporary, and totally believable.<br/><br/>For that timely theme alone, THG merited a 7."

","First things first, people who did not read the books will not know what the heck a tesserae is. Even if it's not important, at least kind of give the audience an idea and don't just leave them confused. Same goes for the ending, which I will explain later. The Hunger Games is an okay movie, nothing spectacular. The ending doesn't show the controversy Katniss's rebellion caused (Seneca's imprisonment and supposed death doesn't do any justice, either) and the film itself is lacking a lot of elements, including the inner turmoil Katniss has and most of all, how hungry they really are. It's a good action flick, but I wish it had more gore and satires in it as in the book. 7/10 for not explanations that should have been done better and failing to impress me."

","The Hunger Games is one of my favorite books. It has a really great plot and hats off to Suzanne Collin's for creating such a genuine but yet interesting novel! When I Went to watch the film I had really great expectations. And I enjoyed the movie through out but it could have been so much better.<br/><br/>Screenplay- The 1st half of the screenplay was pretty good. But I felt that the second half lacked in emotion. The Katniss/Peeta scene in the caves were completely butchered down and the interviews after the games were really very short. The only scene that I loved in the second half of the film was the scene in which Rue dies! <br/><br/>Acting- The acting was top-notch! Jennifer Lawrence was brilliant as Katniss. Her emotions, eye movement and everything else was perfect. Woody Harrelson, Elizabeth Banks were also great in their roles. Liam Hamesworth's performance was too short to be judged. Josh Hutcherson.... His character was not well written and so its not his fault that we did not get the Peeta we deserved.<br/><br/>Action- The action scenes were pretty good but I still think they could have shown a lot more for a PG-13 movie.<br/><br/>Direction- Gary Ross' direction was amazing. Sad He's not doing the second one.<br/><br/>Overall the film was a good adaptation of the book but it could have been a lot better. Looking forward to the next one."

","I was hesitant to watch this movie because the premise - children being forced to compete to the death - seemed so unpleasant. It is unpleasant, and grim, but it's also fast moving and kept me interested throughout.<br/><br/>Ultimately, though, I feel this movie didn't quite commit to anything. It's an action movie with some pretty good action scenes, but the dour concept keeps it from being a fun popcorn-style action movie. At the same time, the movie didn't really embrace the moral darkness of the tale; the lead character is put in a situation where there would seem to be no possibility of not doing monstrous things, but then she manages to go through the whole movie being flawlessly pure and noble, with any problematic moral choices neatly swept out of her way.<br/><br/>It's a good movie, and I enjoyed it, for the most part, but honestly I feel I would have been better served to have followed my instincts and skipped it."
"elshikh4","5","1","5","3 January 2013"," Nothing special, except the success !
","This was a disappointment. After the huge financial success it had, with a worldwide total of $686,533,290, I thought it would have been huge itself, but it wasn't, on any level!<br/><br/>The thing is, while the story has potential, a lot of it, the execution takes a little bit of many things, blends it with nearly unremarkable everything, and makes something that I saw before in way better shapes!<br/><br/>We have an aphorism in Egypt that says: ""It took a song from every film"" which precisely describes what that script did. It just chose many good subjects (apocalyptic world, reality TV, class divide,..), however dealt with them as items, not eventually fulfilling anything as high, clear or plenary. So it took a song from every film, to make incomplete musical I guess!<br/><br/>(Donald Sutherland) shows up to blabber, with nothing to be figured out. I couldn't understand the relationship between the 2 leads (Katniss) and (Peeta); was his love true, or merely a trick to draw some sponsors' compassion? Did she love him? And on the top of all; what was the conclusion of that story? She's intelligibly in love with another one, so does (Peeta) know that? And how does her original love understand the matter, not feeling jealousy? It seemed like something ""to be continued later in a sequel""! Btw, I longed for a plot twist concerning (Peeta)'s character, but no such luck. The matter of ""let's die together"" at the climax?? So the heroine, after facing death countless times, prefers embarrassing the show over 1) Winning the contest, 2) Returning to her lover, mom, and sister, 3) Life itself??! That point lost the creditability, otherwise it wasn't basically built well. For one last confusion; why the black kid loved the heroine; the heroine impressed her? The kid had no mother?? The provocative thing is that this movie doesn't want to answer any question, being willfully tepid, or enjoying deficiency.<br/><br/>(Cary Ross) didn't do anything to be proud of, or called smart for. He filmed the movie as unbroken chain of close-ups. The long shots were a few. Aside from tinting the entire movie with one color, that ruined many feelings and situations along the way too. And maybe caused the status of bore which many reviews talked about, knowing that it's shameful to talk about ""bore"" in an action anyway! Speaking about that action, I supposed it would be the movie's real point, though it wasn't by far something to glorify, or watch in the first place. For a non-violence lover, such as me, it didn't satisfy my apatite for thrilling adventures, cool sequences, or clever fights. And for a violence lover, such as millions out there, it was tamer than a Tom & Jerry's short!<br/><br/>I felt usual, flat and tasteless TV all along. Actually, if (Oliver Stone) had directed it, he would have focused on the bestial media. If (Tim Burton) had directed it, he would have greatly cared about the 2 classes' societies, especially the flamboyant rich one, falling in love with the story's darkness and the show's oddity. Even if (Quentin Tarantino) had directed it, he would have made its violence memorable. See how many chances (Ross) lost, to achieve nothing of his own as well!<br/><br/>(James Newton Howard) used to make distinct music scores. This time, forget it wholly. He composed one of his lowest works ever. Nothing was special about his musical ingenuity here, if there was any!<br/><br/>However, I suffered the most from (Jennifer Lawrence)'s dead face as (Katniss). With one-note, awfully cold, waxy features, she was a perfect doll from start to finish, not giving any effective reaction throughout, or encouraging any kind of interplay between her character and me as a viewer, in brief; (Steven Seagal) looks more concerned and involved in comparison. And the critics praised her performance? That's more terrible indeed, particularly while everybody acted better than her!<br/><br/>It makes other movies, with similar plot or atmosphere, simply surpass. In The Running Man (1987), the anti-media speech was into the point, the action was hot, and it showed the public different viewpoints smartly, not to mention having a charismatic hero. Even in movies like The Condemned (2007), Death Race (2008) or The Turnament (2009), the action was more sophisticated, inventive or at least there!<br/><br/>In (The Hunger Games)'s favor, I loved 2 things; the new idea of a flaming dress, plus the assiduous costume designs of district 1's rich habitants. It creatively mixed the old baroque style with the modern camp one. As far as creativeness goes, that was it I'm afraid. Even the CGI of the fiery suits was so obvious!<br/><br/>This is as bland as (Jennifer Lawrence)'s face. It's unremarkable at best, except for its success; which assures, to considerable extent, that today's teens are so insecure, living a hell of a bloody competition; where they can reach their goals by going over the others' corpses, and love is a device to get materialistic dreams. As if the movie summarized life through one TV show, and the message is direct; you have to be like it, namely drastic and manipulative, to survive and turn out well. It put other contemporary leads like (Harry Potter) to shame as too innocent and dully utopian, while showing the world's ugly face as wild and no utopia; which clearly, according to the movie's income, hit a giant nerve out there.<br/><br/>So although the movie has no redeeming quality, ranking as below average for me; it says a lot by its success, and that's undoubtedly where its only value remains."
"MLDinTN","7","1","5","1 January 2013"," exciting adventure....
","but the movie should have been rated R to tell the story better. By this I mean, it is about teens brutally killing each other to win a contest; the violence sounds like an R rating to me. It would have been better if the kills were actually shown and more gore and blood to show the horror of it. Instead, it was really toned down to get a pg13 rating.<br/><br/>The beginning was a little slow, like others have said, the game was the focus of the film and doesn't start to over an hour in. Some things that didn't make sense was how could they conger up fire and dogs that were real in the game, made no sense. If you could do that, why not wipe out all the people in the lesser districts so you don't have to worry about keeping them under control. I liked Woody Harrelson's character, he knew how to play all the power people perfectly. Did any of the other kids get help from their mentor? It was never shown.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: Fun, adventure film. I haven't read the books, but I bet quite a bit got left out because there wasn't room to put it in the movie. The only negative is it is set up for a sequel, and it will be many months before it's released."

The book is quite good and so is the movie - you can't expect a movie a little over 2 hours long to be exactly the same as the book. It is a very good adaptation, but mostly for people who have read the book because the movie is not dumb-ed down. The wild clothing and make-up of the people of ""The Capital"" is a bit much visually and maybe that could have been toned down a bit, but if you understand how it came about (because you read the book) it makes sense. Because of the violence this movie is for adults only. And I'd say the movie is for (real) sci-fi fans only."

","well i didn't know anything about either the books or the movie so when i accidentally saw the trailer i thought it must be interesting but fist i read the books and they are amazing Suzann Collins creates a world so unfair and so monstreous and at the same time so believable that you may forget that its just a book. its not just kids killing each other its the fact that violence is not only accepted but also celebrated an while your reading it you may find yourself encouraging the main character to fight harder even to kill as many as she can and thats where you realize you may not be very different from the people of capitol.as for the movie well its not awful and does a mediocre job until katniss finds peeta from then it just becomes so weird they don't have any chemistry between them and half of the time katniss seems to be peetas older sister !peetas love for katniss seems forced and unbelievable...this boy has been in love with her ever since they were 5 but you just cant feel it. the other characters especially the careers are so dumbed down that they remind you of the bullies in playground not the bloodthirsty fighters who long for the fight.they become down wright ridiculous when they start giggling and jogging in the forest as they hunt other tributes.as for the actors ...jeniffer Lawrence is very good actress but she doesn't resemble katniss in any sort of way i mean katniss is small and slim she has dark skin with strait black hair and gray eyes she is shy and because of what she has been through she has detached herself from others the only person she openly loves is prim (at least in the first book ) Jennifer is tall busty well fed over confident and not at all afraid of even the games... the boy who plays peeta is OK but not as lovable as peeta in the books but what i found funny was the girl who played clove :D :D she is so tiny that even rue could have killed her compare her to clove in the books the frightening big and sadistic killer , i don't know what went trough the mind of person in charge of casting to choose her but the casting of this movie is altogether very awful.finally the relationships in the movie are not like the books, Cato and clove are friends ( actually when thresh kills clove and its by smashing her head with a rock Cato rushes to help help her and cries when she dyes ) but in the movie Cato and glimmer are friends and also katniss and gale relationship is not like what it is in the book. overall not a bad movie but cant be compared to the books ."

And to make matters worse all of the people giving it a 1- star? Or would like to give it a zero? It honestly is not that bad. The movie itself is based off of a book so the people that have an issue with the author's concept of children fighting to the death should not watch it, and those who do should not complain because they should have known what the movie was about before they watched it. The idea is pretty interesting and while some of the acting in a few of the cases could have been better I actually enjoyed this movie quite a bit. And with 3 other movies already lined up, I'm sure some of the story line will come together in the end. So while everyone says its horrible, I say watch it anyhow. If you hate it, you hate it. If not then hopefully its interesting and enjoyable. But for everyone that comes on here just to complain about how god awful it is, you need to remember that it's rated pg-13 and that they are trying to appeal to a younger audience.

","Twenty-four teenagers, one male and one female from each district, ages 12-18, enter into a fight to the death as part of the government's payback for earlier uprisings. The event is televised. Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) from District 12 takes her sister's place in the competition. Josh Hutcherson as Peeta is the male from District 12. <br/><br/>This movie proves that people go to auto races to see accidents. If you can get over the idea of kids killing kids, then you may enjoy this movie. How does one do that? Well, some will say it's all tastefully done; and there are instances where the killings come as a result of self-defense.<br/><br/>If I said the name Katniss 10,000 times over and over again, I may get used to it. Every time I heard it I said ""catnip"" to myself (easy now). Jennifer Lawrence, as Katniss, carries this movie to perfection. We know she doesn't want to kill anyone, yet.there's that self-defense thing that comes along. Yes, yes, we hope she wins.<br/><br/>Observations: the nervous camera was in evidence for about the first 15-minutes, then it went away as well it should. The people who run the television event and other elites have the most garish fashion sense. It's like they all came from the Mad Hatter's tea party. And, don't get me started on the hairdos, beards and a new way to slap-on lipstick. You see, because this takes place waaaaay in the future, we have to be bombarded with extremes. After a while we do get used to these fashion extremes. Sad, but true. <br/><br/>I didn't expect the first half of the movie to drag but, it did with the training and securing of sponsors (who help the participants). The hype that went on for years before the movie was released didn't go into that. <br/><br/>Each team is given a mentor to advise them on how to survive in the woods, the battleground for the Hunger Games. The Mentors were previous winners in the Hunger Games. Woody Harrelson plays a mentor part to perfection. The guy should be given Oscars for just showing up. He is that good. And, aside from Jennifer Lawrence, he steals the show. It wouldn't surprise me if Jennifer Lawrence is nominated for an Oscar as she was in WINTER'S BONE, a great movie. And, Woody Harrelson also.<br/><br/>Other notables: Stanley Tucci, Wes Bentley, and Donald Sutherland who performed well. Donald Sutherland as President Snow says the thing more powerful than fear is hope. The way I see it the contestants and the parents of the participants have hope. The audience sits in fear. If the audience ever gets hope that things can change Snow's government will fall.<br/><br/>There is a certain amount of tension and suspense throughout because we side with Katniss, who is wary of everything, as are we. Now for the kicker - more tension: the ones running the show can inject fire or wild animals into the event if they feel they are losing or losing face. Why they would do that blew my mind. Yes, that is not fair. The contestants have no recourse but to fend for themselves. The audience watching all this doesn't seem to be too upset about it. The audience is every bit of sheep mentality. Is this where we are heading? There are political agendas in here and you may see the implications.<br/><br/>Here is what I was hoping for throughout: that the contestants or the audience would somehow put a stop to these Hunger Games forever. But the ending for this movie is extremely weak. Go see for yourself. But, oh, oh, a sequel is coming: The Hunger Games, Catching Fire in 2013. Sad, but true. <br/><br/>Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: No."
"hypestyle","8","1","5","12 August 2012"," Hunger Games Film Has Bite
","'Hunger Games' Film has Bite New film The Hunger Games takes place in the distant future of a post-apocalyptic United States. An obliquely-referred to war/cataclysm has purportedly decimated world resources, especially regarding food—and the country has been divided into 12 impoverished districts. For seven decades, once a year, a lottery is held in which two children from each of the districts are chosen to participate in gladiatorial combat. The conflict is, of course, to the death— the sole survivor wins the lion's share of vital rations for their district, and one presumes, bragging rights.<br/><br/>The film's heroine is the dramatically-named Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence.) Katniss is quite adept in the use of a bow and arrow, with which she hunts animals for food and to earn money for the family—her mother apparently had a nervous breakdown when Katniss's father died in a coal-mining accident. This year, district 12's female lottery ""winner"" is initially Katniss's younger sister, which prompts Katniss to volunteer in her place. The male contestant from her district is Peeta (Josh Hutcherson), who harbors a long-dormant crush on Katniss.<br/><br/>In an extended, perverted version of being fattened up before the slaughter, the combatants—some as young as 12—are given ornate costumes and literally paraded through the capital city (which seems to lack not at all for any resources), where they are interviewed by the cloying Games host (Stanley Tucci.) Katniss finds sympathetic allies in her official clothier Cinna (Lenny Kravitz), and alcoholic combat mentor Haymitch (Woody Harrelson) who apparently survived the Games himself, decades ago.<br/><br/>Peeta is strong of arm but otherwise unconvinced of his ability to survive the combat arena, a vast forest. Naturally, every inch of it is rigged with video cameras, which broadcast even the most intimate of moments to the national audience. ""Winning sponsors"" can occasionally get strategically delivered supplies to combatants. Regardless, dozens of technicians in an operations room actively work equipment that manipulates the environment, causing fires and conjuring giant dogs to terrorize combatants lest they become too good at surviving (similar string-pulling tactics drove the plot of Cabin in the Woods.) Behind the curtains is Crane (Wes Bentley), an executive producer of sorts who serves at the pleasure of the President (Donald Sutherland.) Embodying the ire of recent real-life political protests, Sutherland's leader knows the status quo he defends is immoral, and he is fully dedicated to maintaining its stark class divisions, with the games as its primary wedge. Katniss's plucky charm threatens to rock the boat.<br/><br/>As executed by director Gary Ross, the film functions as an extrapolation of Shirley Jackson's short story ""The Lottery"" and Golding's youth-gone-feral Lord of the Flies. Genre viewers may also recall elements of The Running Man and Logan's Run. The original Games novel was the first in a trilogy by author Suzanne Collins. If this first filmed adaptation is an indicator, the saga is off to a good start."

","I think this movie was very smartly done. When I saw the cast list at first I was outraged! I thought somebody so pretty and young couldn't play Effie, I kid who already had so many iconic roles couldn't play Peeta and a tall blond beach babe couldn't play Katniss. But when I watched it it all seemed to come together. Very different how I Imagined it but in the same terrifying yet wondrous way. <br/><br/>The emotion that the cast brought on screen was fantastic! Even without Katniss narrating it, you could see what she was thinking and guess every thought in her head. The costuming was very brilliant and added to the story wonderfully. The camera shots at the beginning were a little annoying and artsy and too zoomed in though. It was hard to watch without becoming dizzy. And the final fight scene between the two guys, it just looked like two blond heads spinning around and around. This movie was enjoyable though, not the hunger games that I imagined but a good movie none the less."
"bigmystery23","8","1","5","11 August 2012"," Satisfying, but not for Ross
","There are many positives about this film (the acting, the cinematography, the casting, the set, the costuming and make-up). But, there are some flaws (the depth of setting up the games and the lack of emotions in the games, the lack of Howard's music ability, the unrealistic images of the people who are ""apparently"" starving, and the unnecessary spoilers for the next film). Now is this a bad film? Absolutely not! This film overpowers the flaws with astounding acting from the older actors, particularly Stanley Tucci, Elizabeth Banks, and Donald Sutherland, spectacular cinematography that, though may feel nauseous at times, feels as if the audience is in the games, some beautiful set designs, and memorizing costumes and make-up. Plus, with not as big as a budget as most films, Ross does a good job in creating the atmosphere of the novel. One thing I wish had happened was that Ross had focused more on filming the intensity of the games that was portrayed in the novel, but it is quite difficult to create a film that is better than it's adaptation. This probably wasn't the best film for Gary Ross to direct, but it wasn't a disappointment."
"innocentwanderer","8","1","5","9 August 2012"," The Movie Delivers just fine.
","The hunger games is an adaption of the book with the same name by Suzanne Collins. The story is based on dystopia future. The movie has a typical dystopia look we have seen before in movies like Equilibrium and Aeon Flux.<br/><br/>The genre is action/adventure. The movie delivers in both. The killing scenes aren't explicit due to PG-13 rating. The main roles were played by Jennifer Lawrence(Katniss Everdeen), Josh Hutcherson(Peeta Mellark) and Woody Harrelson(Haymitch). Haymitch's adaptation wasn't exactly to the book strictly speaking but I dare say, I liked him in the movie. Josh too, played his part well. Jennifer was the shining star of this movie, her acting worthy of Oscar nomination.<br/><br/>The mood of the movie was appropriately subdued, something that will be explained in subsequent movies. The main themes like media power, limelight and becoming a symbol were aptly shown. The chemistry between the leads, in my opinion also delivered, a point which many may disagree.<br/><br/>The costumes were awesome, so were the effects. I loved that fiery-dress-effect. The forest burning and balls of fire were awesome too. The sound effect team really deserves some recognition. The deafening-effect when Katniss entered for interview really added to the feel so did the rushing sounds and whistles during the chaotic blood bath. The background score was awesome. The game room perspective also added a nice addition to the movie.<br/><br/>The epic moments were wonderfully shot. The moment when she became a symbol; a mockingjay, really got me moved. The action sequences were adrenaline kicking.<br/><br/>This movie met a lot of criticism among people who had read the books. They said the movie didn't do justice to the book. Well, the books are written in first person perspective view of Katniss. The movie couldn't possibly have explained what Katniss was thinking at the moment. They could've used the narrative technique and people still wouldn't have been satisfied. I think Jennifer Lawrence's demeanor was quite enough to do justice to the Katniss. The chemistry between the star-crossed-lovers may have seemed insufficient but it will develop with the subsequent movies.<br/><br/>In the end, I must say that there is no limit to the reader's imagination while the movie is as good as the director's imagination, to which most people will always disagree. Though there is always a room for improvement, there was no way this movie spoiled the book experience. At least, this movie won't make any reader shout in anger,""What the hell!""."
"egen38","8","1","5","8 August 2012"," I'm in two minds over this movie
","Firstly, i have not read the books, nor did i know they exist before this film. I found this film great when watching it, but reflecting back i can certainly see some of your concerns. I expected this film to be gory and gut-wrenching. But the producers have blatantly kept it mellow and subtle so that they could release it to a pg-13 market, to make another twilight-like film. You didn't really see any of the deaths. Another thing i found bad was that i felt no empathy towards any of the characters, except Katniss, when Rue died i expected to be upset but i wasn't as no emotion was portrayed. Overall, the main thing wrong was the 'pg-13' problem, but on the whole i loved the film, and will watch it again."
"MattsMovieWatchingWorld","5","1","5","6 August 2012"," How The Hunger Games movie compares to the first chapter of The Hunger Games book
","My review for this movie probably started back a year and a half or so before the movie came out. I think the book Mockingjay had just come out, and I heard of some people who were reading and recommending it. Before long, it was the newest big book series on the popularity level of Harry Potter and Twilight, even though at that point I had never heard of the previous two books in the trilogy, The Hunger Games and Catching Fire. (Some people close to the books could tell me that the previous books were always popular, but I have no proof.) It seemed undeniable that it would be the next big movie franchise. If it was, I knew I would eventually see it. But when I did would depend on what I knew about it. My awareness of what it was about changed over the course of a year or so. My first bare assumption of its content guessed it was some cheesy love story. But when I picked up a book and read the description on the back, it looked like a potentially intriguing story of a battle to the death on live television within an oppressive nation, which is pretty close to what it really is. Over a little more time, I thought I understood some premise that it's in the sci-fi genre, more so than Harry Potter and Twilight, and that represented the point where I began strongly considering reading the book. Then over a little more time, I started feeling a little pessimism about it. Really, 24 teenagers from throughout Panem, being forced by their government to kill each other on television until one is left? Is that a necessarily sci-fi premise, and would it really be uplifting enough for me to put it in a classic place in my history?<br/><br/>Then a month or so before the movie's release, I decided to go to the bookstore, pick up the book, sit down, read the first chapter, and leave the bookstore, considering that I would decide to read the whole book (and see the movie early) if the first chapter was particularly compelling. I considered the book fairly difficult to read, and it took five or ten pages before I could really understand what the first two to four pages were saying. But the book made enough sense by the time I read a couple pages into the second chapter, which was where I decided would be as far as I would get with the book, and I would see the movie in the discount theater. The first chapter is about the characters Katniss, her younger sister Primrose, and her friend Gale, and the second chapter as far as I read introduced Peeta. The story seems to emphasize that it's about Katniss volunteering to replace Primrose as District 12 tribute to the Hunger Games, but that's really only what the first chapter is about. Primrose and Gale have very little to do with the rest of the story. I was able to figure this out even as I stopped at that point in the book and before I watched the movie. I hope (and people who have read all the books could confirm or deny) that the sequels are a little more focused on them.<br/><br/>The Hunger Games came to the discount theater when the London Olympics were on TV, which interestingly enough, was a good time to watch it, though it goes without saying that it's nice to live in a world where the Olympics are not the Hunger Games. My impression of the rest of the book seemed pretty close to what I saw on the screen. Somewhat intriguing, but nothing really compelling. Nothing that made me cheer, and the logical lack of applause from the citizens of Panem probably had something to do with that. People I had talked to who had read the book said that there are dramatic interactions between the characters, particularly before the Games begin, and that's basically true. The big picture of the story doesn't really put it all the way into the sci-fi genre, but some little sci-fi elements, including genetically engineered creatures, made the movie a little closer to my kind of thing. There is obviously quite a bit of disturbing violent content, and I was right that it wouldn't be very uplifting.<br/><br/>As for the cinematic artwork of the filmmakers, the directing and acting were okay, and the music which I often pay attention to was also okay. It is an action movie, but because the sci-fi elements are somewhat subdued and almost the whole thing could theoretically happen in two hundred years or so, that doesn't really justify it for classic visual effects. The costume design, makeup, and hairstyling were obviously really weird, especially on the government people, and I don't know how much the book suggested that. I guess that justifies it for consideration for Best Costume Design and Best Makeup of the year. Is ""may the odds be ever in your favor"" supposed to be the new ""may the Force be with you""? It's quotable, but I don't think that's really going to work.<br/><br/>And my last comment, why is it called ""The Hunger Games""? I can tell that the government tries to lighten up the mood of the competition by calling it a ""game,"" but other than the fact that competitors might sometimes get a little hungry during the games, I don't know where the ""Hunger"" part of the name comes from. If I were writing it, ""The Panem Games"" probably would have been a better title."
"socialmedia-437-956449","7","1","5","2 August 2012"," Something that Knits Us All Together
","Based on the first part of a trilogy of books with the same name by Suzanne Collins, ""The Hunger Games"" is set in an unspecified post-apocalyptic and peaceful future. The price of food is rocketing. The citizens of the Capitol, the fortress city of the rich and powerful, annually select, through a lottery, a young boy and girl between the ages of 12 and 18 from each of the twelve districts to fight with each other to death. This is done live on television, leaving only one winner. Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) volunteers instead of her younger sister to lead this fierce battle.<br/><br/>16 year-old Katniss hails from the distinctly poor district 12, and area known for its rich supply of coal. She shows a rebellious streak and is the breadwinner who feeds her mother and younger sister. She has a talent for illegally hunting to sell goods on the black market with her best friend Gale (Liam Hemsworth).<br/><br/>'The Hunger Game' is introduced in the film as ""something that knits us all together"" from the creator of this bloody live show. The poorer districts ask for food from the government; their names appear in the lottery. It's a life defined by day-to-day survival.<br/><br/>The two selected protagonists of district 12, Katniss and Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) are moved to the Capitol, where the conglomeration of technology and money are based. Like gladiators, they are treated like stars with big banquets and fancy clothes before they're sent off to their deaths in an outdoor arena.<br/><br/>They meet their drunken trainer and previous winner Haymitch (Woody Harrelson), who introduces them to the manipulative nature of the game. Basically they have to please the audience in order to get more sponsors who will provide them with gifts of food and crucial items when they're out there fighting for their lives.<br/><br/>Katniss understands she's nothing but mere entertainment for the rich living in Capitol. Her bravery in standing up for her sister has already given her more points, but she has to keep it up by employing her talents in order to shift public opinion in her favor while audiences anticipating death.<br/><br/>The film is an analogy of the manipulation of media in our modern times, and how end-users are at the service of darker powers. I was reminded of Noam Chomsky, who has revealed the mass media schemes through the ""manufacture of fear"" in order to reach control.<br/><br/>Media manipulation is not new to Hollywood, from ""Wag the Dog"", ""1984"" and ""The Truman Show"", all hint in different ways, the power of the media industry in shifting people's opinions towards war. But this is probably the first time this argument has been pitched at a younger generation.<br/><br/>Oscar nominated Jennifer Lawrence (""Winter's Bone"") has proved once more that she's a formidable presence. The film, on the other hand, sometimes lacks details that would have moved it closer to perfection. There are some irrelevant futuristic costumes, and an under-developed storyline about the father-like daughter relationship between Lenny Kravitz and Katniss. The film is open for analogy with the current uprisings in the Middle East. As the film says, hope is ""the only thing stronger than fear"".<br/><br/>Find the rest of our film and festival coverage, as well as our events and education, at www.DohaFilmInstitute.com.

"williamhume","8","1","5","9 July 2012"," Review and Analysis: ""Hey Katniss, how about that kiss?""
","Bias: Having read the book a year ago, I am more likely to fill in plot holes and character development mentally.<br/><br/>When this movie was announced I expected it to be down the line studio filmmaking at its most mediocre like many lesser book adaptations, but came out quite impressed with how the film turned out. This movie stands on its own so you don't get any of that ""Well it makes sense if you've read the book"". As far as the adaptation goes this movie maintains every major plot point from the book without much change. The movie is limited by its format running time pushing everything in at a faster than preferred pace, but takes advantage of the third person narrative showing a few welcome and crucial scenes. Reactions outside the arena from the nation's districts, Katniss' hometown, and one on one's between Head Game Maker Seneca Crane and President Snow offer better and less obvious character development than the book.<br/><br/>21 Year-Old and Rather Attractive Oscar Nominee Jennifer Lawrence as 16 Year-Old Katniss Everdeen The acting in the film is strong all across the board. Obviously the major role of Katniss Everdeen carries the film and Jennifer Lawrence who though seems just a tiny bit too old to play sixteen humanizes the strong female protagonist very well. Small roles like Effie Trinkett, Cinna, Haymitch and Gale (a major character later in the series) are played really well and put to good use. Though my favourite had to be Stanley Tucci in the fun role of Caesar Flickerman. I thought Game Maker Seneca Crane is set up better here as the main antagonist than in the book and looks cool. Josh Hutcherson (who like Lawrence is also a fan of the series) is the only one I would have a complaint about, as he is less charming here than depicted in the book (""Hey Katniss, how about that kiss?""). My guess is that he either played to his limitations, was cut from much of the film, or it was decided he was to be taken more seriously as a love interest, but this might make him lack as a strong alternative later in the series. Which could get interesting.<br/><br/>Minor criticisms I would make are that the adaptation should have been even more bold venturing outside its faithful route (The character of Foxface though necessary in the novel is a fun distraction that doesn't add a whole lot to the film). The climax of the film lacks a truly strong payoff that the book had but also trades that in for planting the seeds for a series. There is nothing truly remarkable or stand out about this film that led me to think much about it afterwards, other than the fan fervor of counting the proceeds of its success. Many complaints of the film stem from the use of shaky cam. Though the film could use more wide shots, as it is beautifully filmed, I find it actually adds to the frenetic pacing of being in the arena, and is not as annoying or overused as in other such films as ""The Bourne Ultimatum"". It also should be known that this was one of the tactics employed by the producers to cut the film for a PG-13 rating, both to exercise more money and stay true to the authour's request. The rating is really played to the edge as it is still very bloody so I actually applaud the studio for maintaining the books vision as well as being consistent and not limited by its rating.<br/><br/>In my opinion I thought the themes left unexplored in the novel aside from; Personal Independence and Satirization of the Media especially Reality Television, were hinted at but unused to their full extent, which would highly elevate the material. This includes comparisons to the Holy Roman Empire and French Revolution, Poverty, Class Warfare, Governnent Oppression, ""Big Brother"" a la George Orwell (though that's pretty overdone nowadays). The bright side is that there is plenty of this to play around with in the series' future.<br/><br/>Bottom line This is a very strong solid film with great execution that is worth seeing in theatres, and deserves the praise its getting. The groundwork is strong for a series and it overall is a very good time. It's just not the R-rated magnum opus I would have it be having taken more risks.<br/><br/>Ridiculous comparisons: Better than ""John Carter"", ""X-Men"", ""Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone"" and ""Mission: Impossible III"". On par with ""21 Jump Street"", ""50/50"", ""Inception"" and ""Spider-Man"". Not as good as ""Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring"", ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"", or ""Batman Begins""."
"joetufano719","8","1","5","7 July 2012"," Quite an excitement!
","I knew absolutely nothing about ""The Hunger Games"" until I saw the previews for this movie, and also when my Mom and sister went to see it in the theater. My Mom told me it was exciting, but my sister 'liked' it only because she said it didn't really follow the book.<br/><br/>My interest was raised, and I watched a preview and decided to go see it. Honestly, I liked it! The story takes place sometime in the future in a country called Panem, which is a post-apocalyptic America and Canada and divided into 12 (or 13) districts, and one young person from each district is sent to the capital city located in the Rocky Mts to take part in a match called ""the hunger games"". The games are a series of a fight to the death type of scenario like the gladiator fights that took place during the time of the Roman Republic/Empire, and only one will remain victorious and receive eternal glory. Two young people, Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) and Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) are taken to the capital city to take part in the games. By now a lot of people have seen the movie and read the books, so I don't think it's a big surprise what happens at the end. Peeta and Katniss are the last two left by the end, and are pitted against each other so only one comes out a winner. They later decide to kill themselves instead, thus forcing the game hosts to declare them both winners. They emerge as celebrities throughout Panem, but now the President of Panem (Donald Sutherland) has to figure out what to do with Peeta and Katniss since they started a rebellion throughout the other districts.<br/><br/>I thought the acting was very good: Jennifer Lawrence, Josh Hutcherson, Woody Harrelson, Elizabeth Banks, Lenny Kravitz and Donald Sutherland are very good in their parts, and the scenes that took place during the match were pretty intense, and I got a bit freaked out when the giant dogs came out. I never read the books so I can't tell you how the movie is in comparison, but I did feel like there were some things that felt a bit rushed. But in the end, I thought ""The Hunger Games"" was a good movie and I'm looking forward to the sequels."

"kelliez","9","1","5","18 May 2012"," A fantastic film
","I would have loved to give this film a 10/10, but unfortunately there were some crucial elements missing. However, I feel that lots of people are giving The Hunger Games a worse rating than it deserves because they expected it to be exactly like the book (which I've read and loved) when in reality there was no way they could have included everything that went on in the book unless they made a 6-hour or two-part film.<br/><br/>There were things missing such as Peeta's ""Here to finish me off, sweetheart?"" line and Madge's character was completely removed, meaning that Katniss got the Mockingjay pin from Greasy Sae instead of Madge like she did in the books (which gave the pin a lot less value and meaning).<br/><br/>Those things can be overlooked, however one thing that really got me was the lack of screen time that Rue (Amandla Stenberg) was given. I felt that I couldn't really connect with Rue when watching the film like I did when reading the books because you just don't see enough of her, and when she dies, although the scene is near perfection, the emotion doesn't hit you like it should because you just don't see her enough and get to connect with her. Altogether I feel that it was a fantastic film (if not a little too fast-paced) and they captured loads of aspects of the books brilliantly, and most of the things that were missed out can be overlooked if you appreciate the film for what it is.<br/><br/>Something that I wasn't expecting to happen when watching the film was how much I ended up liking Seneca Crane. He got more screen time than I thought he would, but Wes Bentley has something endearing about him that really made me love Seneca and I felt quite sad when he died - which shocked me more because I didn't really care when reading the books.<br/><br/>All the cast gave a fantastic performance, I'm not really going to single anyone out because they really were all fantastic.<br/><br/>8.5/10"
"codeman1964","8","1","5","15 May 2012"," So rare to see additional content in a book adaptation!
","**Major SPOILER Alert**<br/><br/>I really enjoyed this movie. Some other reviewers have (correctly) commented on the fact that certain elements were missing or altered from the book, such as the ""hunger"" aspect of The Hunger Games. For me, notably, it was 1) not seeing Rue leap through the tree-tops to escape as Katniss releases the Tracker Jacker hive, 2) omitting the tribute who explodes after prematurely stepping off the platform and 3) the Muttations not walking upright. As for the Muttations, I think it is likely that the filmmakers simply decided that portraying the nuances of Katniss's realization that they were the re-animated (or imitated) dead tributes would be simply too lengthy and costly to portray.<br/><br/>After I finished the book, I mentioned that I was surprised that the author didn't include details (maybe alternating chapters?) of the reaction of the Capitol's spectators or the experiences of the Gamemasters. I was shocked to find both in the film. Bravo! <br/><br/>It is not often that you find a film that adds legitimate content missing from the book. I say ""legitimate"" content as opposed to the District 11 rebellion which was not even hinted at in the book.<br/><br/>The casting was fantastic with the exception of Woody Harrelson as Haymitch. In the book, Haymitch is described as a paunchy, gone-to-seed middle-aged man with short dark and curly hair, but Harrelson's version looks more like a buff, overly-recognizable, albeit shaggy superstar.<br/><br/>All in all, a terrific movie!"

The selection of the participant or ""Tribute"" are choose on the annual lottery known as "" The Reaping"".as the the next lottery for 74th annual Hunger Games begin in District 12,which is the poorest district among the whole district.Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) is a 16 year old girl living in the district along with her little sister Primrose(Willow Shields) whose odd of being chosen as one of the tribute is close to impossible,However the odds are suddenly change when her sister Primrose are chosen to become district 12 tribute.Knowing that her sister didn't have any change of surviving the hunger games,Katniss Everdeen bravely substitute herself with her sister as the tribute of district 12 by becoming a volunteer for her sister sake. beside Katniss as the female tribute,another tribute that is chosen to represent the district is a baker's son named Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson).they are brought up into the capital with the well dressed Effie Trinket by riding Capitol fastest train,during their journey into the capitol, Effie introduce them to Haymetch Abernathy (Woody Harrelson) that happened to be one of the winner of the hunger games and he is also take part as their teacher.what Lies ahead for Katniss and Peeta in the Hunger Games?and How they are going to survive the brutal and violent Hunger Games?<br/><br/>The Hunger Games has a strong start in the beginning especially during the scene where Katniss little sister Primrose are chosen to become one of the tribute,which emotionally showed the conflict and dilemma that is going to become her motivation in the future. After dramatic separation between Katniss and her beloved sister Primrose,we are showed the Capital which visually packed with lots of CGI and glamorous set of decoration.from the realistic district 12 into the imaginative Capitol as how the future Metropolitan City looks like was one of rules that The Hunger Games has quickly set up the rules of Fantasy and Science fiction which tell the audience that the movie has something more than just drama with its adolescent female as its main character.<br/><br/>But what makes The Hunger Games different than any others kind of similar movie is how the combination of serious drama and teen romance manage to capture the theme of the movie which is deeper than a young adult being forced into harsh reality when everything is controlled by rich people who didn't have any moral value nor sense of compassion.without over-the-top action sequence The Hunger Games flows naturally with the character development and solid acting from the cast of young actors and teen star like Josh Hutcherson and rising star Liam Hamsworth whose acting skill are far better than Pattinson and Lautner in Twilight has saved the movie from becoming another twilight rip-off.but all the credit should goes for Jennifer Lawrence whose captivating performance and method acting is what makes the movie looks more mature as a movie that primely aims for teenage audience.Lawrence acting credibility is proved when she got Oscar nomination in last year Oscar in Winter's Bone where she played similar character of an adolescent young adult who are being forced take responsibility as head of the family and surviving the cruel reality.to have played strong independent female character like Katness Everdeen is no difficult task for Lawrence since her past experience has definitely brought her own perspective when it comes to played this kind of character.her fans will be craving for more and audience may take more attention toward this promising young actress.<br/><br/>The Hunger Games delivers all of its promise,from exciting adventure to witty and dazzling heroine that take place in a gloomy future of United States in post-modern warfare which the visual effect that was used is not over the top so the fantasy world such the Capitol still has some of its realistic aspect as future metropolitan yet it is still imaginative."
"vmoreno2007","9","1","5","7 May 2012"," Good movie, lots of tension and minimalist but high impact acting
","I did not read the book, but but know from reading other novels, things will be left out in movies, there's only so much you can portray on film; you cannot really get into the thoughts of the characters, their feelings or past experiences that make them into what they are. I thought the acting of the main actress was phenomenal; there was a lot of focus on her facial expressions which added to the somber tone of the film; it was more about the plot and acting rather than the actions scenes themselves. On a deeper note, the movie portrays the age old conflicts of the elitist and the impoverished; there is always a whole world of those lurking in poverty so vastly different from the unreachable rich people just like in today's society as is true from thousands of years ago, an age old theme that will always be popular because it is true any century you live in; on a deeper note it shows how a young girl has to be strong under adverse conditions and is self-sacrificing, brave and courageous despite adversity; the actress really showed the depth of character required by the heroine-it was easy to connect to the emotions; I got the sense she is a very strong character and this was remarkably portrayed. The hero Peeta seems a little weak in the movie especially when he gets injured; but the longing in his eyes for his true love is evident and I think accurately portrayed as it is young innocent love, not those sexy steamy romances you always see where the couple sleep with each other as soon as they meet; I think the love story was sweet and showed hope amidst the dire circumstances; the way the children killed each other was very gory but on deeper note it stands for how everyone is after each other even at the expense of their neighbour to try to get ahead in life;everyone is too literal in trying to translate the book into the movie but that will never happen; film will never be the same as reading a book where you get to hear the hero's and heroine's thoughts, feelings and plans; but without having read the book, I think it portrayed a lot of deep strong emotions; I never got the sense that it was going to be a love story so by not concentrating on the two young kids was fine with me-it is unfair to compare it to Twilight which focuses mostly on the love plot, this is more about extreme circumstances; it was shown to portray katniss as this very strong young woman fighting for her survival using the very same skills that kept her alive when hunger as prevalent; it reflects life and is a metaphor; you either rise above your circumstances and stay strong and beat the odds or you crumble under the weight of you what life hands you and perish underneath go to drugs and alcohol and perish because of it; the whole movie is metaphoric pitting rich against poor; pitting the strong willed who will survive and the weak who get shot with an arrow or better yet some ugly looking dogs; I think you need to see past the fact it may not have faithfully followed the book and enjoy the excellent acting and depth of the portrayals, I certainly did I was entranced the whole 2 1/2 hours and didn't realize it was that long; great movie I say; you feel what the actress is feeling not by dialogue but clever scenes of facial expression it captured the mood greatly; I was a little confused with the first guy she hung out with I thought they would hook up then they introduce peeta so I was bit confused there; regarding people's criticism about the loud costumes, I think they were trying to contrast the rich with the dark and somber poor who are lifeless without color compared to the rich who are vibrant and can afford anything; same is true in real life when you have no money you clothes get dirty and full of holes; when you are rich you afford designer clothes and can pamper yourself and look extreme, to the point of looking silly; it again is metaphoric and portrays the greediness of the elitists and the wasting and wanting of the have-nots and amidst it all is katniss who gives them hope....think you need to dig deep to really appreciate the film.

","So if you read through all of the comments of the movie your always going to get that divide between people who absolutely loved it and people who critique every detail. For someone who hasn't read all of the books you'll probably really like the movie. As for the book readers, yes it's true details where altered, but it's still an overall good movie. If you honestly didn't like the movie solely because of the detail changes there's hope for you all! They have already released that the director that directed this one will NOT be doing the next. Therefore, don't be loosing hope in the series! It has so much potential and I'm sure their next director will learn from the flaws of Mr. Gary Ross. May the odds ever be in your favor ;P"
"freshclean-66-318608","7","1","5","28 April 2012"," Better Than What I Thought.
","I just came from seeing this film. Well, what can I say? It was a good movie, although I did see two other older movies in it. I was told to read the book before I saw the movie and if I did that would make the movie even more better. Well, I didn't read the book at all but I still thought it was a good movie. What separated this movie from the other two movies similar to it was the make up of the storyline. Here you had a couple of other situations that took place in the film apart from the main storyline. The acting was pretty good too. Isabelle Fuhrman(Clove) did a pretty good job doing her part. It was almost like she was playing her role in Orphan again. The book has two sequels. So if they are planning on making them to this film I think I'll take a peek at them as well."
"gizmomogwai","7","1","5","22 April 2012"," A decent depiction of indecency
","A blockbuster movie about teens and preteens fighting to the death, from... the director of Pleasantville? Really? Pleasantville was a good movie but this sounds a world apart. Still, The Hunger Games has a decent IMDb rating, so I decided to give it a shot.<br/><br/>So the plot is that in a country (I assume the United States because of the accents) that had a civil war, the victorious districts annually force the defeated 12 districts to sacrifice 24 kids between the ages of 12 and 18 (""tributes""), and force them to fight to the death, with only one winner. Katniss, our hero, volunteers to fight in place of her younger sister.<br/><br/>To the movie's credit, there is bitter irony in the fact that the tributes are congratulated for being picked, that the sadistic woman with an accent called fighting an honour, that the whole games are called forgiveness of the rebellious districts just because there's a winner. Even if those districts rebelled, that doesn't justify executing 23 innocent kids every year after the war. As the movie conveys, the fact that people watch these games and enjoy them is fundamentally sick. This is a good concept. Adding to the sick factor is that we see some of these kids actually enjoy killing. A number of tributes team up to ambush a girl who made a fire- and then they laugh about it, mimicking her, saying ""Please don't kill me!"" Evil breeds evil.<br/><br/>But while some kids enjoyed killing so much, the idea of Katniss abstaining from killing except in defence is a little harder to swallow. Sounds suicidal to me; I didn't even think she grabbed a weapon until she took out a knife to drop a wasp's nest on other tributes. Not killing Rue is, however, quite understandable. The main weakness of the film is that suddenly allowing two winners breaks the film's own rules. Even if it were done, Peeta still should have died, killed by another player, by his injuries or by those poisonous berries at the end of the film. Letting both Katniss and Peeta live together happily ever after just feels unbelievable, a cheat. Overall, The Hunger Games is still a very decent movie: frightening, sardonic, and entertaining."
"agmoldham","7","1","5","22 April 2012"," Good film!
","I didn't really know anything about the Hunger Games before seeing it at the movies.<br/><br/>For others like me The Hunger Games is a fight to the death between representatives from the 12 districts in a future world. There are 2 contestants selected from each district and the winner is the last survivor. The story follows District 12's participant Katniss who volunteers to replace her sister Prim.<br/><br/>The film is interesting and engaging throughout and there's a definite influence from the Truman Show and Lord of the Flies amongst others. It certainly also leaves you with plenty to talk and think about afterwards. I found out that it was based on books and I enjoyed the film enough to make me go out and buy the trilogy. Hopefully the books will be as entertaining as the film!"
"lilbug_00","7","1","5","4 April 2012"," No More Camera Shake, please!
","All in all, The Hunger Games was a good movie. They did a good job of sticking to the book, though there were some minor details they left out, but it didn't change the story too much so I think it worked for the most part. And since the main character was also the narrator of the books and you never saw anything other than her point of view, I thought it was interesting how they showed the outside world when she was in the arena. However, since the books are in the first person narrative, the emotion of the story was not conveyed as well I it could have been, but how would someone convey that without a fully narrated movie, which would become irritating? The only thing I really disliked was the close-up, camera shake style that was used. You could barely make out what was going on in the fight scenes, or even some of the non-fight scenes because they did it this way. I understand that they wanted you to understand the fight or flight stuff. And it had to be kept PG-13 so the inability to really see the deaths and bloodiness was part of the reason for the style, but really too much shaking can sometimes induce nausea! Other than that, I think they did an awesome job with it! They kept to the book much better than some movies I have seen adapted from books. My only hope is that they do not continue the nauseating camera shake style for the rest of the series. There are better ways to show the action and emotion of a scene. Still, highly recommend The Hunger Games! Enjoy!"
"jenny_dios","7","1","5","30 March 2012"," Really Wanted to Like the Film
","I had just recently read the first book ""The Hunger Games"" so it was fresh in my memory when I went to see the Movie. I was really excited to see how the book would look on the Big Screen and how the Characters would come to life, but I was so disappointed. The Film completely lacked the emotion of the book. The book was amazing, I couldn't put it down. But The Movie just sped through everything not allowing you to feel connected with the story. I was not happy with the Directing Style, The shakiness of the Camera didn't add to the drama it just made it hard to see what was happening and didn't bring you into the situation at all. Production wise I really thought that they would captured the difference between the Capitol and the Districts but they both fell flat to me as well as the impression it should have made on Katniss and Peete seeing the luxury and seeing all the food that is not available to them in their District. There is no Character Development in the Film like in the book. You don't get the tension between Katniss and her mom, the Relationship between Katniss and Peete is something that you really route for in the book even in the end when he's hurt because he realizes she's not sure that she feels the same way and they put on the last show for the cameras, its heartbreaking but you don't get that in the Film. Even the moments of tension weren't as exciting. I believe they took out crucial characters Like the Mayor and his daughter who is the real reason Katniss has the Pin. Peete's Father who has a soft spot for Katniss, the Avox girl who had her tongue cut out for being a traitor (whose story would have added more mystery). Also the end when they are being chased by the wild dogs that can stand on their hind legs like humans and Katniss realizes that they are the dead tributes who have been mutated, these are all impactful moments in the book that really would have added impact to the film. It just surprises me because I know that the author was one of the Executive Producers, so I thought they would have stayed a little truer to the books. I love the actors with the exception of the Casting for Haymitch and Cinna, I don't feel like they delivered the characters in a believable way and they cut so much out from their stories that you don't really feel the connection between them and Katniss and Peete. I really hope that if they do the second book they ""up"" the Production Quality and really bring the book to life Character development and all."
"Vartiainen","Null","1","5","30 March 2012"," A good adaptation
","I personally enjoyed this one, both as a regular moviegoer and as a person who has read the book. In my opinion this is surprisingly faithful adaptation, which manages to capture the essence of the original story yet still managing to stand on its own. Is it helpful to have read the book before the movie? Yes, as with most adaptations, but the movie does a good job providing us the backstory and exposition. Not perfectly, mind you, but I don't think that many people will be confused by the plot.<br/><br/>That being said, the best part of this movie are the actors. It is rather rare to see a movie starring young adult actors, who are as talented as this bunch. Jennifer Lawrence especially shined as the main protagonist, Katniss Everdeen, managing to portray both her tough, survivalist attitude and her fear for her life. Easily the best performance in the film. Though I have to commend both Josh Hutcherson and Liam Hemsworth for their roles as Peeta Mellark and Gale Hawthorne, respectively.<br/><br/>The movie isn't without flaws, unfortunately. The biggest problem is the shaky cam that every reviewer is sure to mention. Rationally I can realize that it was used to maintain the rating, but it was still a bit annoying from time to time, though one grew used to it after a while. The other problem that I had with this movie was that while it is a faithful adaptation and a good story in its own right, there was that final spark that was missing. It's a good movie, but not something that I will surely see again in the future.<br/><br/>And that's this movie. It's good, but not great. Faithful to the source material and surely enjoyable to pretty much anyone, but not much more."
"goldwriting","6","1","5","30 March 2012"," The Next Bog Thing (But Does It Deserve It?)
","Out with the old (Potter and those shiny vampires), in with the new! The Hunger Games is the next in line of young adult adaptations steamrolling their way into the theaters, to the extreme delight and disappointment of fans of the books.<br/><br/>The arguments are eternal: Did it really capture the tone of the book? Did they get all the details right? Did that character actually look like that?<br/><br/>On and on they go, but really, the only question that should be asked is, did they make a good movie? In order to get that answer, let's move right ahead into the review and see what made it onto the big screen.<br/><br/>The Hunger Games is a dystopian tale of twelve outlying districts that must sacrifice one young boy and one young girl up to their capital every year to participate in a televised battle to the death. Katniss Everdeen volunteers herself in place of her younger sister and we follow her into battle, not only over the other ""tributes"", but also over the deadly pitfalls in the arena and the bloodthirsty nature of a society that allows these games to continue.<br/><br/>First off, this movie clocked in at just under two and a half hours, which is incredibly long for a teen flick. Even Harry Potter didn't dare create such a marathon until well into the franchise where they knew fans would eat up every minute of it. Also highlighting the length was the incredibly slow pacing. The experience was oddly reminiscent of seeing The Da Vinci Code, where the original book was an eye-popping page turner, but the on-screen rendition seemed to suck all the life out of it. The Hunger Games didn't quite starve itself into a cinematic coma, but there certainly was a momentum and energy missing in the translation.<br/><br/>As for the actors, Jennifer Lawrence was the prodigal choice and really brought much of that angst, conflict and fire-in-the-belly attitude Katniss needed to have. Josh Hutcherson also displayed a great deal of the heartfelt charm and inner strength that made Peeta such an easy character to root for in the books. Wes Bentley also gets a special mention for pulling off the expertly choreographed beard, but I missed a touch of the creepiness I expected from the Head Gamekeeper. Beyond that, everyone I felt did what they needed to do, but there weren't any stand out performances.<br/><br/>The story was there, the pages played out on-screen almost right off the page, but it felt like they tried too hard to capture everything from the book, making it overly long, yet dropped particular sections that would have better served the overall experience. In that regard, without going into too much detail, I'll point to the mutts and how disappointing that entire sequence was. The whole point of who and what they were was lost, making them nothing more than aggressive bulldogs.<br/><br/>Now there have been reviews buzzing around all weekend about this movie, so this will likely get swept away in the digital wind of the internet, but I must say this in closing. To those people who were upset because Rue and Thresh were cast as African-Americans, while Suzanne Collins didn't feel the need to spend a whole lot of time and energy repeatedly describing the races of her characters, those two were in fact written as ""dark skinned"", so the casting was not ""politically correct"", just correct. Secondly, to those people who went the step further to say that you felt less when they died because of that casting, yep, you guessed it, you're racist."

","This is not the sort of experience I want in a Friday night let's-wind- down-at-the-end-of-the-week movie. When I read the storyline, I thought ""That's sick"" but then I watched the lovely young actors in the trailer and thought this could be fun. It wasn't. It was grim, dark and unredemptive, a kind of Orwell meets The Truman Show. So much in the movie was sickening and offensive â€“ and disturbingly ironical. I was disgusted to see the hordes of gaudily painted adults crammed into the theatre waiting to be entertained by the killing of children, and realized uncomfortably part way through that this was exactly what I was doing. The juxtaposition of decadent opulence with abject poverty was obscene, yet it was nothing more than a true reflection of the extremes in our own real world. So please don't take your children if you're out for entertainment. The incidents of violence, though unpleasant, are nothing compared to two and a half hours of unrelenting dread and despair. You might on the other hand for a thoughtful discussion about the influence of media, reality TV and world economics, though if your family's anything like mine, their response is more likely to be ""Get over it Mum, it's just a movie"". There's no denying that this movie was a taster, an unfinished introduction to the series based on the books. Like it or not, I'm hooked - I can't wait to read them."
"phxphil","7","1","5","29 March 2012"," Good movie even if you haven't read the book
","Jennifer Lawrence is wonderfully attractive throughout, whether she is hunting, running, fighting, in a red dress or in competition clothes. Her husky but feminine voice is enthralling. She carries the movie. Even though she's not a classic beauty she has a certain look that attracts the eye. But there is plenty other talent to entertain as well. Not having read the book I was surprised at who wasn't chosen to go to the competition from her village. But as the story unfolds its understood that it's being set up for a sequel. The sets and the futuristic setting is a nice add to an old story line. Some reviews have said that the story doesn't pay homage to the village starvation that the book spoke to. I think it's pretty evident but it's not dwelling piece in the story. I got the point well enough and don't think it was necessary to emphasize it more. There could have been more character interaction during the training period to set up the bad relations between contestants during the contest. The time does fly and I would have never guessed it was over two hours long although I did have to bow to the Big Gulp in the later half of the movie. Dehydrate before you go."
"alex-harold","7","1","5","29 March 2012"," The Hunger Games is an entertaining movie, but it doesn't quite deliver.
","When I first heard that they were making a movie adaptation of Suzanne Collins's famous book, The Hunger Games, I was excited but cautious because I was worried they would focus less on the violence and cruelty of the games and more on Katniss and Peeta's relationship to preserve the PG-13 rating. Luckily it isn't that bad. <br/><br/>The Hunger Games came out at a good time. The Harry Potter movies are finished, and the Twilight series has only one movie left. If the Hunger Games is successful it could be the next big franchise. Fans of the series should be happy as it definitely has earned enough money for a sequel. It's far from the emotional, deep movie it could have been, but moviegoers will enjoy it as long as they don't expect anything sensational or new. <br/><br/>At the beginning of the movie the basics are explained through text and the movie starts. Katniss's skill with a bow is explained, her sister is picked at the reaping, Katniss takes her place, and Peeta and Katniss are off to the Capitol. That is basically all that happens in District 12. How poor and starving the people are is almost not even explained. <br/><br/>In the Arena fighting is edited to preserve the PG-13 rating. Most of the violence is barely shown. The ""bad"" guys are flat so no one cares when they die. Josh Hutcherson's Peeta comes off as weak and wimpy. The movie drags on a bit too long, and the ending is predictable. Katniss and Peeta's relationship is weak and poorly addressed. <br/><br/>The Hunger Games could have been worse, but that doesn't mean it's an amazing movie. Poor character development and flat characters hold it back from its potential. Hopefully the inevitable sequel will address these issues."
"dawnr470","8","1","5","29 March 2012"," Very good, but not great
","First of all, I will say that I'm a 42 yr old woman, and my daughter had to practically force me to read the books. But once I got started, I couldn't put them down! With that said, I went into the movie with high hopes and moderate expectations, and didn't really leave disappointed. The movie was very well done, and covered most of the really important parts of the book. And I've read several reviews where people have complained about Rue's death....I actually thought it was handled very well, and was very much in line with the book. However, there were some things that I think should/could have been better. <br/><br/>1) If you haven't read the books, you're probably going to leave confused. They didn't do a very good job of giving you the background story, and didn't really allow much time for the relationship between Gale and Katniss to be seen. 2) They totally screwed up how Katniss came to have the Mockingjay pin. I don't know why they did this, as anyone who has read the books knows that this is KIND OF important later on. 3) Nothing at all was mentioned about Katniss's mother's healing services or of the book that Katniss and her parents have. This is also kind of important later on, so I felt like they should have at least mentioned it. 4) I wish they would have spent more time developing the relationship between Katniss and Rue, to explain why she was so distraught when Rue was killed. They also didn't show Rue explaining to Katniss about the berries, which again, was kind of important. 5) Would have liked to see more of Cinna and his team. 6) They REALLY screwed up the muttations at the end.......what happened to them being engineered with the dead tributes features? <br/><br/>I did think the casting was very well done,and really liked how they showed more of the inner workings of the game center. They did a very good job showing the excess and lack of reality from the citizens in the Capital. And the violence was nothing at all like what I thought it would be. Yes, this is a dark film with dark subjects. It is NOT for tender hearted youngsters or adults who are too sensitive. But it DOES shed a grim light on the true conditions of our country as it is, and shows the dangers we face if we don't correct our course."
"jadepietro","7","1","5","28 March 2012"," Dinner is Served
","This film is recommended.<br/><br/>Our latest mega-blockbuster franchise was inspired from a 1987 sci-fi- film called The Running Man starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, loosely based on Stephen King's novel of the same name, which was inspired from Richard Connell's famous short story, The Most Dangerous Game, way back in 1924. Add in elements from The Wizard of Oz, The Truman Show, teen lit champ Twilight, and another classic American short story, Shirley Jackson's The Lottery, and you have The Hunger Games. No, there's no much originality left in Hollywood nowadays, but the money will be flying into the hands of the producers with this movie series. Hollywood still knows how to market and make an expensive film even more profitable and popular before its first screening. <br/><br/>Money has been lavished on this big screen adaptation from Suzanne Collins best-selling trilogy, from its strong production crew to its fine casting. ( The author even helped to co- wrote the script, along with Billy Ray, and the director of the film, Gary Ross, giving it her seal of approval. ) The Hunger Games stars young up-and-coming talents who have proved their mettle in other movies: Jennifer Lawrence as the strong-willed heroine Katniss, Josh Hutcherson as Peeta, her comrade-in-arms, and Liam Hemsworth as Gale. her best friend and confidant. Also bringing a modicum of class to this project, in showier supporting roles, are a perfectly smarmy Stanley Tucci (Caesar Flickerman), Elizabeth Banks (Effie Trinket), Wes Bentley (Seneca Crane), Woody Harrelson (Haymitch Abernathy) at his cynical best, and an underused Toby Jones (Claudius Templesmith).<br/><br/>The simplistic story goes somewhat like this: It is the future. And, as we all know from past films of this genre, it's bleak. Global change is evident with drought, famine, and war the main causes. North America, now known as Panem, is made up of 12 districts where the 99% exist, and the Capitol, where the wealthy 1% live. Every year, there is a lottery where 24 teenagers from all the poorer districts, in teams of 2, are chosen to become part of a live reality game show like Survivor, only this time, it's real survival. One by one, these ""tributes"" are eliminated until the champion is crowned. It's Gladiator games with mandatory viewing, televised for all the citizens of Panem ( and us ) to see. <br/><br/>What makes The Hunger Game fun to watch is that it successfully captures the satirical edge of present-day America's obscene fascination with reality shows and competitions, blending its sci-fi mentality and teenage romance angst with a relevant social message of our insatiable ""hunger"" for popular entertainment at all costs. Sure. it's an easy target to ridicule, but it works in an uncomplicated way.<br/><br/>The story itself is pure action and only works on a visceral level. There is no true dramatic tug, no genuine emotion invested in the characters. Most of the teenage characters in peril do not resemble anything remotely real. They never go beyond the limitation of their stereotypical roles as pawns in the game of life vs. death ( the bloodthirsty jock, the mean girl, the innocent young waif, etc. ). <br/><br/>Katniss, our noble protagonist, is portrayed as a young girl victimized by a cruel totalitarian society who sacrifices her own life to save her younger sister who was the actual Chosen One. She has all the heroic traits necessary to succeed: she's pretty and courageous, smart and strong-minded, agile and able to shoot a mean bow and arrow. Plus, she only kills in self- defense. A born leader and ultimate fighter, she's at the top at the food chain and the perfect role model for the tween set. Jennifer Lawrence shows the many sides of Katniss, all of her the spunk and savviness, and also subtly displaying her vulnerability and fear. Her casting is pivotal to the film's success in making Katniss such a sympathetic and likable character. <br/><br/>Just as the tributes are manipulated by outside political forces, so is the movie audience controlled by its filmmakers. They have created a fine, if somewhat conventional, adaptation from an immensely popular novel. ( Loyal readers will not be disappointed in this version. ) Violence and gore are kept to a minimum to safeguard and assure that this PG-13 rated film reaches its targeted audience and the film is efficiently directed by Ross, although I wish he would have spent the extra $50 fora sturdy tripod to compensate for the overwrought shaky hand-held camera-work. <br/><br/>The Hunger Games is diverting entertainment, a well-made film for assorted tastes, with enough satisfaction provided for mass consumption.

"BigRichAU","7","1","5","26 March 2012"," Bring your own context
","I read these books with my two pre-teen sons. We all found them exciting, frightening, involving and above all, thought-provoking. I took them to see the movie without desperately high hopes because I usually find films of books I enjoy to be unrewarding or even just boring.<br/><br/>Instead I found myself drawn in to the film. I thought the production - in particular the camera-work that has been criticized by many - was excellent in the way it drew me in to the scene, to the chaos, panic and fear that surrounds so many of the characters.<br/><br/>As the film moved on, I became aware that there were points where other audience members were laughing - points that I found very serious or moving - and I began to realise that maybe as a movie in its own right it wasn't quite hitting the mark. Because I already know the characters and what moves them I was seeing things that weren't really there.<br/><br/>After the film finished, this feeling continued to nag at me. Taken on the surface (as many media writers have done) this is a brutal film about children killing other children. Only once you are immersed in the characters and situations as they are drawn in the books does the real meaning of the stories become apparent - the themes of love, the corrupting influence of power, the bonds of family and so on. I felt comfortable reading the books to my kids because we could talk about these themes and see that the event of the Hunger Games is really just a device to explore them. I don't think the film really gives you that picture.<br/><br/>In the end, I think Hunger Games is a good, faithful rendering of the storyline of the book and I really enjoyed it, but it fails paint the characters and the situation as well as it could. The unfortunate result of this is that it risks becoming the very thing it aims to criticize - a bloody circus."

","Thought it was good. My kids (boys 9 and 10) enjoyed it as well. Action kept it moving along but in the end it felt like it was all setup for a series. Lots of focus on the main character and it did well enough to explain her background in the mining district 12. She's a very like-able character, but really the only one that gets any development of any sort. The action itself isn't overly gory, although it does take a level of understanding from the kids that children are going to die. I did not think they did enough to explain *what* was evil to warrant killing children in the plot. In the end, the plot is about survival and the kids got that. I left myself wishing we could just see the next two chapters at the same time so that there was some sort of conclusion."

","OK so I'm going to start this review of by saying I had no clue what this movie was base on. After seeing a few previews months before its opening date, I felt it was going to be a different type of movie. One that we have not had in a good time. Now after I make my mind up on if or if not i will go see any movie I stop looking at previews and I do not look at the cast and crew. I feel it takes away from any surprise the film makers may have install for viewers. So now fast forward opening day I go online at 7am to check show times and they are sold out off all times in pretty much any place it was showing in manhattan, mind you it's 7am and I'm looking for tickets for 10 that day and there's nothing. So now I check for the next day witch is a Saturday all sold out up to 9:50 pm . Bam I buy 2 tickets for me and the lady, fast forward I get to the movies 2 hours before the movie starts to get good seats. I'm told to come back 45 min before the show starts because that's when they will start to let people in, I come back and hour later not 45 min and they let me I and there's almost 45 people in line, OK now I'm freakimg mad, but I did end up getting good seats for us. So now the Movie is about to start and yes there's people that can't just stop talking as always. 1st few minor the movie I really liked. They way they made her and everything look was very good. Jennifer played a great roll very strong but yet not over strong, Wes also played a good roll, wasn't to over powering so it rolled into her performance pretty good. The move effects were not as good as good as I felt they could have been. I mean it is after a book I would hope it will have everything it should have to hope top off good actors. I felt there was a lil time where the movie was dragging along and as it got to the end I also felt it was a short and not as good of one to over way the beginning witch as I said was pretty dorn good. So my review is its good enough to go see it you never read the book. If you did read the book maybe ull love it or maybe ull feel it's not as the book is and won't. But no matter if u have read the book or not ull walk out saying it was good at lest."

","""Ssssoooo iffffff IIIIIIIII writttte likkkkkke thisssssss"" does it make my writing any better? Director Gary Ross seems to think a shaky camera image is the way to go for half the scenes in the movie. Yes it seems to be the fad in movies today to give this ""natural"" shaky camera look, but I found my self having to look away. I found it very distracting and not enjoyable. The plot, which I always say is the most important, was based on the popular series of books, was just OK. The heroes made it through, but there weren't any real unexpected twists and this movie wasn't dialogue heavy, it relied upon the action scenes. I would have liked to have seen more development of the story, however this does leaves room for a prequel. The acting was fine, and Jennifer Lawrence played a very convincing lead role which showed the strength and vulnerability of her character. I enjoyed the movie overall, but I won't watch it again. The shaky camera is a real pet peeve of mine. Of course watch this if you have read the books. Warning, the ruthless killing of children even though crucial to the plot gives it the pg 13 rating and I would advise parents not to have their young children watch."

","I won advanced tickets and saw the movie on Wednesday. I think the tributes made the games feel like a joke. They seemed to happy and laughed to much when they were chasing after Katniss. Katniss's relationship with Rue wasn't explained and they didn't even mention District 13. Another thing was Buttercup wasn't orange, he was black & white. Is it really that hard to find an ugly orange cat?! Both Prim's and Peeta's eyes were brown, not blue like they were said to have been. And the Cornucopia wasn't gold,honestly the built it themselves, they could have painted it at least. There were so many ways they could have made it seem more like the book. The movie wasn't nearly as deep as the book. There was no near-death of Peeta or near dehydration of Katniss. But the capitol was almost spot- on. But I was wondering where Octavia & the rest of the prep-team was! The acting was amazing, but Jennifer Lawrence just seemed a little bit to old to play Katniss. But, I guess maturity comes young when your starving to death."

","As a Book Reader I gotta say Well Done 'cause even though I knew what it was all about it was still pretty exiting. The Cast was very good ... Although D. Sutherland wasn't as scary as president snow was described, he was far from the book character. Besides all that I have to say the pictures in the beginning were extremely shaky and unsteady and that was really irritating. You couldn't see right because of the flash of shaking pictures. Without it the Movie would've been perfect but it was still brilliant and compared to other Book based Movies it's been really close to the book. Might be because Collins contributed to the screenplay. Even the added parts fitted perfectly in to the story and made it even better. So All in All a very good Movie"
"ssiebels","9","2","16","24 March 2012"," An Excellent Adaptation
","I saw this movie with my thirteen year old son, who had not read the books, though I'd read all three. I'm a middle school Language Arts teacher, so for some time it has been hard to ignore this series. I enjoyed the books, and looked forward to this movie.<br/><br/>The reviewer who said he reacted badly initially to Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss had obviously not seen her in ""Winter Bone"" - odd since she was nominated for best actress for the role. The reviewer said Lawrence wasn't ""hungry"" enough, or gritty and poor, I guess, though she was fantastic as a rural Ozarks teenager with a drug dealing father and abusive family, caring for her siblings and a catatonic mother in a two-room shack. Go figure.<br/><br/>I thought ""The Hunger Games"" was a terrific adaptation. The cast was outstanding - Harrelson was perfect as Haymitch and the actors for the two male love interests were just right. There were minor differences with the book, but that always happens as you try to make a 2 hour plus movie out of a novel. Katniss' backpack was supposed to be orange, she was supposed to go last when the judges were rating the Tributes, Katniss and Peeta's scene on the eve of the Games was supposed to be on the roof... but none of that really matters. For me, the director brought the book to life almost perfectly. I loved it, and judging from the absenteeism in my classes on Friday (students who went to the midnight premiere the night before) this movie will do very well."
"fermata125","8","2","16","23 March 2012"," Excellent, excellent work.
","I loved these books, and I positively love the film version as well. Everything was almost just as I had pictured it, and the acting was superb across the board--JL especially. The violence was depicted tastefully but still indicated the brutality of the Games and the sadistic nature of the Capitol. Donald Sutherland and Wes Bentley were also great in their roles as Snow and Seneca Crane. Some highlights for me:<br/><br/>(SPOILERS AHEAD)<br/><br/>-JL portrayed Katniss flawlessly. Now I can never picture anyone else but her playing Katniss- -her emotion, body language, voice, everything is spot-on. They couldn't have picked a better actress.<br/><br/>-Josh Hutcherson was actually quite great as Peeta. I liked how they made him less lover- boy-esque in the film, and I liked his portrayal of the character better than I liked reading about Peeta in the book.<br/><br/>-Harrelson as Haymitch: hilarious. Also spot-on. Same goes for Banks as Effie.<br/><br/>-Tributes: The ones who stand out are Cato (Ludwig) and Clove (Fuhrman). Ludwig nailed the brutality of Cato's character, while still managing to somehow make the audience feel sympathetic toward him before he meets his end. Fuhrman's Clove comes across as a psychotic and malicious killing machine, which really comes to a head at the Feast scene (my favorite part of the film). All of Clove's raw hatred for Katniss was really perfectly portrayed, and her pleasure in killing was illustrated at numerous points throughout the film.<br/><br/>-Too bad Glimmer (Leven Rambin) didn't get more screen time--her death scene was very well-acted on her part. Tracker Jackers looked great.<br/><br/>-Rue (Stenberg) was gorgeous and perfect. Her big scene was extremely emotional and portrayed with spot-on accuracy as to what I felt while reading the book. Also wished for more screen time from her, but what little screen time she does get she absolutely nails. <br/><br/>-Foxface (Emerson) was so intriguing. Just like the book, I wish we could have known more about her, but it definitely portrayed the fact that she was a genius and very light on her feet.<br/><br/>-Thresh (Okeniyi) made a bigger impact on me than expected. His scene at the Feast was very intense and I loved the passion he put into the character, especially when it came to avenging Rue. <br/><br/>-Pre-Arena stuff was so exciting; you could feel the anticipation leading up to the Games. It was kind of fun to watch (like all the interviews and the chariot rides), but an unavoidable sense of dread filled the entire sequence. It felt like watching a roller coaster that could go off its tracks at any second.<br/><br/>-Arena stuff was great. Shaky-cam effects blunted some of the violence, but added to the feeling of desperation throughout. Opening bloodbath was spectacular, but unusual in its execution (not a bad thing). Feast was amazing, and Muttations were surprisingly thrilling to watch.<br/><br/>-Music was phenomenal; not much to be said there. JNH at his best.<br/><br/>I'm no film critic (obviously) so these are just my personal observations. I did notice some areas where the moral of the story could have been made even clearer, but these were few and far-between. <br/><br/>My only disappointment is that feeling you get when you've been looking forward to something for a very long time, and then it happens and it's over--and you feel kind of empty. It's not a disappointment with the film itself--I just loved the pre-film excitement, waiting process, cast interviews, etc., and I feel like I now have nothing to check for updates consistently! But I suppose a feeling like this just stands as a testament to what an excellent job the company has done in preparing, advertising, and promoting the film. I will truly miss the excitement I had building up for this movie--it was well-deserved, and I cannot wait to get onto the pre-movie-hype bandwagon for Catching Fire.<br/><br/>As a fan of the books and as a fan of thought-provoking films, though, I would highly recommend this movie to anybody. It really makes you think, and though the message could have been made even more explicit, it's clear what the film is trying to say about society and morality. Gary Ross has done an excellent job and I'm sure the sequels won't disappoint. <br/><br/>9/10"
"DavidTL","9","2","16","22 March 2012"," The Hunger for More Games
","For once a film that not only lives up to the trailer and hype, but actually surpasses it. The pacing for the film is excellent, especially for its run time of 142 minutes. The performances from Jennifer Lawrence (WINTER'S BONE, X-Men: First Class) and Josh Hutcherson (Journey to the Center of the Earth, The Kids Are Alright) were great and gave the characters of Katniss and Peeta so much depth and memorability. The directing is great and even though the camera work was a little too shaky at times, it made the violent scenes more dramatic and horrific. Not only was the film thrilling, but it is also the only film I've seen where no one in the screen spoke a word. The film didn't just engage my attention, but everyone else's too. With fast intense, edge-of-your-seat action and an emotionally filled script makes ""The Hunger Games"" a captivating action drama thriller. If you enjoyed the trailer, you will definitely enjoy the film. 9/10"
"user-153-969934","10","2","17","23 March 2012"," AMAZING!!!! (may contain spoilers)
","At first I thought...wow that was terrible but I realized this book is mostly Katniss thinking to herself about the games. Then I realized they had two options put a narrator(it would kill the movie), or cut it out(better idea). I love how they actually take scenes word for word and it was really interesting to see how The Hunger Games was put on screen, and I was pleased I watched the midnight premiere which was sooo fun. I loved how they had every character just like Suzanne Collins described them. There were scenes that could've been changed such as Katniss finding like no water, but thats OK they can't include every little detail from the book. I really liked how they showed Gale when Peeta and Katniss kiss I was like awwwww, I felt so bad Liam Hemsworth Is soo hot but Josh Hutcherson is pretty good looking. I'm a die heart fan of the books but the book is always better but I think they did the best they could which is all I care about because like it didn't turn out like Harry Potter and it didn't turn out like Twilight(THANK GOD!). I loved how they followed the thing the girl on fire and when Katniss twirled for Caesar I was like OMG they followed the book. They had the main points and they captured basically the whole book they captured more than I expected.. people are probably bed reviews because they had hoped every last detail in the book would be in there and if they were going to do that we might as well be still in the movies still watching for 12am. BY FAR THE BEST MOVIE YET! GO TEAM GALE!!!!"
"davenport-lorna","9","2","17","23 March 2012"," In a word: Perfect. (Containa spoilers...)
","My favourite scene in The Hunger Games was the Tracker Jacker scene. The interaction between Jennifer Lawrence and Amandla Stenberg was fairly accurate and the venom/hallucination sequence was filmed superbly well.<br/><br/>To review the film, I would give it a 9/10, purely because of my love for the books and because of the slight details they missed out here and there. There was a few lines from the book that I was hoping would be kept in and they weren't e.g. ""You've got as much charm as a dead slug.""<br/><br/>However, I think the additions into the movie were cleverly thought out and actually added to the overall quality of The Hunger Games. As much as I adore the books, Suzanne Collins perfectly depicts everything from Katniss' POV and as a reader, I always wondered what the reactions from the spectators would be as well as everything behind the scenes/construction of the games, so I was deeply impressed by all of those things.<br/><br/>I will also say that, after months of wondering and hoping, the (short) inclusion of Buttercup made my day! Although it's a shame we can't hear Katniss' inner monologue about their turbulent tolerance for one another, Jennifer's delivery of the line ""I can still cook you"" perfectly shows off part of the books that the fans know and love.<br/><br/>I was initially sceptical about the casting of both Jennifer and Josh as Katniss and Peeta, simply because I was afraid of how they would portray such iconic characters. After watching the film (and booking my ticket to watch in a second time tonight) I can safely say that the cannon has sounded to mark the death of all my doubts. Jennifer's portrayal of Katniss is very accurate to the book, despite us not really seeing the inner turmoil that plays out in Katniss' mind.<br/><br/>The only faults I have with this film are that I miss certain scenes/moments from the book that were not included/developed, but I can see why those decisions were made. For a fan who has read all the trilogy and been a fan for a very long time before the announcement of a movie, and for a fan of other books-turned-films e.g. Harry Potter, Twilight, A Series of Unfortunate Events, Inkheart etc, I cannot compare this trilogy to the previously mentioned books, because they are in an entirely different league. I can honestly say that I have NEVER seen a better book to film translation than I have witnessed with The Hunger Games.<br/><br/>To conclude, I watched this film last night with a variety of people (some who had read the books and some who hadn't) and we all left saying the same thing - that the film was amazing. For those who hadn't read the book, they are going out to buy and to read them because they enjoyed it so much. It's safe to say that fire is most definitely catching!"
"Bluepig112","9","2","17","23 March 2012"," True to the Book (Pretty Much)
","It's tough to translate a book into a movie, but I think this is probably one of the best I've ever seen. I don't like going to a movie and having it be very different from the book- this isn't like that. For the most part it stays true to the book, which readers are going to appreciate.<br/><br/>I was not convinced that Woody Harrelson was going to work as Haymitch. He turned out to be excellent! When I read the book I pictured someone older, but Harrelson makes this work and was the highlight of all the scenes he was in. Elizabeth Banks IS Effie Trinket. She is EXACTLY as you picture her when reading and does an excellent job of bring Effie to life. Jennifer Lawrence does a great job as Katniss. I'll admit, I had my doubts about her, too. She brings Katniss to life and her performance is better than I ever imagined. But it is Stanley Tucci who steals the show. His portrayal of Caesar Flickerman is spot on (except for the blue skin which is in the book!). Both Harrelson and Tucci got many laughs from the audience. The way Tucci smiles that crazy smile makes him endearing even though the audience should really hate him (considering what his job actually is). <br/><br/>The only part that I'm not convinced about is Josh Hutcherson as Peeta. He played the part well, but it's not an award winning performance and I think it's kind of flat. Teenage girls will not care about that at all and I can already see a Team Peeta and Team Gale war breaking out. :) <br/><br/>My biggest complaint about the film is the cinematography. I understand the effect the director was going for, but at times the picture was so shaky it literally hurt my eyes and I couldn't focus on anything. I did not care for that at all and it detracted from the film in a big way (other people were complaining about it at the theater). <br/><br/>Overall this was an excellent rendition of the book and I think it was very well acted and scripted."
"jay10536","10","2","17","23 March 2012"," Lawrence and crew hit the bullseye (no pun intended)
","Oh my goodness. I just got home from the midnight premiere of this wonderful, magnificent film. To say that I had a good time would be an understatement. As a die hard fan of the books, seeing everything that I read being translated onto the big screen. Every actor portrayed their character as though they were their character, and you could tell that they really knew their roles. The futuristic world of Panem felt very realistic and I couldn't help but feel as though I were living in the harsh country. The Capitol scenes were very well done, and each scene showed how much better they got it than the Districts. The added interviews explaining the games were very helpful to newcomers of this epic trilogy. May the odds be ever in your favor that you will enjoy this movie, which I guarantee will not be a difficult task."
"sanetten","9","2","18","23 March 2012"," The world should be watching....
","The story centers on Katniss, a girl from a poor district, who by a cruel twist of fate, must fight for her life as a tribute in an arena against 23 other children for the viewer's entertainment. The film, directed by Gary Ross, has a startling good cast with Jennifer Lawrence playing Katniss, Josh Hutcherson as the almost love interest, as well as Elizabeth Banks, as the Spectacular Effy Trinket (Style Icon of Capitol Couture) and Stanley Tucci as the fabulous talk show host, Caesar Flickerman. The whole cast has a certain chemistry that you can't help being swept up within the world of Panem.<br/><br/>Enjoyable as a whole, The Hunger Games offers so much more then a glorified survivor film. Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss embodies bravery, strength and the need to fight for what you believe in. She shows the importance of family and shows that even in the harshest situations there is a way for good to triumph evil. While I wouldn't recommend this movie for young kids because of the somewhat brutal killings, I would encourage all people to watch it and consider the comments it makes about our society today.<br/><br/>Fans of the books will not be disappointed with the portrayal of Panem and will adore the sights of the Capitol and the wonder of the arena. From the ridiculous outfits of the Citizens with bright colors and fake eyelashes, to the amazing technology they have in the Game room with their 3d maps and touch screen abilities, you will wish you could be a part of Suzanne Collins' World.<br/><br/>Perhaps the only let down of the movie was what they had to leave out. Although it runs for 142 minutes, it still feels rushed. This may add to the films adrenalin-pumping feel but at times you wish they would slow down and include your favorite book scene.<br/><br/>So should you see it? Definitely yes. Regardless of whether you have read the book or not, it provides an entertaining escape into a world that isn't too far removed from ours, keeping you on the very edge of your seat. So may the odds be ever in your favor and enjoy the movie."
"ajaws4ever","10","2","18","23 March 2012"," The most faithful book-to-screen I have ever seen!!
","Just came back from a midnight premiere, and I must say I was rather impressed. Normally, when my expectations are very high (as they were with this one), I tend to get disappointed. This film struck me with that rare instance of satisfaction. This knocks the first Harry Potter out of the water, and needless to say it tops Twilight by a million miles. I was actually a fan of the hand-held shots, even though most hated them. I thought they added a sense of realism. I will admit though, that the hand-held shots during the action sequences blurred out some stuff and made it hard to see what was going on, but I'm sure that was necessary to hold the PG-13 rating.<br/><br/>Speaking of which, the film was actually quite violent for its rating. Yet, at the same time, it still could've been more violent. Not necessarily more gory, but I would've liked it to feel more gritty and raw. It didn't quite capture the intensity and peril from the book.<br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson both did FANTASTIC with their roles. Excellent acting from each. Donald Sutherland (Snow) was a wonder to watch as well. Elizabeth Banks (Effie) and Woody Harrelson (Haymitch), also did a wonderful job, bring some comic relief at times. Stanley Tucci (Caesar Flickerman) and Wes Bentley (Seneca) were also well acted. The rest however... let's just say their performances were average, and I wish some tributes had more screen time, damn it!<br/><br/>My main complaint, though, is the sheer lack of character development. The reason why this film will probably only get an average rating of 6 out of 10, is because the people who haven't read the book will NOT connect with Gale, or Rue, or Katniss and Peeta's relationship. They won't have any idea what is going on, and they won't feel any sympathy for certain characters' deaths.<br/><br/>But, all in all, this film and the next two (or three) are in good hands. Apart from a few minor things I would have liked to see get incorporated into the film, this is as close to perfect as a book adaptation gets.<br/><br/>9/10"

","Alright, so I've been anticipating the release of The Hunger Games for quite a while now. I've read the book and am currently half-way through Catching Fire. I must admit, my expectations grew higher and higher every-time I read a positive review on this movie, and, unlike many other movies I had been highly anticipating, I can happily say it delivered on all fronts. I saw the movie yesterday (Thursday) and I loved it. Whilst I took all the negative criticism thrown at the movie into consideration, most of that is nit-picking and no one should expect a movie to be exactly like the book. <br/><br/>What you get in The Hunger Games is an amazing story, lots of suspense, a small sub-plot (that being love) and most of all, terrific acting. The movie is great, Jennifer Lawrence was perfect as Katniss, and frankly I don't think any other actress could have taken the roll of Katniss as well as Jennifer did. Everyone's acting was sublime and it came together so well.<br/><br/>Whilst I had a few moments in which I was thinking 'why did they leave that out?' That did not take away from the overall experience and you can tell this movie has been made with love and care, and when Suzanne Collin's (the books writer) co-wrote the screen-play for the movie, you can expect it to be good. I'm not one to sway anyones opinions, but this movie has really proved to be on a ground of it's own and can really take the helm as being another big blockbuster franchise. <br/><br/>Bring on Catching Fire!"

","I can't believe so many people have such a negative opinion of this movie! I've read the entire Hunger Games series and despite the differences between the book and the film, I was not disappointed.<br/><br/>I'm not saying it's a perfect film. I would have preferred it if they had used the dead tributes as the mutants near the end like they did in the book, instead of just creating them out of nowhere. In the book that really helped demonstrate the monstrosity of President Snow and the Capitol. However despite its flaws, seeing so much negativity for this film is rather upsetting.<br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence is one of the most talented actresses I've ever seen, and one of the few who can back up her striking good looks with real acting skill. The irony is that Katniss Everdeen is a lousy actress. Jennifer Lawrence is a wonderful actress playing a bad one. Off the top of my head, I can think of only three other actresses in Jennifer's generation who are both exceptionally beautiful and incredibly talented and they are Jenna Coleman, Anna Passey and Emily VanCamp. Saoirse Ronan could also be included but I don't find her as physically attractive as the others.<br/><br/>Josh Hutcherson, Willow Shields and Woody Harrelson did great jobs as Peeta, Prim and Haymitch. Donald Sutherland was also horribly evil as President Snow, but in this film he was more of a side character than a main antagonist, so you can't really appreciate and despise him as much as you can in the sequels. If anything it was Cato, played by Alexanda Ludwig, who filled the role as main antagonist and his little speech just before his death made him more interesting than the mindless brute he was portrayed as in the book. Despite some great performances from the majority of the cast, it was Jennifer Lawrence who stole the show.<br/><br/>Overall this was a great start to the Hunger Games movie franchise and people who don't like it can... I won't finish that sentence but I think you get the idea."

Involving 2 children from each of this future society's districts who must compete in a cruel televised tournament in which the 24 lottery ""winners"" fight to the death for the entertainment of the masses. Yup I always knew reality TV was evil and this is where its headed.<br/><br/>The second time was the charm with this movie for me because I enjoyed it way more when I caught it on TV the other night then I did the first time around. Not exactly sure why or what changed for me except that it's now been a few years since I read (and loved) the book so I wasn't as busy comparing the two. The movie still dragged a bit in the middle for me and Katniss spent way too much time hanging out in trees but ultimately I was entertained throughout.<br/><br/>Great casting in Jennifer Lawrence, Josh Hutcherson and Liam Hemsworth, well everyone really; I liked Woody Harrelson & Elizabeth Banks, Stanley Tucci & Donald Sutherland.<br/><br/>They also did a good job of recreating the world that Suzanne Collins had created in her book (Capital city, all the crazy makeup, girl on fire costume) and explaining what the hell was going on in this post apocalyptic society, which couldn't have been easy.

","""May the odds be ever in your favor"", that's the sentence along which 24 children, the tributes, are sent into an arena to fight each other. The purpose is to remind the country of a rebellion 74 years ago. Each year, each district has to be represented by one randomly picked boy and girl from their district. That's the pervert concept of the capital of the country: ""Panem"" which is named ""capitol"". The whole science-fiction-film ""Hunger Games"" directed by Garry Ross, is based on the book written by Suzanne Collins. It tells the story about the main character Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) whose sister was elected for the deadly games. Because of that, Katniss volunteers instead of her sister. That's where the tragic story of Katniss having to fight in the arena begins. The two tributes, Katniss and Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) are accompanied by their mentor Haymitch Abernathy (Woody Harrelson) and their contact person in the capitol Effie Trinket (Elizabeth Banks). The introduction of the characters is well done and also the actors can transfer their fears before and during the games. The peak of the movie is well installed and even though the films' length is about two and a half hour it doesn't get boring and keeps on making you want to know what's next. You can even watch it more than once and it doesn't get boring. It keeps on frightening, surprising you and makes you hope for the tributes and even want to help them. During the film and especially during the games there are a lot of violent scenes, even against children. It is questionable if the FSK 12 rating isn't too low but by reading the book you would have expected a lot more violence shown. All characters are well played, the carreers are as brave and frightening as they need to be, the normal tributes can make you identify with them and are piteous, the mentors are exactly like in the book and during the movie their very special individualities make sense and you'll get to like them; especially President Snow (Donald Sutherland) is like you would imagine him if you read the book. In summary it is a well action packed, moody and exciting movie with a complicated love story, for which the two and a half hours are worth sitting in the cinema (especially in 3d). I wouldn't recommend it to younger people because of the strong violence used, but if you have no problem seeing such things on TV then I can think of no reason why you shouldn't watch it."

Every year, Panem organizes the Hunger games, a ritual which shall remind the people of war and to show them that the Capitol of Panem has got the control. For this, they elect two teenagers from each district, one which is the richest, and 12 that is the poorest, who have to fight against each other. There is only one winner who will get honor and a lot of money. Katniss is living in District 12. She lives in extreme poverty. Her relationship to her mother is not really good, but she loves her sister. Because of her father's death, she has to take the role of the man in her family. She is hunting nearly every day and is very well trained with the bow. To save her sister from getting killed in the games, she volunteers as tribute. Together with Peeta Melark, she travels to the Capitol, where they get trained and presented to the sponsors, who are very necessary to win the games and can save your life. Peeta and her know each other. His family has a bakery. He did not treat Katniss well and she hates him at first. But they pass much time together and get to know each other.Their relationship is getting very wired. Will they have a happy ending together? I really like the movie because there are so many different feelings in it. It is exciting, sometimes brutal, long but never boring and even a love story. The main character Katniss is well chosen. She is a girl who has got nothing except of her best friend Gale, played by Liam Hemsworth, and her little sister, for whom she is even ready to lose her life. The movie has got a great statement. You can do everything as long as you believe in it."

","""I volunteer as tribute!"". With these words a huge adventure begins for Peeta and Katniss who are the main characters. In Panem the fictional state in which the movie takes place everything changes for Katniss and Peeta as they take part in the Hunger Games, where tragically only one can survive. You never want to leave the cinema, even after 180 length. In this blockbuster, Katniss volunteers as a tribute so that her sister doesn't need to take part in the brutal, inhuman games. She and another tribute from her district try to survive and come back alive which seems impossible. In my opinion this movie definitely deserves 11 of 10 stars ;). As soon as ""The Hunger Games"" film starts, the tension, happiness, sadness, and many more feelings don't stop for one single second. It's the most amazing movie in this decade. And if you have seen other good movies like Avatar, you know that this means a lot. I simply cannot deny that this fantastic dystopian horror thriller is a piece of art. It even has a heartwarming love story in it with one of the greatest actors of our time, Jennifer Lawrence. But I have to warn you that you will lose a lot of money because you are probably going to see the movie at least once a day in the cinema."
"classicsoncall","8","1","6","1 March 2015"," ""And may the odds be ever in your favor.""
","Starting out, I'm not part of the target audience for this film so I approach it without knowing anything about it or having read the books on which the movie was based. There's obviously a political/social commentary being offered here in it's depiction of conflict between the haves and the have-nots. Had the principal characters been adults doing battle as representative champions of their districts, I think I would have been better satisfied. However the idea of kids killing each other for the entertainment of the masses speaks more to the hypocrisy of the American left and the liberal film industry than it does for telling a legitimate story. While promoting the legislation of strict gun control laws the same folks would argue that entertainment like this (if that's what we want to call it) does not in any way contribute to an increase in violence in the culture. Flash mobs anyone? <br/><br/>So with that out of the way I guess the rest is kind of moot for me. The film held my attention well enough but I had to call into question the motivations of the players once the Game got under way. Personally, I'd be wary of forming alliances with other gamers once I knew the objective was for them to kill me at some point. And the idea that the game controllers could take an active part in targeting players and change the rules back and forth took it's toll on this viewer after a while.<br/><br/>So maybe there was a point I missed in the set up to the story. What intrigued me more were the 'adult' concepts offered by President Snow (Donald Sutherland) when he warns Seneca Crane (Wes Bentley) on the direction the Game is taking - 'Hope is the only thing stronger than Fear; a little is effective, a lot is dangerous'. Perhaps the sequels deal with this idea more effectively. I'll try to get to them in due time."
"Sissy111","Null","1","6","29 December 2014"," Awesome!
","A great ride of a movie that captures Suzanne Collins' brilliant novel. It is a great science fiction picture because of its pacing, cast, and portrayal of a nation that governs its people through fear and fascism. The movie shows a society that has collapsed. While the average person fights for survival, the top class and government can basically do whatever they want. Included in this is a barbaric cultural show, The Hunger Games a bit like Celebrity Jungle mixed with American Idol, but the losers die. It makes you feel emotion for every person who is on the ""good"" side, and creates an atmosphere unlike anything you have ever seen. Jennifer Lawrence is totally awesome. Emotion runs on high through the movie and I was on the edge of my seat the entire way through. I'm glad I watched it and I can't wait to see the sequels, second and third Hunger Games."
"williampsamuel","8","1","6","7 December 2014"," Far above its YA fiction competitors, Hunger Games is a strong start to a much anticipated trilogy
","I should begin by saying I have never read any of the Hunger Games books, and given the number of other books that I'm currently required to read, I don't know if I will for quite a while. But after watching the first film adaptation, I very much want to, because they always say the book is better than the movie, and it would have to be a very good book to be better than this.<br/><br/>The story, which is surely familiar to most Americans of a certain age, is that in a distant future the people of North America rebelled against their government. The revolt was suppressed, and decades later the rebellious states, or districts, are governed as impoverished police states while the chosen few in the capitol enjoy every modern luxury. And to further punish rebellion and instill fear, every year each district must offer up one young man and one young woman as 'tributes' for the Hunger Games; a latter day gladiatorial competition that is also the entertainment event of the year throughout the land.<br/><br/>Most of these 'tributes' are chosen by lottery. Others volunteer, either because they've been trained for it from an early age, or so that someone close to them won't have to. Katniss Everdeen is one of the latter. She volunteered to enter the competition after her much younger sister was chosen. As an older teen and experienced hunter, she'll have better chances than most, but the odds are certainly not ""Ever in her favor."" Her male counterpart is Peeta, a local boy who is roughly the same age but has only a fraction of her skills. If they win they'll be treated as heroes. If they die, they're just two more victims.<br/><br/>This movie is extremely violent for a film based on a youth novel. But the violence is anything but casual or gratuitous. It stops well short of being as brutal as it could be; this is after all a PG-13 movie. But neither is it something that happens and is quickly passed over, nor are the deaths of Katniss and Peeta's rivals cause for celebration. Because really there are no 'bad guys', or at least they're not the ones fighting. The young people in the games, even the most ruthless and seemingly callous, are fighting and killing because they have to. They're not fighting to win a war, or for riches, or out of hatred for the other contestants. They're fighting because a tyrannical government makes them, and if they don't kill they will die.<br/><br/>Consequently many of the fight scenes are less like the Matrix or Lord of the Rings than Fight Club. They aren't stunningly choreographed showdowns between skilled combatants, but desperate, uncoordinated struggles between frightened, semi-trained youngsters who would rather be anywhere else. Some encounters are over in an instant; with Katniss's bow finding its mark just before her opponent can do likewise. Other fights are extremely physical, as combatants frantically grapple and strike untrained blows at each other like wild animals, driven by adrenaline and instinct to outlive their opponent.<br/><br/>Either way it is traumatic and tragic. Every time someone dies a family is losing their child, and every time Katniss kills she knows that she could just as easily been the one who died. In the Hunger Games victory means simply being alive, and knowing you had to do terrible things to stay that way. Katniss and Peeta's outcome was the best they could possibly have hoped for, but it's still no happy ending.<br/><br/>Besides the cruelty inherent in the games, what's striking is that for everyone in the capitol this is all a great show. The games aren't just a warning for the outlying districts; they are a grand spectacle on the scale of the Olympics or an awards show. Garishly dressed crowds cheer as the contestants are paraded before them. Top journalists interview the tributes on live TV. 'Sponsors' pay to make a limited number of airdrops to their favorite contestants. There's as much pomp and pageantry surrounding the games as a royal coronation.<br/><br/>And Katniss and the others have to play along, giving the correct responses, dressing the right way, doing everything they can to make the crowds love them and the government not view them as a problem, because the entire time they're on stage and the world is closely watching. We the viewers are also watching. The difference is that we know this is fiction and no one is really getting hurt, and even so we view the competition not glorious spectacle but as the cruelest of tragedies. Yet you have to wonder, if these were real people, if they were really dying, how many of us would still watch?"

","8/10 STARS! I am a great fan of the book trilogy and was looking forward to this one. It was a 98.5% faithful adaptation and really liked it, but there are a few pros. 1. The editing. It was too chopped out and felt a bit like a Youtube video at times. 2. The shaky camera. It bugged me! Right when the action scenes come up, the camera shakes like if there's an earthquake or something. We couldn't get to see the good stuff. 3. The atmosphere didn't quite feel like I wanted to feel it. Maybe because of the editing and shaky camera, it didn't feel as awesome and science fiction-ish as reading the book. Still, I liked it. My favorite scenes (the destruction of the Career's supplies, the mutts, the feast, the fire, Rue's death, the reaping) were really well done. So it really was a good solid film with great performances that got two stars taken out due to it's editing and shaky camera."
"joncheskin","8","1","6","27 September 2014"," What Our World Really Looks Like to a Teenager
","As an older viewer and a schoolteacher, I was fascinated enough in my students' reactions to ""The Hunger Games"" that I decided to roll it out of the Netflix one night and give it a view. I must confess I found it an odd movie--a strange mix of Rollerball and Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, where teenagers from different parts of a futuristic fascist society win a lottery for the privilege of killing each other in a spectacle designed to maintain the social order. <br/><br/>This might sound ridiculous, at least put this way, except that in my mind the movie works. It does not work for the reasons that everybody says it does--the awesome action, the ""brilliant"" dystopian premise (this is actually a cliché!), or the great marketing. I think it works because, if you have ever spent a fair amount of time with the modern teenager, you know that this movie really reveals something about the way that they perceive the world. Our society is dysfunctional (is it not?) in ways that especially hurt them, many kids have parents lacking in resources (yes?) or no parents at all to speak of, the privileged kids are sharpening their knives for the battle of winner take all, cliques form for the purpose of destroying you, etc. Furthermore, this perception is not just teenage angst--it is unique, truthful, often unseen by adults and revealed in this movie in a way that adults can digest it, if they take the trouble to take it seriously.<br/><br/>The world of the Hunger Games movie is not realistic, it is not great literature, it probably does not measure up to its source novel or Battle Royale, the Japanese movie that everyone says it copies, but it is spot-on in depicting the modern world as viewed through the eyes of a teenager. In this movie, our teenagers get their revenge on us, showing us through the eyes of their mature- beyond-her-years hero Jennifer Lawrence exactly what our sick society is made of."

","not as a fan of the books (which I intend to read having seen the first film) and was pleasantly surprised that not only was this film as imaginative as it was daunting to take in the disparity between the social classes that forms the basis of the plot and essentially plays out throughout its course, Jennifer Lawrence (Katniss) truly shines even in commercial cinema. I discovered her a few years ago having seen her in a couple of small films I'm sure no one else saw ('The Burning Plain', 'The Poker House') and I'm glad that the world has now discovered her rare talent on such a monumental scale with brilliant turns in 'The X-Men', 'Silver linings Playbook' and now 'The Hunger Games' series."

","The Hunger Games was an excellent movie, I really enjoyed the casting of this movie, I thought it was really well done. Jennifer Lawrence was by far the best actress in the movie, I thought she was a great person to play a young girl, like Katniss Everdeen. She looked amazing in the movie, she was just so beautiful and I thought the fire dress really showed her true beauty, really nice. This is in my top 50 movies of all time it was just outstanding, and it makes me want to go see Catching Fire which looks ever better than the 1st. The main story is about teenagers from the 12 districts of Panem have to go into a massive arena and fight to the death, and well, the last man standing wins. I can not express enough about how good this movie was... amazing!"
"khanbaliq2","8","1","6","15 January 2014"," Romance takes a backseat to issues of class, mass media, and a brave heroine.
","The Harry Potter film franchise taught movie studios that a lot of money can be made from popular book-to-film adaptations. Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows – Part 2 was released in 2011, but now it's the norm that every year there are several attempts at starting a new franchise. Some are successful and some are not successful. Of course these films are aimed mostly at a teenage audience. One of the most popular franchises has been The Hunger Games by Lionsgate Films. The studio managed to pile up $78 million for this first film, which was released in March of 2012. The budget isn't very large but the filmmakers managed to make a good film. At the box office the earnings amounted to an impressive $691 million. One of the reasons for the success was the casting of Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss Everdeen. Chloe Moretz was supposed to get the part but she failed her auditions. Director Gary Ross said that he was most impressed with Jennifer Lawrence. Lawrence isn't the perfect fit for Katniss physically. Katniss is supposed to be shorter, thinner and have olive skin. Still, Lawrence has the good looks and the acting skills to make up for that. Her facial expressions capture Katniss' feelings without going over the top. She's especially good when it comes to the most important scenes. One example is when she grieves for Rue. Amandla Stenberg had to be persistent to get the part of Rue. Good thing she did because her scenes with Lawrence are some of the best in the film. Rue and Katniss talking in a sunlit forest was handled especially well by Gary Ross. The only real downside to Ross' direction is a lack of thrilling action. Was this due to the budget constraints? Or was this due to the attempt to maintain a PG-13 rating? Suzanne Collins' novel includes some sinister and violent parts that weren't in the film. In the excellent supporting cast Stanley Tucci's turn as Caesar Flickerman is especially memorable. Tucci is simply terrific. Elizabeth Banks and Woody Harrelson do a good job as Effie and Haymitch. Banks is most memorable during the Reaping scene. Josh Hutcherson, however, is rather bland as Peeta Mellark. Once Katniss and Peeta get on the train headed for the Capitol, Hutcherson mostly fails to provide his character with the necessary emotions. He does a better job in the second film though. James Newton Howard's music score for the film is admirably restrained. He doesn't fill it with intensity but provides a bittersweet elegiac experience. The end credits feature the sad lullaby Safe & Sound by Taylor Swift, who sings it with a reassuring warmth. Suzanne Collins was, of course, inspired by Greek and Roman history. The Capitol is like a futuristic Rome. The Hunger Games arena is like a futuristic colosseum. Slavery was a major institution in Greece and Rome, so it's not surprising that gladiators fought to the death in Classical society as entertainment and spectacle. In the Hunger Games tributes from each district fight to the death, and Katniss is a defiant teenage gladiator who challenges the power of the authoritarian Capitol. Despite the shortage of thrills the film provides viewers with a well-realized world, with its unique clothes, architecture and rules. It's a good beginning for a franchise. I recommend it."
"akash_sebastian","7","1","6","7 December 2013"," Though inspired, the fresh take is captivating!
","After directing interesting movies like 'Pleasantville' and ""Seabiscuit', Gary Ross delves into the realm of Science Fiction quite efficiently and applies a unique touch. He himself adapts Suzanne Collins' first book in the Trilogy, along with writer Billy Ray and the author herself. Except the colourful costumes in a scene or two, the story is uniquely set in an aesthetic and gloomy environment, unlike the gloss, glam and colour of a typical Sci-Fi movie; Cinematographer Tom Stern lets the effect set in quite well.<br/><br/>The whole satire on the concept of reality shows, set altogether at a completely different level, plays out in an intriguing way. Though it's mainly a story about violence, it's depicted without glorifying it at all.<br/><br/>The acting by the two leads is strong and convincing, especially that of Jennifer Lawrence who portrays innocence quite efficiently. The supporting characters played by brilliant actors like Elizabeth Banks, Woody Harrelson, Stanley Tucci keep the story lively. Guest appearances by Lenny Kravitz and Donald Sutherland are also interesting.<br/><br/>Overall, the story of this first part bears a lot of resemblance to the concept and story of 2000's Japanese movie 'Battle Royale', it's the setting, the direction style and the acting that keep this movie engrossing till the very end."
"David_Habert","8","1","6","21 November 2013"," A good film with a great story. Well worth it's fan base and I'm not even a fan. Even I was impressed.
","Over the past four years, I've been working at a cinema and I kept hearing the trailers to this movie and at first it didn't take my interest at all, in fact it was annoying me quite a bit.<br/><br/>In the end I decided to go and see it, expecting it to be another Twilight or Harry Potter clone and expecting it to be a load of rubbish.<br/><br/>Now I'm not a fan, I've never read the books (nor do I wish to). I'm a complete outsider to this franchise and I knew next to nothing about The Hunger Games. So I'm looking at this film from an independent point of view compared to most people who did review this film and are fans. I hope this review will show that.<br/><br/>When I was watching the film for the first time, although I felt it started of very slow. Throughout the film and towards the end, my feelings, expectations towards it and its franchise as a whole completely changed. I thought it was a brilliant film.<br/><br/>Although this film is based mostly towards teens and young adults, even I was impressed and I'm a lot older than most teens or young adults and that's saying something.<br/><br/>One thing I hate about Teeny films like Twilight. Is all this boy meets girl, boy loves girl, boy marries girl and live happily ever after, that is such a lot of crap. What impressed me about The Hunger Games, is that there isn't too much of that in there. There is a good story attached to it which isn't ruined by too much CGI and special effects. Which sadly most movies nowadays are.<br/><br/>I'm not gonna say anything about what the story is about in this review, what would be the point. Most of you will properly know about it already. It's funny, it's sad, it's emotional, got a great deal of action. Even the actress who played Katniss Everdeen was brilliant, I can only imagine that's a tough role for a young actress to play and Jennifer Lawrence did it well. So did the rest of the cast with their roles. Well done guys and gals.<br/><br/>All I can say is The Hunger Games has now become one of my favourite films of all time and I don't say that easily or often.<br/><br/>All in all. A great film, great story, great cast, great actors and actresses. Suzanne Collins I believe these people and the film itself have done your Hunger Games stories justice. Congratulations."
"SnoopyStyle","7","1","6","16 August 2013"," good enough to justify franchise
","Based on popular books, the totalitarian nation of Panem is divided between 12 districts and the Capitol. Each year two young representatives from each district are selected by lottery to participate in The Hunger Games. Part entertainment, part brutal retribution for a past rebellion, the televised games are broadcast throughout Panem. 24 enters 1 leaves. When 16-year-old Katniss's young sister, Prim, is selected as District 12's female representative, Katniss volunteers to take her place. She is an underdog against other participants who have trained for this their whole lives.<br/><br/>Other than Jennifer Lawrence, there isn't much to write home about. The scale of the movie barely big enough. The action isn't that brutal. The artistic style is a mishmash. Some of the important people have fanciful hair but are they truly original? I haven't read the books and after watching this, I don't intend to. By comparison, I eventually broke down and read the Harry Potter books after watching the 3rd movie. To be honest, I don't know what the big deal is. It's good enough to justify the franchise."
"eline-hoskens","10","1","6","2 August 2013"," Absolutely brilliant CAN match with 'loved by teenage girls'
","I rarely write 10-star reviews because movies really have to earn them. But in this case, I make an exception. A 10-star movie, to me, is a movie that keeps wandering in my mind weeks after I've seen it, that I can keep watching over and over and never get tired of, that really touches me emotionally and introduces timeless and meaningfull themes and issues.<br/><br/>I seriously suspect a lot of people hate this movie simply because teenage girls love it too. But I can assure you I am no teenage girl, I have read the entire trilogy and loved it and my parents (who are not at all fans of the fantasy and sci-fi genre) loved this movie too! There is nothing wrong with being honest about what you feel and this movie blew me away. Not only is Suzanne Collins a brilliant writer who came up with a wonderful story, it's clear she was one of the script writers herself. <br/><br/>If there is a point of criticism I respect, it is people complaining about the shaky cam literally making them nauseous. However, I don't have motion sickness and understand the choice to use it. I think it's an addition to the way they tell the story on screen. It makes you sympathise more with Katniss and translates the very personal and subjective ""present tense first person narrator"" writing style to images that make you feel just as disturbed and scared and ""what-the-hell-is-going-on"" as the main character.<br/><br/>I don't mind the fact that they made the story a bit less harsh for the movie. It's still wonderfully touching but I think it's great that they make it more accessible to a younger audience as this is a story everyone should read and as not everybody likes to read it's great they adapted it to a medium that reaches more people from different ages. I was relieved Haymitch was not the puking bastard he was in the book. It made him a more round character.<br/><br/>The casting and acting in this movie is brilliant. I became an instant fan of Jennifer Lawrence and would see every movie that casts her from now on, even if the genre does not appeal to me at all, just out of admiration and curiosity about how she will make a character come to life this time. She does not play Katniss, she IS Katniss. The same goes for a lot of the other actors. I love Wes Bentley as Seneca for example. He reminded me a lot of one of my former employers who was an often not so black-and-white wolf in sheep's clothing with charming good looks who made you wonder about his real intentions and personality a lot.<br/><br/>This movie really made me 'feel' the danger in the woods and the threat of the other contestants, 'feeling' really unsure and suspicious about their intentions, not knowing who to trust...<br/><br/>I am convinced that emotions and feelings are very much underrated when it comes to reviews. It's like what you feel during a movie is completely inferior to the amount of grey and grumpy grown-up issues (that are popular at the moment) you can find in the story. It's like all reviewers are these ""Yuk, feelings are gay""-types nowadays. I'm not saying I can't enjoy a good action movie and that I need my hanky with me every time I watch a movie but when a movie gets me emotional at the end, gets me to CARE about what happens even after I've seen it scores of times, it's really good in my opinion. And just because a lot of girls in puberty will agree with me doesn't make my opinion less valuable. Puberty is after all a very emotional period in people's lives. ;-)<br/><br/>This movie has a heart and more movies could use this nowadays. It shows the harshness of a world that (frankly) isn't that far-fetched if you have a good look at our current society. And I'm relieved that even amongst the most superficial teenagers, there are girls who love this cause that means there is still hope. It's a story about responsibility, courage and being a rebel against the main stream that is obviously not always right, having the guts to stand up to it! What's the point in blindly loving all those movies with hard political messages that are rated R and have a lot of 'realistic' and 'mature' violence if they only make you depressed and if they don't 'touch' you? What happened to art as a way of reaching people and making them have more fun than they could have watching the news channel. It's not because this movie is not about slavery or nine eleven or the civil war or any other horrible historic event or plain nihilism and because it is loved by teenage girls, that it is a bad movie. I hated most of the Twilight films but it doesn't mean I will brainlessly hate all movies loved by teenagers from now on.<br/><br/>I think people saying this movie 'misses the point of the book' don't get the point themselves. What is 'the point' to begin with? There are several! I believe the essence of the story is contained in the movie. Maybe people automatically think it's 'intelligent' if you prefer the book over the film and forget Suzanne Collins actually helped writing the script. I bet she knows best what 'the point of the book' is and she watched the writing process carefully to make sure nothing important was lost. Also, I read the movie is a 'non-violent' 'dumbed down ' version of the book? What does that mean? That preferring violence is more intelligent? <br/><br/>Just don't care about those pseudo-intellectual critics, don't you dare to consider this adaptation a 'guilty pleasure' and enjoy this wonderful movie as it is. I'm so looking forward to the sequels!"

I have no words for how amazing, and emotional this movie was.

I think the sound and music were amazing and what gave the feeling of being there.<br/><br/>Other people complain about the shaky camera, personally it's kind of a style thing and I think it worked well to increase the story, others may disagree but that's what I think.

","Jennifer Lawrence has a good performance as Katniss Everdeen but if The Hunger Games: Catching Fire and The Hunger Games: Mocking Jay (both parts), then she needs to be nominated for best actress. Josh Hutcherson's role as Peeta shows that you don't need to be picked for a tribute, you need to be trained as a tribute. Liam Hemsworth's role as Gale shows that you have to train to become a guider of The Hunger Games, an annual tradition only in the movie. Lots of people have been chosen to play roles in this movie which means like to me about a hundred are in the movie that is called The Hunger Games. But there will be more in Catching Fire and Mocking Jay, so you don't need to worry. And that was my review of The Hunger Games."
"tbchico7","8","1","6","11 July 2013"," A very pleasant surprise
","This is a movie I never thought I'd see, let alone right a favorable review on. I'm one of the only Teens in the world who hasn't read the books, and was only watching because of the talented Jennifer Lawrence, for whom I have a great deal of respect. It turned out to be one of the best films I've seen all year, and one of the best surprises I've ever seen.<br/><br/>The plot is pretty universally known (even I was familiar with the core concept) Teens fighting each other on T.V for the worlds entertainment. Not too original, but well executed. The visuals and scenarios were really well done, and I almost felt sucked into the world. The contrasts from the poor world of district 12 to the wealthy, colorful cities was awesome.<br/><br/>The Film is lead by the lovely Jennifer Lawrence, who plays the part of Katniss Everdeen wonderfully. Katniss was the first volunteer tribute from district 12, and she was to go to the Hunger Games along with Peeta Mellark (played by Josh Hutcherson) Although not friends, they become romantically linked, and develop a bit of a love throughout the film which is used to gain interest from viewers. Despite the good acting, the romance did seem a little far fetched, and it is doubtful that any man could turn down the role of Peeta if only to snuggle with Jennifer Lawrence. Woody Harrelson, a favorite of mine, played their mentor, a former winner of the Hunger Games. He is a bit of an alcoholic, but very likable. The rest of the cast was good, but aside from the two A? listers, no performances stood out.<br/><br/>I really liked this movie. I have some complaints, but nothing that ruined this nice experience. I would recommend it to people looking for a visually striking film with a strong female lead. Jennifer Lawrence was the highlight for me; I personally thought that she created a great character with tons of depth. Strong film, I might even go see the sequel in theaters."

"mattloveless","8","1","6","6 March 2013"," Entertaining movie. Absolutely worth the watch.
","A movie based on a teen novel, hyped - and grouped - along with the likes of Twilight? I was absolutely closed-minded about this movie, and only rented it because I knew Bikini Spring Break wasn't a good choice for dinner-and-a-movie night with my wife (the RedBox was running thin). We were both pleasantly surprised! <br/><br/>Yes, it's a PG-13 movie, which probably took away from some of the reality, but the characters were well-developed, the concept was very intriguing, and my wife and I both found ourselves wrapped up in the Games. I forgive the writers of the teen novel for wishing to appeal to their demographic, leaving out some of the elements of gore.<br/><br/>I've read the other reviews, and was initially surprised that so many people gave low ratings (1s & 2s), but then I remembered two things: 1) People will think it's either the worst thing ever, or the best thing ever, & 2) This story was first a book, and it infuriates people if an adapted screenplay leaves out ANYTHING in the novel.<br/><br/>I haven't read the book, but I'm sure there's a lot missing from the movie. Consider, for example that the run time of the film is 2:22. The run time of the Hunger Games audiobook is 11:12. Is it not reasonable to expect that somewhere in those nine hours, a few bits of the story won't hit the pages of the movie script? No one is impressed that you're capable of reading, so there's no need to act like what you read is better than what I saw. <br/><br/>But to address specific themes/plot lines that people claim were missing:<br/><br/>I understood that the districts were left hungry - this was not missing, as some have claimed. Remember when Katniss smelled the bread at the beginning of the movie and said ""Is this real?!"" like it was a 24-carat diamond? Remember that the tension between she and Peeta stemmed from a wasted roll? If the complaint is that Jennifer Lawrence was not emaciated enough, that is a weak complaint.<br/><br/>It was made clear the oppression they all live under - which apparently some of the book-readers claim wasn't in the movie. Throughout the film, in every was possible, it is illustrated. In fact, it's explicitly addressed by Donald Sutherland's character when he talks about why there's winner: Hope. If the complaint is that there wasn't more to illustrate the tyranny, again, it is a weak complaint.<br/><br/>People claim that there was not enough developing of the relationship between Katniss and Rue. I disagree. Did we not see how Rue's death affected Katniss? Were there not multiple occasions when they worked together to kill the other tributes? Did they not play roles in protecting each other? Sure, you can claim that there may have been missing scenes, but to argue that their closeness was not illustrated is - again - a weak complaint.<br/><br/>I haven't - and probably won't - read the book. All that seems to do is create cynics, who want everything from their 11-hour read to fit into a 2-hour movie - and will consider it garbage if anything is missing. That's unfair, and this is coming from someone who discarded this series as crap before learning anything about it.<br/><br/>It's a fun film with an interesting concept, and I'll probably watch it again. Odds are I'll make an effort to catch the sequels, too. I'd strongly recommend this to anyone."
"atlihafsteinsson","9","1","6","12 February 2013"," Terrifying
","I have not read any of the books, so this movie will be judged solely on my interpretation of watching. Which, really, is the only way to watch a movie, unlike many reviewers here apparently think.<br/><br/>The Hunger Games is terrifying. Set in a bleak future where a totalitarian world state rules with an iron fist and class separations are absolute, every year two teens from each of the world's ""districts"" are chosen at random to compete to the death in a callous show called The Hunger Games. When a young girl is chosen from district 12, one of the poorest districts, her older sister Katniss volunteers in her stead. She thus is taken to the Capital, a city overflowing with riches and privilege (the very contrast to her coal mining home town), heralded as a celebrity. But the sick thing about it is that while she and the 23 other youngsters are cheered on by adoring fans, they and everybody else knows they are really being led to most of their deaths. But Katniss, while quickly gaining attention in the much-publicised pre-games televising, is not intent on playing by the rules any more than she had to.<br/><br/>Some fans of the books expected the movie to be more brutal. I found the callous attitude of the whole thing quite brutal as it was. The sick nature of leading random kids to their deaths, cheered on by adoring masses, is most difficult to stomach. The first half of the movie sets up the games, and the latter half is the games themselves, in the woods, where all the celebration and celebrity vanishes like smoke and the cruel fight for survival begins. Of course, they don't know that they're dealing with Katniss, who's already proficient at surviving in conditions not that far removed from the ones she finds herself in bar the teens trying to kill her. The movie knows how to build tension by giving us moments to breathe, not knowing what's gonna happen next and making us worry about the characters.<br/><br/>The acting is superb. Jennifer Lawrence gives a stunning performance as Katniss and you root for her from beginning to end. She is 100% believable as tough and yet so vulnerable. If the Academy had any sense, she should've been nominated for her powerhouse of a performance. Donald Sutherland is chilling as the maniacal President Snow.<br/><br/>It seems the books have such a high standard that they can't possibly be fulfilled on the big screen. Too bad. But for the uninitiated, The Hunger Games is a thrilling, stomach-churning action movie about surviving in hell."

","Based on Suzanne Collins best selling book trilogy, The Hunger Games stars Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss Everdeen who volunteers to take part in the Capitol's annual Hunger Games, a game show where contestants fight to the death.<br/><br/>I postponed seeing this film as long as possible. I had finished the first two novels (which are both fantastic and readable in a matter of days if you're stuck for something to read) but I checked the film out and when the opening starts and we're thrust into the world of District 12, I was shocked.<br/><br/>The opening is something remarkable. It's great if unyielding from the truth of their poverty. District 12, run down where residents struggle for food and to make a living, but Katniss and her friend Gale (Liam Hemsworth) find escapism in their hunting. And when Katniss' sister is nominated for the games we see Jennifer Lawrence show why she is currently the most promising actress of these last 5 years.<br/><br/>Lawrence was a great choice to play Katniss. The character in the books is quite unusual, quite solemn but with hidden desires and energy that the young actress excels at. Her on screen peak is with Rue when in the arena, a heart wrenching exhilarating piece of acting combined with opportunistic film pacing.<br/><br/>The film starts slowly getting into the feel of the poverty of the districts but as viewers, when we see the world of the Capitol and see how perfect, classy and snobbish everything is we feel the pace pick up and we are right there with the contestants, in a world the Capitol controls where these young fighters have little say in their destiny.<br/><br/>The first book is very imaginative and is very well brought to the screen by director Gary Ross. The excitement and adrenaline really starts pumping when the arena is introduced. The resemblance to the events of the book is spot on, if not better. Katniss' independent tracking and thirst for survival are well shot, especially during the Trackerjacker sequences. The best part of the entire film is when Katniss is with Rue, the excitement and emotion in these scenes are fantastic and it's hard to express how well this works in developing their characters and holding the film and the rest of the story together.<br/><br/>When reading the books I had concerns over how Collins was working the romance angles, being a bit like Twilight with the love angles but this is nothing like that series. This is something calmer, less intense in terms of love and lust. Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) may be viewed differently by people. As the stories progress his character changes and Hutcherson portrays him very well and strikes up a good partnership with Lawrence that resembles their respective adaptations.<br/><br/>There are a few minor lapses and improvements. I only wish the fire sequence was a bit longer as it was in the book. Seeing Woody Harrelson as Haymitch was rather strange at first but it would have been great if he was included more during certain scenes! This film is a great adaptation of a great book. The imagination Suzanne Collins has been wonderfully adapted for the screen with her vivid and controversial environment and ideas and with excellent performances, particularly from Jennifer Lawrence, the Hunger Games is a must watch."

","I personally loved this movie. No, it didn't have everything from the book, but when does that ever happen? I try not to compare movies to the books because I will just end up disappointed. Movies have to be a little different from the book. It's impossible to get them exactly the same, and I think they did a great job at making this movie. I loved all the actors they chose (although I was a little unsure about Josh Hutcherson as Peeta at first). Donald Sutherland was spot-on for President Snow, and I thought Amandla Stenberg as Rue was great (I still don't understand why so many people were surprised she was black when it is clearly stated in the book). Her death was so sad! I almost cried because she played the part so well. I don't really have any complaints about this movie except that I wish it could have been longer! I can't wait until Catching Fire comes out so that I can see more of this great series on the big screen!!"

","The Hunger Games Movie Review Like the book (written by Susan Colons), the Hunger Games movie creates a fast pace, suspenseful, plot that you will not want to end.<br/><br/>The Gary Ross (the director) and the actors imitated the book perfectly. Katniss Everdeen, played by Jennifer Lawrence; the 18 year old main character is a bow and arrow wizard. This really helps when she volunteers fight in the games so her little sister, Primrose (prim for short) doesn't go to the games, which yearly is a blood thirty game show where a teenage boy and a girl from each (12) district is chosen increasing your chances with each year of your life. Resulting in 24 kids from ages 12-18, very young, fighting to the death.<br/><br/>katniss' best friend and hunting partner, Gale, promises to take care of her family for her while she goes into the games up against many people, including Cato and Thresh. These people are careers; people who train in an academy there whole life and at 18 they volunteer for the games and, most of the time, win. The capital; higher class people, allows it because all they want is to watch tiny helpless 12 year olds get viciously massacred by gigantic 18 year olds on live TV. The capital includes one heartless, snobby, Jerky, conceded, leader, president Snow (even though he's more of a dictator). Just because 13 said they didn't like him, he started a war and ended the district's days by bombing it and leaving nothing but rubble and dust.<br/><br/>Once the games actually start katniss (despite specific orders from her mentor), run strait to the cornucopia and almost gets killed! The cornucopia is the most suspenseful, blood thirsty part of the arena. It's where you begin and for many, end. You supply here, so many (unpleasantly) meet with others here! Yes, there is a lot of violence, but whoever wins the games gets a worry free life until they die.<br/><br/>""The Hunger Games"" movie keeps you at the edge of your seat wandering what will happen next. The theme of this movie is to treasure what you have. You will love the fast pace movie."

","I was so excited to see The Hunger Games and had high hopes for this movie. I so badly wanted it to be spectacular because the book was so fantastic. The Hunger Games fell a little short for me though.<br/><br/>First the good, I found the acting to be quite good. I felt for the most part that the movie represented the book quite well. Of course the book was far more detailed, and some aspects of the book were left out of the movie. I don't feel anything necessary was really left out of the movie. This is a plus. I think the storyline is fantastic. It is certainly intriguing and entertaining.<br/><br/>The negative for me was that the movie was a bit slow. It felt like it dragged on at some points, and at the same time some of the book details felt rushed.<br/><br/>All-in-all, I would certainly recommend seeing The Hunger Games. It is worth it."
"hoyt09","8","1","6","29 October 2012"," Katniss, through her bravery and character, beats President Snow at his own Game (literally) and began a revolution that inspired broken spirits.
","The Hunger Games is based off of the book by the same title written by Suzanne Collins. The story is post-apocalyptic and centers around a girl, Katniss Everdeen (played by Jennifer Lawrence), who must fight to stay alive when she volunteers in her sister Prim's (Willow Shields) place in the Hunger Games. The Hunger Games is an annual fight to the death occurrence in the fictitious nation of Panem, which consists of a Capital and twelve districts. The Games is means of punishing by the Capital against the poor districts because of rebellions that happened in the past. At the Reaping (lottery), each district must offer a boy and a girl (called tributes) to fight in the Games. The sole survivor of the Games is rewarded with fame and riches to last for their rest of their lives. The premise of the movie is the strength of character and how hope can flourish from just a small spark. <br/><br/>Katniss must leave her best friend, Gale Hawthorne (Liam Hemsworth), unstable mother (Paula Malcomson), and younger sister behind as she is paired up with Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) in the Games. Katniss and Peeta are joined on their journey to the Capital by former Games victors, Haymitch Abernathy (Woody Harrelson) and Effie Trinket (Elizabeth Banks). Katniss and Peeta, who become portrayed as star-crossed lovers thanks to Peeta, become unlikely favorites as the Games get underway. The televised competition is fierce and unforgiving as tributes die off either on account of fighting or the contrived elements of the Games. Katniss and Peeta are the last ones alive, but soon discover the Capital only wants one to win. A quick ploy by Katniss disrupts this plan and both are proclaimed victors, but not without upsetting the President (Donald Sutherland).<br/><br/>Throughout the movie, the audience watches Katniss as she bravely fights against all odds. Although she may not be as highly trained as some of the tributes, she is passionate about staying alive for her sister and mother back home. Although a kind person, she takes on the role of hunter as she plays the games to win. She somehow manages to walk the line between being ""good"" at the Games and still defiant of the Capital's imperious ways. Although none of the tributes deserve their untimely deaths, the audience roots for Katniss as she skillfully plays the game. The movie is reminiscent of The Running Man (1987), a science fiction-action movie where ""contestants"", who were convicted killers, must ward off killers in a televised slaughter. Like the Games, the main character, Ben Richards (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is a wrongfully convicted man who ultimately is fighting a resistance against the government. Although he must participate in the deaths of his fellow contestants, Richards is victorious and the movie ends with hope. The Games has both magnificent colors and special effects to portray the brilliance of the characters and life in general in the Capital. District 12 is a drab, dark place where people are struggling to stay alive. Everyone wears shabby clothes and their homes are anything but fancy. But when Katniss and Peeta arrive at the Capital, the colors are vibrant and the scenery comes to life. The people of the Capital wear extraordinary costumes and makeup and live in palace-like buildings. The lights of the city are bright and everything is clean. The people of the Capital truly live in a different world. The Games, although fictitious, represents a future world that occurs as the result of the oppression of the common people. It takes the courage and bravery of one young woman to ignite the spirit of the people. Although she must fight for her life while taking the lives of others, she becomes a ray of light for her dark world. Katniss, through her bravery and character, beat President Snow at his own Game (literally) and began a revolution that inspired broken spirits."

","I was chatting with a friend about his latest reading material and he'd been reading the HG trilogy. He said I wouldn't like it much as I'm more into supernatural/horror. I gave the first HG book a go, and LOVED it!!!! The writing was well paced and very enjoyable, and so naturally, I wanted to see the film. I have to say, I was more impressed with it the second time round, and to be honest, I get a bit miffed when people pick it to bits.<br/><br/>Not everything is explained in the film, but it doesn't need to be if you open your mind and imagine yourself in that situation. Although I'd read the book, the first time I watched the film, I wondered when Jennifer Lawrence was actually going to do something. Then I remembered that her character Katniss was thrust into this fancy world she'd never seen before and crowds were screaming, cameras all over the place, no wonder she was confused. I got that in the end and sympathised with her.<br/><br/>I liked the occasional jerky camera footage, simply because it highlights how messed up the situation is. You're a child thrown into the lion's den and forced to protect yourself or die. I'm a fan of watching the special features on a DVD, and a lot of the techniques are explained in these, the camera angles included.<br/><br/>The one scene that chokes me up every time is the part with Rue, and Katniss really shows her humanity and vulnerability. It's not necessary for there to be mountains of story for these two, you understand their bond straight away.<br/><br/>There is very little blood in this film, but once again, there doesn't need to be. The subject matter on its own is horrific and unimaginable, and I believe that the author as well as the film director did a fantastic job in capturing the despair and determination. The cast did a great job too, and although I did like some performances a lot more than others, I'll be interested to see how they fare in Catching Fire."

"WilderMovieReviews","8","1","6","4 May 2012"," Let the games begin!
","This was an interesting film, the marketing was excellent and I wanted to see it even though I knew almost nothing about it. I knew it was based upon a novel but I hadn't read it. Jennifer Lawrence plays the lead of Katniss Everdeen and in my review of X-Men: First Class, I put her as the stand out performance of the film. I could see that she had something special, but would she be up to the task of carrying the whole film? Would my prediction about her be right?<br/><br/>The film is about a girl Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) who volunteers to fight in the Hunger Games taking the place of her younger sister. Competitors in the games are forced to fight to the death until only one is left standing.<br/><br/>There have been many films about people hunting people from Hard Target (1993) with Jean-Claude Van Damme to Surviving the Game (1994) staring Ice-T. The one that is most similar in style is the Japanese classic Battle Royale (2000). It also has youths forced to fight to the death, but where that film was purely designed for adults to shock and horrify you, Hunger Games is based on a book for teenagers and so is the film.<br/><br/>This was a very good film and for the most part it was beautifully shot. The actors in this are perfectly cast which includes Jennifer Lawrence, Stanley Tucci, Liam Hemsworth, Josh Hutcherson, Woody Harrelson, Wes Bentley, Paula Malcomson, Amandla Stenberg & Elizabeth Banks. Once again Jennifer Lawrence is outstanding, this time as the lead. Her portrayal of Katniss Everdeen is captivating. She has a great skill in drawing the audience in and making a connection with them. As with her performance in X-Men: First Class, her skill in portraying emotions comes over amazingly.<br/><br/>The film is a great visual treat, with a good story. However as good as the film is, the film makers failed in the transition from book to screen.<br/><br/>Minor Spoilers The book is set from the perspective of Katniss who is telling the story. However this is not the case with the film. It is just a story. The film really loses a lot from changing the format. With the book you get a lot of the history of the Hunger Games and you understand what they are all about. With the film this is missed out and barely covered in a small written intro. All the film needed to do was to have Katniss telling the story at least up until the point where her sister is chosen. Her giving a background narrative over the start of the film would have made a perfect introduction. The way it was done left me as a viewer without the necessary information I felt was needed to create an emotional connection to the characters and the story. Fortunately for me I started to read the book the night before the viewing as I had read that the film was a little vague during the opening scenes. This gave me the background that unfortunately the viewers of the film wouldn't necessarily have.<br/><br/>Minor Spoilers end The intentionally shaky camera shots get a bit too much at times and the lack of blood and carnage is a little too unbelievable and while overall this is a good film, it could have been a great film. If you have already read the book you should enjoy the film more than if you haven't.<br/><br/>8 out of 10 if you haven't read the book 9 out of 10 if you have read the book."

","It's hard to be objective as I enjoyed this movie so much after hearing how good it was from several of my grandchildren. It is set in some kind of an alternative universe showing what a reality TV show would look like if the Nazis had won WWII. It was a salute to every outlandish wardrobe choice and bad hairdo ever imagined. It had everything, heroes, villains, chivalry, loyalty, suffering, victory, and explosions, not to mention a love story. Stanley Tucci and Woody Harrelson couldn't have been better in supporting roles. Jennifer Lawrence was outstanding. She is a beautiful young woman that looked the part as a warrior.

Ill give a short review that will hopefully add to the countless others.<br/><br/>Having not read the book, i went in open minded to all and anything. Yes, i have seen Battle Royale. There are certainly some similarities, however i can say this is not a simple rehash of BR.<br/><br/>Some of good things that stood out was the acting (Jennifer Lawrence i think it is did a superb job as the lead and i liked Woody Harrelsons portrayal of their mentor.) I am a big fan of dystopic society and thought the settings were well done. Futuristic in the Capitol and old, depressing, in the Districts.<br/><br/>I have a few gripes. First, there is shaky camera a lot. Even when there is just calm convo, the camera moves like something really intense is happening. Gets annoying and makes it hard to observe the smaller details (ie set pieces, people). I also would've rather seen a little more brutality. I understand that it was pretty much restricted to PG-13 because of the target audience, however i think the brutish nature of the games and its contestants would have shown better if there was more....just more.<br/><br/>Overall, Def a good movie. On a 100 scale, 77 does it justice. I am currently reading the book which explains some details i had questions about. Even if you have read the book, the movie will keep your interest."

Jennifer Laurence is absolutely brilliant as Katniss Everdeen - which the character has many similarities to that of the Oscar nominated role of Ree in Winter's Bone (taking care of her siblings while her mother is catatonic, facing dangerous situations, never giving up and doing it on her own), and really captures the emotional turmoil her character faces.<br/><br/>Now on the other hand, what really bugged me was that the film was too long and really dragged on towards the end, making the ending less than enthusiastic and sort of ruined the prospect of it being a ""game changer"" . Also, the film has a very interesting message and theme: Combining war with reality TV. The way the kids are exploited like they are not human beings is really horrifying, but the film focuses more on the action rather than the message and the reasons for these terrible Hunger Games. <br/><br/>The book was brilliant, but the film really could have been much better. 6 out of 10"
"mtzmcrchick111","7","1","6","5 April 2012"," i really liked this one
","good thing i didn't read the book, otherwise i probably would've come with much higher expectations. I thought the acting of the leading characters was good, i liked the bizarre costumes they wore but i think they could've gone further with that. I thought it was really suspenseful, there was definitely emotion to it. I would've liked Rue to be in the movie longer though to really grab the audiences connection with her. I don't think Katniss overreacted to her death though even though Rue as only in there for like 15 minutes. I think a lot of people would cry if they just saw a little girl get murdered for no reason in front of them. Overall i think it was very entertaining and i will be watching this again."
"febicks","7","1","6","5 April 2012"," The Hunger Games
","Based on the popular novels by Suzanne Collins, The Hunger Games sets reality TV on high by forcing teens into a 24 person battle royale, a legitimate fight to the death where the lone victor will be showered with honors for the district they call home. The government forces children into these ferocious games asÂ penance for society uprising; to keep people in their place they sacrifice two teens from every district, parading them around to gain popularity for a world wide audience. The Hunger Games fashions style and tenacity from its vibrant cinematography, creating a futuristic dystopia where upper society strives on extravagant hair-styles and gaga esque outfits, while the lower classes wallow in 19th century living styles. Millions tune in nationally to see these teens beat each others brains out and take bets on who will become the victor. Much of the build-up revolves around how these contestants sell themselves to gain sponsors who essentially will ensure their survival, the pay-off is immense. Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss Everdeen shines, and adds a depth to her character that others may have lacked. The fear on her face as she enters the battle royale is real. Up to that point it's been a parade, showing off to gain acclaim, but the fun and games are over and what is about take place is life or death.<br/><br/>The source material for The Hunger Games I'm certain is far more in- depth, and that is somewhat missed within the film. Just when we think we're going to get to know some of these characters they die, or worse yet a flashy explosion detracts from the narrative, but still The Hunger Games delivers in entertainment value, keeping you guessing who will survive and how Katniss will escape her perilous enemies within the battle yet again. Her prowess and survival skills make her a tough cookie, we learn that early on, so were not surprised when her rough exterior makes her a formidable opponent. While she's interesting to say the least, it's her counter-parts who are somewhat lacking; we barely get to know many of them before they're sent off to the slaughter for our viewing pleasure. Amandla Stenberg as the young girl Rue is also noteworthy, shedding humanity onto a film which desperately needs it. Her expressions go beyond her years as a young actress and she adds a delight to the film. Woody Harelson also has a nice supporting role, playing a drunken-tutor who seemingly has written the book on how best to survive.<br/><br/>The Hunger Games while having a wonderful entertainment value fails to go the extra mile to ensure greatness (the ending lacks somewhat; without question they're leaving room for sequels). If anything, the only gripe anyone can have is simply wanting more out of it. Much like a helpless society, we watch people we hardly know slaughter each other, and young adults at that, we are emotionally startled at first but as things progress we become more desensitized until all we want is more brutality. The Hunger Games delivers in this regard, forcing a love angle that may or may not develop in the films to come, and creating a sense of alarm within each of us as we imagine how we would react in a similar scenario. Odds are we would do what was necessary to survive, odds are we would also have the moral fiber to question the games themselves. The Hunger Games works however. Just like the audience watching within the film, you'll have a hard time turning away.<br/><br/>Stephen Febick, 4/2/2012"
"arj-8","6","1","6","1 April 2012"," Why you will or will not like the Hunger Games
","I went to watch The Hunger Games with a lot of expectation and excitement and left the cinema with an underwhelming feeling.<br/><br/>Let me first clarify I have watched Battle Royale, I have watched the Condemned and the Running man you see the pattern thats being developed.<br/><br/>The idea and concept of the Hunger Games is a good one, ( I wont go into detail as you can read that elsewhere). <br/><br/>The major problem for me is I have seen Battle Royale and for me that is the same concept, but executed more efficiently. The problem with the Hunger Games is that it takes almost 70- 80mins before the movie kicks in. If you want a quick thrill ride this is not it, I understand its part of a trilogy but the idea seems to be a carbon copy of battle royale with its own spin.<br/><br/>I have seen all the Battle Royale films and even the Condemned with Steve Austin is very similar to the Hunger Games. <br/><br/>I guess if you have seen those don't bother watching, but if you haven't then the hunger games will be fresh and new for you.<br/><br/>But for me it seemed like watching a movie I had already seen before."
"rbferre","6","1","6","31 March 2012"," Good popcorn movie but falls flat in several aspects
","I confess I never read the books this film is based on. I also did not read any reviews before stepping into the theater and I was concerned whether this was a movie solely directed to teens or adults like me would also enjoy it.<br/><br/>What really called my attention was the outstanding box office in its first weekend. In short, I came into the theater without high expectations as most of the people who read the books had.<br/><br/>At the end, I left with mixed feelings:<br/><br/>I think the movie counts with great photography (although I hate the shaky camera trend), costumes, good performance by the veteran actors like Donald Sutherland and the Sugar Monster Lady, and a good surprise with the young leading actress. And finally, a nice way to show a dark, hopeless future and a warning to the descending spiral we have been taking with the reality shows.<br/><br/>What is bad? First, the pace was too slow in the first half of the movie. You would imagine they do it on purpose to allow character development, but the feeling is they fall flat. Little we learn about the district 12 boy (Peeta), the past of the main characters like Woody Harrelson's and how the country got to that situation. <br/><br/>Second, not sure if either the Peeta character is bad or the actor did a bad job, but he comes across very weak, and the girl is definitely who wears the pants in the relationship. <br/><br/>Third, the fights sequences had no suspense at all. Immediate kills without leaving the audience at the edge of the seats. <br/><br/>Fourth,the plot: So, the idea of the government is to have the Hunger Games as a way to avoid riots by the masses? Really? After 49 years knowing that every year a friend or relative will be executed in national TV? Isn't this enough to start a riot? <br/><br/>Fifth, the Cato character is not developed at all - spectators are not really led to dislike him, he reminded me the bad high school guy in the first Karate Kid movie. By the way, shouldn't the lead actress be looking less healthy/hot for someone who did not even had bread to eat?<br/><br/>Finally, the feeling is that the book is much darker than what we saw on the screen, and the producers wanted to lighten it up and get PG13 rating to boos audience. That leaves the movie suitable only for teenagers at most.<br/><br/>All in all, a reasonable popcorn movie. Given the outstanding box office though, I would not expect them to change the formula for the other two coming. A real shame given the success of the books."
"longcooljolie","7","1","6","31 March 2012"," Contains some stunning scenes and images, but also uneven
","This review is being written on the morning of March 31, 2012, when the initial hype for the movie has died down a little and the hatchet job reviews have started popping up here on IMDb.<br/><br/>Suzanne Collin's novel, written in 2008, tells an intricate and evocative story. In broad terms, the United States approximately one to two centuries into the future has become a dystopic totalitarian regime divided into twelve districts. The governing body called ""The Capitol"" has devised ""The Hunger Games"" as a way of quelling rebellions and keeping the populace in line. Twenty-four children (a boy and a girl from each district) between the ages of 12 and 18 are randomly chosen to fight to the death in a massive outdoor arena, until only one survives.<br/><br/>The novel triumphs because the author manages to capture a dystopian universe through the eyes of a rough-hewn 16 year-old-girl who is both the product of her time and amazingly resourceful. Since the book has had so much success and is read largely by high-school age children, it's easy to dispatch it into the ""Twilight"" category of ""fad"" fiction. Yet Suzanne Collins is an experienced, successful television writer and it shows. By contrast, even author Stephanie Meyer admits that the ""Twilight"" books are far from literary masterpieces.<br/><br/>Now onto the challenge in filming ""The Hunger Games:"" the filmmakers have to take a story with a first-person viewpoint and tell it in third person objective. Some reviews have criticized the lack of story development into the mores of the dystopian society but they have missed one important detail: author Suzanne Collins was part of the screenplay team and was still trying to tell the story through Katniss' eyes in the best way she could. Let's face it: no matter how educated or rough-hewn they may be, a sixteen year old is just not going to have much world experience yet.<br/><br/>""The Hunger Games"" best moments occur during the pomp and pageantry that precedes the games. To use too much detail in describing it would be to court spoilers, so suffice it to say that the images of Katniss and Peeta arriving in a chariot are stunning and unforgettable. Katniss interview with Caesar the emcee is also striking and taken almost verbatim from the book.<br/><br/>Most other reviews fail to appreciate the great work of the Art Direction team in creating the Capitol. The exhibition hall where the interviews for the tributes take place shows a crowd layout and architectural detail that eerily mimics the Nuremburg rallies during the Nazi era in pre world war 2 Germany. Taking it a step further, the Reaping scene near the beginning shows the youths dressed in bland, demure clothing straight out of a Hitler youth rally.<br/><br/>During the ""games"" themselves, the movie becomes a somewhat bland action thriller. This brings up another problem which faced the producers: to truly reflect the strife Katniss and Peeta faced, the movie would have had to have been at least twice as long. Katniss' relationship with Rue, one of the best parts of the novel, also suffers in the story streamlining for cinema. On top of everything else the producers also downplayed and sanitized the violence to secure a PG-13 rating.<br/><br/>As many have also reported, the ending seemed flat but there's a rhyme to that reason: the makers are clearly springboarding to one or possibly two sequels. Still, if you're on the fence about whether to pay $11 to $13 to see this in theaters, just go. ""Hunger"" is good cinema, with fine performance by all the principals and a movie that in the end asks a disturbing question: ""Is this what we're heading toward?"""
"tributarystu","7","1","6","31 March 2012"," Evasive but engaging adaptation
","I suddenly found myself reading The Hunger Games trilogy in preparation for the movie, mainly due to the allure of Jennifer Lawrence. Thankfully, it was a pretty fun read, even though the books are fairly derivative, at least in regard to their dystopian theme. It's the ambivalence of Katniss that drives the story forward and keeps it interesting, so to my mind this was one of the most important things to get right in the movie.<br/><br/>The universe of Panem, a land set in the future comprised of twelve districts and run by an authoritarian capitol, may seem a bit implausible in its literary portrayal, but the movie gets the tone and scope of the place just right. District Twelve is the home of our main protagonist, Katniss Everdeen, a teenager charged with the responsibility of taking care of her mother and sister after the passing of her father in a mining accident. As if life weren't difficult enough on a day to day basis, every year the Capitol organizes ""The Hunger Games"", a duel to the death in which two tributes, a boy and a girl, are enlisted from each district to battle for survival. The event is supposed to serve as a reminder and punishment of the failed rebellion against the capital which took place 74 years prior. In an unfortunate turn of the odds, Katniss is forced to volunteer for her younger sister once she is selected for participation in the games, and together with Peeta Mellark, the male tribute of District Twelve, she heads off into the unknown and, most likely, towards her demise.<br/><br/>The key to understanding the event itself is that it represents a piece of entertainment, similar to the gladiator fights of Ancient Rome. As the participants are groomed for a televised show, the macabre concept behind the games may be easy to lose out of sight, and it is at this point that the direction of the film becomes a bit skewed and decides to evade/underplay one of the central plot lines in the book. In the transition from Katniss' literary narrative to the cinematic transposition, her struggle with herself and those around her, in particular Peeta, loses out. As the two tributes, under the guidance of their mentor, decide to play out a love story in order to endear themselves to the public, the film's focus shifts to the more easily translatable tension resulting from the potential love triangle between Peeta, Katniss and her childhood friend Gale (who remained in District Twelve), rather than focusing on the constant ambivalence in Katniss' soul. This is particularly interesting once it becomes evident that Peeta has truly been in love with her for many years, while the question of her own feelings towards him are shrouded behind the importance of self-preservation.<br/><br/>Therefore, it is a shame that the film's choice is to portray the situation as a love triangle, set to develop further in the upcoming sequels, rather than to investigate the implication of how Katniss feels at odds with her situation and the role she has to play, knowing that in the end there is only one survivor to The Hunger Games. It is understandable that due to the scope of the movie franchise this would be a bit harder to sell, but it undermines one of the most fascinating themes of the book, the journey of Katniss' self-discovery.<br/><br/>Implicitly, we get a fairly limited understanding of most characters and how they relate to one another. Despite this hindrance, Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson, who play Katniss and Peeta, manage to infuse a lot of what their characters are supposed to be into the final print of the movie, thereby conveying at least part of what is unwritten in the script and transpires from the books. Hopefully, the undertones of their relationship will be further expanded upon in the second movie, without focusing too much on the romantic dilemma, which serves as a backdrop in the books, rather than a driving force. <br/><br/>Also, what the movie managed to do quite well is create a fine rapport between President Snow, played with delightful and menacing restraint by Donald Sutherland, and the game-maker Seneca Crane. Their scenes shed some insight into the workings of the games which otherwise could have needed a rather tiresome narrative, while still defining two characters of interesting depth.<br/><br/>I can imagine some of the shortcomings mentioned are less evident to viewers who have not read the whole story, which leaves them with a pretty well rounded film about a cruel world that begs for many answers - but lacks a fair bit of heart. Seeing how difficult it is to rise up to the expectations of so many interested parties when producing a film like The Hunger Games, it is fair to say that the end result is a reasonably faithful and sensible adaptation of an engaging story. The politics behind Panem, which should feature more extensively in the second movie, will be a different challenge altogether, but the set-up for the sequel is solid and should offer a large enough scope to fulfill the vision of Suzanne Collins and her rather uncompromising characters."
"qwerty_x","Null","1","6","29 March 2012"," Good but overrated
","Firstly, I haven't read the book, and I judge a film on its own merits which is a good thing. I tend to be able to overlook the hype. Having said that, the film lacks in a few things. 1. the plot was too forced, there were moments that could've been built up better. 2. The use of shaky camera was too much and added to the 'forced' feel of the film. This is the main problem with directors who do this. They don't seem to get that viewers need to SEE what's going on to get into the story, and it's blurry it doesn't engage them, it has the opposite effect. 3. The emotional highpoint of the film was a scene with a minor character, not when Katniss volunteered instead of her sister or the ending, which it should've been. It lacked emotion where it counted. The pacing also could've used a bit of tightening, especially the scenes in the forest. The good parts: plot was engaging and good performance from Jennifer Lawrence, and the action is not bad. All in all, worth watching but it's not what it's hyped up to be."
"vang_lee2006","6","1","6","29 March 2012"," Not as dramatic as I thought it was going to be
","I a fan of the books, I was kind of disappointed at the movie. A few important scenes were cut out and the way that they altered the storyline from the book really didn't make me feel as connected to the characters as I was when I read the book. Most importantly, all the dramatic scenes that are supposed to sad, romantic, and thrilling were not as good as they were in the book. These scenes were kind of plain with very little emotions in the character that it made me feel like there wasn't really any climax to the movie. Bottom line is that this movie is something that you go watch just to see it and for entertainment purpose only, but don't expect to be moved by it as you were when you read the book."
"dave-1662","6","1","6","28 March 2012"," Shaky premise & even-shakier camera work
","I found the premise of the story to be really shaky. Who in their right mind would let a bunch of foppish boot-jacks keep them in a state of perpetual starvation while watching on in helpless silence as their children are dragged away into a kill-or-be-killed scenario -- for fun? For 75 years! With no objection from ANYONE, including the children? Hey kid, just smile and get on national TV, oops, sorry, you have TO KILL 22 OTHER CHILDREN?<br/><br/>Impossible. What this says about the author's view of the human spirit is very depressing, indeed. When the Nazis overran Europe, there was an Underground movement from Day One until liberation. Of COURSE people would rebel against such a regime.<br/><br/>As to the shaky camera-work, I have one word of advice for the director: please watch Inside Man directed by Spike Lee, and learn. That movie has terrific camera work that gets you right into the middle of the action without making you toss your cookies."

","When the movie first started thought to myself, wow, this is a simple movie, simple people moving about in a simple village (in the future?), doing simple things, shot in a simple setting (the woods), with simple photography, and then it got really big quickly. At first didn't see the bigger picture but then realized the filmmaker wanted to start us off in the simple life of the lead girl, day to day routine, hunting for food, taking care of her little sister and mom, and the nobility she carried for a young woman. Meet her love interest, or so we thought, and then oh, no, it's time for the sacrificial lottery, and holly crap, we're taken to a world of distinct class division and bizarre settings, people (or should I say characters), and the complete opposite of where the movie began. I then realized the set up, and the need to show the simplicity of the beginning of the movie, the contrast was perfect. Glad they didn't start at the lottery, right decision to wait until it was time. I know a lot of the movies out there want to start off with a bang but in this case it was the right decision to start on her and get to know her first. From what is heard the sequel is around the corner. Looking forward to that."

"dimarinc","7","1","6","26 March 2012"," Entertaining and Excellent but Will Be Overjudged
","The Hunger Games is actually the first movie that I've viewed after reading the book. As such I had mixed feelings going in, and my worry mainly pertained to event accuracy. I understand the nuances of making a movie and had I have donned the Directors cap I would've had to change parts to make it an acceptable movie for all crowds. However, this team executed the movie with a general focus on fact accuracy and the first hand experience.<br/><br/>The acting in this movie is great. The actors all reacted in the manor i envisioned while reading. The production quality is top notch, which was expected for such a high profile movie. The level of accuracy that this movie has in paralleling the book is astounding from an adaptation stand point. It can be very difficult to make an entertaining movie that closely follows the structure of a book, but they were able to.<br/><br/>I'd like to start out by saying that this is a great movie, but being that I read the book, I had some criticisms. The biggest one in the execution of subtleties. This movie tried very hard to define the dystopian world and spent a lot of the movie's ""free"" time on that. However, the visuals are enough that i felt this time may have been better spent expanding on the other characters in the movie. Emotions also took a back seat. Katniss is portrayed as a very strong emotional character, but a lot of the emotions around the various events felt rushed and lost. <br/><br/>I would easily recommend this movie to everyone. However I don't think it will be as highly rated as it is successful. If anything I would recommend reading the book. Because I think if you wanted to make this movie you have it stray a little further and create its own identity. Trying to capture everything the book offered in just over 2 hours is an impossible task."
"SirBreeze","6","1","6","26 March 2012"," Works fine in the city, not so much in the woods
","Like many other, I first saw the trailer, was intrigued and only then learned that it's actually a ""young adult"" novel. That label makes me sick and I went to see the movie only on a recommendation.<br/><br/>First of all, the theme seems a lot like ""Running Man"", both the novel and the movie. I won't say it's a ripoff, but you just can't neglect it. From the dictatorial regime throwing a bloody reality game, down to the flamboyant host, and even the flashy colors in the TV studio and the costumes. But that's probably just me.<br/><br/>The intro and the Capitol parts are very convincing and a little disturbing, it really made me think and I'm not easily fooled by sugarcoated Hollywood c**p. The decadent society of the well-fed, who seem oblivious to the real world of poverty and despair beyond their impressive city, is not so unbelievable and I really see it as one possible future. High marks for that one.<br/><br/>However, the action part in the woods is drawn-out and only average, with shaky camera-work not really helping matters. The same story could have been told in less time and with more believability and that would've made it much more enjoyable.<br/><br/>What puzzles me, and some other reviewers as well it seems, is the down-played hunger. Kids who are reduced to squirrels as their main protein source seem completely cool when brought to a world where each meal is a feast - and many scenes take place at the table. It's either poorly acted or poorly written.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the violence was cleverly depicted: I don't need buckets of blood to feel something very gory and tragic is happening, I don't need to see skulls crack and limbs torn to think it's a good action movie.<br/><br/>A bit about the cast. Woody - so so, Sutherland phones it in, Bentley seems more interested in his beard than the acting, Banks' character needed to be given more, because she seems she could have pulled it off. Hemsworth and Hutcherson - eye candy for teen girls. Jennifer Lawrence is quite good and deserves a mention. I don't have a particularly good opinion of her acting skills, but here she pulled off a good performance, again, more convincing in the city even though her character is more at home in the woods.<br/><br/>Overall, an uneven film that still manages to be intriguing but leaves you wanting more. Maybe I'm the jaded, cynical 30-something that wants more grit and much more social commentary. But then again, it's a movie aimed at a very different audience and on that level it succeeds much better. What works both ways is the need to straighten up the directing and pay more attention to characters. Maybe the sequels will be better."
"fulkrum78-968-389851","7","1","6","25 March 2012"," Great effects, decent version of the film, but characterization lacking...
","I read the books for this series based on the recommendations of friends. The amount of screen time given to this part of the story gave me a lot of hope. The effects overall are excellent. Once the kids get to the arena, the effects really nail the scenes from the books. My one complaint is where the contestants enter the arena, I had kind of hoped for a bit more with the flames, but oh well.<br/><br/>Overall, the story sticks to the plot and scenes from the book, which is nice. Some of the additions/subtractions make good sense for the film. I did miss the Mayor's daughter who gives Katniss her Mockingjay pin though, but again, it makes sense with the time allowed.<br/><br/>My biggest complaint was in the character development. You get none of the explanation for why Katniss is closed off and survival driven. No real reason to appreciate Cinna and what he brings to the story. None of the appeal of the Rue. You also miss out on the fans reaction to events in the arena (food being sent to Katniss from Rue's District). Rue herself is a sympathetic character, but you get none of the back-story involved with her, her district, or why it is so important overall when Katniss decides to trust her in the arena. I understand the need to cut some things out so that the story doesn't run to 4hrs, but it helps when you actually feel some attraction to the characters on screen. <br/><br/>While I liked the movie, I didn't feel any real connection to the characters on screen. Since one of the things I enjoyed so much about the books was the characters in them, I can't help but miss them in the movies.<br/><br/>Overall a good movie for the effects and sticking to the books, but I hope that a bit more time is spent on the next two developing the characters."
"breckham101","7","1","6","25 March 2012"," Good movie, played it too safe
","The Hunger Games, as many of you know was a very violent book. If you're expecting violence from this movie you're not going to be satisfied. While the story was well executed, and the acting was nothing to complain about, the main problem is the the camera work. The camera is extremely shaky in this movie. The reason for this is 3 reasons: one to save money, two to cover up the gore and violence, and three to build up tension. Probably the goriest visual in the movie is a close up of a cut or two. I am only complaining about that because many people that have read the book have told me how violent it was. Because the main audience of The Hunger Games trilogy is young adults they made the horrible mistake of making this movie PG13. The books, so I've heard, should get a solid R. They purposefully toned down the violence making for a relatively boring character story. Don't get me wrong the character development was superb, but due to the lack of scenes with actual visible violence it is hard to see that the characters are in any real danger. Also without the violence there isn't that sense of disgust towards the antagonists. It all seemed like a game show and the acting does not provoke terror into the audience. Because the characters do not look like their terrified. The actors made the horrible decision of not going past their limits. In other words these were actors who didn't take the emotional part of the film and run with it for the fear of looking stupid. Since the actors didn't want to do more than they wanted to, the main way to instill suspense is through gruesome violence. But no you can't have that because the director thought it was suppose to PG-13. By the way what's so horrible that you can't market a movie that's rated R towards young adults? ""I would really want to go see The Hunger Games but it's rate R and my parents would have to come and then I wouldn't look cool."" No! If you are not willing to go see a film with a guardian than you are not mature enough to watch the film. I honestly think they could've made this PG, that's toned down the film was. On the bright side though some of the characters do have humorous lines, and there some very interesting characters. If you like the book rent this movie. My Verdict: 6/10: To rent and watch once."

","I read the first book of the series and simply haven't had time to go back and read the rest. I am definitely not the type of person to complain about movie adaptations because it is a very different process and I believe both have to be appreciated separately. This movie is not only an amazing mainstream epic but, much like the book, has a lot of depth and really captivating and interesting political undertones. I don't care if this isn't a new concept...what is? So it borrows a basic concept from Battle Royale...BIG DEAL!! We get it...you've seen the Truman Show...get over yourself. The Hunger Games is a brilliantly crafted, cleverly violent, very well acted adventure epic that is worth all the praise it has received. Yes the morality and political concepts are not new but that doesn't make them any less important. I do agree that the film is violent and definitely not for younger viewers but the film makers deserve a lot of kudos for handling the violent elements with class and as appropriate as possible for its demographic. The way they film it absolutely gets the point across and leaves you sick to your stomach without it being gratuitous. I also thought this was one of the best book adaptations I have ever seen. They actually manage to capture nearly every aspect of the book into the film and that isn't easy. They introduce the world and the characters carefully and with excellent pacing and save the actual games for the last third of the film.<br/><br/>New Hollywood superstar Jennifer Lawrence wouldn't have necessarily been the first actress I would have thought for Katniss. I always pictured her younger. However, now, Lawrence IS Katniss. She is strong willed, rough around the edges, an amazing heroine. She is probably one of the best female heroes in film history I think. She isn't fake or overplayed and she feels real and passionate and charismatic on screen. She is the heart and soul of this film. Josh Hutcherson is Peeta, Katniss' fellow tribute in her district. I feel like Hutcherson seems a little out of his league at times in this film. He isn't bad in the role and he and Lawrence have good chemistry but he definitely pales in his performance next to Lawrence and comes across as very needy which I didn't get the vibe from his character in the book. Both of them are great though at capture different sides of being a Hunger Games tribute and some of the best scenes are the sheer look of terror, amazement and stunned fearful anticipation from the reaping to the actual games. Liam Hemsworth seemed to get talked about a lot for his role as Gale but he really has very little screen time. That being said he establishes a fantastic chemistry with Lawrence and you definitely hope to see more of him in future sequels. The supporting cast of the film is nearly brilliant. Stanley Tucci (one of my favourite supporting characters), Elizabeth Banks, Willow Shields (again very little screen time but impressive setup for a character), Wes Bentley, Woody Harrelson (also one of my favourite characters--and Harrelson is brilliant in his portrayal), Lenny Kravitz, Amandla Stenberg (great in her role but the role is really downplayed in the film considering how important it is to the overall story), and the Presidential and deliberately evil seeming Donald Sutherland as President Snow (a role I hope we see far more of in the future.) The other tributes in the games are all very good but short lived and don't get a lot of screen time. There are truly many terrific performances in the film from the entire cast.<br/><br/>There was a lot of negative reactions to Gary Ross' directing in The Hunger Games. He does love the shaky cam style but for the most part it works in this movie. You need the chaotic feel and you also need to avoid showing gratuitous violence while still getting the message across and like it or not the shaky cam does that well. He still crafts the dysotopian world brilliantly. The characters are vibrant and the film moves along at a terrific pace considering it clocks in at two and a half hours. I think its noteworthy that Gary Ross hasn't had a lot of experience directing but he absolutely knows how to create a terrific story. This deserves every bit of the attention and money that it gets. It is a mainstream epic that was created with great thought and care and let's hope they continue the series with the same quality. 9.5/10"
"drumbeats1513","9","1","7","2 May 2012"," An Excellent Critique on Society
","The Hunger Games is a superb dystopian movie and novel. While some may call this a typical dystopian movie about the atrocities of some modern utopic society; I think it goes much deeper. <br/><br/>The Hunger Games movie is an excellent critique on the dangers of a completely materialistic society, in which man is seen as merely a material object. This cleverly crafted criticism is depicted through the people of the Capitol. Throughout the movie you see the disparity between the Capitol and the rest of Panem. The people of the Capitol are displayed as garish and overly extravagant. This is a society completely based on materialism, excess and frivolity. Although not seen in this movie, Suzanne Collins describes later in the series that the very meaning of Panem comes from the phrase 'panem et circenses' Latin for bread and circuses. The meaning is often used to describe Roman society, who appeased the crowds with bread and gladiatorial games. The Capitol is a society in which every person's wants and needs are provided for. The games then, are simply to keep them entertained; it's a distraction from the boredom of life. I also think that the site of Panem as modern America is another interesting point to ponder, as America has often been described as the 'New Rome.' <br/><br/>The movie portrays not just the injustice of the games but begs the question ""what is man in a completely materialistic society?"" What makes the people of the Capitol barbarous is not their technology, or even their wealth, but their refusal to see these children or 'tributes' as anything more than objects. I love the scene of Katniss and Peeta's the last night together before the games, where Peeta says ""I keep wishing I could think of a way to show the Capitol they don't own me. That I'm more than just a piece in their Games."" This movie depicts that man is not merely an object, animal or machine, he must be something more. All told, this movie is a great watch. I would recommend it to anyone who loves a thought provoking story."

","I have seen (in my opinion) a few of the most fantastic films in the world, and The Hunger Games is one on my list. It is astonishing just how wonderful is. It is action-packed and makes your heart go insane in your chest. I went to see it with my friend - who has read the books and seen the film more than twice - and we jumped and screamed and laughed and sobbed like babies. Stanley Tucci is hilarious with his blue hair and Hunger Games talk show - very funny and cute. My friend knew I'd love Peeta, and she was completely right; Peeta is an incredibly lovable and sweet character. The gruesome parts are quite graphic, but if you ignore the blood and guts and the cannons signifying a tribute just died (very emotional, to be honest, but excellently done) you see an emotional and heart-breaking and mesmerising film that will captivate you from the very beginning right until the very end."
"mirwais-orbit","7","1","7","23 April 2012"," Far better than the book
","The Hunger Games is a surprise. For the first time I've watched a movie that is better than the original material. In a era that every channel has a new kind of reality TV program, like those ones that Truman Show (1998) and EdTV (1999) predicted a lot in a brief past, Suzanne Collins' idea sounds, by its own merits, interesting. And although her mix and parallels between reality shows and Roman Empire ""panem et circenses"" are by far the most interesting idea that came back to pop culture in the last couple years, I didn't like the book for a lot of reasons.<br/><br/>The success of the book trilogy is completely understandable. Until 10 yrs back book series wasn't exactly a product of consumption until The Lord Of The Rings become more popular than it was. Then Harry Potter followed the success of its major source of inspiration, becoming the first young adult series to become a world wide hit. When the series was close to its end people was crazy for a new stuff, searching for a new book series that could replace it. Then Twilight saga was discovered and later, The Hunger Games.<br/><br/>Unlikely Twilight saga, which entire movie series was made for young people that loved it without reasons because it is incredibly bad, this one is for a totally different audience. First of all because there is a real actress there, second because Gary Ross (director and writer) did a good work taking the essence of the book and amplifying it, never hiding from the audience that everything is a TV show, even the cheesy romance. But the good thing about Collins' saga is that it always was more interesting as a material to be used in the future than as literature. All three books of the brief saga are short, with a lack of description and poor narrative that would only satisfy those ones looking for a new subject. So, the best achievements of the screenwriters (including Collins herself) were taking all these flaws and transform them into a movie that does what the book fails: dive you into it.<br/><br/>The 1st person narrative that Collins uses is an extremely old technique for those ones who does not succeeds a lot into other different perspectives, cutting a lot of what could be a great experience if a much more described narration was used instead. And that is what the movie does, it shows you the different and wider perspectives that the book does not.<br/><br/>Gary Roos, who directed that sweet movie called Pleasentville (1998) and the great Seabiscuit (2003) had the same gentle hands here and the supporting actors give to the movie another high level. Elizabeth Banks performed Effie Trinket exactly as she is in the books. Woody Harrelson and Stanley Tucci (and his prosthetic teeth) were far better than the way Collins describe them.<br/><br/>But at the same time that the movie feels better than the book, sometimes it also fails. It cuts some important facts of the book wasting time on Katniss hiding, crying and running or other uninteresting facts that if doesn't bore us, dumbs us. There are so much open space for close shots too, and also plenty of 1st person shots, which sometimes are interesting, connecting the audience to what the character is experiencing, but there is a time that it stops being interesting to become dull. For a movie rated PG 13, I think that more should have been shown like the fighting between other tributes which would have given us the feeling of what a true hunger game is. Instead, the tributes are shown as a bunch of teenagers in high school bullying each others.<br/><br/>Its success is fair because it's not bad when compared to other low quality movies made for this age group. It has bad moments, but as a whole it deserves attention and Jennifer Lawrence deserves this success."

","'THE HUNGER GAMES': Five Stars (Out of Five) <br/><br/>Blockbuster adaptation of the immensely popular young adult novel (of the same name) by Suzanne Collins. It was directed and co-written (with Collins and Billy Ray) by Gary Ross (who also wrote and directed such popular classics as 'PLEASANTVILLE' and 'SEABISCUIT'). The film stars Jennifer Lawrence, who rose to fame in 2010's 'WINTER'S BONE' in which, at age 20, she was the second youngest actress ever to be nominated for a Best Actress Academy Award! The movie is a very powerful and moving film going experience that is highlighted by Ross's masterful directing and Lawrence's outstanding performance! <br/><br/>The film is a science fiction action drama film that tells the story of a dystopian post-apocalyptic future set in the world of Panem. Panem consists of 12 poor districts ruled by a wealthy city known as the Capitol. The masses once attempted to rebel against the Capitol but failed and as punishment are now subject to 'The Hunger Games', a reality TV series broadcast for the public to watch in which a boy and girl (between the ages of 12 and 18) are selected from each district every year to fight to the death in a bloody arena. This first chapter (in a trilogy) revolves around Katniss Everdeen (Lawrence), a sixteen year old who volunteers to participate in the game in order to save her twelve-year-old sister (Willow Shields) from having to. She's joined by Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson), who's selected as the male participant, from their district.<br/><br/>Most young adult novel adaptations are poorly made films (the biggest example being 'THE TWILIGHT SAGA') and it's because they usually come from crappy books. 'THE HUNGER GAMES' is one exception that is widely seen as a very well written book series (another being the 'HARRY POTTER' books) and this first film adaptation is probably the best youth book movie yet! It's extremely dark and violent for a teen movie and I actually think it should have been rated R rather than PG-13; the themes and subject matter are pretty intense and disturbing but that's also why I think so highly of it. It's a very effective and nightmarish film going experience. Shocking, tragic and heartfelt (I cried multiple times while watching it).<br/><br/>Lawrence is gorgeous and about as strong a role model for young people as you could ask for. She's everything I would want in a woman as well. She gives an award worthy performance and really powers the film into masterpiece territory. Ross is about as good a writer and director for the material as the producers could have asked for as well. It's the best film I've seen this year!<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KzFGXKpG30"
"trevorruth","6","1","7","18 April 2012"," The games will change everyone
","While I must confess I was never that big a fan of the novels that this film was based off of, I felt that this movie actually did a decent job incorporating a unique style of its own while staying true to the source material. The first half of the film was awesome, the gloomy atmosphere of District 12 was perfectly portrayed through establishing shots of the life around the district, as well as the set in which actual concrete elements used to flesh out the setting- made the realism of the film all the more stronger. There are, unfortunately, moments when CGI rears its ugly head to create futuristic landscapes that look artificial and lifeless, and it contrasts senselessly with the scenic nature of District 12. With that said, I do think that Ross tried his hardest not to incorporate CGI as much as possible, which I commend him for, by all means. As far as the plot is concerned, it's a bit hit-and-miss. Yes, we're all aware of the similarities between this and Fukasaku's Battle Royale, but the acting in this film felt a little wooden. The characters didn't show the slightest bit of sympathy or remorse when they murdered one of the contenders in the game, and the script was riddled with the kind of clichés one would find in a young adult novel(Yes, it's based on a young adult novel, but I digress). Furthermore, a lot of elements were left unexplained and felt quite ridiculous. But, then again, if you think about the synopsis for the backstory... I guess you couldn't expect much else. There are some interesting camera angles used to enhance the intensity of the games, which work quite well, and the brutality may not be as bloody as Battle Royale, but the emotion of the first couple of deaths are just as exhausting. I do think that once the movie hits the actual 'games,' it starts to take a nose-dive. The plot succumbs to the generic clichés that you'd expect to find in a film such as this, and a lot of the elements used to enhance the way the 'games' are played are too vague in design that it breaks away from the reality of the plot. But for what it's worth, it's still a damn good movie. It has great action, decent acting, and while the entirety of the script may not be perfect, its still entertaining to watch. Definitely consider checking this one out."
"neighborlee","7","1","7","18 April 2012"," Poignant, and often gruesome modern day Roman gladiators ,asking should we
","In todays world , where classes divide people, we have middle income America, and on each end , the poor and the elite on the far end of the spectrum.<br/><br/>Often the two rarely meet or have much in common, but no one cares when you enter a fight for your life, and in this movie those that are vying for the right to life, are but mere children. If that notion scares you as a mother or a teen, this movie may not be for you . I personally think that while the movie doesn't leap to the level of 'saw' or similar types, its enough to have possibly warranted a R rating. I would certainly think twice about taking a teenager, because some scenes are extremely vivid.<br/><br/>That sad, while I went into the movie expecting horrific things, I admit to being overall impressed with the take away.<br/><br/>The harsh reality sets in as a opulent and lavishly dressed 'announcer' shouts names from a list of teens to be involved in a gruesome last-teen-standing duel. We are then presented with a short 'video' explaining why all this has come to pass , and that those involved in this 'battle' most violent, are there due to a treasonous event of their ancestors. A high price to pay for civil disobedience, though we aren't told the details of any of it.<br/><br/>You do not need details, when its rather clear why everyone is there and the cruelty about to unfold, and I suspect those details will be present in some 'sequel'.<br/><br/>As I sat watching, I was pleasantly surprised to see not just another gruesome violent fest, but real philosophies being presented; as in out of the mouthes of babes . These aren't all just willing participants, but in a few cases, reluctant, sometimes to the point of rebellion at great risk of bodily peril.<br/><br/>'Players' are thrust into a environment ( after coaching), not unlike the gladiators of ancient Rome. It's quite unsettling given the age group of the people involved, but it sets a proper tone for what is to come. The innocent of youth, thrust into the barbarity of war, and those 'in charge' with their opulence and extremes, poised over their materialism to the exclusion of the safety of those about to fight.<br/><br/>The movie includes not only great acting from a young new cast, but exciting visuals, exciting if not basic plot line and amazing visuals of a world seeming full of technology, yet some questionable morals.<br/><br/>To consider ones death yet remain true to their nature, as well as wishing a end to the sickness , where rooting for a victor , yet sadness when a entrant succombs, are expressed sentiments.<br/><br/>This is no pure gore fest, but do take care in taking those young adults who may need to wait a few years before seeing something so visually troublesome. Everyone else will see a movie that on the outset may seem gruesome and violent, yet inside containing questions of us all, in a sometimes world where injustice and elitism rule the day.<br/><br/>A decent see not for its violence, but the questions asked by the participants."
"Thomas-Giffin","7","1","7","18 April 2012"," A Film Worth Watching
","I must begin my review by stating that I have not read the books. My views may be altered if I did read them but I have not and this may be taken into account<br/><br/>I was initially hesitant about seeing the film mostly because I had up to that point assumed that it was a watered down version of Battle Royale, a soulless and charmless big budget film aimed at young adults.<br/><br/>I was only half right.<br/><br/>The film does have noticeable similarities to Battle Royale, the idea of youngsters fighting to the death is similar to both films as is the purpose of the fight being a tribute or lesson to keep a fragmented society in line. Where the two differ is that whilst Battle Royale was a controversial and twisted pieces aiming its lens at social groups in schools and how school children would react in a 'kill or be killed' situation, The Hunger Games instead is a much less cynical study of individual strength and psyche. Whilst a group does form early in The Hunger Games, it is not a social clique as would have been found in BR, it is instead a group of individuals who find that grouping up early helps themselves in the short term.<br/><br/>Another aspect of the film that really surprised me was the highlighting of just how important and pervasive the media is in the film. Centered around the fantastic Stanley Tucci, the media and appearance play a huge role in making each participant in the Games popular (an attribute that helps the participants). Tucci interviews each youngster and tries his best to show each in their best light to give audience a good show. It was a theme I was not aware would come up when I started to watch the film.<br/><br/>So I guess the best and most flattering way I could describe the film would be a mix of both Battle Royale and The Running Man, in particular Richard Dawson's character in the latter (in reality, he used to host a popular US gameshow, a stunning piece of casting). <br/><br/>I've already mentioned Stanley Tucci's acting in this film and he is only one piece of a solid cast, each performing the solid script without fault. Jennifer Lawrence in particular shines as Katniss, her performance is incredibly nuanced, intelligent, strong, resourceful, shy and emotive. She does a fantastic job. So does the always entertaining Woody Harrelson. Another surprise (in a good way) is Donald Sutherland as the President, a chillingly subtle portrayal of a leader without much screen time or lines, a pleasure to watch.<br/><br/>The direction is perfectly fine apart from an occasional over-use of the hand-held camera work, not so much an issue during quieter scenes but during the action it really turns the events on the screen into streaking blurs. This helps keep a lot of the violence implied (thereby achieving it's 12A rating despite quite a dark tone), as well as creates a documentary feel that plays against the calmer (still not static) shots of the capitol and the cameras in the Games itself.<br/><br/>The film goes on with a long running time of just over 2 hours and 20 minutes and it does feel long. They could have easily have trimmed at least 15 minutes without losing too much of the films power and emotion. The actual event itself doesn't happen until at least halfway through (it seems) so you have a sudden jarring change in pace from the slow buildup to the rapid culling of several minor (really, really minor) participants and the rest of the film is a slow fight for survival. Not in itself a bad thing but the pace really switches up and down very unevenly at times. <br/><br/>However, whilst the 84% it currently resides on at Rotten Tomatoes I think is a tiny bit high (I'd say closer to 75-80%), it is a very good film and it is proof that you can turn a popular young adult novel into a complex, thrilling and entertaining film."

","Gary Ross directed The Hunger Games, based on the screenplay by himself and Suzanne Collins (she is also the novelist) and Billy Ray, with much aplomb. <br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence, Josh Hutcherson and Liam Hemsworth were all very good.<br/><br/>Summary: There is an annual event whereby the capital of the nation of Panem makes sections to send a boy and a girl to compete in what is known as the Hunger Games.<br/><br/>Televised all over the nation, the event has Tributes fighting each other until the last tribute is left standing. Our hero (heroine), Katniss, uses her instincts and skills that she learned from a former victor. It's basically the survival of the fittest.<br/><br/>I've read the books. In the book, Katnis has clear thoughts about everything, which is kind of missing in the movie. I really wish that aspect was played up more in the movie. But given that the filmmakers ended up with a fast moving and action packed theatrical piece of entertainment, I can excuse the omission."
"Das-Virus2002","7","1","7","15 April 2012"," Great idea, decent movie
","First of all: no, I did not read any of the books, but I still found myself mildly enjoying this movie.<br/><br/>However, to me it felt as if the producers were forced to shoot this movie as smooth and hip as possible and did not even bother trying to make this a mature, deep, and dense movie.<br/><br/>The story in itself is rather simple: set in a future about 100 or so years after our present day, the United States are long gone. They have been torn apart in a civil war, and the eventual victor of this war was to be known as ""The Capitol"". This is the name of the city that has become the new capital of ""Panem"", a country existing of 13 districts that are divided by their duties (as every district is forced to produce certain goods that will be used in the Capitol), but united in their hatred against the totalitarian regime that is the Capitol.<br/><br/>One district, District 13, tried to initiate a coup d'état some 74 years prior to the incidents of the movie - but failed miserably and was thus extinguished by the Capitol. From that time on, the remaining 12 districts were forced to offer one boy and girl between 12 and 18 years of age every year. These children were drawn from a lottery and had to participate in the ""Hunger games"". These are, coincidentally, very closely related to the gladiator fights in ancient Rome - and the similarities go even beyond that. A lot of the names occurring in this movie are of Latin descent, such as Caesar, Seneca, Flavius and Octavia.<br/><br/>As Katniss Everdeen's 12-year old sister is being drawn to participate in the games, Katniss herself offers to serve as the ""tribute"" in order to protect her little sister. When she teams up with the male drawn from the lottery, Peeta, she senses they might even have a chance to survive this nightmare - but only, if they work together.<br/><br/>So far about the story and background, now on to the cinematics: As far as SFX go, this movie is very good. Not great, and certainly no Avatar or Hugo Cabret, but it serves its purpose and is somewhat organic and realistic. The acting, however, was pretty dull, stiff and overall mediocre at best.<br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence may be a breathe of fresh air in Hollywood due to her untypical behavior and willingness to call out fellow actors and VIPs, but her acting skills are pretty limited. She basically knows only two emotions: disinterested and angry. Any variation within these two is pretty much non-existent and other emotions seem to have vanished from her mimics ages ago.<br/><br/>Her counterpart, Josh Hutcherson, certainly is no better. His skill set may eventually be broader than hers, but his character is limited to knowing only compassionate, hopeful, and gullible.<br/><br/>Most of the actors' depth derives from supporting actors such as Woody Harrelson (who does an awesome job playing the grumpy, cranky former winner of the games, Haymitch), Wes Bentley, and even Lenny Kravitz.<br/><br/>The worst part of the movie, however, was the camera. Sometimes we sat there and thought ""What is this guy with the camera doing?"" or ""Is he drunk?"". Cinematic shots are an absolute rarity in this movie, and the cutting and editing crew has done a poor job of giving it the look and feel of a music video that is cut about a 1,000 times a minute.<br/><br/>Due to these restrictions in the actual ""art part"" of the movie, it is no more than just a nice flick that could have been so much better had it been developed and shot right.<br/><br/>A movie with a storyline like that has to focus more on the psychological aspects and raw fear and anxiety of the protagonists participating in the game rather than some dull ""What am I doing here?""- moments. The true horror of such a situation can only unfold if there actually is horror shown, but the gore factor of this movie is minimal at best."
"raphael-weber1","7","1","7","11 April 2012"," The book movie syndrome
","I wasn't really surprised after I watched the movie when I learned that it is actually based on the first of a trilogy of books. It felt that way.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, the movie itself is quite entertaining, but there's missing a part. When a story takes place in a dystopic world I'd like to know more about that world because it is vital to understand the different characters and their motives. I obviously haven't read the books and from that perspective I found that the movie gave me very little information about the world's history. I think it wasn't even mentioned that there was a revolution during which district 13 was annihalated. I actually had to look that up on wikipedia. I know it's a difficult task to make a movie out of a book because you can only make a movie so long but I think there have been other movies which did this way better than Hunger Games (Harry Potter would come to my mind). <br/><br/>To sum my impressions up: Good movie, but it could have been better if it focused a little less on everything around the hunger games and a little bit more on the people and the world they're living in because that's what the whole trilogy is about."
"myungjahigh","7","1","7","11 April 2012"," It was pretty good for me
","I've never read the original books before, and I enjoyed this movie. I had not expected that much about the movie... maybe that's why I found it fun during the running time. Still, I am satisfied with the movie and it makes me want to read books. I heard there are some people who argue that The Hunger Games actually stole the idea from Japanese literature and movie called Battle Royale. I am a huge fan of Battle Royale, and I also think the idea of 'killing' game is quite similar. However, it looks hard to say that The Hunger Games copied the idea of Battle Royale. People killing others in order to survive is a common theme in literary or media works, I guess. And The Hunger Games and Battle Royale are entirely different films. <br/><br/>While watching this movie, I thought that the audiences from Panem are similar to people of the real world including myself. They are eager to watch more horrible and provocative things in media. It's getting worse in these days. Also, I felt that the world in the film is not that different from real. District 1, a strong one, already established the structured and well organized system to make its own weapon. In contrary, a weak District 12 cannot help but participate the games for living. And the Panem which takes control over the districts looks just hideous even though it is decorated with colorful stuff. I sympathized with the movie in terms of these points.<br/><br/>Anyhow, I think the movie The Hunger Games is enjoyable enough. It is thrilling, and it's too terrible to imagine... I am waiting for the next series, and I'd like to read the books."
"amyclay2","9","1","7","10 April 2012"," Enjoyed this film even with bits missing.
","I saw this film today and I was mostly impressed with the film, I enjoyed it a lot. I took two friends who had no idea before hand except from watching the trailers and one reading some of the first book. They both enjoyed it and said it was better than what they thought it would be like.<br/><br/>Good points: . They included most details about the books, I loved the scenes in the capitol such as the chariots and the interviews were pretty good. The games themselves were good as they involved most of the events from the books e.g Katniss blowing up the careers food, Rue's death, the trackerjacker nest. The score: was pretty good as well and mostly matched the film, the sweetness of some scenes still had dark elements to remind the audience the games is still going. <br/><br/>Not so good points: The soundtrack: The soundtrack really does not feature at all in the film until the credits. None of the songs were on there so Taylor Swift's ""Safe and Sound"" was not anywhere in the film as many of us expected it somewhere around Rue's death. I do not know why the songs were not on there and I was slightly disappointed as the album would have been better called: ""Songs that relate to the hunger games but are not in the film until the credits"". So if your going to see the film for the soundtrack you won't find it till the end. The score was there just no soundtrack. The cast: My problems with the cast are only little just with heights and eye colour (Peeta's eyes are meant to be blue, but he was still good to watch) but their easily overlooked. The main problem with the cast was some characters were missing e.g Madge who plays a good part in the books as she gives Katniss the pin and in Catching Fire explains the pin a bit more to Katniss. Time: The film is long its 2 hours and 22 minutes so by the end I had to walk around a fair bit to get the feeling back in my legs so be prepared to stretch whilst watching the film. The problem I have with the time is it felt in the film a little out of place as certain sections of the games felt faster than others and some parts had much longer time. Towards the end of the film when the mutts appear it is supposed to last a whole night roughly in the film it lasts in their time a few minutes. Time affected the film as some scenes did feel rushed due to how long film had to be. Katniss is meant to be in the games for a few weeks but it felt like she was in for a few days.<br/><br/>Anywho the film is still pretty good and the acting is good to go with it Cato and Clove were really good as you could feel the hate pouring out of them. I recommend this film to people over the age of 12 and if your one who doesn't like blood or mild teenage gore then be careful about seeing it.<br/><br/>May the odds be ever in your favour..."

","I did not read the book yet, but that will soon change. After seeing this movie I decided to change all that A – S – A - P. I will get the entire series of books and devour all of them little buggers as soon as possible. This movie left the starting gate like the slowest horse in the race. At first, there was no doubt this deprived thoroughbred was out of its league and overdue for a devastating tumble. I did not want to witness the poor thing keel over; kick its hooves in the air, and be carted off to the glue factory. I had to escape before the story's sad demise? Before I expedited my brilliantly formulated plan of a trip to the bathroom which included a no-return visit to the exit, the movie started to pick up the pace. Wow - am I glad I stayed? The trot quickly turned into an all-out run, and what a scary concept? I know it is all pretty far-fetched, and know that this so far from reality, it could never happen. But it did make for a good tale. There is no way that a government would allow its selected elites, big-money contributors and favorable entertainers to feast off the misery of tax-payers; scoff at those who disagree, and continually abuse hard workers. I am so relieved that could never happen. Just imagine how horrific it would be! To think that a government could lie, cheat and allow gross entertainment like, 'The Games', to continue, unchecked and unquestioned by a news media so blindly in the bag. Phew, such an idea just sends chills up my spine. At the same time, I am so glad NOTHING like this could ever happen. It is time for me to get back to reality. Anyways, the special effects were better than many other recent movies. I was happy to see that none of the usual flash and splash, which usually puts a flick over-the-top, was used as one of the supporting actors. Since I did not read the book I cannot really comment on how the cast did in portraying their characters. They seemed fine and convincing in their rolls. Just a side note; I was a little surprised to see Woody Harrelson in the roll he was in. I will admit, he did a very good job – I just thought he may have been better suited as President Snow, now that roll fit him like a glove. As far as writing and directing, I thought it was great. I will say this story was definitely a story not for those cerebrally challenged. Excellent story!!!"

","I saw the movie yesterday and before I go I should mention that there is never a movie that I love every single moment of it, there will always be one or two things that I don't like. This movie is no exception, but I can look past them in this case because it wasn't that big of a deal.<br/><br/>I was most worried about the ""shaky camera"" that many comments were referring to and honestly it was there in the first maybe half hour and then either I didn't noticed or it mostly stopped. As for the acting, I thought it was great. I have definitely seen worse it other book to movie adaptations *cough cough* twilight<br/><br/>As with every every adaption, everything in the book can't be brought to screen, but this movie brought all the important things and added a new twist with the control room that I loved. Great for those who didn't read the book to understand.<br/><br/>Biggest let down: No one looked hungry lol I do feel they could have portrayed the desperation for food better but alas its too late for that. (Its not that they didn't mention it at all, they did, just probably not enough for many fans liking)"
"isadianeburd","7","1","7","8 April 2012"," Best book adaptation since the first Harry Potter!
","I read the series and have fallen in love and obsessed over them, so when I went to the movies to see this, I had high expectations. And it did not fail. Sure there are some differences, but you can't exactly fit a everything in a 400 something page book into a 1 and a half hour movie. The casting was phenomenal and the set was stupendous. I can not wait for Catching Fire! I think that the production team did a great job. Jennifer Lawrence was the best choice for Katniss and Josh Hutcherson as Peeta was an amazing choice, and he did a fantastic job. I believe Rue was also magnificently cast, as was Alexander Ludwig as Cato. I am glad they chose some lesser known actors for the parts and not major Hollywood stars, because this movie was not meant to be a star studded Expendables type action film, but it was made for the book lovers and true Mockingjay fans. They left out some important parts, but they made it as close as they could to the series and did great. If you are looking for a If you h action film with great acting, then this is the movie for you. The relationships between the characters were well established, especially between Katniss and Cinna and Katniss and Peeta. Jennifer does a great job portraying Katniss's emotions to the audience and letting us get to know her as a detailed, emotional character. If you have not yet seen this movie or read the books, I highly recommend them. They will not let you down. If you are a fan of Harry Potter than this is definitely a must see for you. Not only does it have great acting, but we can actually see the characters grow throughout the movie and gain respect and feelings towards one another. The book and movie are extremely close and of curse the books are always better than the movies. There is no way to completely transform The Hunger Games novel into a movie due to the immense details in the book, but this movie is definitely the closest anyone can get to capturing the wonderful book into the time allotted for the movie. Hopefully people enjoy it as much as I do and fall in love with it enough to go out and buy the series that everyone is calling the greatest series ever written, and rightly so. This movie and the cast and crew deserve more credit and praise for their amazing work.... a job well done! My only problem is I wish that they had established more into detail the districts and which one does which. Also, I was disappointed that they l left out Madge but I guess they didn't have time for such a small character and felt that they could cut her character out to save time and avoid having to establish the importance of yet another character."
"thefish101755","6","1","7","8 April 2012"," Made for people who read the books.
","Let me start off by saying that this movie is not garbage.<br/><br/>What I will say is that this movie was, as my title says, made for people who had read the books. Everyone I know that was excited for this movie had read the books, from teenagers to adults. I was one from the very small population of people who had never read the Hunger Games. I had never really planned on seeing the movie, either, but on the insistence of a friend and after seeing Wrath of the Titans (I had to wash the bad taste of that movie out of my mouth), I went ahead and bought tickets. <br/><br/>What I saw was a decent movie. The action sequences were a little boring and I wasn't exactly held at the edge of my seat. (I've seen more intense movies.) However, overall it was okay. But there were definitely moments when I felt like I needed to have read the book. For example, the story mentioned 13 Districts rebelling but only 12 Districts participated in the tournament. What was the deal with the three fingers hand sign? <br/><br/>Also there were some illogical moments in the movie. Why was Peeta able to throw a hundred pound steel ball yet not throw down the boy from District 1 in the end? Why wasn't the girl with throwing knives able to hit Katniss out of that tree even though she could hit a target at the center 20 feet away earlier in the movie? <br/><br/>I could definitely feel like the movie needed to be edgier and more intense. I'm not saying that there needs to be more blood and gore but I could definite feel like the film was glossing over the violence and intensity with shaky camera moves and such. I mean, there are definitely more intense PG-13 movies out there (Casino Royale, Jurassic Park...) and I just didn't feel any tension in this film.<br/><br/>So, overall, it was decent but according to me, someone who has not read the books, the film could use some work."
"gendainobushi","7","1","7","5 April 2012"," Overall great story, but
","Well, I may or may not read the book, it doesn't matter. What matters is the ability to tell the story from scratch, and the movie didn't do that very well. <br/><br/>First of all, there wasn't any background at all. Except few lines of text at the beginning of the movie (which don't help much). I don't wanna feel like I'm missing out something because I didn't read the book. <br/><br/>2. Poor character development. Most of the movie I had to guess who's that guy and who's the other guy, and what are their parts in the universe. <br/><br/>3. Life at the twelve districts seem not so bad!! The few flashbacks don't help to portray the dramatically horrible life at the districts. Like President Snow said, ""The only thing more powerful than fear is hope"". Well, Mr. Snow, I didn't get that fear to begin with."
"jdn-hunt","9","1","7","4 April 2012"," Hungering for more.
","Reviewing the film purely on its cinematic merit and ignoring the source material, 'The Hunger Games' is a bold franchise starter, notably philosophical for a 'teen' blockbuster. The writers have devoted half of the running time to exploring, albeit only skimming the surface, the social and cultural ramifications of a nation hosting an annual televised bloodbath as punishment for a previous rebellion against the Capitol. The result is a surprisingly deep action drama that does so much more than offer predictable fan service.<br/><br/>With such provocative subject matter and an engaging script, director Gary Ross could have quite easily been complacent in his approach, but he instead raises the games with two contrasting shooting styles; one a blend of extreme close ups and long shots that give the first act the edge of a documentary, the second an aggressive 'shaky cam' that that is wholly appropriate to the action that takes place when the eponymous games finally begin. If the inevitable sequel is shot in an equally suitable manner, we can anticipate curiously what tone might be captured in 'Catching Fire'; until then 'The Hunger Games' succeeds in delivering action for the PG-13 crowd while its unnerving subtext plays to viewers of more refined tastes.<br/><br/>Stars Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson, playing Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Malark respectively as the 'tributes' chosen to represent District 12 in the 74th iteration of the Hunger Games, have a refreshing dynamic that complements the female character's unusual physical prowess over her male counterpart. Hutcherson faces a similar discrepancy acting against his co-star, who undoubtedly has the greater emotion to toy with, though it appears something central to establishing him as a more interesting character may have been lost in translation between the novel and the screen. Regardless, the pair accomplish an endearing chemistry that will cement their status as Hollywood's new 'power couple' in the wake of the final instalment in the 'Twilight' saga, which this series looks set to eclipse with the deserving success of this film.<br/><br/>'The Hunger Games' will undoubtedly garner a legacy for itself as being amongst more credible adaptations, its uncommon wide appeal ensuring an extensive audience as is only fitting for its brave efforts. Finally a studio can (and will hopefully continue to) fill cinema seats nationwide with a film that caters towards a spectrum of demographics.<br/><br/>9/10"
"Matt_Layden","7","1","7","3 April 2012"," The World Is Watching.
","The Capitol selects one boy and one girl from each of the 12 districts to compete in a fight till the death on live television event. 24 enter, one leaves, this is the Hunger Games. <br/><br/>It's incredibly hard not to compare this film to Battle Royale, I hate to do so, but the similarities are there and unfortunately for The Hunger Games, Battle Royale did it better. In the end, I did like it, but I can't help but feel that it was a lot of build up, with a mediocre delivery of the most important aspect of the film. They talk about how deadly the games are, how it's a fight for survival, but I never really felt that danger. I really do hate comparing it to Battle Royale, but that had a sense of danger. Battle Royale felt deadly, the characters seemed like they've been through hell, you felt sad to see characters die, here, not so much. The most deadly part was the bloodbath that occurred when characters ran to their weapons, then it seemed to be an autopilot. I might be the only one to say this, but this would actually work better as a television show. That way we can feel how devastating these games are, how long they are, how deadly they are. The film does not get this point across, at least not to me.<br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence was good in the lead role of Katniss, the only volunteer for the games. She shows how brave and heroic a female character can be (you suck Bella). She kicks more ass than any other character. That's another downfall, none of the other kids are really memorable. I wanted something unique for each kid to be memorable, but if they didn't speak a line, they were basically ghosts. There are 24 kids, with the exception of the obvious (Lawrence, Hutcherson, the ""villain"" kid, and the little black girl) everyone else fades away. I'm not asking for screen time to be dedicated to each one, but make some of them memorable. I knew who the redhead was because she had red hair, that's it. Again, Battle Royale did this right. They had the tech guys, the evil guy, the medical girls, the crazy girl, the romantics, the hero, etc. The smallest detail is enough to make someone in the background memorable. I had no idea who was dying.<br/><br/>The supporting characters are poorly written, specifically Hutherson's character Peeta. Hell, Liam Hemsworth's character Gale does absolutely nothing in the film except brood about Katniss, and yet one little scene where he grabs her little sister to take to her mother screams more about his character than anything Peeta does. Banks, Kravitz and Harrelson all serve to make Katniss all that she can be. Harrelson has some backstory to him, he won a previous game and has since become an alcoholic. <br/><br/>I hope more of the world is explored in the follow up films. They barely scratch the surface here, just the basics are given, which is really all we need for the first one, but I was hoping for a bit more of this world to be shown, specifically the Districts. I actually thought that all three books were about the games and that's what the films would be about. So when they wrapped up the game, I thought to myself, where are they going to go from here? But I suspect there will be some uprising and new characters introduced. As a stand lone flick, The Hunger Games works. It doesn't really leave you wanting to go deeper into the story, but it does tell the story it needs to tell and leaves it in a bow for you. It may not be a nice little bow, but it's enough.<br/><br/>The detractors of the film are many, like the love between Katniss and Peeta. It's never really explained if she does love him or if she is only doing it for the show and to survive. I suspect the latter will eventually turn into the former, but as of right now, the film does not make this clear. The shaky camera work distracts as well. Even when no action is taking place, we are all over the screen, making it hard to connect to those speaking. The film is also a tad lengthy, which can be bothersome to some, running at two hours and twenty minutes.<br/><br/>Despite those nitpicks, the film is entertaining. I guess I just expected a bit more from it, hearing rave reviews and it making millions. The training sequences are exciting and the initial build up, mainly the countdown, to the actual games is thrilling. As I said, I did like the film, I just had to point out those problems. As a film targeted towards teens, I recommend it."
"thefilmdiscussion","7","1","7","3 April 2012"," ""The Hunger Games"" - Well made, but it didn't bite hard enough
","The film adaptation of this first book in the popular Y.A. trilogy is visually stunning and packs an emotional wallop! Set in a bleak future reminiscent of something from a George Orwell nightmare, we find our heroine, Katniss Everdeen, thrust into a bloody tournament called The Hunger Games, where she is expected to fight to the death against 23 other youths, all of them under 18. The whole world tunes in to watch. In the universe of The Hunger Games, this is tantamount to the Olympics, and it happens every year. To most, this is entertainment.<br/><br/>The film is shot beautifully, the frame gritty and full of popping colors. We get down and dirty with the fighters, tributes as they are called, right down in the arena with them. It's a scary place. It's made all the more real by the outstanding performances by all, wholesome and sinister. Jennifer Lawrence is unstoppable it seems, and is destined for greatness. She is joined by other talented actors like Woody Harrelson, Wes Bentley, Donald Sutherland, Elizabeth Banks, Stanley Tucci, and Josh Hutcherson - all of whom pour their hearts into their characters, making their presence known no matter the amount of screen time. You feel these characters are real, and that they must exist, and so the gravity of their world is felt all the more. Fans of the books won't be let down, for the script is very true, and succeeds at capturing the essence of Suzanne Collins' vision for the world of Panem.<br/><br/>The theme of the books, and the film as well, is one of purposeful irony. Here we are, eyes glued to the silver screen, watching children murder each other. Are we to be excited when we witness them hacking each other to pieces? Even if it's a ""good guy"" kid impaling a ""bad guy"" kid? No, not at all. The film is a challenge to us all to reexamine what we find as entertainment, and ask ""why?"". What is it about reality television that keeps so many Americans tuning in week after week? Are we aware of an ever-pushing envelope? Do we make conscious efforts about what we watch, or do we simply watch what flashes on the screen in front of us. How strong is the media's alluring spin on our discernment about what is moral? I know I'm guilty.<br/><br/>Many find the film's storyline deplorable. Why? Is it not the attitude towards the material that we should be evaluating, not the subject that the writer has freely chosen to examine? To be angry at the film's theme and content, and even its approach to the material, is outrageous. You're not supposed to find it entertaining, it is supposed to make you sick and disturbed.<br/><br/>The film is simply a commentary of our society's disgusting love and heartfelt embrace of outrageously immoral behavior, expedited through and by the Media.<br/><br/>The Hunger Games could have been sharper, however. It could have examined these themes even more, it could have further and more explicitly explored the totalitarian society the film inhabits. The film plays a little light on the heavy subjects, and seems to cater more towards an audience that may not fully understand the deeper message. A PG-13 audience may be simply entertained, and that would be a tragedy.<br/><br/>Perhaps the film wasn't shocking enough, not enough to rattle the masses from their comfortable cages anyways, but merely enough to give them something to grumble about on the way back from the cineplex.<br/><br/>The Hunger Games is a film to ponder deeply, however surfacey it may seem. There are still two more films to come, and I hope they are even more powerful than this great first installment. May the odds be ever in their favor.<br/><br/>By TOMMY BOND, thefilmdiscussion.com"
"njeezy","6","1","7","1 April 2012"," Disappointed
","Frankly, this movie was quite a disappointment for me. The acting was pretty good but after all the hype generated the movie failed to live up to it's expectations. I was hoping for a lot of action but most of the first half of the movie was drama, which wasn't that bad, but there were very few actions scenes in the rest of the movie as well. And i think IMDb should include ""romance"" as a genre because romance plays a very very significant part in the movie. Also the ending was very poor and it wasn't worth going to the cinema to watch it. I would rate this movie 6.5 and at maximum 7. I haven't read the book so I don't know if the movie is better if you read the book. Overall it's not a bad film to watch, but I think if you have high hopes of it being an awesome movie, you would not enjoy it."
"lukaknicks","7","1","7","1 April 2012"," Good but many flaws
","The Hunger Games is a amazing and dramatic movie to watch. Everything that was written in the book was finally put into the big screen. The scenes picked for the movie are great and completely match the description in the book. Unfortunately,this movie has more flaws than I thought.<br/><br/>One problem was whenever there was a action scene the camera was always shaking. Another problem was that the movie was kind of rushed, I barely had a chance to catch a glimpse of some parts of the movie which still urges me to watch again and it's a waste of money to watch it again.<br/><br/>If you want to watch The Hunger Games, I guarantee that you will experience a dizzying and partially confusing movie."

","Note: I didn't read the books and saw this as a stand-alone movie. I also may be the only non-shill who actually liked this film. <br/><br/>If you check your left brain at the door and view this as a dystopian fairy tale, then you should enjoy this movie pretty well. It features simply fantastic cinematography, a trite but believable premise, a heroine you find yourself rooting for, and good acting from the primary cast.<br/><br/>If you check your right brain at the door and ignore the fantasy aspect of the movie, then you will see some extremely exaggerated plot elements, some bizarre inconsistencies, and a lot of rip-offs from other movies and literary stories, and generally will find yourself giggling a lot.<br/><br/>I chose to see the movie from a right-brained perspective and, hence, found it quite enjoyable, maybe even something I'd watch again or consider buying on DVD. The acting of lead actress Jennifer Lawrence was pure gold to watch. She was able to believably convey a great range of emotions and fully immersed in the character, giving a excellent performance. <br/><br/>Dwayne Boyd, as the uncreatively named ""Peacekeeper #1"" was also extremely believable, as was the performance of the characters' acerbic and wayward 'mentor', Woody Harelson. The supporting cast did OK, but I kept having the feeling I was watching a WB Network teenie-bopper-demographic type show whenever they were showcased. Anyone familiar with the shows ""One Tree HIll"" or ""Gilmore Girls"" (or even the extremely-ridiculous ""Secret Life of The American Teenager"") will dig what I am saying here.<br/><br/>From a critical standpoint, the film does tend to rip off a lot of concepts from other sources such as: William Golding's 'Lord of the Flies', Shirley Jackson's 'The Lottery', the character of 'The Architect' (eg. Donald Sutherland's character) from the 'Matrix Reloaded', 'The Truman Show', the story of Joan of Arc, and others. While this practice is not very original, it works well in the movie. The costumes of the 'city people' are a bit over-the-top, and look like they were stolen from the props storage of 'The 5th Element'; the city sets also have a very '5th Element' feel to them. <br/><br/>With the exception of the wasp scene, most of the violence in the film is handled in a relatively non-graphic but believable way, and the hand-held camera shots lended a gritty realistic aspect to certain pursuit scenes. Pretty much everyone else seems to think this sucked, but I completely disagree. <br/><br/>I did think it was hilarious & bizarre that, while having all this amazing technology, the city people only thought to arm their guards with knives and sticks. Surely they could do better than that. I'm tempted to think that might have been a deliberate move to lend a Biblical feel to the film, but honestly I think it was just a dumb oversight.<br/><br/>Also, it's unclear who the Robert-Smith-looking-freak-woman is who hosts the ""Reaping"" and what exactly her role is in the film. An investor? A district governor? Who knows?<br/><br/>From a story perspective, when you get to the end, nothing was actually solved and it's a wee-bit anti-climatic. Also, the very last scene in the film should have been cut because it adds absolutely nothing and left me laughing out loud saying, ""That's the end....??!"" It was a really dumb way to end this film.<br/><br/>I also found it hard to believe that simply *everybody* in the cities condoned the games and that there was no opposition and/or protest of it. From a fairy tale perspective it works (in the same way we believe the 'Wicked Witch of the West' from Wizard of Oz is evil), but from a realism perspective, it's oversimplification at it's most extreme. <br/><br/>The 'point' the movie is trying to make seems to be a Kmer Rouge propaganda statement: City people are evil & decadent, but the common folks are A-OK. Or, perhaps more generally, the implied moral advice to avoid excess and hedonism for the sake of hedonism. <br/><br/>Finally, it's good to see a strong, believable female lead in a tween movie. Despite all the nay-sayers, I think this movie could definitely be empowering to young females. Overall, the film was enjoyable (if just a tad bit silly) and something I would watch again."
"joshua-halstead","9","1","7","1 April 2012"," Very well made.
","'Hunger Games' at first appeared to be another teen fantasy book series, that would someday become a film saga which would be mediocre like most the others. Instead it was a refreshing surprise when I read the books that it was an intelligent, well thought out, series with an almost unpredictable story arch. Upon seeing the film I was once again surprised and refreshed by the quality of the creation. It followed as closely to the book as possible, and did very good job of bringing Suzanne Collins novel full of imagination to life. They custom designed every line, every look, every costume, every setting and every detail to Tailor fit it's purpose. Jennifer Lawrence provided her usual rugged, intellectual, emotion-yet-strong character with nearly flawless acting, to compliment the film even further. Josh Hutcherson brought something new to the table for him. He was serious,emotional, and brave: a perfect co-star for Jennifer Lawrence. They did a nice job of adapting the vital lesson of the book: Suzanne Collins' creates a world full of imagination though it is very clear that it is is in a not-too-distant future for the united states on the path that we are currently on. It is visible, however in only the most subtle of ways. All in all, very well made, and most definitely a must see."

The book was much more epic with little things like this.<br/><br/>Katniss feelings felt absolutely fake toward Peeta, but she makes up for it with her short but heart-felt relationship with Rue, which I felt was one of the high moments of the movie."
"achsaphillippi8","7","1","7","27 March 2012"," Faithful to the book, and that's good!
","With Harry Potter over (sadly), and The Twilight Saga coming to a close (thank goodness), America needed a brand new franchise to go crazy over. And here it is, The Hunger Games! A brilliant adaptation of Suzanne Collins' best-selling series (and far better-written than Stephanie Meyer's Twilight books). This movie delivers in almost every aspect. Despite its one flaw, The Hunger Games was definitely worth the wait.<br/><br/>The one flaw I was talking about is the over-use of shaky-cam in a few scenes of the movie. It gets less abundant later in the movie, but it can be mildly distracting at times.<br/><br/>But don't let the camera work ruin the movie for you! This movie is full of good things: superb acting, thrilling action, great story, and genuine heart. The movie was very well casted, with Katniss, Primrose, Gale, Peeta, Cinna, Effie, and Haymitch's characters all flawlessly portrayed by the actors. I also enjoyed the girl who played Rue: she was perfect! The action was very well choreographed (despite the iffy camera-work) and I felt as though I was experiencing the same thrill I did when I first read the book. I was on the edge of my seat, even though I knew exactly what was going to happen. I cared about all the characters.<br/><br/>There were a couple of alterations in the movie's script that left out some details from the book, but it didn't ruin the story for me at all. There is no need to be worried about the movie screwing up the book; the changes are rather small and inconsequential.<br/><br/>This movie is also very emotionally charged, just like the book. You can feel the characters' devastation, their happiness, their sadness, their defeats and triumphs. Again, thanks to the acting and the well-written script.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie did a fantastic job of bringing the book to the big screen. It was enjoyable, exciting, and satisfying. Even if you haven't read the book, if you like action movies and movies about triumph and standing strong, then this is the movie for you."
"xsophiethekingyx","7","1","7","26 March 2012"," A book critic.
","Spoiler.<br/><br/>I read the books when they first came out, and thought of how brilliant a movie it would make. I can't say I'm disappointed but just a few little things let it down. <br/><br/>Considering the movie is 2 hours and halfish everything seemed extremely rushed. The film starts on the day of the reaping and everything goes very fast. I don't feel enough emotion is created, when Rue died in the book it was SO sad but in the film Rue spent about 10 minutes tops with Katniss. I will write a few cons (being critical)<br/><br/>1 Prim's goat is mentioned ONCE. 2 The Mockingjay pin was found by Katniss in the blackmarket in which she gave it to Prim and Prim gave it back to Katniss. 3 There is no Madge, Darius, Greasey Sae, Cray, Octavia, Venia, Flavius and the red head avox girl. 4 The Cornucopia is black and sci-fi looking, whereas in the book it's gold. 5 Peeta's dad doesn't visit Katniss before she leaves 6 Peeta doesn't tell the story about how his father loved Katniss' mother and Peeta loved Katniss for her singing (the singing part is included just not the father thing) 7 Katniss doesn't go deaf in one ear from the explosion 8 District 11 don't give Katniss bread instead it shows an uprising even though uprisings don't happen until the second book. 9 The ending isn't the same as the book, the film makes you believe Katniss loves Peeta whereas in the book she doesn't at first and states she did it for the camera. 10 Clove doesn't die the way stated in the book, she has he head smashed in within the book which I guess would be pretty gruesome. 11 President Snow is to nice! He isn't presented badly enough 12 Haymitch isn't in the movie until the train scene, I was hoping to see him fall off the stage. 13 Haymitches alcohol addiction is just stopped at a point within the movie, there is no conversation on the train in which he decides to help Katniss and Peeta out because he realises their potential. 14 The beasts do not resemble nor do they have the eyes or the Tributes, I would of hoped a small detail like this could of been added. 15 Peeta doesn't have a prosthetic leg after the games, his leg just heals fine.<br/><br/>If you haven't read the books or just aren't as critical I would suggest seeing this movie. It lacks in emotion but the actors were cast very well and did a good job. The make up of cuts and things could have been a little better, the violence is there to an extent but the camera is VERY shaky, not sure on what effect they were trying to create but I felt quite dizzy. Most of the general story line is there with just some alterations. If you are worried this would spoil the book , I don't think it would just don't expect too much."
"dbrown1793-325-135050","7","1","7","26 March 2012"," A Review for the Over-40 crowd who never read the book.
","DISCLAIMER: This review sets up the situations of the movie without revealing the ending.<br/><br/>If you take the reality show ""Survivor"" and re-imagine it in ancient Rome, you might get the idea behind ""The Hunger Games"", a televised contest where 24 teenagers compete to be the last one standing. There's one catch, however. They earn that victory by hunting down and murdering the others. The story take place in a futuristic dystopia called Panem where the central authority, ""The Capital"" demands that the twelve formerly rebellious outlying districts send two ""tributes""; kids between ages 12-18, to battle in the Games. All are picked by lottery. Once chosen, they are pampered like modern day reality stars before being sent into the forest with whatever weapons and supplies they can muster.<br/><br/>The story focuses on the brave and resourceful Katniss Everdeen (played by the extraordinary Jennifer Lawrence), who volunteers to take the place of her younger sister. The first few scenes are excellent and chilling. Katniss's home, District 12, is an impoverished coal mining backwater that eerily mimics the Appalachian locale of Lawrence's last film, the equally bleak ""Winter's Bone"". The children are chosen at a staged event, called a ""reaping"", at the train station in a vignette that echoes (deliberately, I assume) the Selection Platform processing at Auschwitz.<br/><br/>Once at the Capital, the story sags somewhat. This is supposedly where the rich, venal rulers congregate but, adorned as they are with exaggerated costumes and grotesque florescent hair styles, they look more like extras from a Fellini film. They come off as silly, not threatening, especially Stanley Tucci as the unctuous Ryan Seacrest-like MC who is cursed with a blue-tinted pompadour. The entire sequence is meant to mock the celebrity/reality show culture of our present day but it comes off a bit forced. The only character who radiates menace is Donald Sutherland's President Snow and he is dressed in plain formal attire.<br/><br/>The story picks up again when the youngsters begin to battle although it's unsettling to see children casually slaughtering each other. Katniss is paired with Peeta (Josh Hutcherson in a tender, underplayed role), a boy from her home district and their love story, ruthlessly exploited by the show's controllers, provides the backdrop for what transpires.<br/><br/>""The Hunger Games"", the beginning of the trilogy by author Suzanne Collins (who also wrote the screenplay), promises future sequels which will hopefully give more back story to Panem's beginnings and more challenges for the riveting and poignant Katniss Everdeen. These stories are aimed at teenage readers and it is easy to see their appeal. Combining elements of love and heroism, it also plays out every teen's revenge fantasy of getting back at the creeps who ignore them in the cafeteria and bully them in the hallways. A typical American high school is a true Hunger Games survival setting. The only difference is that the bloodletting is emotional, not physical."

","I love the Hunger Games books. When my best friend told me they were making a movie about the first book i was super excited about seeing the movie. I saw it after it had been out for four days and all my friends who saw it before me said it was really good. If you haven't read the book I'm sure you would find it a great movie, but i thought it was kind of average. Some of the parts where really close to the book but others where completely different... e.g. the wolf mutts didn't look anything like they were described in the book and rue's role wasn't that big in the movie, whereas it was more significant in the book. I also found the action scenes really hard to follow because it was all blurry close ups and you couldn't figure out who was fighting who like when the tributes first entered the arena and they are all running for back packs and weapon I had no idea what was going on until Katniss had run into the forest. <br/><br/>Overall The Hunger Games wasn't a terrible movie but in my opinion it wasn't the best movie I have ever seen. BUT I STILL AM A HUGE FAN OF THE BOOKS!!!"

","Though the financial juggernauts known as tweens aren't well-respected for their literary taste, lumping 'The Hunger Games' in with other young adult books transferred to theaters would be reductive. Here, we have a bleak, yet accessible adventure novel that doubles as an intro to social critique, something that can't be said for recent YA efforts where ponderous teen angst masquerades as human drama. Its path to bookstore ubiquity came with many familiar potholes; romantic entanglements and haphazard plotting seem, at this point, par for the course. But along the way, The Hunger Games managed to invest readers in a world with characters and stakes that raise questions reaching far beyond ""which boy do I like?""<br/><br/>Of course, using young people killing each other is a pretty blunt, but undeniably effective, way to establish a sense of urgency. Author Suzanne Collins brings to the post-apocalypse a disturbing revision to coming of age rituals; the surviving nation of near-total cataclysm demands 24 young people, ages 12 to 18, fight to the death in the annual Hunger Games. Each of the states' twelve districts offers up one boy and girl to do battle in a vast arena, where the only way out is to be the last ""Tribute"" standing. In district 12, the drawing for the 74th annual games forces 16 year-old Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) to volunteer as Tribute, in place of her sister. <br/><br/>It's a pastiche of evocative ideas, a sampler menu of other, undoubtedly, more challenging works. The fingerprints of 'The Lottery', '1984', and even 'Logan's Run', are unmistakable in their influence. Those ""in the know"" have been touting the Japanese thriller 'Battle Royale' as the real source of inspiration (if not outright conceptual theft), but that film's use of blood sport as social metaphor is replaced here with a more deliberate approach. We do, after all, have two more books to set up, so it's not surprising that roughly half the run-time of 'The Hunger Games' is spent establishing the world surrounding them. <br/><br/>Even at a lengthy 140 minutes, there's no time for light touches. The gulf between Katniss' Ozark-ian District 12 and the opulent Capitol that hosts the games is presented in broad strokes befitting names that creative. The American Idol-inspired training period for the Tributes offers equal opportunity for easily recognizable satire. A takedown of voyeurism and artifice in reality programming would have had more bite, say, ten years ago, but here it manages to float thanks to a healthy dose of self-awareness.<br/><br/>Playing the game outside the game requires cunning and popularity (fittingly, a dystopian future lets the high school experience live on). For once, getting a makeover is a justified plot motivator, as Katniss catching the eyes of influential viewers is all part of the long-term strategy. How the condemned react to the hand they've been dealt is as close to a deft touch as the film manages. Director and co-scripter Gary Ross keeps the gruesome reality of kill-or-be-killed as mostly an undercurrent in the early goings, letting momentum take hold of what could have easily become maudlin.<br/><br/>Ross's strength lies in the quiet moments, which benefit from being just that. James Newton Howard keeps his score tactfully reserved in the opening half, letting you soak in the big moments through looks and gestures. Even in blockbuster filmmaking, a buzzing fluorescent bulb will let you know the air has gone out of the room better than any orchestra. The silence that accompanies the start of the games makes for what is perhaps the film's most accomplished moment. <br/><br/>From that point on, The Hunger Games kicks into its high gear back-half, one no less prone to bouts of sputtering. The only thing messier than an underage bloodbath is trying to film it within the boundaries of a PG-13 rating. Persistent shaky-cam is a practical solution to keep the nitty- gritty of murder safe(ish) for youngsters, but the sense of discombobulation it can produce is aggravating. It's a good thing Katniss specializes in the bow, because the fracas of close-range combat would have robbed her actions of their necessary impact.<br/><br/>It is, after all, Katniss' story from word ""go"", leaving the non-fodder supporting cast as either thinly sketched, or relegated to simple introductions. Josh Hutcherson and Liam Hemsworth form the base of a requisite but mercifully contained love triangle, with Hutcherson as fellow District 12 tribute, Peeta, getting the lion's share of the pair's screen time. Woody Harrleson gets the most love of the secondary players as a loutish former champion, who's tasked with training Katniss and Peeta. The kinds of sponsors he wants for Katniss, and the ones he could use himself, are quite different. <br/><br/>Though well-established as a ""wildness girl"" following her revelatory performance in Winter's Bone, Lawrence proves more than capable at mixing stoic resolve with the emotional heft required in the occasionally forced tender moments. Survival is a pretty utilitarian personal journey, which is somewhat limiting, but Katniss doesn't need a grand arc because she's given credit as a compelling character from the start. The great economy of the film's early scenes can't undercut how effective Collins is at crafting a heroine worth investing in. <br/><br/>The 'Hunger Games' has plenty of traits that are easy to nit-pick over; the climax is rushed, and life-saving plot devices abound, but it's tolerable because there's so much appreciable at its core. No, it is'nt high-art, but there's something encouraging, if not downright exciting, about a mature, well-executed piece of popular fiction that plays to the fans while staying inviting to the uninitiated. A week ago, I wouldn't have given 'The Hunger Games' more than a passing thought. Now, I'll include myself in the ranks of those cautiously optimistic for the next serving."
"laurascheri","Null","1","7","25 March 2012"," Could have been better
","The question is not how faithful to the book the film is. Obviously a lot of episodes and characters have been deleted or altered, but that's not the trouble. The book is one thing, the film is another.<br/><br/>The point is, the authors have chosen a definitely teen-ager approach to the story. ""The Hunger Games"" by Collins is a beautifully complex book, and it can be read on many different levels by different categories of readers. While youngsters are more attracted by the fight/battle/survival plot, we adults are more likely to be interested in the relationship between TV and violence, oppression and voyeurism, domination and advertising.<br/><br/>Deciding to dedicate much of their attention to the events going on in the fighting arena, the authors of the film have, in my opinion, given way to what is most obvious and spectacular, in a word to what will attract spending-money crowds to the cinema.<br/><br/>Better would have been to emphasize the role of the media, with their sponsors who are willing to pay for a medicine to be sent to Katniss only if she kisses Peeta so the audience will appreciate. Better would have been to point out the ""Big Brother"" aspect of the story (not only its visual reminders), but apparently that's considered not important. What a pity."
"ambuj-saxena","7","1","7","25 March 2012"," Hunger Games without hunger?
","If I were to review the movie in a word, it would simply be ""sell-out""; selling the soul of the book just to reach a wider audience.<br/><br/>Even before I went to see the movie, I knew the screenwriter's job for this movie is going to be difficult. With the whole movie as first person account of Katniss, it won't be easy to convey her emotions and feelings without making most of the movie a background narration of her thoughts. Yet, the movie surprised me at a more fundamental level. How can the screenwriter ignore the very first word in the title of the book: Hunger. How did the director accept the screenplay in which no one ever goes hungry or thirsty in the arena? For someone who has read the book, the needless pain and suffering that the tributes endure is central theme of the book. The movie decided to chuck that all out, dumbing it down to a glorified reality show. Even at that, they did a poor job of not even taking 5 minutes to show ""Why Hunger Games"". All they offered was a written paragraph preceding the movie and a short movie on the history of Panem. Right from the word go, it looked like a lazy attempt at screenplay because they were not competent to recap the background.<br/><br/>The casting of the movie was also a disaster. Except for Katniss, Effie, Senaca, and President Snow, everyone seemed out of place. It was hardly believable to see people with well built bodies, perfect hair and skin when they are supposed to come from a food-deprived district. No wait, the audience would believe it because the movie didn't even take time to explain the poverty and hunger in the districts. Movies sometimes take liberties from the book to make it more compelling and consistent. An example here would be the story of how Katniss got the Mockingjay pin. But what was surprising is that they even decided to change what the blast did to Katniss' ear. How are they going to explain her hearing the force field in the second movie? More screenplay liberties, I guess. I wanted to rip my hair off when they decided to dumb down on the emotional connection Katniss established with Rue, when they decided to skip the emotional conflict in Katniss and Peeta's mind on their fake love, the dumbed down signaling between Haymitch and Katniss. Yet, the movie wastes time visiting twice the story of Peeta in is young days having crush on Katniss and still unable to explain the whole burnt bread saga, the emotional Katniss when she sees the dress she has to wear for the reaping without any background to its significance, and so on.<br/><br/>Sure the movie will now be more popular because most people don't care to read the book and they won't understand all the levels the movie fails to deliver. And when they won't understand, it will probably be attributed to mysticism rather than incompetence."
"rebeccasxu","7","1","7","24 March 2012"," Not Bad for a Book Adaptation
","I am a college freshman. Wondering why exactly The Hunger Games had so much hype, I decided to read the books and then check out the movie. I finished the series in three days and became thoroughly pumped for the film, since it doesn't look like the low budget poo of another young adult book adaptation (coughTwilightcough). But this isn't the place for complaining about that.<br/><br/>In terms of following the book, The Hunger Games movie did remarkably well. This can be a good or bad thing. Of course, in order to condense the story many small details were cut. Small, but important to fully understanding the story. Depth, character development, these things are all sacrificed in the movie, which can lead to an unsatisfying middle ground where fans aren't happy and non-fans are confused as to what's going on.<br/><br/>Casting of the characters was better than expected. Jennifer Lawrence makes a convincing enough Katniss, although she is way too tall and curvy to actually seem like she was suffering. I don't really know how that could be fixed though. Josh Hutcherson as Peeta was...unsatisfying. Basically he was there to look wide-eyed and weak. Same with Prim. I hated how the movie makers interpreted Prim as a whiny, scream-y useless kid. Elizabeth Banks as Effie Trinket was funny and spot-on, Haymitch was meh, President Snow wasn't bad but not as I imagined. <br/><br/>Cinematography was very...shaky, as mentioned in other reviews. Also, the books were quite explicit in describing the violence in the arena, but the movie muted this quite a bit. Most scenes go something like this: someone waves/throws a weapon, the camera zooms around in a blurry manner, and the audience is shown the result (a gash, an arrow in something) without actually seeing the process. This really couldn't be helped if they wanted the PG-13 rating, given the teen fanbase, but it truly reduces the impact and power of the movie. It's fine with me though. The Hunger Games isn't supposed to be horror, per se. I think the series is a good introduction to thinking more deeply about human nature, society, war, and violence. It is STILL a story for kids! As for the Battle Royale thing, BR is distinctly more...Japanese. It's sick, twisted, and gloriously, insanely violent. Its purpose is to shock you and give you chills, maybe make you think about things once you get over the gore, which depends on your taste obviously. The Hunger Games dabbles in these parts, yes, but it's much more hopeful. It taps into the viewer's emotions and sympathy, and advocates that good people still have a chance.<br/><br/>Anyway, basically The Hunger Games movie is pretty decent in getting the point across, although small things are lost in the process. If you want the full experience, read the books."
"mark_gc11","7","1","7","24 March 2012"," I know its pg-13 but an R rating would have made it better.
","Warning : contain spoilers!<br/><br/>I realize that its a teen movie and an R rating might not get as much money for the trilogy but come on! There should have been way more blood then the movie showed. In the book it made me think it was hard and brutal to be living in that era and I think the movie should have done a better job at portraying that among other thing it could have done. For example, in the movie when Cato fell from the cornucopia into the pack of muts there should have been whimpers and blood everywhere from him and from peeta who was bleeding out. I guess my hopes where a little to high. Movie versions of a book never get all the details."
"gjrb01","8","1","7","23 March 2012"," A brilliant story with just some loose in the execution
","Don't get me wrong Gary Ross is great! Let me put it this way; ""Dismissed a rated R violent book and cut it down to PG13 to make more money"". They stated before releasing the firm that it could be or will be the next Twilight Saga Movie (which of course this was much better than that series), which I believe thats the reason why this film could have been more better (it's all for the money).<br/><br/>J. Lawrence is way too better than K. Stewart impact, she is the best suited for the role though the lead is only 16 year old girl - Katniss Everdeen. The first book of Suzanne Collins's prodigiously popular trilogy has been brought to the screen with a Jumbotron sensibility, a shaky camera to emphasize the action and a shakier grip on the subject's emotional core; which I do not prefer, could much have been better if slow motions slides were used rather than shaky ones; which makes it more intense. <br/><br/>The concept is hardly an original one. Older audiences with a sense of movie history will recognize more than trace elements of ""The Most Dangerous Game,"" ""Spartacus,"" ""Battle Royale,"" or ""The Running Man."" But ""The Hunger Games"" wasn't intended for older audiences. the film does quite effectively bring to life many of the meticulously detailed elements of the books, often making them feel more accessible and understandable in the process. The look of the various Districts is true to its source, and the film's costume and make-up departments have managed to translate specific looks (from Katniss and Peeta in particular, to the colorful Capitol citizens at large) straight from the page to the screen. Moreover, while there has never been any doubt as to the depth and breadth of the Capitol's control over the proceedings, seeing the Games play out through Seneca Crane's central command center adds a new dimension to the tone of the game and the perception the Capitol. That control, combined with the overt division between what the other Districts have versus what the Capitol has (in terms of goods, services, technology, and quality of life) give us a striking villain to root against (made even better when the first seeds of a new revolution begin to sprout).<br/><br/>Don't be hook to the rating of 8/10 it's not like it is better than The descendants or Drive or even X Men first Class last year, but overall solid acting; a stunning look and feel; an infectious energy and sense of engagement; stays true to the source material except in rare (and necessary instances); the introduction of a bold new world; totally moving and emotional.<br/><br/>7.2 out of 10 stars"
"dschlatter","7","1","8","17 April 2012"," Come on guys, it's a 12-up book!
","I need to say this right away: Woody Harrelson and Stanly Tucci were the PERFECT choice! All the other lead actors were just very well chosen. That being said... (And also that the movie stays true to the book and is really quite good.)<br/><br/>A lot of disappointed reviewers complained about the missing bloody violence in the movie. I will give them this: Yes, it bothered me too, the way the camera 'kept looking away' whenever some serious s**t went down. Reading the book was way more intense than watching the movie. So instead of gore we get shaky camera work, filming random stuff while only hinting at the violence. But hey! I found the book in the 12-up section of the book store. It's only fair that they make a PG13 movie out of it. (Seriously, what did you expect from the guy who made 'Pleasantville'? Haha.) So quit bitching, people, and go wait for The Expendables 2. <br/><br/>There was, however, one thing that bothered me. It seems to happen to all the books-turned-into-a-movie. The movie is better for those who have read the book. Outsiders tend to miss important details, just because the movie didn't bother going into those details. Like the relationship between Katniss and Gale. Or the general misery that the districts were in. (A couple of shaky shots of their village are not enough to show a viewer for example how dangerous it is to get caught on the other side of the fence. Or how cruel those stormtroop.. erm, peacekeepers can be.) A movie should stay true to the book, but be filmed as if there had never been a book to begin with. Do you know what I mean?<br/><br/>Go watch it. It's good. Just don't expect much violence. I've read reviews of people who claimed that the movie was pushing its PG13 limits. They are dirty little liars ;-)"

","This movie just flew by. It was over before I knew it.<br/><br/>Maybe it went by so quickly for me because I've read the book, all 374 pages. Unfortunately it's impossible to give 374 page book the treatment it deserves in a little over two hours.<br/><br/>What we got was entertaining, but it's just a shadow of the book. There's so much cut out. We hardly get an idea of what life was like in District 12. I don't think they even used the words ""the Seam"" in the movie. Rue had about 5 minutes of screen time. Gale had even less.<br/><br/>Even Peeta was hardly developed. There isn't much of a sense of Peeta's bravery from the movie. There was one scene where Peeta showed some strength by throwing the medicine ball in the gym.<br/><br/>Gale only has a few minutes of screen time. You'd think Katniss's best friend would have more than a few minutes.<br/><br/>I think they cast the wrong actor for Gale. The actor was just too nice. Gale is more of an edgy character. He has a fierce temper, but a heart of gold.<br/><br/>I did enjoy some things in the movie. It was interesting to see actors portraying the career tributes, such as Clove and Cato. I wish we could have seen more of Glimmer too. The boy from district 1 hardly got any screen time. Woody Harrelson was entertaining. But I thought all the shaky camera work near the beginning was unnecessary. It made the reaping all too real, and all too creepy. If I want to be creeped out I'll go watch a horror movie.<br/><br/>I would have liked to see some key scenes. They could have included the scene when Katniss and Gale first met. Katniss offered him the bow, and he smiled like a little kid in a candy store.<br/><br/>Also I was really interested in seeing Lenny Kravitz play Cinna. He only had about five minutes of screen time.<br/><br/>And was it really necessary to cut short Clove's death scene? And Cato's reaction afterward? How much time did they save? A minute? Also I really like the Foxface character. Her success gave me a sense of hope. But, unfortunately, Foxface's starvation ultimately lead her to eat some poison berries.<br/><br/>It was nice to see Thresh, if only for a few minutes. Thresh is really unique because he mostly kept to himself and was strong.<br/><br/>And was it really necessary to cut out the death scene of the girl from district 4? She also died from the tracker jackers. You'd think they could at least leave in the death scenes. But I was glad that they cut short Cato's death scene. That was pretty gruesome in the book.<br/><br/>Too bad they didn't split the first book into too movies."
"aamirm","6","1","8","13 April 2012"," The first half of the ""Hunger Games"" raises up the expectations: the second half let you down.
","I start by saying that I haven't read the Collin's novel, but the underlying ideas in the movie seem to be quite grasping. The movies itself is not, though. The movie might be seen as an attempt to despise the reality TV shows, and it progressively succeeds doing so during the first half, but then is reduced to being not more than a bad parody of the Big Brother where the quality of the relationships are so inexplicable. Nothing is said about characters' motivations for their actions (which I guess has happened during the adaptation phase. There are extremely good guys and extremely bad guys.Adding more and more characters helps only to worsen the ambiguity, and the increases this gap between the two extremes.Dialogues are generally poorly written in a way that even in the most dramatic moments, you could only try not to laugh. If you can ignore these rather big issues, Hunger Game could only be an entertaining film to watch with your friends. especially that the story ends with an acceptable twist, making you interested in (perhaps) getting answers to the unanswered questions, though one thing for sure is that I won't watch the sequels in theater!"
"fahimraza1234","Null","1","8","9 April 2012"," I read the book and then watched the movie
","I read the book and then watched the movie. Was very pleased to see that they stayed very true to the story in the book. If anything, the scenes added in the movie only enhance the story line instead of taking away from it, like Haymitch talking to sponsors and talking the Gamemaker out of killing Katriss, but the best scene added was President Snow talking to the Gamemaker about hope.<br/><br/>The actress that played Rue captured the girl's wide eyed innocence, made me fall in love with her. When she died I cried like my own little girl had died. Even though in the book you think Cinna is white, I can't imagine another actor portraying Cinna the way Lenny Cratz did. He captured Cinna's aloffness perfectly.<br/><br/>The only criticism I have is with the styling. I was so confused. The peacekeeper's white protective gear reminded me of stormtroopers from Star Wars, District 12 reminded me of America in the Great Depression, right down to the grimy coal miners, and the heavy, stone buildings and lettering reminded me of communist Russia.<br/><br/>And the futuristic styling of the Capital and the people's makeup reminded me of I don't know what, but all together it was not cohesive, seemed like you were watching three different movies instead of one. I know they had to contrast the richness of the Capital with the poor worker districts, but still, there are other ways they could have done it. I mean, they could have had the people in District 12 dressed in clothes that look like the clothes people in the capital wore, only faded, worn and patched.<br/><br/>But the story stayed very close to what was in the book. So much of the dialogue in the movie kept almost word for word what was said in the book, that I forgave the bits that were left out.

","OK, look. Everyone who's bashing this movie for not being 100% consistent to the book, grow up. It would be impossible to fit all the accuracy and detail of a book into a movie. If they did this, the movie would've been, like, 5 hours long. I will admit, they did get some things wrong, like how Katniss got the Mockingjay pin. Madge gives it to her in the book, but a merchant (possibly Greasy Sae) gives it to her in the movie and there's no explanation for it whatsoever. And they could've easily given Madge a two-second appearance to give her the pin. They could've shown Katniss and Gale trading in the Hob a little more and bringing the strawberries to the mayor, which would've given more time for them to exchange dialogue and delve into the characters a bit more. But these were minor details that could've been easily overlooked. As for the shaky camera, yes, there were scenes that called for it, such as the Cornucopia scene and the final fight with Cato. They needed to do this because they can't have the vast amount of violence in the book shown in a movie that's targeted towards the adolescent demographic. And the following movies are going to be even worse in that sense. They can't have someone getting their skull bashed in and still keep a PG-13 rating. But apart from that, yes, they did have to narrow down the events of the Games. They couldn't show the entire extent of the games because, once again, the movie would've been excruciatingly long. They fitted what was needed to get Katniss from point A to point B and keep as much consistency as possible so as not to disappoint the fans.<br/><br/>Basically, the production staff and new director will take all this into account. They'll take this time to notice their mistakes and try to fix them. That's what they do. The film business is just that. A business. They've just been given a series as popular as The Hunger Games. They will not butcher these movies because they know that the fanbase is huge. And if they make the movie as close to the books as possible, they know fans are going to want to see the movie and they can keep strolling to the bank. So have faith, people. This was only their first installment. Catching Fire is bound to be amazing. But only time will tell."
"Bascoda","6","1","8","6 April 2012"," A pretty good adaptation, with one huge exception....
","Let me begin by saying I am most definitely not the target audience for this movie. Even so, I read and enjoyed the first book (my wife writes YA fiction, so I try to keep up), and was quite happy to take my two teenage granddaughters, who are the target audience, to see it. While not quite as brilliant an adaptation of book to film as some - the Lord of the Rings trilogy comes immediately to mind - it is still a worthy effort. Worthy in most respects, that is, with one glaring exception, which I will get to in a bit.<br/><br/>First, the good points. The film is a faithful adaptation of the book, with a few minor changes that mostly work. The differences in the two media require different handling. What can be explored at length with the written word must be compressed, implied or, in some cases, made obvious in the visual world of film. The reader's imagination, which is the writer's best friend, becomes the viewer's preconceived notion, which can be the filmmaker's worst enemy. I felt the film did a pretty good job of translation. <br/><br/>In general, the casting and characterizations were good. I have long been a fan of Donald Sutherland, Woody Harrelson and Stanley Tucci, and they didn't disappoint. Jennifer Lawrence was a pleasant surprise - I was unfamiliar with her work, but the young lady can definitely act, and her portrayal of Katniss was eminently believable. I had a bit of a problem with Josh Hutcherson as Peeta appearance-wise, but setting that aside, overall he acquitted himself well. Elizabeth Banks created an absolute gem of a character with Effie Trinket.<br/><br/>Some have complained that the film sanitized the violence which is such an integral part of the book. I disagree - the violence is there, it is just implied more than explicitly shown. This is a perfectly respectable, although currently little-used technique (consider the murder scene in the original ""Psycho"", for example) and was necessary for the PG-13 rating the film required for its target audience. Costumes were good, settings were good - some, like the Capital, were superb, and one - the control room - actually improved on the book. Overall, pretty good marks except for that one glaring flaw ....<br/><br/>The camera work was awful! It intruded, it interfered, it irritated, it gave me a headache, dammit! The hand-held jitters and the constant rapid-fire jump cuts were just too much for these tired old eyes to handle, and seriously detracted from my enjoyment of the film. If not for that, I would have scored the film a couple of points higher than I did."
"MovieJunky101","7","1","8","5 April 2012"," The Hunger Games
","A tangible and powerful look at America's fascination with reality shows and violence on television, The Hunger Games is the only movie in 2012 that I saw twice in one day. It is also the only film in which I felt a strong connection to the main character. Maybe it's our age, or just that with the dark hair Jennifer Lawrence I look somewhat similar (which makes my girl crush all the more creepy), but I felt a kinship with Miss Katniss Everdeen. That being said the lovely Jennifer Lawrence just killed it. For lack of more appropriate adjectives, she acted the crap out of this role. I fell for her almost instantly which kept me rooting for her the whole way through, which is exactly what Suzanne Collins wanted. Although everyone else seemed to fall secondary, I think the film was excellently cast. I'd heard somewhere that Josh Hutcherson was miscast, but I thought he did a fine job, at the very least I didn't notice anything bad to comment on. The filmmakers did a good job at highlighting the differences between the higher Districts and the Capitol. In fact when I saw the Capital I nearly fell out of my seat! It was like a legion of crazy pop stars, it felt like you were literally walking through a Katy Perry or Nicki Minaj music video. Although the thing that surprised me the most about The Hunger Games was Elizabeth banks, who was completely unrecognizable in her role as Effie Trinket the District 12 escort. Though it is EARLY in the year and any real recognition is unlikely, I hope that the Academy will at least take notice of the costume design. <br/><br/>I can't remember if Gary Ross has done a film like this before, and by that I mean something with this much action, fight scenes. Although there wasn't as much violence as one might expect, and a lot of the real bloody violence takes place at one particular moment. The fact that they were children brutally killing each other made it all the more difficult to swallow. Gary Ross used shaky camera work to mask some of the brutality of it all, and using Stanley Tucci and Toby Jones characters commentary to replace Katniss' narration was a brilliant compromise if you ask me. I think The Hunger Games would have done better as an R- rated feature. Not that the box office could be any better, but as a film about a televised fight to the death, it would have been interesting to have seen it taken to the next level. Although, that way so many of the the young fans would of had to miss out on the... fun? <br/><br/>Overall I REALLY enjoyed The Hunger Games, and in fact, I cannot wait to own a copy of my very own. Hopefully with lots of Special Features!"
"afh179","7","1","8","4 April 2012"," Epic adrenaline rush of a film
","I'll start this off by letting everyone know that I've never so much as picked the Suzanne Collins book up. I had no idea there was a book called ""The Hunger Games"" until I saw the trailer for this film. I don't know why, but something about this movie stuck out to me upon my viewing of the trailer. Maybe it was the premise of teenagers brutally fighting to the death as a game and tradition, or maybe it was how the movie clearly demonstrates the unbreakable love between siblings. But for whatever reason, I knew I needed to see this film.<br/><br/>I went with a friend of mine who had read the book. She assured me the book was fantastic, and she was sure I'd love the movie as long as it followed the book. After it was over and I asked her how closely it followed it, she seemed a bit disappointed. But, having no previous knowledge, I didn't find many major flaws in this film.<br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence is a fantastic young actress. Her performance in the great Winter's Bone was remarkable, and she doesn't disappoint here either. She plays our protagonist, Katniss Everdeen, who takes her young sister's place in The Hunger Games, a brutal but traditional game where 24 teenagers battle to the death while the entire country watches. The action scenes are tense and awesome, and Katniss proves herself to be an extremely intelligent player as the games go on, finding clever ways to pick off opponents. Lawrence's portrayal is really a joy to watch, as is the film itself.<br/><br/>Look out for a decent acting turn from Lenny Kravitz as well, as well as a strong performance from Josh Hutcherson. It is these performances that make the movie special, and make it such a thrilling and enjoyable film. I cannot speak as a fan of the book, but as someone who loves to watch a good movie, I was very pleased with this one. And if you are a fan of smart, clever action-fantasies, you shouldn't feel any differently.<br/><br/>Overall: 7/10"
"ivern-326-711636","8","1","8","3 April 2012"," No, The Hunger Games is Not an Eating Contest!
","The Hunger Games has been one of my most anticipated movies of this year, and I'm happy to announce that it's awesome! Is it better than the book? No, not really... Is it worthy of the book's legacy? Hell yeah it is!<br/><br/>Katniss Everdeen lives together with her mom and sister in District 12, Panem. Each year, the Capitol of Panem holds a famous television show called The Hunger Games, where two tributes from each of the 12 districts must fight to the death in an arena. Unfortunately, Katniss' sister is picked as the first tribute, but Katniss saves her by volunteering. Now Katniss has to do everything she can to survive The Hunger Games.<br/><br/>The book is great, and this movie adaptation is also brilliant. It stays true to it's source material and doesn't try to change the original story for the purpose of changing the original story for the purpose of ... you get the idea ... NOTHING!<br/><br/>There are some brutally violent moments in this movie, all containing teens, and there is one really sad scene that I won't spoil.<br/><br/>I also like that the movie is pretty pure. Most of the movie is CGI-free, so it isn't a CGI overload movie like most other big Hollywood films.<br/><br/>Overall, The Hunger Games is a brilliant movie, and it follows the book greatly. Let's just hope that the next movie, Catching Fire, will be good."
"CumClarity","9","1","8","2 April 2012"," wonderfully shot, no sappy block buster here, fantastic acting
","Movie was excellent. Yes I have read all the books and they were pretty darn tooting close. The acting was superb, all the young actors did an amazing job, and all the adults were spot on. I wish there was more screen time with Lenny Kravitz, but perhaps that's because Cinna from the book was my favorite character. Stanley (Cesear flickerman) was great!<br/><br/>The cinematography was wonderful, shot in fast sequences and gritty. A few slow-mo shots, a few which could have been dropped but was amazing.<br/><br/>Yes there was a little violence, but it was not gratuitous. And most of the sound for the battle scenes were muted. Interesting take on it.<br/><br/>My husband came with me, having not read the books and could follow along, and really liked the movie, even though going in, he didn't want to see it. <br/><br/>This movie is definitely not filmed for teens, and isn't even filmed like the generic block buster (which it is). I was extremely impressed.<br/><br/>Not suitable for kids under 12 I would say."
"ssto","9","1","8","2 April 2012"," impressive!
","if you want to read the book after which the film was created then it must have been a good movie, right?<br/><br/>i was very impressed with The Hunger Games. i knew about the hype surrounding it and was reluctant, but was convinced by family to go and see it and this was a good decision. <br/><br/>one of the most impressive things was the feeling i am watching the movie in 5D - the two dimensional screen, the depth of the camera, and really the perspective of Katniss: what she sees, what she hears. somehow i hadn't experienced this recently and for me this is the greatest achievement of the production team.<br/><br/>the story was well told, some lines probably just hinted, comparing to the book (which i am yet to read). again, some episodes were surely abridged, but the flow was smooth and the action was tense. <br/><br/>looking forward to the next episode of this impressive movie good work!"
"DennisH","8","1","8","2 April 2012"," As good as can be expected given MPAA and time restrictions.
","Spoilers of book and movie ahead.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the books and I've been looking forward to this movie for some time. I'll go straight to the highlights (and relatively few lowlights), but overall, they did a damn good job given the forced constraints.<br/><br/>I can only imagine what it would be like to be the director (the very talented Gary Ross) in a pre-production meeting where the studio head says, ""Gary, I need you to take this novel written in first person narrative about a futuristic society that has teenagers killing each other with swords, knives and arrows over a three week period and film it. It must be PG-13 and under two and a half hours. Plus, we're a small studio and can only fund it for 80 million dollars.""<br/><br/>POSITIVES <br/><br/>-Everything up to the start of the Games was well done. The pacing was good and necessary decisions were made regarding characters (e.g. Madge omitted) and events. I would note that while it was clear how poor District 12 was, it was hard to see how hungry they were. <br/><br/>-The story of the Games was motivated well, especially using news room panels and historical footage of previous games. <br/><br/>-The Reaping was perfect, both Jennifer Lawrence's volunteer line and Prim's shrieking. Nice touches on the Capitol film, and how the crowd would not respond with enthusiasm to watching their children taken from them. The look of realization on Josh Hutcherson's face when he was picked was perfect.<br/><br/>-The Capitol was visualized wonderfully, and the Chariot entrance was almost as I imagined it. <br/><br/>-The training sequences (except for Katniss'individual interview that only had a bow and arrows in the room) were perfectly realized. <br/><br/>-The casting overall was excellent. Stanley Tucci was great as Cesar, and the interview scenes were perfect. Lenny Kravitz was awesome as Cinna, although they didn't have much time to talk. Foxface, although speaking only five words it seemed, really filled her role. Rue and Prim were also perfect, although they never had a chance to talk. <br/><br/>-The start of the games was so tense, the sound choices hit the mood perfectly. That they had the violence on shaky cam was probably wise, but you saw enough of kids dying in the Cornucopia to feel the depression. <br/><br/>-I liked that they had Game Control room sequences, as well as dialog between Snow and Crane. While not in the book, it was good to see how the Gamemaster would control it. I also thought using Cesar and other commentators to add notes (tracker-jackers, etc) helped explain the action well when the book had it in first person. <br/><br/>-Nice to introduce Katniss' father's explosion through the hallucination sequence. <br/><br/>-Some of the changes in dialog helped more than hurt (for example, Thresh saying only, ""Just this once 12, for Rue"" was much less awkward than the book).<br/><br/>NITPICKS <br/><br/>-The pacing made it hard to understand the passage of time during the Games. You never knew that Katniss was thirsty or hungry, none of them looked worse for wear except for the cuts. They were there for almost a month. <br/><br/>-Gale wasn't developed enough either, every shot was him upset with Katniss and Peeta, how about a reaction shot when she survives? <br/><br/>-There was very little development of Rue's character and the relationship between her and Katniss. It was hard to understand her grief with 2 minutes of screen time. <br/><br/>-I never saw any mention of Peeta getting injured, then Katniss is tracking him down and finds him with no explanation...there must be some film on the cutting room floor that would have made this more clear. This was probably the biggest goof.<br/><br/>-Haymitch was far too sympathetic, which I'm guessing was driven by test audience response. I was dying to hear his first advice, 'Stay Alive!' while laughing, then 'Stay Alive' in all seriousness. <br/><br/>-Why not explain that Cato tracked down Thresh for the backpack? They made it sound like Thresh was killed by mutts. <br/><br/>-The mutt sequence at the end was choppy, although I liked that they ended it for Cato quickly instead of dragging it on for a day.<br/><br/>Again, I really liked the movie. There is no way it could be made to the standards that you would have for the book, but given the imposed limitations they did a marvelous job. Looking forward to the sequels."
"yarden-malka14","8","1","8","2 April 2012"," ""The Hunger Games"" Review
","""The Hunger Games"" is without a doubt one of the most anticipated movies of 2012. A remake of a successful trilogy, I saw this movie yesterday. I came in with notably high expectations, since I had already read the books, which are of very high quality. The opening is very good, giving you a feeling that you are familiar with the characters. The preparations for the ""Hunger Games"" are portrayed in an exceptionally long fashion, but they are intriguing and fascinating. The main part of the movie, the ""Hunger Games"", portrays the love story of two 16 year- olds form the same poor District 12. The ""Hunger Games"" themselves will be depicted by the average viewer as nothing more than onslaught between teens. However if the viewer looks beyond the horrific killing between the participants he/she will see a marvelous and outstanding story of love, sacrifice, survival, caring, kindness and action. The ""Hunger Games"" themselves are magnificent and your eyes will be ""glued to the screen"". Not only is the movie simply very good, it criticizes today's civilization in a way that makes you re-think many things. Even though the movie is almost 2.5 hours long it is so interesting that you feel as if it is only 1 hour long. When you exit the movie theater you will only think you saw a very good movie, but after a few hours (when it sinks in to you) you start to realize all the messages and criticizements that the film has for today's population. As I have mentioned before the movie contains never-ending killing between 12-18 year old teens, and a few ""jump"" scenes. Thus, I must advise that children under the age of 14 should not be allowed to view this film."
"lekgolah","7","1","8","2 April 2012"," Not having read the book I enjoyed it but far from great
","Over a week after seeing the film, giving me time to decide whether as good as the hype made it out to be, I am now ready to give my opinion. First-off The Hunger Games is a good film, whereby the cast are great, there is a sense of atmosphere and delivers what it promises. However, is it as good as how everyone hoped it to be? Well what is but this film has many flaws. <br/><br/>While I can't blame a teen-oriented film for not showing the killing of multiple young people clearly, blood and everything, the director thought it would be better to zoom in hand-held camera with quick cuts so you never get a clear view to avoid offending its audience and receiving the 15/R rating. The overall effect is distracting and cheapens the film. If you intend to show something, then show it! The film's half-hearted attitude to the violence felt indecisive, not sure whether to stay true to the books or to make something family friendly. <br/><br/>This is a much talked about issue and there is more that could be said, however the film does have its moments. Half the running time is set before the game begins and creates a tense atmosphere as the games move closer and closer. As mentioned the cast are great and the film allows time to develop their characters. Some scenes, particularly flashbacks, did feel poorly handled though and if more time had been spent developing them, I believe it would have improved the film immensely.<br/><br/>As it stands, the film is good, however the direction is not all that strong. The climactic fight felt poorly handled, which is a shame since it also successfully developed the antagonist. Two CGI scenes were weak and did not add anything to film. While I did enjoy it, the film lacked a certain edge needed to keep me invested in what will happen next for the characters. Looking at the box office, hopefully the sequel will build on what this achieved and make up for its shortcomings."
"s_quinland","9","1","8","1 April 2012"," Well done, but could have been more...
","HUNGER GAMES Movie Review (minor spoilers): I approached this movie with more than a little trepidation. As much as I tried to shield myself from the media, headlines caught my eye and I was truly afraid that the movie would not live up to the hype, which is what SOME people were saying, while others praised it to the skies. After this first viewing, it is important to note two things: 1) If you are a fan of the book, it pretty faithfully follows it. 2) If you have NOT read the book, you will still ""get"" it; this is NOT one of those movies where everyone who read the book has to explain what is happening on the screen to those who have not.<br/><br/>It clocks in at 2 hours and 22 minutes, so they packed in as much of the book as humanly possible, without making it seem too rushed. The actors did an incredible job of portraying the characters and the costumes were excellent, if not exactly what I pictured from the book. <br/><br/>The changes that were made to the story were fairly minor... and, on reflection, seemed necessary for time and/or clarity. Except for one that I really missed, but, hey, I really liked the scene in the book, so I kept looking for it.<br/><br/>The beginning was very disorienting – loads of camera shake in an in/out of focus montage, but still managed to convey the backstory fairly effectively, although the burnt bread scene, rather important in the book for a lot of reasons, was chopped into several tiny bits as flashbacks and didn't really work except to confuse the un-read audience. The flashbacks regarding Katniss' Mom were odd as well, and happened extremely late in the movie, at that point it almost didn't make sense to have it in the movie at all.<br/><br/>Showing the differences between the Haves (Capitol) and have-Nots (everywhere else) was striking. The silliness of the costumes, the inanity and shallowness of the People of Capital as compared to the rest of Panem underscored their differences: the children who are forced to fight (and kill) each other to survive and silly giddiness of those who view the Games as entertainment and those who exploit the spectacle for political oppression of the masses.<br/><br/>The entire Arena section was very compressed, and contrary to some of the other reviews, not really sanitized, just really FAST. The effects were excellent, and the whole ""Reality Show/Gladiator TV Show Heartless Let's keep Those Ratings UP"" mood was conveyed very well. There were some brutal scenes, a couple of jump-out-of-your-seat moments, and some funny flashes scattered throughout, enough to break up the tension. Gotta love that Effie!<br/><br/>The heart of the book was the heart of the movie, and I cried during that scene in the film, just like I did in the book... Those of you who have read the book know what I mean. <br/><br/>NOTE: If you have kids who have read the books and who are old enough to actually understand the theme and are able to discuss it, by all means take them to see this movie. Talk to them about it. It was far less violent than just about any Stephen King movie or Jurassic Park, for example. I would not take a young child (under 11) who is sensitive or who has NOT read the books, however. <br/><br/>On the whole, an excellent movie with a few minor quibbles. We saw it in an IMAX format, in perfect seats. I will be seeing this one again!"
"Rommaik","9","1","8","1 April 2012"," Medical Warning!!!!!!
","IF you have Epilepsy OR Equilibrium Problems be careful seeing this movie! The director is addicted to the hand held cameras! There are whole scenes where the world just spins around! I am sure there is some deep ""artistic"" reason for all this. All I know, is that I had held on to both the chair and my stomach to keep my dinner from coming back up! <br/><br/>The opening at the ""Reaping"" is a particular case in point. The camera dances all over the place, leaving it incredibly hard to focus on any one thing. Again, I do not think that it adds anything to the movie. It is distracting and deeply annoying after the first couple of minutes.<br/><br/>I assumed that there would be some running through the forest, but the frequent overhead tree leaves swirls were entirely unwarranted. It adds nothing to the movie and after the fifth or sixth such scene, I was getting sick and a headache. <br/><br/>The actors were so strong, I could not fathom why the director could not find a steady cam or even a large tree stump to settle down on. There was nothing gained by all the handy-cam! Nothing. Sending me home with an upset stomach and the start of a migraine is not a welcome addition to my weekend!"

","I have not read the book, and my friend dragged to to the movies to watch ""Hunger Games"", so I am not a fan, in the real sense of the word.<br/><br/>However, the movie rocks, and it will be another legendary fantasy series in line with ""Harry Potter"", etc. I will say that there are a few things that must be pointed out. Despite Jennifer Lawrence presenting (in my opinion) the best performance of her life, Gary Ross tried too much and too little at the same time. Diverging from the violent nature of Suzanne Collins' original story put a big damper on the overall feel for the oppression of the Capital (all to keep profits up by keeping the movie PG-13). Overall though, the movie stayed true to the book as any adaptation I've seen prior. The energy output of this all star cast is amazing, despite the lack of ""action"" in some sequences. All and all, a great movie that begs the question: ""What will become of Katniss Everdeen?"", especially when you see the ending."

","I was a bit worried that I wouldn't like The Hunger Games movie, but I shouldn't have worried -- it was terrific! I loved the books and devoured them, so was a bit nervous about seeing the film. I couldn't find fault with the film. It was just as smart as the first book, lots of action, scary bits and romantic bits, thrills and chills. The folks who put this together definitely did well with casting -- love seeing Josh Hutcherson, Jennifer Lawrence and Alexander Ludwig all grown up and doing well -- the sets were reminiscent of Brazil (another movie I love) and the writing was first-rate.<br/><br/>Elizabeth Banks was hilarious, Stanley Tucci (such a great actor) was fabulous, Woody Harrelson was great and even the short time Lenny Kravitz was on screen showed some acting chops. Of course, Donald Sutherland was terrific. The costumes were pretty wild, which really helped keep the otherworldliness of the 13 districts alive. <br/><br/>The parts that were changed didn't really interfere with the story, which was a nice departure from other teen films based on best-selling novels. It didn't hurt that Suzanne Collins helped write the screenplay. I was so surprised when the movie was over -- I kept thinking, surely it's almost over but I don't want it to end. While the second and third books weren't as strong to me as the first, I am still anxious to see the films hopefully being made from the final two chapters of Katness and Peta's story. <br/><br/>A must see!"

"colinrgeorge","6","1","8","26 March 2012"," Superfans Be Easy.
","Superfans be easy. If your barometer for measuring the success of Hollywood's Hunger Games adaptation begins and ends with faithfulness to the source material, by all accounts it is one. If you can swing a bit of emotional transference, all the better — I suspect few who enter without a preexisting love for Katniss and Peeta will be moved by their exploits. This $78 million companion piece to Suzanne Collins' young adult novel isn't especially concerned with converting the uninitiated; it's about cashing in on a fertile franchise. Cha-ching!<br/><br/>For the rest of you: Katniss Everdeen is a girl from District 12. In the future, America is divided into 12 districts under a totalitarian government. Once a year, at a grim lottery known as a ""reaping,"" two adolescents' names are drawn to represent each district in a televised battle to the death known as The Hunger Games. Katniss, 16, has survived several reapings, but when her younger sister's name is called, she volunteers to fight in her stead.<br/><br/>Directed by 55-year-old Gary Ross, The Hunger Games isn't exactly brimming with angst and youthful energy. His craftsmanship is competent, but Ross puts too much pressure on the talent to sell Collins' world and contributes too little himself. Where's the scale? The novel pops with aesthetic opportunity, but Ross isn't visionary enough to really capture our imagination. District 12 is a destitute mining community that counts starvation and black lung among the leading causes of death. Show us that. By skimping on act one atmosphere, the director undermines the comparative splendor of the bizarre and extravagant capitol city.<br/><br/>Ross routinely sabotages the emotional potential of Collins' story and setting. The reaping in particular lacks narrative punch. Ross adequately animates the flesh of the scene, but as a storyteller he fails to find the soul. On paper, a family is splintered and an act of defiant bravery instigates a Herculean trial. Ross puts the impetus on the audience to feel the weight of that choice — artistically, he renders the scene with all the gravitas of mild indigestion.<br/><br/>And the cast — talented though its constituents may be — often feels curiously misplaced. Kudos to Ross for casting an anti A-lister like Jennifer Lawrence as his lead, but he negates any goodwill with clunky misallocations of more famous folk. Woody Harrelson sticks out like a sore thumb as drunkard slash mentor (in that order) Haymitch Abernathy. Harrelson's half- hearted take on the character plays like a spacey stoner from a bad SNL sketch. Stanley Tucci and Lenny Kravitz are also underwhelming as Hunger Games host Caesar Flickerman and stylist Cinna, respectively.<br/><br/>It feels like an eternity before the games actually get underway, and it quickly becomes apparent (this is a criticism consistent with the novel) that any illusion of challenging the preconceptions of preteen storytelling disintegrates. Granted, there's a bloody death or two, but mostly Katniss gets by with clever alternatives to direct combat — there's something distinctly Home Alone-ian about watching her drop a hornets' nest onto her would-be assassins. For Ross' part, he frames the action just inelegantly enough to obscure any offensive violence.<br/><br/>Ultimately, what works about Hollywood's Hunger Games adaptation are the traits intrinsic to the novel. A worthy premise lends a compelling backdrop to a young adult coming-of-age sci-fi romance whatchamacallit — and Ross borrows those ideas wholesale. It's all there. His is a relatively faithful transcription of the source material, and it's a shame he does so little to distinguish his version. He fails to replicate the emotional oomph of Collins' imperfect novel, and expands upon those imperfections with lazy visuals and uneven pacing. After all, when financial success is a certainty, there's little incentive for a director to think outside the box.<br/><br/>Naturally, my complaints will carry little weight with the Hunger Games superfans, for whom this film was expensively and exclusively realized. If you count yourself among that elite group — read no further. This is your film. Enjoy it."
"movieguy592","7","1","8","26 March 2012"," Well acted, faithful to the book, but a bit long
","*POSSIBLE SPOILERS*<br/><br/>Hungers Games, well-acted and seemed to keep the same eerie and dark theme of the book. <br/><br/>I get why (or at least I think I get why) they chose the movie the way they did, no I'm talking specifically about the hand-held ""shaky"" camera. That would be fine if combined with steady shot scenes after the hand-held camera scenes, however in the beginning of the movie the a lot of the hand-held camera scenes jump directly to more hand-held camera scenes. It takes some getting used to and yes it does get a little better as the movie progresses. I would have preferred they save the hand-held camera scenes specifically for the battle/fight scenes, but if you go in prepared like I did, you should be fine, just don't eat a whole lot before hand. <br/><br/>Now that that is out of the way.<br/><br/>The long and extended scenes without music. As one who hasn't read the whole book, I found a lot of these scenes boring. I'm taking a guess that these long-drawn out music-less scenes were on purpose for realism and emotional pull. It succeeded in creating more realism, but I feel if failed in the emotional pull - Let the actors act, Lawrence and Hutchinson both very talented actors, they were doing fine on their own. I found myself actually dosing off a bit during a few of these scenes where the emotion is felt, and the scenes seems to have no more purpose, yet the camera is still rolling but nothing is happening. <br/><br/>The special fx were pretty standard, but still cool. The film did a good job and trying to show the different lifestyles of each district with vibrant colors and fancy clothes for the rich and wealthy Capitol City, to the dreary and blue collar feel of District 12. It would have been nice to see them go a little more in depth with the 12 districts, but I think you'll get to see jest of it. <br/><br/>The film also gives you a nice simple and straight-forward love story subplot that does a very good job at setting up the potential love triangle. But Katniss' and Peeta's love story is done in a simplistic way that feels a bit more natural, even if it might have more to do with the finale of the competition.<br/><br/>Overall, while the film is slow in parts, and at times wants to make sure you know what emotion you should be conveying , and the camera movements may take some by surprise, it's well acted, and seems to stay pretty faithful to the book. <br/><br/>It might seem depressing, and the tone of the film is definitely dark and eerie. Don't expect flashy battle scenes of fights or deaths: some are quick, some are longer - but all are brutal, and few are beautiful."

","I'm in my 50's and went to see the movie with my wife and 14yr old son yesterday (opening weekend). My son and wife enjoyed it, although there were no raves. Personally, I was disappointed and thought that the movie lacked intensity. This is likely due to the producers aiming for a very definitely younger teen crowd. I haven't read the book so can't comment on that aspect. The first third of the movie dragged for me and the latter part had no real surprises, with a storyline that left me with no real empathy for the characters.<br/><br/>This movie will make a lot of money based purely from the effects of its marketing hype, but I can't see that continuing. I don't believe this movie will appeal to any male older than his mid-teen's. I'm not saying that this is a BAD movie, just that I think the premise could have been better explored in a darker, grittier, presentation with this future world detailed in more depth."

","The Australian Broadcasting Commission TV critic was scathing about the shaky hand held camera ( a pet hate of his) and what he described as poor direction. Had it not been for the local newspaper critic's rave review I would not have attended.<br/><br/>It was a very young audience and I figured I was in for a noisy viewing. But surprisingly, the audience was almost funereal. Almost reverent attention would be an apt description. <br/><br/>I was an interested viewer, but I noted that I was not in that state of anxious suspense that a really well made film can evoke. That may have been the root of the complaint about poor direction. That and the camera work. It was not the shaky camera I noticed - even though it made some of my YouTube efforts look positively rooted-to-the-earth stable. It was the surprisingly soft focus, lack of sharply defined clarity of some of the forest scenery.<br/><br/>It struck me that the author (and screen writer) may have picked a rich vein of young viewer familiar context by setting her political thriller up as a sort of Survivor - Big Brother television show. That might explain the lack of palpable, visceral tension. (at least until they released the hounds). Maybe kiddies are used to the long, drawn out, only occasionally exciting Big Brother format. Maybe people forming and dissolving strategic alliances has replaced the ongoing, inescapable terror. <br/><br/>But there is more to Hunger Games than a new take on the Survivor formula It has at its hearth the idea that our culture has no problem with sending its sons and daughter out to engage in killing each other for no truly worthwhile purpose. (Vietnam, Iraq, Afghanistan). Those of us who have heard the late Howard Zinn could extend that back to World War II and from there, to the very dawn of ""civilisation"".<br/><br/>I am told that the subsequent novels in the series reveal a heroine toying with the idea of rejecting that barbarous notion and demanding that it be re-examined and changed. You don't get that with the Survivor television shows, or the vampire teen movies, so bring it on."
"dog-luver-1","7","1","8","23 March 2012"," Really good! but if you get a headache easily, do not watch.
","I am a fan of the hunger games, so i was really excited to see this movie. It did match the book in the best it could possibly do, that was the best part, there was a couple changes, but understandable why they were changed. The camera work however is another story, it was not very stable at all. Very shaky work, and some of the focusing on closeups were very fast and not very good. But other than that i did enjoy the movie. Another thing is if you are Obsessed with the book, like i mean read it like 5 times and no everything down to the last button, you are not in for a very good trip to the movies. Because you know way to much about the book and are expecting the best of the best, but the movie is NEVER the EXACT same as the book, the little details that they changed are going to make you mad. So you shouldn't of read the book 30 times. I only ready it once and i loved the movie!"
"willowtree_777","7","1","8","23 March 2012"," Nothing ""Mellarkable"" here
","With this movie, there are two groups: those who haven't read the books and those who have. I am in the second group, having read the books before there was even a thought of a movie and I really enjoyed them. I went to the midnight premiere and was really excited to see it unfold on the big screen. Did I like it? Well, that's complicated. I'm not going to bother describing the plot but just get right into the pros and cons. I may mention some spoilers, so be warned.<br/><br/>Pros: -The acting. No one was bad, everyone believable, even the newcomers such as Prim and Rue. Josh Hutcherson was impressive as Peeta, although most of his lines were awful, and Liam Hemsworth was good as Gale. I personally don't like Jennifer Lawrence, her voice irritates me and I felt like she was too tall and ""well fed"" to be Katniss. However, I was surprised, she was really realistic and I think she carried the role well. I was most impressed by the Careers though. They had hardly anything to work with but managed to make them believable and interesting, Cato and Clove especially. I was actually disappointed when Cato died, because he was an interesting character to watch.<br/><br/>-The plot. I was happy to see that there were hardly any changes. Sure, no Avoxes or how she really gets the pin, but it stuck close and that was great. The violence was toned down, but it still worked. I thought the side story with Seneca Crane was cool, because we get to see what's happening outside of the game, with the game-makers and the president. <br/><br/>Cons: I had lots of issues with the film, but most of them are nitpicky, silly things like goofs, but here are some of my bigger issues.<br/><br/>-The settings/costumes. I get that not everyone has the same idea of the locations in their head, but District 12 was way too nice looking and The Capitol didn't seem to have the futuristic ""wow"" factor I was looking for. I felt like most of the costumes were tacky, especially the other tributes outfits and some of the sets had a cheap look. I get that there's a budget, but still.<br/><br/>-The directing. I know everyone has complained about this too, but I have to say something. The shaky cam was so annoying! My eyes never adjusted to it and I had a hard time knowing what was happening. Its amateur and makes it seem like there is more happening than there really is. I felt like the director was one of the major issues with this movie. I was not impressed by him at all.<br/><br/>-The plot. I'm glad they stuck closely to the plot, but it felt like it was the overview of the Hunger Games that your friend would tell you, not a movie. Everything happened fast with no buildup. When Rue died, I wasn't even upset, because she'd only been on screen for like 10 minutes and hardly had any back-story. Why did Katniss care? If you haven't read the books, you wouldn't know about how she saw Rue as someone similar to Prim. The climax went nowhere and the Katniss/Peeta thing never was explained. Call me a fangirl, but I really wanted the cave scene to have more and been more realistic than two kisses and crappy dialogue. We get no feeling about the fake love story, why it's necessary or how Peeta and Katniss feel about it.<br/><br/>So, all in all, it was enjoyable, but I was very disappointed. I hope they can fix things or get a new director by the time Catching Fire happens."
"rannynm","10","1","9","3 August 2012"," A Must See!
","OMG, the Hunger Games is a MUST SEE! Julianna No one, reviews the film for KIDS FIRST! below: Video review here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHyKC-RSNnw<br/><br/>Adapted from the first of 3 novels, written by Suzanne Collins and directed by Gary Ross, this film brought such an adrenaline rush of excitement that I couldn't sit still watching it. Set in a not too distant future, where North America has been replaced by Panem, where there is a Capitol and 12 Districts. The movie is about the struggles of a nation divided, where the districts must fight for survival and where the Capitol controls all of the districts. Each of the 12 districts must have one boy and one girl enter the ""Hunger Games"", where they represent their District in a battle for their life, while their citizens watch the action live as it happens. Twenty-four entrants, but only 1 will survive. Its reality TV at its absolute worst. The main characters that we learn most about are Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence, X-Men: First Class) and Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson, Journey 2: The Mysterious Island), who are from District 12, the poorest of the 12 districts. They are also my favorite characters. I like Peeta, because he is the underdog of all underdogs, and he wanted to stay true to himself and not let the games change him in any way. I love Kat, because she is a great role model for young girls like me. She is smart and courageous and she is always looking out for those who need her. She shows that just because you may not be the richest, or best looking, or most liked person, if you have the will and fight to survive, you can overcome any obstacle. I loved this movie so much, it's hard to pinpoint any one scene I like the most. The scenes leading up to game really set the tone of the movie. Then you have the training scenes, which too are very well done. I would say the scenes during the actual Hunger Games are my favorite, as that is where the most action occurs. The way the Seneca Crane (Wes Bentley, Gone) controls the Games using hi-tech computer technology, was fantastic. This movie had me on the edge of my seat and had my emotions all over the place. The cinematography in the Capitol and the arena was amazing. One of the best special effects was how they made it look like Kat and Peeta were on fire as they entered the arena, and then later in the interview, they again made it appear that Kat's dress was on fire when she spun around for the crowd. While the movie contained some graphic violence, it was necessary to stay true to the storyline. It was no worse than a lot of video games that kids play today, it's just difficult to watch kids killing other kids. For me, I not only want to see the film again, but I started reading the books as well, so I can compare them when the next film is released. I think this movie is appropriate for ages 11 and up, though for some younger kids, the few short instances of violence are intense and graphic, but they are short lived. I rate this film 5 out of 5 stars, but only because I can't give it more than that. Even my dad stayed awake throughout the whole movie and that never happens! ""May the odds be ever in your favor!"""
"phoenix0879-1","7","1","9","8 April 2012"," A reasonable film
","First of all, I once again find myself appalled by some of the reviews on IMDb, giving the film 1 out of 10 on the basis that ""it's a teen movie"" or that it waters down the violence. On the first point, teenagers are one of the largest film-going demographics and the films are based on a series of young-adult (re: teenagers) books. Seems like a good fit to me. The second point, about the violence, I have only just started reading the first book so can't make much comment. But books can get away with a lot of things mainstream film-making cannot. If the film had included explicit and deadly violence against twelve year old's there would have been a huge outcry. They chose to make many of the deaths emotional rather than physical - Rue's, for example.<br/><br/>Anyway, enough of the short-comings of other reviews. What of the film itself? It starts strongly by establishing the heroine as a hunter and then swiftly moves on to the ""Reaping"" where a male and female are chosen to participate in the ""Hunger Games"", an annual televised blood sport, with one survivor. Think Big Brother meets the Colosseum of ancient Rome. However, from this point the film slows down a lot, what with having to establish a context for the story, showcasing the macabre joy the citizens of the Capitol get from the hunger games and the obligatory training scenes. Some nice moments of dark humour are peppered here and there (look for a scene with Katniss, the only living District 12 victor, breakfast and a knife). But for the most, this second act is bogged down by exposition. However, when attempting to establish such a rich world this often happens.<br/><br/>Things change greatly once the games are under-way. The violence is relatively tame, as noted above and elsewhere. The crew appear to have decided to focus on the emotional elements. Katniss's desire to avoid killing people by simply staying out of their way until they are all finished off by each other or exposure, which the show-runners put a stop to in fairly dramatic fashion. The look of regret when she realises her only way to survive after being surrounded whilst up a tree is to cut loose a nest of deadly genetically engineered wasps. How she lets a lone guard wander off before destroying a supplies cache, when she could have killed him easily. This may be avoiding violence, but the way it is done serves as strong character building work, which turns Katniss from a two dimensional cut-out into a real person.<br/><br/>Many of the films twists (Katniss taking her sisters place, for example) are clearly telegraphed and many emotional moments feel manipulative, not genuine. But I think the latter is a deliberate move by the film- makers as one of the key topics of the film is how the government uses the games to manipulate the population (both of the Capitol and the 12 Districts that support it) and how they manipulate the contestants - blatantly - to achieve that goal. Manipulation is the key subject here and it's handled very well. From a popular TV personality performing the governments agenda wonderfully to the way the games work behind the scenes (rules are changed to get the audience to root for 'star crossed lovers' when it emerges Peeta, Katniss's male counterpart from District 12, has feelings for her). This commentary is what really drives the film along and makes the rather slow second act bearable.<br/><br/>This is by no means a great film, but it's not a terrible one either. It's a 'blockbuster' that tries to carry a strong message. Sometimes the message is overt, other times it's more subtle. It's reasonably well done. 7 out of 10."
"kkosteck","10","1","9","2 April 2012"," Great Movie, Americas next big franchise. Tired of Battle Royale comparisons. Read this if you think the movie is a ripoff
","I am writing this review because I loved the movie and am tired of seeing so many people saying this is a ripoff of Battle Royale. This movie was very well done. The actors all did a great job and Jennifer Lawrence was amazing as capturing Katniss. The movie did not feel as if it was dragging on at all and I was left with wanting more. There were a lot of great comparisons with the book and I loved how extra things were added (seeing the control room for example). The only reason I give the film 9 stars instead of 10 is because the shaky camera made me slightly dizzy at the beginning, but as the movie goes on the severity of the shakiness decreases and you don't even notice it. The violence was perfect for the rating, if you want to see violence you get it. The initial run to the cornucopia is amazing. I very much enjoyed the book series and feel like the film did the book justice. Yes stuff was left out or altered, but its necessary to those that have not read the books.<br/><br/>FOR ALL OF YOU WHO SAY ITS A RIPOFF OF BATTLE ROYALE,<br/><br/>The premise behind the Hunger Games is much deeper than Battle Royale. In Battle Royale 40 random students are selected out of 800,000 to fight to the death until 1 remains. Why? There is an unemployment problem and the Japanese government thinks that the students will be prevented from rebelling? How does this solve the unemployment issue? It doesn't its useless slaughter. Why not teach how beneficial education is for jobs? Also, in the movie every student seems surprised that this is happening. Shouldn't this be something to be prepared for? Don't get me wrong, its not a terrible film, but the whole idea behind it is not well thought out and the characters are so inhumane its impossible to connect with them. As for the Hunger Games,<br/><br/>It takes place in a post-apocalyptic world where America is divided into 12 districts and the Capitol. SPOILER ALERT, there used to be 13 districts but they rebelled and started an uprising. The capitol eventually won and destroyed the district. To instill fear in the nation and keep the districts in check they take two children from each district (12-18 years of age) and make them fight to the death. Sure the capitol may enjoy it and the few career tribute districts (those who train for the games their whole lives) but the rest of the districts hate the games and how in-humane it may seem. The meaning behind the games is much deeper than in Battle Royale and you can feel the pain of the districts.<br/><br/>THE MOVIES ARE NOT IDENTICAL, I guarantee that 90% of the people saying its a rip off A) Have not read the books. B) Have not seen Battle Royale or C) are just trying to get attention.<br/><br/>Go see the Hunger Games. It is fantastic"
"seldomchimera","8","1","9","25 March 2012"," Not a bad movie - Short Review/Summary
","I had not read any of the books prior to seeing the movie. I heard from others that the book was good and so I had decent expectations for the movie. Although I was a bit hesitant in seeing this, as it had been dubbed the next Twilight etc but was reassured by Box Office Mojo that the love story stood aside for the action.<br/><br/>The general idea of having a group of children being forced to kill one another in order to survive and for the entertainment of others, was quite shocking to me (and really made me empathize for the children). Though this idea originated from other sources..<br/><br/>Negative Aspects : - The camera continuously shaking and turning during the action scenes were an awful idea that truly hurt my vision lol.. - Some scenes/scenarios were just plain stupid such as the group of kids deciding to wait for Jennifer's character to come down from the tree and not being able to catch/shoot her down.. and when the crucial supplies were placed in the center of the arena and the ""bad kids"" didn't even notice Jennifer's character near by... the most ridiculous is when the dogs weren't able to chase down the two characters..<br/><br/>Overall, I thought the movie was good to watch and really is something different.. I would recommend anyone to see it and for those that are put off by the comparisons to Twilight etc, don't be! Go watch and you'll see for yourself."
"jankovic","8","1","10","26 March 2012"," Movie is good
","Read the books, liked the movie, it didn't add or subtract anything important from the books, very interesting and watchable. Books are not all time classic, so the movie can not exceed and become a best movie ever. I can not understand why so many people is speaking so negative about it on IMDb boards, official critics are favorable and score is 8/10 on IMDb. THIS IS NOT NEW TWILIGHT, there is no reason to burn this movie or movies yet. It's sin is I suppose that the book it is based on is bestseller. So are the Game of Thrones, and nobody dares to say something bad about new HBO acquisition. Well, so were The Godfather, and to many people the movie is the very best movie of all time. The fact is that the book would not be written if Paramount people didn't sit on Puzzo's head until he wrote the book. Good book, great movie. Solid book, solid movie to entertain yourself one afternoon and to have something to think about. Will the Trilogy survive the test of time is yet to be seen."
"uofmsuperfan12","9","1","10","26 March 2012"," Pleases the senses without losing the story
","I have to admit I went in to the theater last Friday afternoon slightly apprehensive. I hadn't heard of this series until I started seeing previews a few months ago, and then read the first two books a week before the movie came out at the urging of my boss. I really enjoyed the books not only because of the tension filled action-y bits, but also because of the political background about a repressed people.However, I was building up the movie in my mind at how good it could be that I was getting afraid it would let me down. I got to the theater with only 32 tickets left, my friends a few places in line behind me, and grabbed a free poster from the dwindling pile next to the register. I even was interviewed by the local paper about seeing the movie. But the apprehension was still there. By the time the movie ended, it was all gone. This movie captures the feel of the book wonderfully. It has the usual variations that book-to-movie films always do, but those usually don't bother me. The movie version of The Hunger Games captures the feel of a girl thrust into a much bigger world than the one she knows and then is dropped into a deadly game in which she does everything she can just to survive. Some people will say the movie isn't gory enough compared to the books, or that there isn't enough action, or that it is just a retelling of this movie or that movie. The Hunger Games melds two stories together; one about a girl's will to do what it takes to survive in a deadly environment, and two, the political movings of a society where she is just a piece of a much larger game. I think the aspect of the movie that struck me the most was how it strikes the audience visually and audibly without overwhelming you. The score was woven in to bring out the emotions of some scenes, and help hold them back in others. The movie looks great too. The actors give genuine performances that capture the essence of their characters. This movie is a must see for fantasy-story lovers anywhere. It is forward enough to hold teenagers attention and deep enough to engage those that are a little bit older. It leaves you invested in the characters and yearning to know what is coming next. Back to book three for me...."

","I love the books - and i read the whole series in a few days. Therefore i was very crabby to see this movie. After the first time i can tell you: I was very very satisfied with this movie. I think it only really works when you not only think about what you see, but also what you and the characters think/feel. The film works also without a pompous score - it mostly works only with the feelings transfered by the characters. <br/><br/>Finally i want to go down on my knees before the play of Jennifer Lawrence!<br/><br/>I cried during reading the books and i also cried during watching the film!!<br/><br/>For me: My new favorite!"

","I have not read the book; my kids have them and I plan on reading after I finish what I'm reading now, so this perspective is from someone with little knowledge about what was supposed to happen.<br/><br/>It was intense. My emotional level was kept high nearly the entire movie, it didn't seem to let up. In many ways, this is less an action/sci-fi movie than it is a compelling tragedy, and I cannot wait to get reading the books because I simply do not want to wait until the next movie to see what happens.<br/><br/>We all know the premise - it's written in the IMDb summary; Katniss Primrose volunteers to take her younger sister's place after the younger sister is selected in a lottery to join the Hunger Games.<br/><br/>Each district must supply a boy and a girl, aged 12 to 16, to compete, chosen by lottery in a spectacle aptly called ""the reaping."" Out of the 24, there is only one winner and death for the others. The districts are essentially all impoverished, with hunger being rampant; each district supplies the ""capitol"" with it's resources, but they are all kept on the verge of starvation. The ""winning"" district is supplied more food, thus ""the Hunger Games.""<br/><br/>Like the spectacle of gladiators, the Hunger Games are the opiate of the masses in this dystopian future; more heinous considering kids as young as 12 are compelled to compete. The ""tributes,"" as they are called, are dressed up, paraded around the city, and interviewed one by one on what we would call TV in a macabre display as odds are calculated for each one for betting. Here we get to meet the tributes, learn which ones we like, which ones we don't, all the while knowing only one can live.<br/><br/>The movie predictably moves on to the ""games"" themselves; very compelling and, after accepting the premise, very real. This movie doesn't do what the ""masses"" want it to do. I was on the verge of tears nearly the whole movie, and they weren't tears of joy. As a parent it may have affected me more than others. Still, by the end of the movie I was left wanting more, and so definitely am looking forward to the next installments, as well as reading them myself."

","First, I would like to say that I have never been so excited for a movie adaptation in my life.<br/><br/>The Hunger Games trilogy is the best book series I've read to date, and I was a bit worried that the movie adaptation would be vastly changed as they normally are.<br/><br/>For the most part, it really did stay true to the book with some minor details that were changed (Katniss suffered a burn on her calf, not her thigh, Peeta hinted to Katniss to strike Cato's hand by drawing an X in blood, not tapping the hand, etc).<br/><br/>Some people are questioning the shaky camera. I actually enjoyed it from that perspective as it felt more gritty. If it were straight-on shots while running through the woods, it wouldn't have been the same.<br/><br/>Praise must be given to the cast, especially Jennifer Lawrence as she perfectly conveyed the complex character of Katniss. You felt her pain and anguish. Lawrence is a force to be reckoned with. Not only is she naturally beautiful, but her acting ability is well beyond her years.<br/><br/>Some are making comments about Josh Hutcherson being cast as Peeta. I questioned it at first, but after seeing him take on the role with such vulnerability and strength, I was pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>Also, hats off to Amandla Stenberg, Alexander Ludwig, and Elizabeth Banks. They were also great in their roles.<br/><br/>Overall, the film was raw, frightening, and fantastic. I am sincerely looking forward to the rest of the franchise.<br/><br/>Now, let's hope Kellan Lutz can be cast as Finnick Odair."
"pop_tart_22","9","1","10","25 March 2012"," The World Should Be Watching
","As a fan of the books, I was a bit unsure going into the movie. After all, many Hollywood adaptions of my favorite books have in the past been bitter disappointments, and I have walked out of several book-to-movie adaptions grumbling about wasted money and time spent I will never have back. After seeing this, though, my hope in Hollywood has been restored. Yes, this movie has its flaws like all others, but overall, I was very impressed. Right off the start, they do a great job setting up the story and they easily throw the audience into this post-apocalyptic future. Jennifer Lawrence does a wonderful job portraying the lead role of Katniss Everdeen. As the movie goes on, you are pulled more and more into it. During the games, I was on the edge of my seat the whole time. When it was finished, the audience clapped and left gushing about how thrilling the movie was. Though they did cut out some parts and change a few things, it wasn't anything I was about to throw a fit over. The changes and cuts were fine and I thought actually made the story make more sense. I laughed, I cried, and I was on the edge of my seat the whole time. I'd have to say this was definitely one of the better movies I've seen all year. However, I would have to say the movie may be a little more difficult to grasp if you haven't read the book. With any book-to-movie adaption, I always recommend reading the book first, and this was no exception. I went with a friend who hadn't read the books and once or twice she had to lean over and ask me to clarify a few things. However, she was impressed with the movie when it was over and immediately went to a bookstore afterwards to buy the whole trilogy. Another minor bone I have to pick with this movie would be the fact that the ending felt a bit rushed and the overall climax wasn't as thrilling as it was in the novel. The violence, too, was toned down a bit for a PG-13 rating, which is something I can understand in order to market the movie to a bigger audience. In any case, I loved it and would seriously recommend seeing this."
"martinc003971","8","1","10","25 March 2012"," ""Hunger Games"" leaves you wanting more...
","I read The Hunger Games for 11th Grade English... Usually I don't like reading books at all but I caught myself immersed in the world of ""The Hunger Games"". The movie starts in the city of Panem one of the 13 districts in the capitol where the games are held every year. The districts selects 1 boy and one girl to compete in the games.<br/><br/>Katiness volunteers to take her sister's place after her name is picked during ""The Reaping"". She is District 12s first volunteer tribute in the 74 years of the games... At first Katiness doesn't know whether she can win the games for her sister but she does promise she will TRY to win for her. Im now going to skip ahead a little bit to the actual games....<br/><br/>Katiness and her friend are thrown into the arena but before that happens Haymitch tells her that there are arrows but to not go for them yet but to stand her ground... Once the clocks sounds the tributes go after what supplies they can. Tributes end up having there throats slashed and machete's thrown in their backs Katiness stands her ground. <br/><br/>Tributes end up dying off very quickly I think within the first 8 hours 8-10 tributes are already dead. Katiness ends up meeting a tribute named ""Rue"" she gives Katiness guidance on how to take out other tributes. There is one point where Katiness is almost killed by a District 2 tribute... A tribute from District 11 hears the fight going on and picks the girl up and slams her head against a metal wall 2 times (EPIC and AWESOME) thus killing the tribute and saving Katiness' life and because Rue also died. <br/><br/>There is also a confrontation between Peeta and another tribute at the end of the film and the other tribute is very bloody... The other tribute threatens to kill Peeta by choking him. Katiness shoots an arrow at the tribute and gets him right in the neck and kills him and his body get eaten and torn to shreds by the wolves/dogs. Katiness and Peeta end up winning the games and District 12 has two winners.<br/><br/>I give this movie 8/10. I feel there could have been a little more violence to depict more of the games. AWESOME MOVIE overall.<br/><br/>Go See It!"
"Legendary_Badass","7","1","10","24 March 2012"," Saved by Jennifer Lawrence
","The Hunger Games benefits heavily from movie-by-marketing filmmaking, at least in terms of exposure. Sourced from a series of popular young adult novels by Suzanne Collins, the opening weekend is expected to make bank if not rewrite records. <br/><br/>Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) has volunteered to take her sister's place in the upcoming Hunger Games, a state sanctioned gladiatorial event for kids ages 12-18. Presented as a TV show that keeps the 12 districts involved from uprising, Katniss is trained in both survival skills as well as presentation. Her mentors consist of Effie Trinket (Elizabeth Banks), Cinna (Lenny Kravitz), and most importantly Haymitch (Woody Harleson).<br/><br/>Sadly there's at least a solid hour of buildup for a rather lackluster blood sport. Blame the PG- 13 rating if nothing else. The entire film is shot with a disproportionate shot selection. If you're into seeing the wrinkles on Elizabeth Banks, The Hunger Games is your movie. I haven't seen this many close-ups since Speed 2: Cruise Control. If the audience is seeing nothing but a blur of faces, they sure aren't seeing violence. Another thing they're not seeing is set decoration. <br/><br/>As the story develops it becomes painfully obvious how this tale panders to the female psyche, resulting in a concoction that drives them to theatres. There's Katnis, the working class yet stylish heroine. She's talented with a bow and arrow, though I wonder how this futuristic society has overlooked the developments we have in compound bow technology. The men are cowardice. especially Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) who is teemed with Katnis as her counterpart to represent District 12.<br/><br/>In just the realm of cinema it's obvious there are two sources of inspiration. The gorific reality TV comes from The Running Man (1987). The kid vs. kid aspect is found in Battle Royale (2000). It's the latter that compares best. Kinji Fukasaku's Battle Royale is a tighter, more action packed, more dramatic, even funnier film. A classroom of children think they're going on a trip, but land on a deserted island with orders to kill each other. They watch a comical training video instead of sit through days of flashy interviews, chariot rides, and jungle gym exercise. The wildcards thrown in to keep the game progressing are truly fearsome and endless more probable than a computer program's summed canines. With each death in Battle Royale emotions pour out. We learn that everyone is connected, that some feelings need to come out, the value of friendship, and the price sustaining one's life. With The Hunger Games there are some bounds forged, buy the adventure puts them through few tests.<br/><br/>The casting of Academy Award nominee Jennifer Lawrence does so much for the film that I wouldn't be shocked in the least if she didn't receive and Oscar nomination. You'll note how Kristen Stewart leads the fangirl series that is being unseeded, and that no one has ever considered her Bella Swan for anything other than a Razzie. If not for the eyes that speak without words of Lawrence, The Hunger Games would be a complete disaster. I can't stop you from seeing it but I'd like to encourage you to check in on the true source material, the aforementioned films.<br/><br/>You can check out my (some would say comical) video review at my site VaughnOnMovies.com"
"GaneshKSalian","Null","1","10","24 March 2012"," A good movie
","The Hunger Games directed by Gary Ross is an excellent movie.<br/><br/>Based on the novel ""The Hunger Games"" written by Suzanne Collins,the movie has some really good performances.<br/><br/>Story:- In 2112, the nation of Panem has risen out of the ruins of what was once known as North America. Due to an unsuccessful uprising by the districts of Panem, a raffle (known as the ""reaping"") is held to choose one boy and one girl (ranging from ages 12–18) from each of the twelve districts to participate in the Hunger Games, a competition in which each contestant (known as the ""tributes"") battles to the death until only one is left. The winner or victor receives fame and fortune. The Hunger Games are a yearly reminder to the 12 districts of the Capitol's authority and punishment for their rebellion over 70 years ago in which the 13th district was destroyed.<br/><br/>In District 12, sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) cares for her mother (Paula Malcomson) and her sister Primrose ""Prim"" (Willow Shields) since her father died in a mine accident when she was 11. Each year, since the age of 12, Katniss' name has been placed in the reaping more than once. In return for taking this extra annual risk, she receives extra grain and oil for her family. In addition, Katniss has been illegally hunting for food outside the boundary fences of District 12 with her friend Gale (Liam Hemsworth), whose father died in the same mining accident.<br/><br/>Prim, now age 12, has her name placed in the reaping for the first time—only once—and it is unexpectedly drawn. Katniss volunteers to replace her sister in the Games. She competes against other tributes, including Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson), the male tribute from District 12, who has secretly loved Katniss since childhood and who once showed her a kindness she could never forget.<br/><br/>Before the Hunger Games begin, she is given a stylist named Cinna (Lenny Kravitz) and a Capitol escort named Effie (Elizabeth Banks) to help her make a good impression with potential sponsors. Haymitch Abernathy (Woody Harrelson), a drunk and the only living victor from District 12, mentors both Katniss and Peeta before and during the Hunger Games. Once in the arena, Katniss must rely on her hunting skills, stealth, speed, and wits in order to survive. She also has to fight her anger for the Capitol and 'put on a good show' in order to receive food and aid from sponsors.<br/><br/>The only drawback of the movie it proceeds slow making it boring for the viewer.<br/><br/>Since the movie's story is based on the novel,so there is nothing original.<br/><br/>The direction is fine.<br/><br/>The screenplay is good.<br/><br/>Performances:- Jennifer Lawrence is excellent,while Josh Hutcherson is good.Woody Harrelson excels.Elizabeth Banks is good too.Lenny Kravitz is subtle.Stanley Tucci is okay.Liam Hemsworth is fine.<br/><br/>All in all,""The Hunger Games"" is an excellent movie .I am giving it a six on ten."

","That ""The Hunger Games"" is so timely and intelligent is precisely the reason why it's also so frightening. It depicts a time and place in which the failures of mass society are exploited for the entertainment of the privileged few. In this case, it's in the form of an annual competition to the death, one that's captured via hidden cameras and aired for the rest of the world to see. Whatever they call it in this alternate reality, it would be called reality TV in ours. Thank God, we have not devolved to the point of watching people kill each other. We have, however, sunk to some pretty low depths. We celebrate people like Simon Cowell and Gordon Ramsay, who achieve notoriety by being bullies. We watch as groups of men or women vie for a marriage proposal from a woman or man they know nothing about. We witness Kim Kardashian earn millions for doing nothing, apart from looking beautiful.<br/><br/>Adapted from the novel by Suzanne Collins, ""The Hunger Games"" is set in an unspecified future time, at which point a new nation has developed from the wreckage of North America. This nation is presided over by the Capitol, where the rich and powerful flaunt themselves with highly advanced technologies and outlandish fashion choices. The rest of the nation is divided into twelve districts, where the people live in squalor and are essentially slave labor for their respective natural resources. An unsuccessful uprising seventy years ago resulted in the destruction of a thirteenth district. As punishment, one boy and girl from each district, both between the ages of twelve and eighteen, is chosen by raffle each year to participate in the Hunger Games, a competition in which the contestants fight each other in a forested arena. The winner is the one still alive at the end.<br/><br/>In District 12, we meet sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence), a skilled archer and hunter who has cared for her little sister, Primrose (Willow Shields), and her mother (Paula Malcomson) since the death of their father some years earlier. When representatives of the Capitol come to town, Primrose is selected as the female contestant – or tribute, as they're known in this alternate reality. Katniss, desperate to save her sister, volunteers to take her place. The male tribute is Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson), who harbors a crush on Katniss and once showed her an act of kindness. They're both escorted to the Capitol by the preening, clown-faced Effie Trinket (Elizabeth Banks), where, before the games begin, they're shown luxury the likes of which they've never seen.<br/><br/>Along with a good deal of physical training, Katniss and Peeta are given a personal stylist named Cinna (Lenny Kravitz) and an adviser named Haymitch (Woody Harrelson), a disheartened drunk. They make it clear that survival depends in large part on personality; the more hearts they win over, the more likely they are to receive food and aid from sponsors. They also stress that all the people want is a good show. Indeed, all tributes are paraded in the town square to cheering throngs of thousands. They're even greeted by the President (Donald Sutherland), who secretly knows that the real reason the Hunger Games exist at all is the give District viewers the illusion of hope. All tributes are dolled up and flaunted on a flashy reality show hosted by the flamboyant Caesar Flickerman (Stanley Tucci), whose white teeth gleam along with his sequined jacket.<br/><br/>Once the tributes are physically lifted into the arena, the story abandons hype and celebrity in favor of a brutal, desperate battle for survival, one that's highly disturbing but no less compelling. Although director Gary Ross doesn't shy away from depicting the deaths of young people, he refrains from being gratuitous, and for that, he deserves a great deal of credit. This is not about tasteless gore effects and the exploitation of faceless teens; we're actually made to care about these characters so that, when they die, it elicits a genuine emotional reaction. It's not easy to watch, but then again, it isn't supposed to be. Imagine what it must be like for the District populations. They're forced to watch as someone's son, daughter, brother, or sister is murdered as a form of mass entertainment.<br/><br/>Katniss and Peeta are enamoring characters, mostly because they learn to survive without sacrificing their humanity. With Katniss, we see this through her bond another tribute, a twelve-year-old girl named Rue (Amandla Stenberg). With Peeta, we see this through his growing affection for Katniss. It's precisely because of them that the people behind the scenes devise a number of rating-boosting strategies, including a last-minute rule change I will not give away. I suppose one could consider ""The Hunger Games"" an enjoyable movie, although I believe it's intended to be something more than that. It tells a story that's so deeply troubling and yet so remarkably insightful. It makes some valid points, not just on the state of what passes for entertainment nowadays, but also on society, politics, and the capacity for hope in dark times.<br/><br/>-- Chris Pandolfi (www.atatheaternearyou.net)"
"alexiambark","7","1","10","23 March 2012"," It was overall, a good movie, but I wish it would have stayed truer to the books!
","I still don't like the actors for Peeta and Gale. I do like Jennifer Laurence more now, but I think others could have been better for the part. The fact that, in the move, Katniss is taller than Peeta? That bugs me to no end. She's supposed to be a slight, small girl, and while Jennifer is a good actress, she's not who I would have chosen for the part. She did do better than I expected though. I don't like Josh Hutcherson. I never really have, and I absolutely dislike him for the part of Peeta. He looks better with brown hair, first off, and he's super short, and my list can go on and on but I won't bore you with my dislike of him. Liam Hensworth Now , he'd have been a good Peeta. And alright, He's a better Gale than I expected, but I think that if they had searched a bit more, they'd have found someone perfect. Woody Harrelson is a decent Haymitch. Not exactly what I'd imagined, but good enough to make me happy with his appointment. <br/><br/>Now, off of the characters (For the most part).<br/><br/>Buttercup's not being orange disappointed me very much.<br/><br/>I loved the way they did the reaping, and have come to love Willow Sheilds as Prim.<br/><br/>Katniss's mother annoys me. She's a good choice though.<br/><br/>I want that train.<br/><br/>What happened to the hole knife-throwing, glass-breaking scene?!?!<br/><br/>I love the way they did the capitol citizens.<br/><br/>Uhh, Where exactly is Katniss' Prep team? They're not even identified, not really (Seeing as I wanted to go dressed up as Octavia, this upset me greatly)<br/><br/>Cinna rocks. Just Saying.<br/><br/>The flames weren't exactly what I'd expected, but I know that my vision of it was probably far-fetched.<br/><br/>President Snow is not what I imagined at all. HE HAS A BEARD. Not sure how I feel about it though.<br/><br/>I like Cesaer Flickerman. And Claudius Templesmith. <br/><br/>The interviews were awesome.<br/><br/>I've decided I would like the couple who played Cato and Clove as Katniss and Peeta. Right size and good actors and all.<br/><br/>There was no Dehydration<br/><br/>I liked the fire.<br/><br/>I love how they cut back and forth between the Capitol and the arena to explain things and such.<br/><br/>Tracker Jacker effects were awesomely done.<br/><br/>They didn't really play up the Katniss/Peeta romance as much as they should have. (They only kissed once!)<br/><br/>I loved the blowup scene.<br/><br/>What happened to Katniss loosing her hearing in her left ear?!<br/><br/>It all seemed so rushed.<br/><br/>Peeta as a part of the ground was awesomely done.<br/><br/>There was no sleeping medicine, and no goat story! D=<<br/><br/>Thresh was awesome.<br/><br/>Clove was awesome.<br/><br/>The medicine wasn't in a syringe?(not bugged by that really, it's just something I noticed)<br/><br/>The dogs were good, but they weren't mutts that gave the strange impression of dead tributes.<br/><br/>What happened to Peeta's loss of blood and such in his leg? <br/><br/>Cato's death scene is amazing<br/><br/>So are the berries.<br/><br/>They rushed the end.<br/><br/>Cornucopia isn't gold! D=<br/><br/>What happened to the revelation of Peeta's new leg? Does he even have one?<br/><br/>There was like, no conversation on the train ride back.<br/><br/>BUTTERCUP WASN'T ORANGE. (Seriously, I expected them to get at least that right. It's not as if finding an orange cat is that hard)<br/><br/>And that pretty much wraps it up.<br/><br/>Overall, I enjoyed the movie. I'll be seeing it again, soon, I hope. I wished they had stayed truer to the book though, because I'm not sure how it will reflect on the next movie. If they make Catching Fire into a movie, which I expect they will. I'll be interested to see who gets to play Finnick But, one last thing. The movie is a good compliment to the book, but for those who haven't read the book, I'm not sure how much you'd understand the movie. It left a lot out that would have aided it in making sense to those who haven't read it. Then again, because those who haven't read the book haven't been able to piece it together in their minds as I have, it might not have been so bad. <br/><br/>I'll be interested to see other people's reviews, though!"

","Just watched The Hunger Games with a bunch of friends and i have to say that i was blown away by it.... firstly let me just say this to all the people complaining about shaky camera handling that it was supposed to be like that.because when you are watching an intense scene in which the girl is being chased,you feel a rush of adrenaline and by direction of this kind that feeling is amplified,so for me it was superb direction.... Jennifer Lawrence played the role of Katniss Everdeen to perfection,displaying that perfect blend of anger,hurt and love.the other actors did justice to their parts as well,but Jennifer Lawrence as usual stole the show.on a grade of 1 to 10 i'll give her an 11.this is one of the few movies who remain true to their novels...for me this movie was brilliant in all aspects be it direction,acting or whatever... To all those who haven't watched it yet-you can't afford to miss this one people.<br/><br/>P.S To all those nutbags who r busy comparing this movie to Twilight- please stop making fun of your own self and also stop wasting other people's time because unlike you they have better things to do than to watch shitty movies or read books like TWILIGHT!!!"
"IllusionOfLife","8","1","11","25 March 2012"," Wishing I Had Seen the Movie First
","Typically when there's a movie I'm excited for that is based on a novel I will wait to see the film before I read the book in order to allow the filmmaker to tell me the story rather than get caught up in my own interpretations of it. The thing is, though, I wasn't excited for The Hunger Games. I had heard the book was great, but the marketing material looked as if it was geared mostly towards the Twilight crowd, of which I am most certainly not a member; so I went ahead and read the book. Now the book tells a compelling story with an interesting and timely political parallel, but it is not necessarily the most well-written thing I have ever read. Competent, but not excellent. However, what the book is is cinematic. The novel was absolutely begging to be made into a film and you could almost see author Suzanne Collins sending it off to publication and waiting by her phone for the film studios to start calling. As a filmmaker, and major film nerd, reading the book I started creating my own imaginary screenplay for the film and directing in my mind my version of The Hunger Games. The problem with this movie lies in the fact that it's not IllusionOfLife's The Hunger Games, it's Gary Ross' The Hunger Games. <br/><br/>As I mentioned, my biggest problem with the film was that it was not The Hunger Games movie that I would have directed, and while I know that sounds terribly pretentious of me, give me a second to explain. Due to the cinematic nature of the novel and the fact that as a filmmaker and a film fan I have certain sensibilities, there are things that I would have done differently while adapting the story, but that does not make them inherently better than what is in the film, just more aligned to my personal tastes. I regret now that I read the novel first because I think I would have appreciated the film much more from an objective perspective. That being said, Gary Ross does a great job adapting the material and, despite what the marketing campaign might have indicated, it doesn't fall into the trap of teenage melodrama that so many other similar films do. The love triangle that forms in the story is appropriately handled here and doesn't overtake the more important themes of the narrative. <br/><br/>The film has a very gritty and realistic feeling to it, and I know that those two words are buzz words that get thrown around a lot, often in the wrong context (Snow White and the Huntsman is neither gritty nor realistic, it's a big CG fantasy film that happens to have dark subject matter), here however, I mean it in the most literal sense. There are no big ""money shots;"" no grand, sweeping moments of spectacle; no massive visual effects set pieces; the whole thing is subdued in a way that I feel is very appropriate for the work. A lot of the camera work is hand held and intimate, and the score never attracts attention to itself and exists only to punctuate certain moments; listening to the score on iTunes would likely be boring, but it works perfectly in the context of the movie, often stepping out of the way in favor of complete silence when appropriate. <br/><br/>The performances were also fairly strong, which is something I was not expecting from this. There's a fairly low bar set for acting in similar films that are aimed at young adults and teenagers, but everyone did a good job in this film; even some of the casting decisions I wasn't sold on right away (Josh Hutcherson most notably) surprised me by taking on the role really well. It doesn't have the brilliance of something like the casting of the Harry Potter films, but few things do. <br/><br/>One thing the movie does cut significantly from the book is the lore and backstory, and I'm sure many fans of the novel will lose their minds over this, but it didn't bother me too much. Having too much of the movie dedicated to explaining the history of Panem would have taken time away from the core story and character development which arguably got trimmed too much already (I'll get to that in a moment). Not only that, but with the popularity of the book it's almost an absolute certainty that anyone seeing the film who hasn't already read the book will know someone who has, and conversations will inevitably be sparked about the lore of this world. There was just enough of the lore included to make sure the story at hand was in the proper context, but not too much that the film gets bogged down in the details. <br/><br/>My one legitimate complaint with this film, is that it rushes through some of the character development in order to keep moving the film along at a brisk pace. At 142 minutes the film is already pushing it for a mainstream blockbuster, but if they had taken some more time to really develop the relationships in the film (like that of Katniss and Rue or the dynamic that shifts between the two leads in the third act) I think it would have made for a stronger film. <br/><br/>The movie is an extremely well-made film and exceeded my expectations in many ways. It's not perfect, but I feel it does a good job of adapting the novel and setting up the trilogy. I also think that it is one that I'll appreciate more on repeat viewings as I'm able to set more and more of my personal vision aside and appreciate it more objectively than I do now. <br/><br/>B"
"achyutaghosh","9","1","11","25 March 2012"," The Hunger Games- Lively, Engaging, Violent- First real blockbuster of the year!
","Hungry for an excellent dystopian tale? How about a future where subjugated folks have to commit a ritual sacrifice, and teens kill each other off on prime time TV? How about a world where a totalitarian regime induces massive divide of resources? And how about an underdog story, where a 16 year old girl is able to beat the odds stacked against her and emerge as the new hope for the downtrodden.<br/><br/>Based on the first part of Suzy Collins' trilogy, it introduces us to a version of the world where the ruling nation is Panem, built on the ruins of war torn North America, which exerts total control over its 12 impoverished districts. Capitol, Panem's central city, is home to a wealthy, decadent elite, whose comfort is supported by the labor of those districts. The 12 districts had rebelled, ever since the rebellion was quelled, Panem conducts an annual event to drive home the notion of their dominion. In this annual event, a boy and a girl between the ages of 12 and 18 are chosen from each district by means of an annual lottery to engage in a battle for survival in a huge arena with cameras capture and transmit live to an audience, every move, every detail and of course, every gory death. The idea of domination through this gladiatorial display is intriguing, but as Donald Sutherland's cynical and twisted President Snow remarks – ""Hope, it is the only thing stronger than fear. A little hope is effective, a lot of hope is dangerous"" – the games give control over the 12 districts not only through fear but also through the hope that Panem will allow one to live.<br/><br/>The movie is long at 144 minutes, but not a single minute feels needless or unimportant, even though the fighting starts post interval. Right at the outset, we are introduced to the central character, Katniss Everdeen, a 16 year old who volunteers to participate in the ""games"" in place of her sister. Jennifer Lawrence plays Katniss with a rare combination of beauty, vulnerability, resourcefulness and steel. Katniss develops skills such as getting people to like her, and her god gifted abilities of being able to hunt, to survive the bloodbath. In the process, she makes friends, unites people, and wins hearts. And she comes out with more than her life intact, she also finds love.<br/><br/>Hunger Games targets the same audience as the Twilight series- female teens, features lethal kids, a love triangle, creative imagination and violence. But as a movie it leaves the vampire tales way behind in its effectiveness and involvement. The pace is brisk, there is plenty of shaky cam shots, the sound is often drowned out in the ultra violent scenes which gives it a surreal effect, but also helps the movie get a PG13 rating. The deaths are quickly done without much heart rendering, and the cinematography is simply awesome- Director Gary Ross who gave us Seabiscuit 10 years back, literally transports the audience into this dark and desolate jungle, where you can feel the hopelessness of Katniss through his signature close up shots. Blue haired TV host Ceasar, played by Stanley Tucci exemplifies the citizens of the Capitol who display the aesthetic cues of sci-fi fascism- fluorescent hairdos, crazy fashion, garish furniture, gaudy costumes and an excess of everything. <br/><br/>Watching Hunger Games, i couldn't resist drawing parallel to the modern Japanese classic- Battle Royale, with a similar story, but with a lot more gore, and with the children there actually enjoying the killing as compared to the more refined sensibilities of this version. But then, do i root for Katniss? But doesn't that mean i wish for the other children to butcher themselves? Is'nt it immoral?<br/><br/>All is fair when it comes to entertainment though, and Hunger Games is outstanding when it comes to that. We have a heroine who can make us cry for her, dishing out a layered performance and cementing her position as one of the leading young actresses of Hollywood. There is plenty of drama and romance, un-inhibited action, and some understated but superbly effective special effects. This has edge of the seat excitement, and intense drama, and i finally get the feeling that summer is on- this is the first summer blockbuster of the year! As the tagline goes- The World Will Be Watching- will you?<br/><br/>May the odds always remain in its favour- 9/10"
"raychielle41194","9","1","11","25 March 2012"," Really Great Movie
","As a fan of the books, I was really excited for this movie but I was still skeptical. To many great books have been made into bad movies. The Hunger Games is not one of those books.<br/><br/>First, the cast. I wasn't sure that the lead actors were the right choice but they all did a great job. Josh Hutcherson is perfect for Peeta. Jennifer Lawrence did Katniss's strength and courage justice. Liam Hemsworth's take on Gale was impressive. I also loved Woody Harrelson's Haymitch and Elizabeth Banks's Effie. Amandla Stenberg was wonderful as Rue. Her death scene made me tear up. The only other movie to do that was the seventh Harry Potter when Dobby died.<br/><br/>I was also very impressed with the scenery and set design. The Capitol looked just like I envisioned it while I was reading the book. The styling of the cast was also right on. Effie's outfits were my particular favorites.<br/><br/>Overall, I only have a couple of issues with the movie. Number 1: I wish that District 12 had been darker. The book describes it as a dark, depressing place covered in coal dust. The movie does show it rundown, but there was to much sunlight and I don't think I saw any coal dust. Issue Number 2: At the end of the Games, the mutts weren't made to resemble the dead tributes. To me, that was a very important thing. In the book it provided a really great emotional moment that the movie lacked. There are some other minor changes in the movie, but I felt like they didn't take anything away from the story.<br/><br/>Fans of the books should have no problem at least enjoying the film. I can't wait for Catching Fire!"
"daminecraft","9","1","11","25 March 2012"," One of the First to Follow the Book
","The main reason I had given this movie such a high rating was for the sole fact that it had followed the book, The Hunger Games so well. Most stories, for instance, The Lightning Thief, were very well written but once the movie came into play, it was incredibly rushed and done very poorly, skipping many crucial details.<br/><br/>With The Hunger Games, the book and movie were practically identical. The details that were in the book were portrayed in the movie almost exactly how I had pictured them to be when I had first read the book.<br/><br/>However one thing that had disappointed me in the movie, was some of the acting. Jennifer Lawrence's acting was spot on, just how Katniss was portrayed in the book. But one big character, that I wish was in the spotlight more and had acted more like himself, was Woody Harrelson (Haymitch). In most of the book, Haymitch was a crazy alcoholic that didn't really care about being their to mentor Peeta and Katniss, but instead, just for the alcohol. The only time I saw the real Haymitch was when they were riding the train to the Capitol. Other than that, he looked like a normal human would, and I was disappointed by that.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie was good, and I definitely recommend seeing it. Especially if you read the books."

The special effects where great and the costumes worn by the people in the capital where pretty wild.I loved that woody harelson is in it he plays a former victor who now trains the tributes. the arena and the tech associated with it is great.I thought the actors which are newcomers did an awesome job bring the book to life.

"HideousHades","7","1","11","22 March 2012"," Entertaining, But Inconsistent
","Enjoyable, no doubt. But obviously the depiction of the future was a little... inconsistent. The lifestyle of the people in the districts seemed like the 1850's, the clothes looked like the 1970's, a few aspects seemed futuristic, etc. So throughout the whole movie, I was confused in the temporal sense. <br/><br/>Also, they stressed heavily on the idea that some would die of starvation, dehydration, and so on in the battle. But none did. Only one death was not caused by another participant. They also stressed heavily on the fact that getting sponsorship was important. But no scene explained why sponsorship affected the Hunger games. Only from reading the books afterwords was I able to know why sponsorship was so important. <br/><br/>Although the movie had some flaws, it was very entertaining and didn't leave me bored for a second."
"honey-hill","9","1","12","25 March 2012"," One of the best book to movie adaptations I've ever seen
","I have been a fan of The Hunger Games since the day it came out as an ARC. I was terrified that the movie would be nothing like the book at all and that it would make me hate the series.<br/><br/>However, those fears turned out to be completely untrue. The adaptation was brilliantly done, and as any savvy reader can tell you, you can't expect everything in the books to end up on screen. I think Debra Zane(the person in charge of casting) made a very good choice in choosing Jennifer Lawrence to play Katniss. Not only can she act, she also got her characters emotions clearly portrayed without being mumbly or twitchy (Kristen Stewart, anyone?). I do believe that Jennifer Lawrence will be able to carry out the emotions, downfalls, and mood of Katniss in the next three movies."
"thenmethinks","8","1","12","25 March 2012"," An excellent attempt at staying true to the book.
","I thoroughly enjoyed reading the novel by Suzanne Collins and was therefore eager to see its representation on the big screen and I wasn't disappointed. Unless you wish to be picky about minor things (such as who gave Katniss the Mockingjay pin or the exclusion of elements concerning the mute serving girl) then the director managed to stay true to the novel for the sake of the fans - often something that detracts from novel-to-film attempts. I would have given this a 10-out-of-10 but for some rather important missing points. I looked for and missed the faces of the 20 eliminated tributes on the wild creatures. That scene was altered. Also, visually, it was difficult to show the Gamemakers altering the arena's temperature - an important element as Peeta & Katniss shared body heat in their cave and further cemented their quasi-relationship. Finally, their relationship wasn't convincing (even if it wasn't real.) Not enough kissing or thought-driven justification on Katniss's part to use Peeta. Anyone not knowing the novel would have believed she was falling for him. Best bit: (spoiler) the arrow through the apple and the look on their faces!"
"ashwetherall1","8","1","12","25 March 2012"," A slightly flawed but very enjoyable Adaptation
","Watched The Hunger games last night. It was a pretty good Movie adaptation of a very difficult book to put on film for a mass audience. The Acting and the look if the film was excellent especially Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson as Katniss and Peeta.<br/><br/>The violence,although very much toned down via the slightly blurred shaky cam fight scenes it was realistic enough for the viewer to take it seriously and not in an Arnie Swartzy way. Also the arena Special effects were very well done, but never over done so please TAKE NOTE Micheal BAY and JAMES CAMERON. <br/><br/>If i had one minor complaint,it would be that some of the much need humour regarding Haymitch, Effie and Cinna team of Helpers seems to have possibly left on the cutting room floor.<br/><br/>Finally some people have complained that The Hunger Games is not as true to the books as it could have been. But I wish to remind these people that neither was HARRY POTTER,JAWS,THE WOMAN IN BLACK or even THE RUNNING MAN of which the novel in emotion bares more of a resemblance to the Hunger Games than Japans Battle Royal.<br/><br/>All in all The Hunger Games wasn't perfect but I really enjoyed it and would recommend it."
"imbeware","8","1","12","24 March 2012"," Over-hyped but delivered
","The amount of drama, action, and a bit of romance in this movie is well-balanced. This movie is what I was hoping Predators (2010) and Gamer (2009) would be. In fact this movie is better than both of them combined. But of course there's still room for improvement. The only thing I dislike is the ending. You can say it leaves you wanting more or it was delivered ""too fast"" without much buildup. I was like ""oh that's the ending already."" BTW, I didn't read the book and I only knew about it due to the hype. Well, it did not disappoint. In fact I think I'm looking forward to the rumored sequel. Bottom line, I think it's well worth the hype."
"danielpuyda","9","1","12","23 March 2012"," 4/5. A must-see
","I read the book and I loved it. That's saying a lot coming from me because I don't like to read books (I have my reasons). But Hunger Games was something I couldn't put down. But I read it and I was ready for the movie.<br/><br/>Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) is a 16 y/o girl living in the former USA, now named Panem, a country divided into 13 districts, and she lives in District 12 with her 10 y/o sister Prim (Willow Shields), and her mother (Paula Malcomson). Every year, each district must pay tribute to the evil Capital by sending 1 boy and girl between the ages of 12 & 18 to fight to the death for a reality TV show called the Hunger Games and only 1 Tribute may live. When Prim's name is randomly called to be in the Games, Katniss volunteers to take Prim's place. Soon, she and her male Tribute counterpart, Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) are taken to the Capital to prepare for the Games. After making an impression with audiences in the Capital, and training with the other Tributes, the rest of the story revolves around Katniss surviving in the Games.<br/><br/>Too often adaptations change so much in the name of appealing to a wider audience, but this was faithful to the original source material. The sets were simple, but fantastic, and as soon as the story reaches the Capital, the sets are gorgeous. Also, the costumes. The make-up department, the people who did the costumes all must have been extremely busy, but HAD to have had the most fun of their careers. Literally, not figuratively, hundreds of people with the most elaborate and ridiculous hair and make- up styles that gave the Capital a strange and funny personality. I give major props to them all, extras and crew alike.<br/><br/>As Katniss Everdeen, Jennifer Lawrence was well-cast. She is believable in this role. But she has a few misses, though that might be the fault of the director, not hers. Certain scenes felt like she should have escalated more, and were certainly more intense in the book, and not in the movie. But that's not to say that Lawrence didn't have her incredible moments. Your heart churns when she cries (the reasons for which I will not spoil). Elizabeth Banks is very spot-on as Effie and is by far one of the more colorful of the side characters that you can't help but love. Lenny Kravitz as Cinna was also surprisingly engaging, despite his limited acting experience. Woody Harrelson as Haymitch was also very well-cast, as he is usually good in ANYTHING that he does. Not much to say about Liam Hemsworth, as his role as Gale is very small. Same with Donald Sutherland as the evil President. But Josh Hutcherson as Peeta was the show-stealer. He is so charming and funny, and when he's being serious, he grabs your heart-strings and yanks. He is by far the best actor in the movie.<br/><br/>Now, I can't close off this review without addressing my complaints. First of all, and this isn't anyone's fault, just a product of an inability to properly adapt books to movies, but certain scenes felt rushed. For those who are fans of the book, they will notice this and might make them slightly aggravated that the movie couldn't take the time to develop those certain scenes. But I won't fault the movie for this. However, I am putting my foot down on one particular moment. THERE ARE SPOILERS AHEAD, so if you don't want that, don't read the next paragraph. <br/><br/>In the book, when Katniss and Rue, a 12 year old Tribute, meet up, they strike a sisterly friendship. Rue is portrayed in the story as adorable, funny, and surprisingly resourceful. As most books can do, the author develops the relationship between Katniss and Rue and the more you learn about the young girl, the more you grow attached to her. So when she is killed by Marvel, the scene plays out so heart- wrenchingly that I would be surprised if anything less than half of the readers didn't cry. I may not have, but I got very misty-eyed. The scene was just so powerful that you get incredibly mad at this world and what these teenagers are forced to do. This is where I get mad at the movie. That scene is, while still effective and moving, is SEVERELY underplayed compared to the book. I don't want to talk down on Amandla Stenberg as Rue, as she was as perfectly casted as Rue as Josh Hutcherson was as Peeta, but that should have been the most heart-breaking scene of the movie. Tears should have been falling. I know that the run time is 142 minutes, but they should have invested just 5 more minutes of Katniss talking to Rue so the audience can get as attached to Rue in the movie as the readers of the book did in the novel. Her death in the movie was just not AS effective as it should have been. VERY disappointed in the filmmakers for underplaying one of the saddest moments in the novel.<br/><br/>Despite that shortcoming, the Hunger Games is still a great movie and a faithful adaptation to the book. If you're a fan, I wager you'll love it. If you're not a fan, I bet you'll still enjoy it. While it's 8.2 rating on IMDb.com will probably drop to a high 7, believe me, you wouldn't be wasting your time. It's an intense, dystopic story full of its fair share of humor, excitement, but more importantly, heart. If you need that ""young hero"" fix in your movies, Hunger Games will not let you down. A strong 4/5."

","Before we get on to the more gritty, action packed movies of 2012 (The Dark Knight Rises, The Avengers, Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter, etc.) let's talk about The Hunger Games. Based on the Suzanne Collin's book of the same name, The Hunger Games has had a lot of hype circulating it ever since the end of the Harry Potter franchise from last year. Does it live up to the high expectations of the uproarious fans?<br/><br/>One thing I'll state clearly before I get down to review this movie is that: 1.) I saw the midnight screening of this with a group of friends and family. I was awfully tired before the movie started, so once it began, I may have missed one or two details. I'll do my best to comment on as many things as I can.<br/><br/>2.) I have read the book that this movie's based on. It's a good read. Obviously it's not perfect, but it kept my interest. With that being said, I am not going to grade this movie solely on what was left out of it. I'm not a big enough fan of The Hunger Games series to speculate on every detail that didn't make it into the movie.<br/><br/>Okay, let's begin. I'll admit, much like the book, this movie is very good. It followed the book pretty closely, though again, if it didn't, I wouldn't have cared that much. The real treat with The Hunger Games is the cast. Many of them look and act the part. I've been a fan of Jennifer Lawrence ever since I saw X-Men: First Class last summer, and here, she doesn't disappoint. She portrays Katniss as an independent survivalist, much like how she was in the book.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is also good...for the most part. Josh Hutcherson as Peeta Mellark and Liam Hemsworth as Gale Hawthorne both show the intensity and maturity of their characters and, naturally, it's great to see. Haymitch and Effie are a lot of fun, and the other contenders in the game are competent enough as villains to make up for lack of any characterization.<br/><br/>Sadly, the two weakest characters are Lenny Kravitz as Cinna and Amandla Stenberg as Rue. Both characters left a tremendous impact on Katniss in the novel, while here, they're simply boiled down to bland, uninteresting supporting characters.<br/><br/>The violence is entertaining, though I think that's very much a personal preference. As I said before, Harry Potter devotees will come to this movie for the weekend entertainment, and that might present a problem. The action in Harry Potter is pretty tame; when you get down to it, it's just a ton of sparks and colored lights flying around the screen. Whereas this movie is much more intense and gritty. There's definitely some pretty disturbing scenes, so I suggest keeping the kiddies home for this one.<br/><br/>One more gripe I have with this movie is how it was presented. Much like Harry Potter, The Hunger Games is very self-contained. Essentially, if you haven't read the book, there'll be a lot of scenes where you might find yourself scratch your head in confusion. Maybe that's nitpicking, but with other movies based on books, such as The Lord of the Rings trilogy, there was enough character and story to appeal to other audience members. And, as much as I liked this movie, it really didn't do this.<br/><br/>Final verdict: Is there any point of writing a final verdict? You're going to see this movie regardless of my opinion. It's going to be one of the highest grossing movies of the year, and deservedly so. It's a smart, action packed, sci-fi story. It's characters, though not the best, are still pretty enjoyable and the action scenes are intense and brutally realistic. There's also a lot of quiet moments where you're just allowed to soak in the atmosphere and tone of the film, something that I don't recall Harry Potter ever doing. If you're a fan of the books and above the age of ten, check it out and draw your own conclusions."

","After the rebellion in Empire somewhere in a future, the punishment is set for 12 rebelled districts. The Capitol selects a boy and a girl from each district who fight to death on live television. Katniss Everdeen volunteers to take her younger sister's place for the latest match.<br/><br/>The movie is based on the first novel in the Hunger Games trilogy by Suzanne Collins, published in 2008. It was probably the most advertised film of the spring, and, given the bestseller nature of the books, the film to wait for. And the fans will not be put down.<br/><br/>Art always follows the mood of the crowd, reflects it and tries to satisfy the desires of the majority. This is why the occurrence of the anti-Utopian and post-apocalyptic movie was actually predictable given the world-wide movements like ""Occupy Wall-Street"". The society filed a demand for another ""V for Vendetta"", and the movie industry (as well as book-publishing) rushed to satisfy it.<br/><br/>The whole movie feels split into roughly two parts. In the first part, authors try to produce anti-utopia with all the necessary attributes. Suppression, fear, anger at the elites, excesses of the Capitol; all the components seem to be in place. Lonely hero, revolting masses, uniformed Special Forces – it took all the best from other anti-utopias. The second part feels like ""The Last Survivor"". Well, a bit more brutal. The movie almost forgets its anti-Utopian start and concentrates on action, reminding more of ""Predators"" and other movies about survival in the jungles. And the thing is that these two parts are as if they are filmed by two different people.<br/><br/>The action part is tense, full of unexpected turns of the story line and genuinely breath-taking at moments. It is a joy and entertainment to watch, it is easy to empathize with the main characters, it is a thrilling movie to watch. But the anti-utopia part is in reality more of ""Anti-utopia for children"" – every single bit is carefully chewed and given to the audience for easy digestion. It is like 1984-lite: colorful, stylish, with charismatic characters, but absolutely dull. I honestly believe that the audience is smart enough to understand the purpose of the games. I do believe that everybody will understand what is going on the screen, without any need to revert to patronizing explanations which leave the taste of a kindergarten lessons.<br/><br/>The cast played its part well. No revelations, no awe-inspiring performance, no Oscar-hopefuls. Straightforward work, no more, no less. I would only single out Lenny Kravitz. He managed to put life in his character, a lot of charisma and some personal touch to it, making it very natural and pretty positive. As concerned Jennifer Lawrence who played the main character, I honestly don't understand why there is a need for her to do everything with an open mouth. She hunts with open mouth, she sleeps with open mouth, she is angry with open mouth – etc. It was supposed to make her look hot, but instead she looks a bit lost and silly. Other than that, everybody seems to be in place and knowing what to do.<br/><br/>P.S. I hated the camera work. The shaking image always unsettles me, I never quite grasped why would you want to use it? It is not how people see the world when they are nervous. It is simply a camera given to a man who has shaking hands. As a result, the whole movie feels like a ride on a very poor road rather than nice smooth journey. Maybe that was the intention? Because of this feature the final fight also lacks some pathos and tension. Instead, it looks like the cameraman himself participates in the fight.<br/><br/>VERDICT: Despite pretty patronizing approach to the audience as concerned the ideological part, the movie is still great watch: captivating, breathtaking, interesting and with a little pinch of content for those of us who look for something more than simple action movie.<br/><br/>m-picturegoer.blogspot.com"
"nush-r85","7","1","12","21 March 2012"," Decent Action Flick for the uninitiated; So-so for Novel fans
","Finally got to see this today, and I have some notes.<br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence IS Katniss. I think we can all agree on that. I am not as certain about the Gale/Peeta castings, though that isn't either of the respective actors' fault. It was more a casualty of the film's overly frantic pace, and relative lack of conscious highs and lows. Part of drama, especially one with such great source material as Ms Collins' novels, is knowing when to linger, and when to pull away. It is through this that gestures and plot points gain significance and meaning to both characters and audience.<br/><br/>Perhaps it is due to editing, or certain directorial choices, or it was just written that way, but the film was very (and I hate to say it), Micheal Bay-esque in certain spots. The mockingjay pin, Katniss volunteering to be the tribute in Prim's place, the three finger salute, the loaves of bread from Peeta, the fiery costumes at the tribute parade, Rue's death; it all fell a little flat and could have used more fleshing out (note that list included almost everything important in the film).<br/><br/>The violence was very well handled considering the PG-13 rating, and I felt to an extent, that the juxtaposition between the queens of the Capital and the people in the districts evoked the slaves in the Colosseum/Roman empire imagery of the novel.<br/><br/>The opening sequence should have been re-worked. Given that the same information appears much more effectively in the propaganda video about the Games, and the conversation between Seneca Crane and Caesar Flickerman doesn't add to the film (as delightful as Stanley Tucci is), it left me a little cold. Everyone knows there will likely be 2 more films, so structurally, there was a bit more leeway for exposition and characterization in this first one, but the opportunity was largely wasted.<br/><br/>After all that, you would expect this to be a negative review. It isn't. Not because I don't think the film has its faults, but because once you've read the books, you know Rome wasn't built in a day. Panem and its inhabitants are already known to you, and you can fill in the blanks. If, on the other hand, you haven't read the books, the film is a decent action movie with added social commentary, and some very pretty people. Either way, you can't go wrong.<br/><br/>May the odds be ever in your favor."
"JaneXme","9","1","13","25 March 2012"," Wow
","I was actually nervous while sitting in the theatre waiting for the curtains to open, I was that excited about seeing the movie and hoping it would meet up to my standards. It was awesome, it was like reading the book really, the same feeling of wanting to put the book down at points where it's still relatively well for the characters but also really really wanting to know how it continues! There were some things I was disappointed about, some things they didn't include in the movie, but they were all left out for a reason and you know that, had they included them it would have downgraded the movie. <br/><br/>The acting was incredible, what some actors lacked in looks (in my opinion, some didn't look like they did in my head while reading the book) they certainly made up for it in their performance. From the little kids like Willow Shields and Amandla Stenberg to Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson to Donald Sutherland, everyone acted so convincingly, I was brought to tears in the first few minutes. <br/><br/>The only thing that slightly bothered me was the really weird looking Cornucopia, but really, that's such a small thing and easily forgiven :)<br/><br/>Yeah, I'd give it an 8.5, but since I can only give whole stars, I'm going to round it off upwards, because it's completely blown my mind. I'm such a fan of the books and I was really worried it wouldn't be like I would've liked it to be and if you're worried about the same thing, don't be; it's not a copy of the book, it's not better than the book, but it's as good as the book -which is really saying something. Go watch it! :D"
"ch-anel","8","1","13","25 March 2012"," Hunger Games was amazing!
","The Hunger Games was really well done. Even though it did not include everything in the book, they've already done a really good job trying to contain everything within 2.5 hours.<br/><br/>Some people are asking a little too much, wanting everything in the book to go into the movie. We have to see it from the film-maker's point of view. There's a budget to follow, there's the time limit, and then there's technology because some things portrayed in the book aren't't able to be acted out. Well, at least not with current's technology. Some people are also weird, I don't know.., but my friends who aren't readers of the book could understand and follow the storyline, so I don't get how some people thinks that the movie is confusing......?<br/><br/>Personally, as a reader of the trilogy, I think they've already conveyed the message Suzanne Collins wants(since she's part of the crew). They included all important parts necessary to keep the story going and the cast did a wonderful job too. You can see how their acting has improved as compared to their previous films.<br/><br/>Unless you're willing to sit through a 10-hour movie or TV drama, do not complain. The book is near 500 pages long, you can't expect EVERY single detail to be included. And do remember that Suzanne Collins is one of the screenplay directors. She wouldn't have agreed to cutting off some of the scenes unless she thought it was alright to do so.<br/><br/>Besides, the book is told from Katniss' point of view while the movie is not. These are huge differences.<br/><br/>It makes me mad when I see people telling those who have yet to watch the movie nasty stuffs like the movie's disappointing and all. Don't ruin it for others just because the movie didn't live up to your incredibly high expectations. Note: I read the book in 2009. When I heard it's going to be adapted into film, I was really happy. Even though it didn't include as much details as the book, remember that it's a film, NOT a book.<br/><br/>In my opinion, The Hunger Games is an amazing movie, maybe one of the best book adaption films ever."
"cpbabvgirl","9","1","13","24 March 2012"," Great- But the book is always better (And important)
","I LOVED this movie, and I can't get enough of it, I've spent most of my day today just searching hunger game related things- Its amazing.<br/><br/>The important thing is ALWAYS to read the book first. I've heard a lot of people say ""Oh I'm just going to see the movie, I don't need to read the book to like the movie"" And normally, I would agree, but it for this movie, its important to read the books, or you might not get it. There are points when Katniss has a look on her face, or turns around when shes thinking about something- Things that they say in the book- and you will not get it if you haven't read the book. Its very important to read the book first! OK, so not everything's perfect. There's a part (in the book) where Madge (the mayor of district 12's daughter) gives Katniss the mockingjay pin- and that was cut out of the movie, and replaced with something different. I will admit, I hated that. I really did.<br/><br/>As for how a kid may handle this, they really seem to have taken great care not to go way to into detail, and the most intense scene is where Katniss is watching a video of previous hunger games, and that lasts maybe less then a minute. There IS a few other parts, while not has intense, they do show some blood, its not like they can completely cut it out. Personally I would not recommend this for a child under the age of 10.<br/><br/>Definitely worth the time, and the money. Great movie."

","Unless you've been living in a cave or hiding under a rock, the newest film franchise to be based on a series of books is The Hunger Games. The trilogy, written by Suzanne Collins, has been read by millions around the world, so anticipation and expectations for the film have been high. The Hunger Games is set in a dystopian future in the country of Panem, where the Capital rules over 12 ""districts"". As punishment for a prior uprising by the districts, a ceremony is held every year in which each district selects a boy and girl between the ages of 12 and 18 to represent their district in a battle to the death on live television.<br/><br/>The key to making a successful film is selecting the right director. Gary Ross, whose previous directorial efforts were the underrated Pleasantville and the Oscar nominated Seabiscuit, was the director chosen; Oscar winner Steven Soderbergh (Traffic) was brought on as Second Unit Director. The next major hurdle was in casting, and it goes without saying that the casting choices were absolutely perfect. The stunning Jennifer Lawrence, Oscar nominated for her performance in Winter's Bone, was chosen as the films lead character, Katniss Everdene. Katniss is an intelligent, strong willed, and determined young woman and Jennifer Lawrence's portrayal is of her is perfect; she IS Katniss! Josh Hutcherson (Journey 2: Mysterious Island) plays Peeta Mellark, the love struck baker's son selected as the male tribute to represent district 12. Hutcherson is not the typical leading man in an action film. He doesn't have magazine cover looks, he doesn't have a chiseled body, he's just your average Joe; and it's that reason that he works so well in the role of Peeta. Woody Harrelson's Haymitch should have been great! In the scenes Harrelson's in, his Haymitch is engaging and commands the screen; unfortunately Harrelson is completely underutilized and doesn't get enough screen time. Elizabeth Banks looks great as Effie Trinket. Stanley Tucci plays Caesar Flickerman with great flamboyancy and looks to be enjoying every minute of it. Donald Sutherland's President Snow exudes power and rules with an iron fist. The rest of the cast includes such fine additions as Wes Bentley, Liam Hemsworth, Lenny Kravitz and a slew of others. Regrettably, the majority of the cast, much like Harrelson's Haymitch, isn't provided enough screen time to allow the characters to be developed; and there lies the biggest problem with the movie.<br/><br/>As I was saying earlier, the main problem with The Hunger Games is that a majority of the characters lack depth due to being underdeveloped, leaving the audience invested mostly in Katniss and mildly in Peeta. Characters like Haymitch, Cinna (Kravitz), Effie, Gale (Hemsworth), and Rue (Amandla Stenberg) who could have had bigger roles are given so little that a few of them could have been left out completely. To be fair, having read the books in which the reader is given more information on the characters, it's difficult to separate the two and judge the film on its own merit.<br/><br/>The Hunger Games is that rare type of movie that appeals to all audiences; younger, older, male and female; it is a very, very good film. The story is well established, albeit at times moved along too quickly. The acting performances are wonderful, the training sequences are entertaining, and the overall action sequences are well executed; The Hunger Games is a very, very violent movie. This isn't a movie along the lines of the Harry Potter or Twilight series'. It's brutally dark film, and one that can be enjoyed by most; just be sure not to try and compare it directly to the book, because you'll only be disappointing yourself.<br/><br/>Grade: A-<br/><br/>visit our site at www.twodudereview.com"
"kolli96","8","1","13","23 March 2012"," The Hunger Games Review
","Before I start my review, I just want to say this: Go watch this movie, it is incredible. And I will mention some spoilers, but if you've read the book, I think it is safe for you to read my review. And now for my review:<br/><br/>The story: The Hunger Games is a movie set sometime in the future, and because of some rebellion that happened years ago, the Capitol created these so-called ''Hunger Games''. And in these hunger games, 2 kids from every district, 24 kids in total, must fight to the death in a gladiator-like arena, until there is only one child left. We follow Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark from the poor district 12.<br/><br/>I think the movie's best scenes are the ones right before the hunger games begin, and when Katniss' 12-year old friend from District 11, Rue, dies.<br/><br/>Minutes before the hunger games, Katniss is preparing to go into the game, and Cinna is talking to her. This scene was very well done, the acting, the came angles, everything was perfect, It was so well done you could actually feel what Katniss was feeling, I myself read the book and I was so excited during this scene because she was about to run into a death zone, and a 50/50 chance of her surviving it. And that was one of my favorite scenes in the movie. But the standout scene, I think, was when Rue and Katniss got ambushed by some man from District 2 I believe, Katniss shoots him with an arrow, but right before that he throws a spear and it goes right into Rue's stomach. That scene was played brilliantly by both actresses and of course, well made. Tears going down both of their faces as they both knew Rue was dying was very dramatic. And honestly I don't think I have to say anything more. Those were just my favorite scenes in the movie. And down below I am going to put my verdict of the film:<br/><br/>The story: 8.7/10 Not the most original story ever, but still something you haven't seen often and very good and well conceived.<br/><br/>The acting: 9.5/10 Very well acted, Jennifer Lawrence was brilliant as- well as everyone else.<br/><br/>The camera angles: 9/10 The camera was always at the right place at the right time, not like in The Green Zone were the camera was always zoomed 300% into the person's face.The camera was a bit shaky, but that only made the action scenes more exciting.<br/><br/>The movie: 9/10 Great movie, great story, well made, well acted, I guess the only reason I am giving it a 9 instead of a 10 is because it felt somewhat familiar and linear. Even if you haven't read the book it was kind of obvious what was going to happen next, so I guess what I am saying is the movie had no twists and turns, which is okay, but I would prefer to have at least some scenes where something you would never expect to happen. Overall though, Great film!."

","I read the whole trilogy in the last month and then the first book again the week before seeing the movie for good measure. The movie was great, it stayed true to the story and themes. The removed a lot but that is expected. The changes they made were mostly to save time and skip the long sequences of how it happened in the book. All the things I was afraid they were going to alter were exactly how they happened in the book so I am satisfied. Since it is PG-13 I would agree that they did take down the level of violence and blood compared to the book. The additions to the story were great to see. You get a lot more background information of how the games are run, what Haymitch is doing during the games and even some foreshadowing of the events in the second book. I found it all very interesting, a straight replay of the book would have been less interesting.<br/><br/>My biggest gripe is that the ending felt a little rushed. Things are mostly the same, but the events occur 100 times faster in the movie.<br/><br/>I can't wait for the next movie and would see this one again."

Did they leave some things out? Of course they did, but we can't all sit through a four hour movie. Most of us have what some refer to as a ""life."" Before venturing from your parent's basement, remember that, while Frodo's encounter with Tom Bombadil was fairly interesting to read, day-long movies just haven't caught on yet. If you think you're going to see your favorite novel on the big screen in all of its glorious entirety, better just stay home and inventory your action figure collection.<br/><br/>The minor details they left out detracted from the story hardly at all. Instead of focusing on the mundane, as the Twilight adaptations were want to do, they centered more on the important things like the hardships of those living in poor districts, making it all seem so real. At the start of the actual Hunger Games the plot began to move much more rapidly, but overall, it was very well done. Recommend!"

","After reading the books a year ago before knowledge of the making of a movie was even in the public, I was obsessed. My friends and I daydreamed about the movie. We selected a small pool of actors whom we thought were accurate, none of which actually were cast. I got my mother obsessed with them, and she agreed to take me and a friend to the midnight premiere of the Hunger Games. I can honestly say as a stand- alone movie it was really good. The acting was spot-on, the scenes were set up nicely, and the overall story was good. However, as an avid Hunger Games fan, I couldn't overlook the significant chunks they cut out and replaced with useless scenes of Seneca Crane and President Snow. The first half of the movie is the preparation for the Games, leaving much less time for the actual Games. Haymitch simply isn't drunk enough. Josh Hutcherson does a good job of portraying Peeta's general character, but he looks nothing like my Peeta, and he's almost a foot or so shorter than his lover girl, which i find frankly weird. I would caution those who obsess over details to steer clear, they've cut out most of the little things and a few things that i thought were major. They completely under-exaggerate Peeta's leg injury, it looks like a little gash instead of a life threatening infection. The sleep-syrup/berry scene is cut out entirely. In the end Peeta does not, in fact have his leg amputated, instead it sort of magically heals after the Games are over. I did love Rue in this movie though, and was bawling like a newborn baby when she died. The only thing wrong with that is that they cut to District 11 randomly when she dies and show two useless minutes of revolt before getting back to the characters we actually care about. <br/><br/>In summary, I loved the movie. It was an excellent adaptation and followed the story well, though some Katniss narration would have been nice. If your a reader, prepare to be angered at the last ten minutes, because its like a different story altogether."
"hborquezp","9","1","15","24 March 2012"," Don't spect fireworks...just a great movie at the height of the books...
","First at all, I have to recognized that I'm a huge fan of the books trilogy. Suzanne Collins created in three books a complex world that doesn't seems to be so far from the actual. Based on that, I didn't spect too much from the movie: it's very hard to see films that can reflect the passion, the emotion and the background of the story presents in a book. And Hollywood has a lot of failures trying to do that.<br/><br/>So, maybe that was what I liked about this film: a movie that it's not centered in the special effects (but they are really good), not centered also in to put in the screen corny moments or have recognized actors to win more money. Maybe that will disappoint to some spectators, which want see a great action movie, vampires in love, incredible magicians, and characters that will do the impossible in the name of the humanity. Here are real kids, playing the wrong game, trying to go back home.<br/><br/>Obviously, the purists will say that the director doesn't take too much time to show the characters histories or what are they thinking, that the camera sometimes it's so frenetic that you can't see the whole action, there's not much blood or explosions, that all happens too fast. But precisely, that the great achievement of the film: put in 2 and a half hours, all that happens in the book, not taking too much time in some innecesary details, not trying to understand when the world fell down in this madness or why Cinna wants to protect a stranger girl. All pieces are in the correct place, the tension don't decline and the rest comes from the spectator: maybe reading the books, maybe taking the time to see how far are we from those childs, maybe just submitting of what they are seeing.<br/><br/>Just want to add something else: the art direction is impeccable, the music is fantastic, some actors really surprised me (Jennifer Lawrence, Josh Hutcherson, the fantastic Stanley Tucci and his madness smile, etc.) and the director really knows how to drive this big machine.<br/><br/>Mention apart to Wes Bentley, representing Seneca Crane: how far are the actual show directors from him?.<br/><br/>My advice is if you read the book, go to see the movie. If you don't read the book, also go to see the movie, but if you can, read the book: they are perfect complements. <br/><br/>_____<br/><br/>P.D.: Sorry for my English, but my native language is Spanish."
"nikowanamate","8","1","15","23 March 2012"," Stunning and effectively filmed.
","From the get go, you get the sense is film has a clear intention -- to make you think. Adaptations for me are always tricky because you can never really relay all the messages and moments that the book present and put them on the screen. The hunger games doesn't do that, but what it does, it does with effective subtlety and sublime attention.<br/><br/>I liked how the director kept the story in Katniss's point of view. This gave the film a sense of new discovery, but also the moments where it ventures away from Katniss and explores the other parts that the book doesn't elaborate on, the book is spot on.<br/><br/>It's certainly not the best adaptation of a book by far, but one thing i can say is that it is a really good one. The film moves from one point to the next with relative easy, but this could also be it's weakest point in that some of the moments are done too fast and we move on to the next before we have time to fully absorb some of the feelings the film presents.<br/><br/>Gary Ross does a phenomenal job, and certainly requires high marks, but i can honestly say, ""don't expect any Oscar nominations"" because for one thing the art direction was cool but very predictable, it was to reliable. The visual effects had a very hard and edge effect, but nothing we hadn't seen been done before. The acting was spot on, giving away the true and real emotions, but nothing saying Oscar because the performances didn't pop, they were just safe.<br/><br/>All in all, the film was enjoyable and i would like to go one but that would just bore, you, so i will live you with this. Go and watch it and see it for yourself, because there are moments that will shock you, make you cry, surprise you but there are also going to be uncomfortable moments where you think the film is just reaching and losing focus, but despite that, the film has merit and recommendation and that alone should be enough reason to watch it.<br/><br/>My score - 7.8 out of 10."
"terrellrobinson71","9","1","15","23 March 2012"," Not since Harry Potter and The Lord of the Rings has there been a movie that's as exciting and thrilling as its source material.
","I just came from a midnight screening of the much-anticipated film adaptation of Suzanne Collins' ""The Hunger Games"". Now, like you, I have read all three books of the Hunger Games series and I was just as obsessed by it as you were. Now that the movie has just came out, let me tell you, it is a very intense and moving movie experience. As the film begins, we meet Katniss Everdeen (perfectly played by Jennifer Lawrence), a 16-year-old girl who lives in District 12, the poorest futuristic district of a divided country known as Panem. A skilled hunter and a everyday family-woman who takes care of her mother and her 12-year-old sister, Prim (Willow Shields) and has a friend in Gale Hawthorne (Liam Hemsworth from ""The Last Song""), another hunter. Her precious life changes from good to bad when her sister is sent to participate in a fight to the death of 24 tributes (12 boys, 12 girls; ages 12-18) known as ""The Hunger Games"". In an act of sacrifice and courage, Katniss volunteers to take her place. Joining her on this journey is Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson), a baker who did a kindness to Katniss when they were young. As the games start to heat up, Katniss and Peeta knows that it's just a matter of time until they have to prepare for the fight for survival. When the Games do begin, it's brutal, intense, and it's also very chilling and devastating. ""The Hunger Games"", directed by Gary Ross (who co-wrote the screenplay with the author Collins and Billy Ray), is as exciting and thrilling as any fan would expect it to be. Some people are calling it ""the next Twilight"", but ""Twilight"" has nothing on Katniss Everdeen, who may be the girl on fire, but a real 21st-century heroine. The performances are incredible, 21-year-old Lawrence is already on fire, thanks to her Oscar-nominated performance in ""Winter's Bone"". She basically own this movie and you can't imagine anyone else playing Katniss but Lawrence. Hutcherson provides the heart and soul and captures that as Peeta. Hemsworth may not have much to do playing Gale, but he does have a terrific screen presence to play with in the next movies. Then you have a very unrecognizable Elizabeth Banks playing Effie Trinket, who is the PR of the Capitol, Lenny Kravitz as the stylist Cinna, Donald Sutherland as the wickedly ruthless President Coriolanus Snow, Stanley Tucci as the Ryan Seacrest-reject Caesar Flickerman, and Amandla Stenberg who is very heartwarming as Rue and has a scene that is extremely heartbreaking and emotional. Even Woody Harrelson deserves some credit for making Haymitch, a down-on-his-luck drunk turned mentor, a pretty cool wiseguy. I sat with an huge audience and for 142 minutes, our eyes were engaged to the screen. Having put some differences from the book aside and using elements of ""Battle Royale"", ""1984"", ""Lord of the Flies"" and ""The Running Man"" to keep us chilled out, ""The Hunger Games"" is a amazing film that knows how to stay true to the book and to entertain us and wrap us with its presence. Go ahead, people. Believe the hype. Note: ""The Hunger Games"" is rated PG-13 (and for good reason) for the brutally intense violence and disturbing moments that takes place during The Hunger Games. If you have brave 12-year-olds and teenagers who read the books, good for them. Non-fans can get hooked into this film as well and they'll enjoy it, too. In the meantime, I can't wait for ""Catching Fire"" and I certainly hope the odds be ever in your favor."

The movie is very moving that your heart is gonna race! It's action, gore, brutal and a little bit of romance. Oscar Nominee JENNIFER LAWRENCE is a great actress! She's perfect portraying the lead role, I mean her beauty, her confidence doing this project is just breathtaking. About Josh Hutcherson, I think his acting skills has improved, and he's really good actually in this film and Liam Hemswroth, I don't know, I didn't see much of his character, but I'm sure I'm gonna see it when ""Catching Fire"" comes out. There's only 2 things that I don't like from the film... first is the horrible cinematography, it was rubbish! It's really fast and you know... it sucks, it ruined the movie and last is the graphics or maybe the CG of the Dogs in last minutes of the movie, I don't like it, it looks fake even in the dark. But... still, it is a must see! One of the best movies of this year! I actually can't wait for the sequels... ""Catching Fire"" which is due to theaters next year and the ""Mocking Jay"" the finale. Great, great! Wait... last, if you hate ""TWILIGHT"" it's OK, but if you will hate ""THE HUNGER GAMES""? GO TO HELL!!!"

","It is incredibly rare to find a film that is adapted from a book without some changes and differences. And with franchises such as ""Harry Potter"" and ""Twilight"" there are always the uber fans that won't be able to get over some of the changes made to a story when being adapted for a film format. This should be remembered for all the huge fans of ""The Hunger Games,"" because the adaptation (directed by Gary Ross and starring Jennifer Lawrence) is an incredible creation of Suzanne Collins popular book that hits the bulls-eye twice by being a loyal spiritual telling of the original story and living up to its blockbuster hype.<br/><br/>If you have been living under a rock for the past few months, or you haven't been able to put everything together from a trailer or your excited teenager trying to explain the story, ""The Hunger Games"" is the tale of a 16 year-old girl named Katniss Everdeen (played by Jennifer Lawrence) who volunteers to fight instead of her sister, Prim, in a bloody and tragic sporting event known as The Hunger Games. Set in the future world of Panem, a country divided into twelve districts that are governed by a chief district known as The Capitol, The Hunger Games pair a boy and girl between the ages of 12 and 18 from each of the twelve districts to fight to the death in an arena on a nationally televised scale.

","They did a great job adapting it for a PG-13 movie. the casting for this movie was phenomenal. Everyone fit there role perfectly, I did have one worry that actually showed a little bit. I was afraid that Josh Hutcherson was going to come of a little whiny, basically I thought he was gonna be a bitch. He surprised me though in the beginning until he got injured, especially in the cave, The book makes him seem much more masculine than Hutcherson portrayed, but other than that, He played Peeta spot on. There was a lot of detail I didn't expect to see in this movie, for example, the flashback of Katniss's Dad's death, or when Peeta threw Katniss the bread. I was really blown away by it though. I wish there would have been more music through out the movie, it was kinda too quite at certain times. I'd give it a solid B. Lionsgate and Gary Ross did an awesome job.<br/><br/>Here are a few things I didn't like:<br/><br/>1. They cut out 2 kinda important characters, Madge (which messed up the story of how she got the mockingjay pin) and The Avox. <br/><br/>2. They cut out the scene where Katniss throws the knife in the wall of the train. <br/><br/>3. The cave seen was WAY too short. <br/><br/>4. The camera angles where way too shaky. <br/><br/>5. They didn't show that Peeta had his leg amputated. <br/><br/>6. And the biggest one is that it was PG-13."
"jboothmillard","8","1","17","21 December 2012"," The Hunger Games
","I heard a lot about this film when it was at the cinemas, it was based on a three part book series and was going to be some kind of big deal, so it sounded very similar to the Twilight hype, and I naturally had to see what the big deal was, from director Gary Ross (Pleasantville, Seabiscuit). Basically in the dystopian future world called Panem, twelve districts have been divided to make the nation, every year these nations compete in the Capitol created and seemingly compulsory event called The Hunger Games, where a boy and girl aged between 12 and 18 are selected from each district to compete against the other eleven in a televised fight to the death. Katniss Everdeen (Winter's Bone's Jennifer Lawrence) is the girl from District 12, the first person ever to volunteer for the games, after her younger sister Primrose 'Prim' (Willow Shields) was originally chosen from the lottery, the boy chosen by the lottery as tribute to represent District 12 is Peeta Mellark (Zathura's Josh Hutcherson), the two of them already have a dramatic history. Katniss and Peeta are taken by Effie Trinket (Elizabeth Banks) to the Capitol, they are mentored by past victor Haymitch Abernathy (Woody Harrelson) who explains the rules of The Hunger Games, how to get sponsors and the public to like your character and watch the show to create revenue and stuff, and how intensive training will guarantee you win. They begin their training at the special academies, and at the same time have TV interviews, this is where Peeta reveals that he has been in love with Katniss for some time, she is first outraged thinking he wants to win the sponsors for food and weapons that are provided, game commentators Caesar Flickerman (Stanley Tucci) and Claudius Templesmith (Toby Jones) see this is a great marketing ploy, but he does mean it about his feelings for her. With Katniss getting a superb score, and Peeta getting a reasonably good score, they are ready to enter The Hunger Games, they begin with most of the tributes from the twelve districts being killed in the first few minutes, but Katniss and Peeta escape and go separate ways through the woods, finding their own ways and other people to help them survive. Throughout the time Katniss escapes many attempts to get her killed, including a trap to tempt her towards some supplies from another district, deadly bees with venomous stings called Tracker Jackers, fires spread by the Gamekeepers to lead her in the intended directions towards her enemies, and she suffers the death of her friend Rue (Amandla Stenberg) from District 11. Some of the districts have become an alliance in order to kill the girl they feel is most likely to win before they will do anything to each other, Katniss eventually reunites with Peeta who has survived some tough ordeals himself, of course throughout the games they have been broadcast all hours and portrayed as star-crossed lovers, but she may only be leading her male companion on for the sponsorship. Finally it comes to the final showdown where the surviving members of Districts 5, 11 and 12 are face to face and will determine the end of the games; of course all are killed in this confrontation, apart from Katniss and Peeta who may both be victorious after the rule change of two winners instead of one. There is a moment where that rule may have changed back again, and Peeta says Katniss should shoot him, but she gives him half of the nightlock instead, the gamekeepers decide not to part the potential lovers and proclaim them both 74th annual Hunger Games victors, they return home, supposedly as true lovers. Also starring Liam Hemsworth as Gale Hawthorne, Donald Sutherland as President Snow, Wes Bentley as Seneca Crane, singer Lenny Kravitz as Cinna, Paula Malcomson as Katniss' Mother, Alexander Ludwig as Cato and Isabelle Fuhrman as Clove. Lawrence gives a great feisty and fascinating performance, Hutcherson is pretty alright too as the boy who loves her and vice versa, whereas Twilight is cheesy and often boring, this is actually an engaging story, similar in ways to Battle Royale, with more special effects, but the death hunting is not the only draw, the love story is nice, and the satire about reality television is interesting, for the fans of the books and those who like explosion and fight filled movies this is a terrific futuristic action thriller. It was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Original Song for ""Safe and Sound"". Very good!"
"KevinMariblanca","9","1","19","21 March 2012"," It was nice
","I wouldn't say the movie gave the full embodiment of the book. There were some scenes that I wish were still included like the part where Peeta and Katniss fight near the end that would have been quite nice as a follow-through for the second movie. Anyway, the movie fell short on quite a number of things:<br/><br/>1) Some scenes shifted way too fast - for me, seeing those transitions were a little disturbing but on the perspective of the filmmakers the burden of introducing the story to the non-readers is hard which is probably why they had to do it in that pace. <br/><br/>2) Action scenes felt fake - I guess this is what you can possibly work with when you only have a PG 13 rating. But I for one, found this annoying because one of the reasons I loved the books was how graphic Suzanne described the fight scenes. In the movie, in order to preserve the rating, they kept on muting the sound which was very irritating. They should consider increasing the rating next time although I doubt this is remotely possible. <br/><br/>But when there are downsides there are some great things about the movie:<br/><br/>1) Ms. Lawrence as Katniss - She was impeccable. I loved how she embodied the Katniss that we loved in the books. She was hot-headed, charming, and had the right mix of emotions to just emulate Katniss from the books. <br/><br/>2) Time lapse - there was no tension of being bored. The time just went on by, which for me is a great consideration in choosing awesome movies. <br/><br/>All these ups and downs of the movie made it awesome as it was. I could not give it a perfect no matter how long I've waited for the movie but the entirety of it was more than satisfactory. Hopefully, we will get more in November of 2013. See you again Tributes!"
"Ramascreen","6","1","19","20 March 2012"," May the odds be ever in your favor, Happy Hunger Games!
","Unfortunately I'd have to stand in the middle on this one. I loved the book, I could read it a thousand times, the adaptation on the other hand, though not entirely terrible, does not excite me as much, but even if I hadn't read the book, I think THE HUNGER GAMES film could be so much more deeply affecting. Granted it's been months since I last read the book so I won't be making too many comparisons in this review, and I promise I won't compare it to Battle Royale. I enjoy director Gary Ross' style and the film's scope and how loud and outrageous the costumes look, the future is undeniably wacky and it doesn't mean a bad thing. The film, in my opinion, sadly tones down the violence and amps up the drama which doesn't always work, especially when the hint of romance is uncertain, it may be for show only or it may be genuine. I think PG-13 is the wrong move for this film, because to me, THE HUNGER GAMES' violence, kids killing kids, is the heart of the evidence of how cruel the government and the game truly are, it's the very essence that fuels and motivates Katniss and Peeta to survive and so taming it or leaving it to thoughts, just makes you feel like you're robbed of what should be an emotionally grounded, heart-wrenching filmÂ… <br/><br/>Let's start with Jennifer Lawrence, I was a huge fan of her work in Winter's Bone, she was absolutely phenomenal in that film, which obviously makes her qualify for THE HUNGER GAMES because much of the living condition of the people in District 12 is more or less similar but THE HUNGER GAMES moves quickly, I don't think it gives the audience enough time to get acquainted with how harsh life is in District 12 and what it is that Katniss would have to leave behind and how difficult it is to part from that life. Ross throws some of those in, by way of flashbacks, but it doesn't help trying to piece them together. So it comes across a bit underdeveloped but keep in mind that it's always tough when you deal with adaptations. I think Jennifer Lawrence does a fantastic job as Katniss, though there are times when it's hard to sense her emotions, there's a scene in which Katniss shoots an arrow at the direction of the gamemaker and his company because she's upset and angry but you can't really sense if that is exactly what Lawrence is expressing. But other than that, Lawrence is by no means the weakest link of the film, that said I still think Hailee Steinfeld of True Grit would'v been a more solid choice for the role.<br/><br/>I find it amusing that Jennifer Lawrence and Liam Hemsworth (Gale) who are natural blond, are now brunette and the brunette Josh Hutcherson (Peeta) has to go blond. Just an interesting note there. The costumes and the makeup are the show stealers here, I was waiting to see how they'd pull the flame/fire spectacle at the arena for the opening ceremony, well, it's not a spoiler if I tell you that nowadays you can just easily go digital, so I wasn't wowed. I think Hemsworth and Hutcherson are unable match Lawrence's talent, despite their best effort. You'd see Lawrence as Katniss giving her all and then the camera moves to either Hutcherson or Hemsworth and neither of them could meet her halfway. Donald Sutherland is a brilliant choice as President Snow, Sutherland is one of those actors that you could just hand him a role and he'll run with it, and he'll leave you with assurance that he's going to do a damn fine job with it. The other 3 interesting characters of course are Woody Harrelson as Haymitch, Lenny Kravitz as Cinna, and Elizabeth Banks as Effie Trinket. Woody can play a drunk better than a drunk, so there's no problem there and when he speaks, even when he's drunk, you'd stay still and listen. I just wish they'd made Lenny look more eccentric, it's sad because they go all out for other characters and the extras but Lenny as Cinna looks too normal and ordinary. Banks knocks it out of the park as the pink-haired Effie, the way she carries herself, she's just sassy, I'd pay for another ticket just to watch her. Before I forget, Stanley Tucci as the MC Caesar Flickman is fantastic, with his big smile and ridiculously white teeth, and freakishly tall hairdo. Ryan Seacrest, eat Flickman's shorts!<br/><br/>For the most part, the film tries to stay faithful to the book but those of us who know better would notice how significant the changes are. I really like the design for the computer grid across the sky and also the way the gamemaker's control room is set, think if The Truman Show's director was in the future. I could go on and on and on observing and analyzing every single detail but overall, THE HUNGER GAMES has so much potential to draw you in, if it would just not hold back as much. If it would be much braver or bolder, I'm a big fan of cinematographer Tom Stern but even his work on this film seems more on the safe side, the film doesn't take enough risk. But I think the audience would follow the girl on fire anywhere she goes, at least to the sequels."

","So, i just saw the movie a while ago and DAMN it really is good. J- Lawrence's acting was SUPERB, she really know how to play Katniss. There are some things the audience who did not read the book wont understand: 1st: Katniss's and Rue's friendship, in the book, it was really detailed and long because it is one of the turning points of the plot. But in the movie, it was so short, the audience wont understand why are they close.<br/><br/>2nd: Why are there a Hunger Games in the first place. I mean, for those who read the book, we know why but for those who didn't, i guess not.

"filipemanuelneto","9","0","1","3 May 2020"," An excellent, exciting film with a good story. Worth watching.
","This film is the adaptation of a literary trilogy by Suzanne Collins. I didn't read them, I have no particular intention of doing that, so I will ignore the books and focus on the film. And what I have to say is very positive.<br/><br/>The film brings a dystopian view of humanity: Panem is a nation divided into 12 districts, where people live and work to sustain the luxury and power of the ruling and social elite, who lives in the Capital. After a brutal civil war, the elite set up the Hunger Games in memory of that carnage, and to remember the loyalty that each district owes to the Capital. In the games, which are a mix of Big Brother, FIFA World Cup and ""Apocalypse Now"", two teenagers (male and female) from each district fight to the death, or better say, try to keep on living until everyone has died. This film tells us the gaming experience of Katniss Everdeen, a young woman from District 12 who offers herself in the place of her younger sister.<br/><br/>There is some details in this film that I think are not well explained. One of them is the title: was there hunger? The whole environment around who is Katniss and what her life was like in District 12 before the reaping seems too chalky to be clear. That's a big problem but if we chose to ignore it the film flows, and it does it wonderfully after the reaping scene. One of the things that most caught my attention is the similarity between Panem and the ancient Rome, either by the character's names, the environment of the Capital, or by the idea of having deadly games as entertainment (kind of modern gladiators, you see?), whether by using the eagle as a symbol of power. The similarity is evident... and purposeful.<br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence proved to be perfectly up to the challenge and maintains a good cooperation with Josh Hutcherson, who is never quite as interesting as she is. Lawrence also makes a very good work when she shares the screen with Willow Shields, who gave life to Primrose. The romantic interest in Liam Hemsworth's character, however, is as cold as winter. In the supporting cast, we can highlight the good performances of Wes Bentley, Elizabeth Banks, Woody Harrelson, Toby Jones, Lenny Kravitz, Amandla Stenberg and, most especially, a huge Donald Sutherland, cold and majestic in the shoes of the dictator Snow. At first glance, Stanley Tucci seems histrionic and annoying, but if we look at his character as a satire of a thousand and one talk and reality show hosts around the world, his work acquires another consistency and relevance.<br/><br/>In addition to a great cast and a good story, the film has excellent production values: careful cinematography with good contrast, but which fails to abuse the unstable camera movement; excellent sets and costumes, good CGI and sound effects. The soundtrack deserves a special mention for its effectiveness and beauty. Composed by James Newton Howard, it is one of those that remains in the ear long after we have seen the film.<br/><br/>Full of action and with an excellent story, this film may not be perfect but it left good premises for the sequel that inevitably happened. It is worth seeing, but I don't know how much younger children are prepared to see and, above all, to understand the story told."

In the book it's suspenseful and you can actually feel the bond between Katniss and Peeta, they explained a lot more things, more context, and had a more real feel to it. During the movie, for someone who hasn't read the book, it would be extremely confusing. A girl who hardly knew this guy who tossed her a bread, got chosen for the hunger games with her, stared at her on the roof for like 10 seconds, and then somehow they started making out in some cave.

Peetah is also an alright character, you get more depth with him than Katniss but it's pretty short and don't really amount to anything really important to the movie.
I just want to say this.
Haymitch was supposed to give Katniss and Peetah tips to get sponsors but he refuses cause he is drunk and he thinks it's pointless but then Haymitch later gives advice on how to get more sponsors that's a bit of a contradiction but ok.
Rue is also an alright character even though things got a bit rushed with her they managed to finish her story in a satisfying way<br/><br/>WORLDBUILDING
The worldbuilding is splendid and they really manage to capture the tone of the world by just a few scenes.
The contrast with the districts and Panem really expands the world and the political themes of the story to enrichen the world really males you hooked but I would like to see more of the other people's reactions to hunger games and how they are affected by 8t a little bit more in detail but other than that it did its job well.<br/><br/>VERDICT
The movie has problems (which are nitpicks) but other than that it's a decent movie and I would give it a 7/10"

","This film, yes, is a tribute to the amazing trilogy that Suzanne Collins has crafted into an intriguing, heartbreaking series that is very raw and real about what might happen in the future and the pain it feels to know that you're like chess pieces on a chessboard, moving knowing that you'll have a risk of dying just for the sake of entertainment for the Capitol. But the movie? It made me so disappointed.
Yes, many films that are based off of books are not as interesting as one should expect them to be. The Hunger Games is a great story, and the movie brought down my ratings. It was basically Katniss taking naps everywhere and teasing Peeta, killing people, and it's basically as dull as a diary entry, for all I know. This bland film bored me to death, except for when Rue died. I'm sorry, I just couldn't bring myself to enjoy the film."

","I recently watched all four movies in a row, after watching them separately over the years... just in case I was missing something by not investing in the famous story and the entire epic as a whole.
I now can't say I didn't try...
Drab and depressing, I found all four Hunger Games movies missing almost all elements to make it memorable, enjoyable, fun, exciting, clever or 'epic' in any way.
The concept from the get go made very little sense, the fictional world was not very well designed, and the rules of the universe weak and flimsy. 
I liked some of the cast and have been fans of several for years, but each character was hollow with very little true motivation, and the arks of their characters rarely moved beyond their first introduction.
I actually lowered my stars scores after binge watching the series, because it seemed like a waste of time and the only thing it clearly indicated is, on my own personal scale '2 stars' means- ""an ordinary movie that I don't want to and could not be easily convinced to ever watch again..."".

","All science fiction futuristic societies are written to have a message about the current day. This is normally contained within the text, or a line someone speaks. The movie starts giving us some background for the games, but we don't know why there was a rebellion in the first place, something that is in the book. The rebellion resulted in a lottery where teens from the various districts must now compete in a survivor battle to the death, all for the entertainment of the audience. Early in the film we hear, ""If no one watches, we won't have a game."" In other words if we stop watching reality TV shows, they will be taken off the air...not exactly a bad thing.<br/><br/>In those other films the evil of society had been either, capitalism, socialism, the super rich, corporations, religion, or science. The irony of the film/book is that it makes fun of the viewer/reader for enjoying it. They are the problem with today's voyeuristic dummy down society, which like the movie can be divided into two groups"" Those who see the movie/games as entertainment. And the intellectuals who realize the metaphor contained within. I'm loving it! (Pardon my pop culture response, but it seems apropos.)<br/><br/>There is a stark contrast in wealth and dress between those who participate in the games and the society who runs them. However, it is those who participate who ultimately empower those who run them, just like with war, the second message of the film which dates from Homer ""War is old men lying, young men dying.""<br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence, who I thought was Oscar worthy in ""Winter's Bone,"" immediately becomes our heroine when she volunteers to take the place of her sister in the Hunger Games. We don't expect her to die anytime soon. As the fighting begins I kept wondering if they were going to simply fight for everyone's entertainment or are we going to get a Captain Kirk/Agorn moment when he has defeated his opponent and refuses to kill him shouting, ""You are going to have to get your entertainment elsewhere!"" Or maybe we could end it like ""Death Race 2000"" where Frankenstein kills the president...but I am getting way ahead of myself.<br/><br/>The victims, or tributes as they are called, are paraded and cheered having done nothing...similar to reality show TV ""stars."" (Yes I mean you talentless Snooki.) People wildly cheer because...they can. Woody Harrelson helps to bridge the time from when Jennifer Lawrence is selected until the fighting begins. Donald Sutherland appears as an unrealistic unlikeable President Snow, a composite character representing the evil of society. There are interviews and pageantry prior to the games during which time we get to know more about Jennifer and very little about the other contestants. It would have been nice to have known some of the quirky combatants and have them killed in ironic ways to their character, but maybe that was too much to ask about a film about shallow entertainment.<br/><br/>Jennifer, with her honesty and rebellious attitude has become the fan favorite and our favorite because she is the only contestant that we know. She lacks the killer instinct...until she must. Alliances form and everyone wants to get the fan favorite aka Rambette Jennifer Lawrence, who did an excellent job to give girls a heroine being both a compassionate woman and a huntress. Like all reality TV shows, when the drama starts to fade the program directors add an element to push it in the direction that they want.<br/><br/>No f-bombs, sex, or nudity. ""Safe"" for kids to watch."

","The Hunger Games has become a household name in pop-cultural life, and this film is an entertaining introduction to a broadly-appealing yet well done dystopia not too far off the brutality of Battle Royale or The Running Man. It's not Twilight (thank Christ for that) and thankfully it's got a better romantic triangle than any of that vampire hogwash had going for it.<br/><br/>This series is like a millennial-appealing take on other sci-fi dystopias ranging from George Orwell's 1984 to Aldous Huxley's Brave New World; where those stories explored totalitarianism in more subversive ways this one shows how extreme things can get when violence is thrown into the equation.<br/><br/>Considering this came out in 2012 and people are STILL saying whether or not this ripped off Battle Royale I think that those addresses are fair, and that it doesn't suffer from the pre-established derivativeness of something like Divergent (which apparently carbon-copied the story so much the films themselves were distributed by Lionsgate/Summit Entertainment).<br/><br/>Anyway, this film is an adaptation of a book that was craving a movie based on it, and it's a good action flick focusing on young men and women trying to survive the worst to-the-death scenario you could possibly imagine."

Our society today gives little attention to the One In Charge, why would a dystopian society be any better? After all, it is a dystopia. Dysfunctional. No wonder why. So, it all ends, and there sits Katniss with her second baby, dressed very much like a Christian country woman from the 1950s with her pastel print dress. The writer and director wants the results of Christianity without Jesus the King. Interesting. In that way, though, the film perfectly reflects our own digimodern society.

","The Hunger Games, is a intense start to the next big young adult franchise. The Plot to ""The Hunger Games"" is Every year in the ruins of what was once North America, the evil Capitol of the nation of Panem forces each of its twelve districts to send a teenage boy and girl to compete in the Hunger Games. A twisted punishment for a past uprising and an ongoing government intimidation tactic, The Hunger Games are a nationally televised event in which ""Tributes"" must fight with one another until one survivor remains. Pitted against highly-trained Tributes who have prepared for these Games their entire lives, Katniss is forced to rely upon her sharp instincts as well as the mentor-ship of drunken former victor Haymitch Abernathy. If she's ever to return home to District 12, Katniss must make impossible choices in the arena that weigh survival against humanity and life against love. ""The Hunger Games"" is directed pretty good by ""Gary Ross"" also written by him and is spectacularly acted by ""Jennifer Lawrence"" and ""Josh Hutcherson"". The special effects in this film are a bit out dated for 2012 but still acceptable and the score have a few stand out moments. Characters are probably the most important part in story's and my god did they hit the nail right on the head with ""Jennifer Lawrence's"" character Katniss Everdeen. The film also stayed quite close to the book but with a few unnecessary changes to it. Overall the first installment to ""The Hunger Games"" franchise started off spectacularly with awesome acting, great characters and a suspenseful plot. I give 2012's ""The Hunger Games"" a 9.5/10."

On the occasion of 74th annual hunger games, Prim was selected, who was a small girl. So her sister, Katniss wished to volunteer her. and the boy selected from the same district was PETER MELLARK. After being selected, they visited to each districts and finally they reach to the center. There, they had training and finally the day came. They all were sent to the artificial environment, where the conductors could create or destroy any thing they like. There, only one could survive from any of the districts and s/he is called 'Victor'. The game started, 8 of them were killed on the first day, similarly others were also being killed.

","There's something inherently contradictory about the glossy and commercialized way this movie portrays its violence against children in the hope of mass popularity. I also feel a huge disconnect between the movie Gary Ross thought he was making and the material he was adapting. The result is a tone that works at first, but falls apart once we get to the Capital and the games begin.<br/><br/>A rare blockbuster that I can get behind for its characters, themes and ideas rather than its spectacle. It's a concept that requires a healthy suspension of disbelief, but if you go with it there's lot to latch onto and contemplate.<br/><br/>Katniss and her relationship with her younger sister is set up quite well, you feel they truly care for each other, even before Katniss volunteers. The camera is really shaky, and it does eventually become annoying, but I enjoyed how it was used at first. It made this world feel tangible, lived in.<br/><br/>Oh boy, once we get to the Capital though, B-movie film making. Bad CGI, crowd scenes, make-up, etc. I get that it's supposed to be tacky, but you can make the content of a film tacky without it coming across as cinematically tacky as well. The arena is boring, and as I said earlier, the violence is glossed over so it could nab that PG-13 rating. Stanley Tucci is pretty awesome, but he's mostly there to explain to us the absurd rules. Peeta The Rock is an unintentional laugh out loud moment. Those dogs aren't explained well enough and they look ridiculous. <br/><br/>The ending is pretty good, but it feels rushed. I don't know how big the books were before this film, but it's easy to see how this ending could have inspired millions of new readers who needed to find out what happens next without actually loving this movie."
"MovieCraz","7","0","2","16 August 2016"," The Weakest of the Hunger Games Franchise.
","I know everyone says this but I have to say I am one of the Hunger Games' biggest fans. I've read the books and seen the movies. I know what I am speaking (or writing) about. <br/><br/>I was excited to see the first movie when it came out in 2012. At this time I had not read the books yet, but I did know a bit about it. Because I hadn't read the books my first reaction was that I liked it, but I didn't LOVE it. I went away and read the books right before Catching Fire was released in theaters. And this is what I found when comparing the two.<br/><br/>The movie wasn't completely off from the first HG book, but it deviated tremendously in some areas. Now I know what you are thinking. ""Oh no, let's get out of here now before this book fanatic blasts the movie just because it wasn't like the book."" That's not what I am doing at all. I'm going to compare the book and the movie and then highlight the good and the bad from the movie. So sit tight and stay with me.<br/><br/>The movie disregarded semi-important characters from the book that didn't add to the movie (in their opinion). It also changed much of the scenes and dialog except for important key lines such as 'Happy Hunger games and may the odds be Ever in your favor.' and 'Ladies First'. The three most notable things though have to be the way Katniss got the Mockingjay pin, the werewolves, and Prim's cat: Buttercup. <br/><br/>Now onto what I liked about the movie.<br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss Everdeen was the most impeccable choice. She does the part so well that I can't ever see anyone other than her playing Katniss. I also thought Liam Hemsworth (Gale Hawthorne), Elizabeth Banks (Effie Trinket), Woody Harrelson (Haymitch Abernathy) and Stanley Tucci (Caesar Flickerman) were great casting choices. Donald Sutherland as President Snow was also an excellent choice, giving me the creeps every time I saw him. He just looked EVIL. The capitol was just as I had envisioned, the scenery was great, and the lines were good. The action was good (because it followed the book). All in all was a very good, captivating, and gripping movie.<br/><br/>Things I think needed work:<br/><br/>1: How Katniss got the Mockingjay pin. I won't go into how she got it in the books (which was perfection) but I do want to point out that in the movie it was a very nonchalant, boring way of introducing the pin that symbolized the start of a rebellion. If you had to deviated from the book you should have given it a better entrance into the movie? Maybe Katniss' mother gave it to her for strength? I don't know because it would never be as good as what Collins wrote.<br/><br/>2: Casting choice for Peeta Mellark. I know all of you fan girls are ready to throw me into the next Hunger games for saying such a thing but it's true! Josh Hutcherson is a good actor, don't get me wrong! He just didn't feel like Peeta to me. Him and Jennifer Lawrence didn't have much chemistry on screen in my opinion. He wasn't the strong, caring, protective Peeta that I knew from the books. They made Peeta seem a bit weak and a sort of damsel in distress in my view. If you don't agree with me that's fine. I just wanted to point out that he seems wimpy and small.<br/><br/>3: The werewolves. Oh my. Here I go. WHY!!!!!!!! Why would you change Suzanne Collin's werewolves. They were half werewolf, half dead tributes, that ran on their hind legs and had huge claws, teeth and big scary eyes. Here in the movie they looked like overfed pit bulls. Even their barking wasn't scary. This scene was supposed to send foreboding shivers down my spine. Instead I sat there in numb boredom, waiting for the games' 'big finish' to end so I could go onto the next movie. What a lame climax. That's all I have to say on that matter.<br/><br/>Anyways those are the three biggest things I thought needed immense work. I hope you like this movie! If you are not sure about how you feel after watching this PLEASE watch Catching Fire. I promise it's a much better movie and you will like it. Also, PLEASE GO READ THE BOOKS! Have a nice rest of your day, AND MAY THE ODDS BE EVER IN YOUR FAVOR."

There are so many holes in the plot, you could idly coast a Zeppelin through it. But this is the big name? I kept thinking of BAYWATCH. This might be without the beach, and the bikinis, but it's an activity show, with too little characterization, and a weak storyline that serves as an excuse to get on with what it is all about: mortal combat presented as televised sport. All the time we do not really get into the head of the main character, we mainly see her reacting. The movie is thus far more empty than you lot will ever realize. Everything of it is geared to the sequel, with many plot threads hanging loose, clearly they knew it was going to be hellishly popular, so let us do it this way. But why? Why? It isn't really that good, it's very basic, yeah, that's what I am trying to say. A winner it is not, it lacks a whole lot of finishing touches.<br/><br/>I am not just critical. I am not knocking it.

","The Hunger Games books were surprising for me in simply the way that I was recommended them not by teenagers but by adults my own age (late 20's/early 30's). It's a series that is marketed for the 'young adult' market, and it does have a strong female protagonist and a romantic love-triangle and things like that. But it's far less in the tradition of Twilight - Suzanne Collins can right and craft characters and make a strong, interesting point of view (Katniss narrates all three of the books) - than it does stuff like The Running Man or even The Long Walk (the Bachman books set in dystopia) or of course 1984 and things like that. It's grim, it's desolate, it's pitiless, and the ""Capital"" is a place where people there (under President/Dictator Snow) create a sense of pageantry and pomp and colorful dresses and of course TELEVISION all while the Hunger Games are a series of death matches pitting teenagers against one another from 12 different districts.<br/><br/>We know from the moment we see Katniss she'll be fine - this IS more than one book that we know of going into this first film, after all - but what is exciting is seeing how she gets out of the predicaments she gets in, how her hunting background and being a hunter on her own time, and just having a thickened skin from years of oppression and mind-screwery from propaganda, and the ways that people DIE. And sometimes these deaths of people are really miserable and rather wild; the one that stuck with me from both the book and the film involved a particular breed of bees/wasps, and that's all I'll say about that if you haven't seen the film.<br/><br/>From the start the real strength in this film is Jennifer Lawrence in the lead of Katniss. She makes the center of the film so strong and captivating - a lot of it is what she holds back, has to internalize, which is always interesting when an actor can do that well - and so around her she gets actors that vary in quality from really tremendous (Sutherland, Banks, even Stanley Tucci in an over the top TV personality performance), and maybe OK ones, adequate ones that can get the movie rolling along (Hutcherson and Hemsworth really). But what is the weakness is that the filmmaking isn't that strong; Gary Ross and his DP Tom Stern and his three editors have taken an R movie, or what should be that due to the quality of the violence (it is vicious, just a step below its Japanese step-cousin Battle Royale), and made it into a PG-13 flick. It's still brutal at times, but it's in such a way that feels cheating and jarring, like Ross watched a bunch of Bourne movies to prep and doesn't really know how to shoot this stuff coherently.<br/><br/>In other words, The Hunger Games disappointed me on a technical level, and sort of rushed through a few points that the book made more heartbreaking (a character named Roo gets a moment but not quite enough), and yet the acting saves a lot of the experience and there's a sense of satire that sneaks up on you where you don't necessarily expect it. It at first appears to be a much darker experience than mainstream audiences - I mean the MALL crowd, not just genre fans, this is meant for as many people as possible - but the sense of play with the world, how it doesn't steer away from the reality TV aspect, that it sort of embraces the conventions reality TV creates while skewering them, is creative and cool."

","I am having a hard time reviewing this title. The elements are not entirely pointless, quite the contrary, it contains a very promising story.<br/><br/>In whole, the layers of the events are tied nicely and continuously strong. Despite that, somehow I still felt an unsure atmosphere while watching this movie. Like, should it be strong and depressive, or strong and playful, or strong and suspenseful? That kind of unsure feeling. Perhaps because it is a PG-13. It's like a strong gift with a loose wrap full of doubt. You're kind of hesitated to open it.<br/><br/>The game itself started brutally, which I applaud. Is this a teen movie? Yes, when you look at it as a whole. But not that part.<br/><br/>I could rate this title 6.8/10 or just straight 8/10. In fact, I am just going to hang in between."

","The Hunger Games is a great movie! It is thought provoking and raw. I am a fan of the books, and while this is about 70 percent book material, it is still very good.<br/><br/>The great thing about The Hunger Games is that it gets the series started off correctly. It introduces the themes of revolution and shows you just how sadistic the games actually are. The ending is different from the book, but you can clearly see that President Snow is not happy with Katniss and the fact that she has defied him. The thing is Katniss does it without really meaning to. Little does she know that she will eventually spark a revolution that will change everything..."

","Not great but not too bad. First of all I found it difficult to get my head around the fact that any advanced society would think it entertaining to watch 13 to 19 year old fighting to the death. In any fantasy world this just isn't plausible. The film takes ideas from various other films, most notably ""The running man""And the costume design although spectacular reminded me of ""The fifth element"" There seems to be a spate of movies these days that specifically aimed at 12 to 15 year olds ie:""Insurgent"" ""The maze runner"" and The hunger games movies. Having said that I thought it was OK in parts and worth a watch."

","Many reviewers compare this movie to other movies or the book, that it is based upon, saying that it lacks this and that in comparison with what they expected. I am really surprised to see how many negative reviews this film has received on IMDb.<br/><br/>I saw this film without reading any of the books and without seeing the famed Battle Royale, and I really liked it.<br/><br/>There are many great subtle qualities to this film. It's in all the performances, from the main actors to supporting roles - among others, awesome performances from Woody Harrelson, Lenny Kravitz and Stanley Tucci as fabulous TV-host Caesar Flickerman. It's in the wonderfully understated fascist sci-fi setting, which connects wonderfully to fascist architecture and cinema. It's in the way the games are portrayed as an advanced form of TV entertainment and sport, the slow but stronger development of the characters and their relations, and in the special effects, which are excellent, but also deliberately toned down appropriately.<br/><br/>It's also in the great and appropriate comment, that this film is on present day society and the current global political order. We are the citizens of the Capitol, enjoying our ""hunger games"" in the form of mass-produced entertainment, while an economical and political order dictates that many of the Earth's inhabitants lives in a world, where they need to fight or starve, while we live in plenty.<br/><br/>I can't fault this film in any way. It takes it's time, and keeps one hooked to the end. A very disciplined effort by the director, with a strong screenplay and cast. I wouldn't hesitate to call it a masterpiece."

The scene when the girl was chosen it was not really interesting it could have done better. When the game had started I was expecting some action but it looked like it was too easy for her to do it. There should be more activities more action.

"Horst_In_Translation","8","0","3","1 June 2015"," Very good - with one exception
","And this exception would be Miss Jennifer Lawrence, who is just so less talented than media and filmmakers want us to believe. I wish they would have chosen Carey Mulligan or Hailee Steinfeld to carry this franchise, but sadly they did not. Instead they choose the obvious pick, who managed, in this film, to basically show zero authentic facial emotion during almost 150 minutes and is also not gifted as a physical actress. The script is actually pretty excellent except in these situations when it is not about telling a great story (regardless of how new it is), but attempts to give Lawrence's character scenes as baity as possible, which she doesn't nail a single one of with her usual aggressive approach to acting that is bar any subtlety. Thankfully, Woody Harrelson and especially Stanley Tucci make the film also worth a watch from the acting perspective. Some of Lawrence's worst scenes include the one where she acts embarrassingly like a mother to her sister, when her sister calls her mother before, or the scene where Hutcherson confesses his love (or better-said Lawrence's reaction afterward) or the scene near the end she says ""it's the finale"" or the apple scene. Basically, she really messed up all the emotional moments this film had, not only the ones I mentioned before, also everything on racism and friendship.<br/><br/>This movie was number 3 in terms of commercial success in 2012 (following the Avengers and Batman) and was written (adapted from a novel of course) and directed by Gary Ross (""Pleasantville""). He did not return for the sequels, which is a bit of a shame as you cannot really blame him for his lead actress' lack of talent. His writing was top-notch for the most part. The whole idea of the current generation paying for the errors of the past generations is not entirely new, but it's still relevant and was smartly executed here. All in all, this was a great film in the first half and a good film in the second half. This decrease in quality obviously also had to do with Lawrence. Surprisingly, everything surreal surrounding the Hunger Games and the detailed introduction to them was far more interesting than actually watching them. The ending of the film was partially expected of course, but not entirely and that was nicely done too. As a whole, it's a very witty well-done film and I recommend watching it."

A male and female between the ages of twelve and eighteen are chosen via lottery from each of the twelve districts to partake in a fight for survival for which only one emerges the winner. When North America lay in ruin, Panem was divided into these districts where rebellion is met with the games.

Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss is the emotional centre struggling to survive while experiencing humanity at its most vile. Josh Hutcherson as Peeta battles his need to survive verses his desire for Katniss. Liam Hemsworth is basically there for Twilight style marketing as the other guy, but his presence is limited.

","The Hunger Games is a thrilling, adventure, sci-fi movie that will leave you on the edge of your seat. This movie takes place in the dystopian future. The nation of Panem is divided into 12 districts and the Capitol. Each year, two young representatives from each of the 12 districts are selected at random to participate in The Hunger Games. These games are not all fun and play however. The 24 individuals chosen at random are forced to kill their competitors and be the last person standing. The objective of the game is simply to survive. If that's not enough stress already, these games are broadcasted throughout the whole nation of Panem so everyone can watch their every move. <br/><br/>Katniss Everdeen is played by the actress Jennifer Lawrence. Katniss' sister, Primrose Everdeen, is chosen at the reaping to be the female contestant in The Hunger Games. Katniss however could not stand to see that happen. Her being the strong, independent individual she volunteers in the place of her sister. Peeta Mellark, played by the young actor Josh Hutcherson, is the male contestant that stands beside Katniss for these games. During the intense games, Katniss and Peeta are determined to make it to the end together and ALIVE. <br/><br/>The techniques used in this movie are eye catching and draw viewers in. The people who live in the Capitol wear bright colors, crazy makeup, and three dimensional pieces. The styles that each character portrays are very unique. Another technique that is used in this movie that really stands out to viewers is lighting and color. The Capitol is portrayed has a happy and vibrant place to be. The director shows this by making each scene very bright and colorful to show viewers it is happy. When scenes from the 12 districts are shown, it is very dark and depressed looking. The colors are very dark or neutral and it shows the districts are unhappy. <br/><br/>Overall, I believe this is a GREAT movie. It is not the typical movie that I go for and I really enjoyed it. The great acting along with the suspense that leaves you on the edge of your seat wondering what happens next is a great escape from the real world. The Hunger Games draws you in throughout the whole movie that you will have to go see the next one. I highly recommend this movie to everyone. And.May The Odds Be Ever In Your Favor!"

","Over the years, there have been many films that have been seen as classics of their genre, due to their critical and commercial success as well as fan support. However, this doesn't represent everybody, as there will inevitably be backlash against the film, and those people would feel that the film in question is overrated. Casein point, The Hunger Games, as while there are some good elements here and there, it seems surprising that a film so derivative, lazily written and overall quite weak would be praised as much as it has, and is one of the most overrated films over the past few years because of it. <br/><br/>The plot is that after volunteering instead of her sister, Katniss Everdeen takes part in The Hunger Games, a show that consists of young people fighting each other to the death for the sake of entertainment. When at the games, Katniss will do anything in her power in order to survive. If you feel that that synopsis sounds familiar, that's because it has blatantly been recycled from films like Battle Royale and The Running Man. If the film wasn't derivative enough already by this point, it also rips off bits from other films (like the authoritarian city from 1984 or the chase scenes from Apocalypto) in order to tell its story.<br/><br/>The writing is also undermined by other factors as well, like the multiple plot holes within the story, like why do the Capitol let two people live despite being intent on killing everyone else, or why Rue's district starts rioting, despite having their tributes killed for the past seven and half decades. It also lacks any sort of fundamental character development, leading to characters who are two-dimensional at best and at worst, quite boring and unsympathetic.<br/><br/>The latter of that definitely applies to Katniss, partly due to her poor writing, and the other part due to Jennifer Lawrence's poor performance, as while her character is meant to a strong, independent young woman with a dark past, Lawrence acts like a bored, whiny teenager who's upset that her Ipod ran out of charge. It makes her completely disengaged from the audience, as since she doesn't seem to care about her predicament, it makes the viewer question why they should care either. Thankfully, the rest of the acting is perfectly fine, but their character writing is still quite weak. The most notable example of this is when a character called Rue is killed off, and despite the fact that she has only five minutes of screen time or so, the audience is supposed to be shocked and saddened by her death.<br/><br/>It doesn't help that the film is constantly switching tone, and it becomes distracting after a while. At the beginning, the tone is serious and downbeat, and the setting of the film reflects this perfectly, with its muted colours and overall depressing mood. However, later scenes in the Capitol (where the Hunger Games takes place) are completely the opposite, with bright colours and people being dressed up like they had escaped from a Dr. Suess book. I understand that this is meant to be a juxtaposition on the rich and the poor, and how greedy the former truly are, but due to the film's serious tone, this part of the film feels overly cartoony and it becomes harder to take seriously as a result, something made even worse by the hugely unconvincing fire and attack dog special effects during the film's major set-pieces.<br/><br/>Sure this film has positive attributes, as it is finely acted for the most part, has strong production values and has pretty good action scenes here and there, despite the overused shaky cam technique, but there's not much to recommend the film otherwise. From its unoriginal story, to its badly written script, to its unsympathetic lead, to its bizarre tonal shifts throughout, the Hunger Games is an overall bad film that is only recommended to die- hard fans of the books, but even then I feel that some fans might struggle(due to how superior the books are meant to be). Sure, the sequels are better, but that doesn't wash away the bad taste that the first film left in the mouth."
"tkd_kize","7","0","3","24 April 2015"," Hunger Games about adversity
","The Capitol of Panem has been divided into twelve districts. Because of a rebellion that was defeated many years ago it was decided that each district would give one boy and one girl to fight to the death in an annual tournament called The Hunger Games. Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) lives in the coal mining area of Panem known as District 12 with her mother and sister Primrose (Willow Shields). When Primrose is selected to be in The Hunger Games, Katniss ""volunteers as tribute"" (Jacobson & Ross, 2012) and takes her place in the games alongside her male counterpart Peta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson). She has to leave behind her childhood friend, Gale Hawthorne (Liam Hemsworth), to go to The Capitol. On the way, Katniss and Peta are helped by a former winner of The Games, Haymitch Abernathy (Woody Harrelson). Katniss and Peta form a bond during the game, and help each other gain favor from the audience by pretending to be in love. In the end Katniss and Peta are the final two tributes. Since there is only allowed to be one survivor they attempt to challenge the Capitol and fake an attempted suicide to allow them both to be named winner.<br/><br/>The theme of this film is about standing up to adversity no matter what the cost is. There are many instances shown throughout this film to show this. One examples is the coal mining District 12 itself. Conditions are hard here and food is in short supply. Katniss goes against the law and travels beyond fenced areas to hunt for food so she can eat and sell on their black market (Jacobson & Ross, 2012) which could mean death for her. One of the two biggest examples in the film is Katniss volunteering as tribute for Primrose (Jacobson & Ross, 2012). Knowing that only one person out of twenty-four will come back alive, Katniss still takes on these odds to ensure the safety of her sister. The other of the big two examples of this theme is when Katniss and Peta stand up to The Capitol and President Snow (Donald Sutherland) by forcing an ultimatum: Either they both live or they both die by suicide and there would be no winner (Jacobson & Ross, 2012). The theme of this film reminds me a lot of the 1996 version of Romeo and Juliet directed by Braz Luhrmann. Both Romeo and Juliet have to face the adversity of feuding families no matter what the cost.<br/><br/>A couple of techniques are used throughout the film to help show this theme. The color scheme of the film plays an important role in showing the distress of the different districts, and the adversity they face. District 12 is a shown in a way that attempts to take the color out of the scenes without actually doing so. District 11, the home of Rue (Amandla Stenberg), is also shown in this light. Another technique used is angles. There are many shots taken from above to show us looking down on to the tributes. The use of these angles has a way of putting the audience in a position that we feel like we are actually watching The Hunger Games being broadcast by The Capitol. One such scene is at the end of the film when Katniss and Peta are fighting Cato (Alexander Ludwig) on top of the Cornucopia (Jacobson & Ross, 2012). Likewise, there are angles being shot upward as if we are watching the fallen tributes in the sky right next to Katniss.<br/><br/>The theme of standing up to adversity no matter the cost is something that I think many hope they could do. When there is a great injustice being done to you or a loved one could you take their place or even give your own life?"

"squirrel_burst","8","0","4","28 March 2015"," There's a lot more to this than people fighting to the death
","""The Hunger Games"" is much more than another ""people fight to the death for the audience's entertainment"" film. It's well acted with solid characters and good art direction and I'm certain that it's just the beginning of a larger saga with an epic story.<br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence continues to deliver solid performances and Is by far the stand-out player in this, but all of the other players do a convincing job. Even the child actors, which I'm always wary of seeing are good. The performances mean that you will actually care about the characters and want to see them again (the ones that are left anyway). Even the ""villains"" have their moments of character development to show that they're not just mustache-twirling bad buys.<br/><br/>One element that I really enjoyed and thought was pretty impressive was the costume and art direction. To really show a clash of civilizations and how different this world Is from ours the people of Capitol City (where the titular Hunger Games take place) have all of these outlandish costumes and manners of dressing. These costumes sometimes have futuristic elements (explaining that this takes place far into the future) but mostly serve to show the difference between the 12 Districts from which each of the ""game players"" come from and the rich Capitol. It also gave me a rough Idea of how far into the future this story takes place without falling on typical science fiction elements like flying cars, or daily trips to the moon or other extravagances that have questionable plausibility. The costumes really feel like they could be worn by rich models and the cream of the crop of the 21st century, except for those futuristic elements and they're fun to look at. I don't even care about fashion and I was impressed by the costumes on display here.<br/><br/>When it comes to the action and violence the film does a good job, showing just enough to demonstrate how brutal a fight to the death can be without going too far and feeling like an exploitation film. The violence is well integrated into the story and it never feels like the movie was built around it. Even if you're not a fan of this type of film, with an audience watching as gladiators fight each other to try and win a prize, this is a smart entry in the genre with good acting and tasteful violence that's sure to get even more interesting with the future entries in the series.

"galmanza","9","0","4","20 March 2015"," review on movie
","There are films that have plenty of more views than others. I believe that something that can have an immense impact on the amount of views a film has, are the reviews behind the movie. Of coarse every film may have different audiences depending on its genre. I sure have different opinions on movies with different genres. If I am watching a comedy movie, I expect it to make me laugh more than 85% of the time. If I am watching an action movie I expect it to look realistic when the action happens. And if I am watching a horror movie I expect it to make me jump out of my seat. My expectations of movies also have to do with how much I think I know about the film. For example, one thing that might affect how well I enjoyed watching the movie is whether or not it is an original film or a remake. Remakes of movies have a lot more to prove to me than original films because that means that I expect them to be better than the last film. One of the films I expected a lot from before watching it was The Hunger Games. The reason for that is because prior to watching the movie I had been reading the book written by Suzanne Collins. <br/><br/>I actually had really high hopes that the movie would be exactly like the book. However, upon watching the movie I noted that a couple of things were left out. Now I know that there is no way possible that the movie could fit every single detail that was written in the book, but I do feel like some important things were left out. One of those things is that, in the book we are told right away about the districts and what they are known for, basically what each district works on. In the movie we simply see each of the tributes ""represent"" the things they work with as if each of them were just symbols. One other thing that was left out in the movie was how much district 12 struggled with starvation. We were never really told in the movie how much district 12 lacked food supply, we simply just had to assume and if someone who hadn't read the book watched the movie, we would have to explain how their situation was. We did see it at certain times in the movie when Katniss shares what has made her happy, the food that they have at the capitol which they do not have at home. Most of the details that were important in the book were covered in the movie like I said I know the entire book cannot be played in a movie so I can say they did their best at incorporating what they could. Another thing I expected to be the same as the book was the narration. One of my favorite things about the book was the relationship of Katniss, the main character, and her boyfriend, Gale. The entire time in the book he tried to convince Katniss to run away with him so they could be free from the games and we definitely saw these attempts in the movie. <br/><br/>The Hunger Games falls into the thriller and science fiction genres. That being said I wanted the movie to look as realistic as possible. Having the book as a reference to details, the movie really looked realistic. One of the things I was excited about was Katniss' dress that she would wear to one of her interview in front of an audience. The dress that she wears actually turns into flames and I loved how it came to life in the movie. The fact that we saw her dress turn into flames is important because it is actually how Katniss gets one of her nicknames ""The Girl On Fire."" The most important thing that I hoped would look realistic was during the actual games. There are so many things that the game makers are capable of doing that some of the things I could not picture while reading the book. One of those things being another scene that also involves fire. About halfway through the movie Katniss tries to find a safe spot and in doing so she wanders off to far. The game makers attempt to kill her by adding fire to forest at the spot where she is camping out. They add flying fireballs, which one actually strikes Katniss and burns her leg. Trees that are on fire appear to fall right in front of Katniss as she attempts to run away and closer to the middle of arena. This particular scene looks very realistic and it is one of the things I was surprised about the movie and satisfied with. It was almost as if I was in her position trying to run away from the fire that the game makers have created. This kind of teaches Katniss to remain close to the arena and not wander off to far. It also shows us how evil the game makers can be and how bad they wanted Katniss dead. <br/><br/>Overall I was satisfied with the movie and I don't feel as if it was exaggerated like some films with the same genres may be. I would recommend this movie to someone else to watch and I definitely look forward to watching the latest film of the trilogy. I hope that the other movies capture the book as much as this one did since it was one of the things that I most looked forward to. Especially since one the movies is split into two parts, I hope that means that close to the entire book will be capture in that film."

","The Hunger Games was NOT a movie I was interested in seeing, having somehow made the wrong assumption regarding what kind of movie I thought it was. I thought it was one of the current, endless dark, violent, plot-weak/less ""shallow"" movies that rates way up there for teens. Despite the number of people who rated it, and the near 5.0 star rating from so many, I was not going to watch it.<br/><br/>I changed my mind when my husband told me he believed ""Katniss Everdeen"" was, in real life, a professional archer (as is Geena Davis.) And am I ever glad I did watch it! I bought the movie, in fact, after seeing it for the first time 2 weeks ago or less, and since that first time, I have already watched it over 10 times.<br/><br/>It's hard to put a finger on ""specifically"" what made it such a pleasant surprise, but there's no doubt...physically, physiologically, mentally, emotionally...I was GRIPPED to the point I wouldn't even pause it for a 15 second bathroom break.<br/><br/>Using a list, here are the following elements that made me rate this a 5-star movie: 1. An original storyline and plot 2. Quality of the acting performances, by both leads, and supporting actress/tor 3. Jennifer's exceptional loveliness: she is beautiful inside and out. (read bio) 4. Excellent Directing; steadily growing from the start, never losing focus 5. Dynamite special effects without sensationalism. Used sparingly, but INTENSE! 6. The moral...very well defined without forcing the point: purity of goodness overcomes the adversity of the corrupted in power, who cause suffering. 7. Last, and yet the most influential - the power of being stunned by the unexpected, and original ""points/actions"", etc...that spring up here and there in the movie, causing the RARE (for me) ""rabidly gripped attention.""

","Gary Ross adapts the first installment of Suzanne Collins' worldwide book phenomenon ""The Hunger Games Saga"". He delivers a thrilling, brutal and exciting spectacle that will mesmerize viewers, whereas book readers might be disappointed.<br/><br/>In a dystopian future, the totalitarian nation of Panem is divided in 12 districts and the Capitol. Each year two young representatives from each district are selected by lottery to participate in The Hunger Games. Part entertainment, part brutal retribution for a past rebellion, the televised games are broadcast throughout Panem. The 24 participants are forced to eliminate their competitors while the citizens of Panem are required to watch. When 16-year-old Katniss's young sister, Prim, is selected as District 12's female representative, Katniss volunteers to take her place. She and her male counterpart, Peeta, are pitted against bigger, stronger representatives, some of whom have trained for this their whole lives. Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson convince in their roles as poor, underfed teenagers that engage in a romantic relationship, although one of them is required to die as there can only be one winner. The Hunger Games catches the authentic atmosphere of the book and holds the viewers' attention, despite its 2.5 hours length, which is partly caused by the numerous plot twists Gary Ross delivers throughout the movie. But the movie is by all means not flawless; it fails at what made the books stand out: Katniss' and Peetas' forced relationship as star-crossed lovers is broached but not carried out to the end. Moreover, the meaning and importance of Katniss' and Peeta's attempted suicide is not shown; the movie ends abruptly and book readers are left with the feeling of being cheated. <br/><br/>Gary Ross delivers a good, thrilling interesting action spectacle that is just that: an action spectacle. He fails in creating the multi-layered story packed with the political and social satire Suzanne Collins created. Therefore the movie would deserve a rating of 7 out of 10 possible points."

This event is being broadcast among the whole country. Katniss gets the tribute of district 12 together with Peeta Mellark. She volunteered to protect her sister who was chosen at first. Over the course of the story a romance between the two tributes develops.

"jacobclark512","7","0","4","21 November 2014"," A Solid Adaptation of a Great Book
","Any devoted fan of a book series would be delighted to hear that their favorite book was going to appear on the big screen. For me, however, The Hunger Games was different. As a novel, it dealt with intense political themes and was a very well-rounded story. Then it became a film. Like every adaptation of a book, The Hunger Games changed some things, and I knew this entering the theater. The book, to me, seemed too complex to fully develop in a two hour running time.<br/><br/>But then details started coming out, like the casting decisions, the crew, and their experience in film. This made me think that Lionsgate was really trying to make this a good film. Hiring actors such as Jennifer Lawrence, Woody Harrelson, and Donald Sutherland made me excited. I knew these names, and other people did too, making this movie more attractive to outsiders that were not already fans. But names don't make a movie. How would this adaptation of a book beloved by millions turn out?<br/><br/>The first key to nailing a book like this on-screen is the script, and The Hunger Games has a good one. The dialogue has an appropriate balance of plot exposition, comic relief, and serious emotion. This also makes the pacing of the story better. The film is not just one long crescendo; rather, it rises and falls in a similar way to the novel. There are also very few notable omissions from the story: those there, while some are considered important, do not change the characterization, the essential message of the film, or the end result. These aspects of The Hunger Games are due to Suzanne Collins, the author of the novels, participating in the screen writing process. When the author of your source material has a say, things suddenly go better in the script and story.<br/><br/>Thematically, The Hunger Games is intense but never seems to nail one specific message down. Some say it is a commentary on the class struggle. Others, an anti-authoritarian film. Still others claim that it is a feminist take on the sci-fi genre. It could very well be all of these at the same time. There is so much room in this film for good themes; however, I personally see it as a commentary (and sometimes satire) of our culture's glamorization of violence. The way the Games are televised and promoted in the Capitol show that they are immune to the effects of immense and immoral bloodshed. At the same time, we are also shown a former victor committing suicide after he wins. This juxtaposition shows us that what the cultural center believes is permissible is not always beneficial.<br/><br/>The visual aspect of The Hunger Games is a solid depiction of Panem, a nation with twelve districts and a central Capitol. When we are shown District 12, Katniss's home, it is portrayed as a poverty-stricken mining community. This aesthetic is done beautifully, with very rustic buildings, landscapes, and costuming. When we arrive in the Capitol, however, it is clear who is on what end of the socioeconomic scale. The extravagant buildings, clothing, and makeup both mesmerize and depress the viewer because, while they are visually impressive, they are also reminded of the depravity of the outer districts, bringing the class warfare discussion back into the ring.<br/><br/>The first less-than-stellar part of The Hunger Games is the acting. Granted, with names such as Jennifer Lawrence, Woody Harrelson, and Donald Sutherland, it can't be that bad. However, the biggest flaw in the acting is not the quality, as we see stellar performances from Harrelson, Sutherland, and Elizabeth Banks: it is the on-screen time these roles get. Harrelson's performance as Haymitch Abernathy, a drunken mentor to Katniss and Peeta, would be Oscar-worthy if he had more time to exploit his character. The major chunk of screen time is given to Josh Hutcherson and Jennifer Lawrence as Peeta and Katniss, respectively. They are both solid choices for their roles, but Lawrence is clearly the better talent, as Hutcherson seems uncomfortable for most of the film. Lawrence also has a command of the film and is not afraid to carry it on her back single-handedly. This unrelenting determination she has suits the role of Katniss well, and it is because of this that the film gets its tone largely right.<br/><br/>Speaking of the tone of The Hunger Games, this is one thing director Gary Ross gets right. His down-to-earth and simplistic style suits the nature of the novel. His use of traditional film over digital is also well-noted; however, it is his cinematography that is the most divisive part of this film. He employs a hand-held camera for most of his shots, and while this can work well for portions of the film where the perspective of the characters is needed and appreciated (i.e. Katniss boarding the train to the Capitol after the reaping), it doesn't always add up. Many times throughout the film, this hand-held camera work is trying to capture a running character with a running cameraman. This looks very shaky and can be almost nauseating, detracting a lot from the film. This shakiness permeates other sections of the film where it has no place whatsoever, tainting the beautiful scenes otherwise present.<br/><br/>Overall, I enjoyed The Hunger Games. Though it has its rough points (especially in the cinematography), it nails the tone, plot, and themes of the novel. The acting also keeps us invested in the characters and is solid in its own right, with the actors interpreting their characters well. This is a rare type of film: one that isn't necessarily the best but will appeal to all types of people. Action fans, dystopia fans, sci-fi fans, and some romance fans will be at least partially satisfied by The Hunger Games due to its broad narrative scope. Yes, its rough around the edges, but in the end you'll look past that to enjoy a good movie."
"bsbulldogs","6","0","2","20 November 2014"," Left me a bit hungry for more
","The Hunger Games left me with a bit of an empty feel as it shown a little bit of promise but at the same time leaves me feeling empty in a couple of areas. The worst aspect of the film in my opinion is character development as it is lacking and as you're watching this film or even after you have commenced watching this film, do yourself an ask yourself this, how many characters do/did I care about? For me, it was only Katniss, played by Jennifer Lawrence and Peta, played by Josh Hutcherson. In saying that, I didn't mind the likes of Stanley Tucci, Woody Harrelson, Elizabeth Banks and surprisingly Lenny Kravitz providing support to the two leads but do I care about them, the supports? Not as much as the leads. although the weakness is that the actors playing the kids from the other districts rarely get speaking lines and don't feel important enough to the story even though technically they should as they are contestants in the Hunger Games, no background into them whatsoever which gives the feeling they're nothing more than automatons and should have been better developed. The shaky cam didn't seem to work as well as you see more of that in low budget movies like Donny Darko and Paranormal Activity, not movies with a $50 million budget like this one. Story seems to suffer a bit as there is not much of a background to it, it's sort of like you're thrust straight into it without an explanation as to why it is what it is and so forth. Positives for the movie are the chemistry between Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson, the setting in a dystopian society and being in front of an audience so to speak a la Truman Show, having a female as a lead action role in a change from the typical male lead action role and great support from the likes of character actors Wes Bentley and Stanley Tucci. Negatives were the shaky cam, lack of character development for the contestant characters as well as Liam Hemsworth which I have already summed up in detail, origins of story could have been further looked into and some quick cut editing in some battle scenes. All up, it's a decent action movie but not a great action movie and I think my headline sums up a bit of my feeling."

I am not saying their performances are bad but they are rather not as good as they could be. This movie also has Lenny Kravitz for whatever reason... that's odd. <br/><br/>The camera work (While not the worst I have seen) is not good. I know you studios want more money and therefore want to keep a PG-13 rating... but don't put the shaky-cam in every f***ing scene. It is annoying and not well done. If you wanted it to be good you should have gotten Paul Greengrass who is a master of shaky-cam usage.<br/><br/>The music is generic (But good).<br/><br/>The story is a blatant rip off of ""Battle Royale"" (Which I for the record haven't seen but I am familiar with the story). The execution isn't that bad but I would rather call it sloppy than masterful. <br/><br/>Also, what the hell is up with the movie taking like and hour and a half to get to the games themselves?

Not sure how this all can keep rebellion at bay (nobody in the districts seemed to care), to me it seemed like a mayor plot hole. But I guess thats why there are more movies (coming).

","Yeah, okay. As it turns out, ""The Hunger Games"" (2012) was actually a really good movie – I'd cheerfully give it an 8 out of 10. I thought that this would be a sci-fi equivalent of a Twilight franchise, or a mainstreamed ripoff of ""Battle Royale"" (2000), but it was none of the former and only a little of the latter.<br/><br/>It took a decent story and populated it with fully realized, three- dimensional characters, then cast good actors across the board. You know a movie works if you're cheering for the main protagonist. It was also a surprisingly dark story for a young adult book adaptation.<br/><br/>The pacing was a little off  characters and plot devices are raised and dropped a little abruptly, and you can tell they were included because they were elements of Suzanne Collins' book that fans were expecting. And the action directing wasn't the best I've seen – the final standoff was a little awkwardly staged and anticlimactic. Those are small quibbles, though.<br/><br/>If anyone really likes this, it might be fun to watch this and ""Battle Royale"" back-to-back on a rainy Saturday.<br/><br/>http://ericrobertnolan.wordpress.com/"

","Almost perfect. When I finished reading the three awesome books I watched the first two movies. It's like someone was watched images in my head or I was the director or something, because everything what was in my mind during reading, this was on the screen. The big part of the cast, the scenes, the costumes, the lines and almost everything was on the right place where were in my head and how I will make it. By almost perfect I mean: I imagine that Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) supposed to be strong and athletic, not so childish and lost. I'm not sure that this role is for him, but the damage is done. I'm waiting to see ""Mockingjay"" Part 1 this winter and ""Mockingjay"" Part 2 next year and hope they will be with the same accuracy."
"nickcox144","Null","0","2","1 October 2014"," Hunger games camera and special effects work.
","Combining proficient acting and expert visual effects creates a piece of work that stimulates the viewing audience. A recent film The Hunger Games accomplishes this by the use of computer generated images and intricate camera work. The Hunger Games movie is based off of the book by Suzanne Collins. The movie's director Gary Ross brings the words off the page and breathes life into them. He shoots the movie in different perspectives that enhance the movie quality. Throughout the entire plot of the book there are several difficult scenes to produce on camera. The film succeeds in producing these scenes by incorporating different filming techniques that are seen starting at the beginning. The future post-apocalyptic America is first seen as a poor destitute district but is then seen to have an extravagant city full of exotic people. The visual transition from lowly living conditions to luxury expands the world of The Hunger Games and gets the viewer's mind moving. Throughout the expanse of The Hunger Games world, camera techniques and computer generated images are utilized in a satisfactory manner that significantly enhances the quality of the movie.<br/><br/>Visual effects is a way the director can convey the plot to the audience. The head of the VFX or special effects said, ""The key was to make a scene that served the story and flowed well in the cut"" (Frei). This was accomplished during the entire plot of the film. The continuous story line along with the attachment of visual appeal achieves what viewers look for in a movie. In the beginning, upon the entry to the Capitol, enormous futuristic structures can be seen. All of this construction was established using computers and software (MacGregor). The makers of this city were exactly right because this effect creates a sense of awe in the viewer's eyes. The immense size of the land develops a larger picture and enhances the overall story. Also, special effects are used when Katniss and Peeta are introduced to the public while wearing clothes that are on fire. The makers of this movie capture this moment perfectly by making the flames look realistic and by making the outfits look appropriate. The creativity of these effects push the boundaries of ordinary movies and give The Hunger Games a special touch. <br/><br/>The arena that the tributes from all twelve districts battle in is filled with intricate levels of camera work that build the mood of the film. The camera angles used give the audience an impression that there are thousands of cameras in the arena (Eisenburg). Most of the arena is filmed in a forest, but the events that take place in this normal setting are bursting with interesting features. One of these features is the fire storm that Katniss gets trapped in. Katniss travels far back into the forest away from any of the other tributes in order to stay alive. Because she doesn't see any action, the game advisers trigger fire balls to shoot from the sky and direct her back to the others. This fire storm was shot at precise angles that give a realistic effect. The sounds created by the fire balls give the viewer an extensive experience. Loud crashes and shrieks enhance the visual events which in turn allows the audience to perceive a more complete scene. Also, near the end of the battle, multiple mutated dogs attack the tributes in order to end the competition quicker. These dogs were computer generated and were incorporated into the movie's plot well (MacGregor). None of the special affects used were unneeded or just random. <br/><br/>Transforming a book into a movie is a difficult process, but it was done in the correct way by Garry Ross, the director of The Hunger Games film. The role special effects plays in the creating of a film is extensive because it can make or break the movie. The Hunger Games is one of the movies that succeeds in creating smooth and realistic visual effects. Also, it preserves the quality of the book because the director incorporates difficult scenes that contain a large amount of work to accomplish. The work behind the scenes is even more amazing then what is seen on the movie screen (Frei). The film was successful in creating a piece of work that captures the attention of the viewers through camera work and technological advances."

","Great performances help enhance this amazing story of friendship. Katniss Everdeen voluntarily takes her younger sister's place in the Hunger Games, a televised fight to the death in which two teenagers from each of the twelve Districts of Panem are chosen at random to compete. I thought that there was really good chemistry between the main characters. From an artistic standpoint, there were some plot elements and character developments I didn't think were totally needed. They do however drive the story, which seemed to be their purpose, so I can accept them. I am not saying the film is a classic, but it was pleasant."

","I watched the movie, read the book and watched the movie again in that very order. Probably not the best approach, but no big deal right? Not exactly.<br/><br/>I thought the movie was good when I first saw it, not great, but good. After reading the book the movie was diminished a bit but still good. Hunger Games did a fairly good job adhering to the book. There were some changes, but I could see that the majority of the changes had to do with time constraints more than anything else. To stay completely true to the book the movie would have had to be four hours long or so. After reading the book I found myself being overly critical and longing for certain scenes to be more detailed. I was looking to capture the same emotions I had when reading the book.<br/><br/>As movies go, this is a nice dystopic film. The tale is not over the top with heroism but rather subtle heroics. The action is moderate and enough to keep the movie lively. Ultimately, your attention is held by your desire for the main character to survive because that's what the Hunger Games are all about."

"Clockwork_Orange55","7","0","3","5 August 2014"," ""Although it stayed with its flawed points, ""The Hunger Games"" is still completely decent.""
","An attempt to switch ""The Hunger Games"" into ""Katniss Everdeen"" would be very lame. You couldn't think of the film without thinking of Katniss; and too you can't imagine Katniss without having a fixed thought on the movie either. The two artistic creations are impossibly separable from each other, just like United States of America and her idea on democracy. I think it is fair to purchase an opinion that ""The Hunger Games"" series starts on a high note. The first instalment of an ambitious 4-movies series is far from being weak or ineffective. Although it stayed with its flawed points, ""The Hunger Games"" is still completely decent.<br/><br/>Set in a dystopian future in the nation of Panem. Panem is likely to be located in North America of today's world-map; to match with an imagination of an empire that covers the lands of Canada and USA, or probably Mexico too. The nation consists of a wealthy state named Capitol, and 12 poorer states which are just being called as District 1, District 2, District 3and District 12. Every year, as a punishment, one male and one female from the age of 12 to 18 will be selected from each district to participate in the Hunger Games, where the players will fight to the death in an arena, and the sole survivor will be the victor. In the 74th Hunger Games, Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) reluctantly volunteered to replace her sister to be the female tribute (female participant) for District 12, as her undying love for her family overcomes her self-ego that possibly contains her. Her choice on not saving her sister from the Games was actually not an option at all.<br/><br/>Gary Ross's vision on Panem is very close to what my personal discovery on the modern society or humanity would be like; or at least, a tease. In the poorer states, which are the 12 Districts, the people are being dressed in a very natural, humane-style. But on the other hand, the wealthy people in the Capitol are very eccentric looking, or simply an image of absurd investments by them to provide paths for ugliness. My view on the mentioned points would be related to people in general who are merely slaves to anything that is modern or 'fashionable'. The rich from the Capitol are likely belong to that group of people, as they are easily exposed to and influenced by the outside world; whereas the poor from the 12 districts have less exposure to anything that would lightly bring destruction upon them.<br/><br/>""The Hunger Games"" too was pointing out on the righteous humans- sensitivity that is slowly draining out from us; perhaps the assumptions are false, but undeniably the facts do stay in the characters of the story. The sense on it withered; the slightest acts to consider on containing a person's heart are buying less. It is too dense, it is relentless. I am in reluctance to indicate the scenes which would unveil the assertions that I made, but one of the moments would probably be on the humiliation that Katniss faced by the wealthy when she is merely trying to fairly display her capability to prepare herself for the games. Their brains are dead, and sensibility is long-gone.<br/><br/>The performances are responsible for setting it apart from other ordinary teenage-dream movies. Many big-budgeted over-hyped young adult fiction pictures are absolute failure, but thankfully, 'Games' is pleasant. Jennifer Lawrence is terrific, Woody Harrelson is terrific, Elizabeth Banks is terrific and Stanley Tucci is terrific. The characters' personas, on either side, are so well captured by terrific stars. Great thanks to the talented cast, which occupied personal-charms in its own level.<br/><br/>'Games' hits on frustration through its self-obsessed editing and the overused employment of shaky hand-held. Gary Ross sure has his own idea or reasons on the practice, but it never gets me. My animosity for the vision is not deep, but the touch of admiration that I would have for it is not a success either. Firstly, the work on shaky camera gives a pain in the head. Secondly, especially during the earlier parts of the film where The Reaping Is taking place, have failed to establish a connection between me and the poor in the state (District 12). Therefore, personal emotions that should have been carried out to audiences, are not reaching.<br/><br/>The characters are flat out dumb and laughable at times. It aims at the forgettable bad guys specifically, who act on not wanting to be humans, but to behave in accordance with an unfavourable writing that even a horror is mistaken for a comedy. Peeta Mellark? He is one of the worst characters to have ever appeared on screen. It is a weakness when a dumb and insulting character is overshadowed by a far more superior heroine. Take Peeta out, and the movie would fare better.<br/><br/>""The Hunger Games"" is one of the few films that really bite me. I am not referring to its characters, but the reflections that were being addressed. The voices are essential, but only in my thoughts, hinged from my personal experiences. I firmly believe that ""The Hunger Games"", as a whole, is a tragedy. It gets to a stage where leadership completely devours its society, and with support, it stands with hypocrisy so terrible that it lies with a talent of only causing pain. A very powerful fiction though.<br/><br/>Score: 2/4<br/><br/>(Cinematicmadness.blogspot.com)"

","I really love this movie and loved the story when I watched it first time. Really good story, I totally love the concept, I always adore such type of new thought that gives and leaves in you deep print of freshness of the idea of the whole story: Completely different future world (not like classical seeing of future in movies such as Robocop, Terminator and alike). It's just something else, that gives excitement: different adventure type, different future world, life, survival, and some fresh simple faces like Jenifer Lawrence. Just like in ''DIVERGENT(2014)''.It's all good for me. I just wish the whole movie's quality has just been a little bit better. Just like in ""DIVERGENT"". God, I loved DIVERGENT too.

"ilikeimdb","9","0","4","31 July 2014"," Gary Ross is a Genius; It's the best movie possible from the material
","Let's separate out the source material itself from the extreme dedication of the production team to get the nuances of Suzanne Collins's The Hunger Games right in tone while shrinking the novel into the confines of cinema. In the latter regard, Gary Ross did a superb job in script writing / directing. He's balanced the need to keep the storyline moving with the need to keep true to the novel's underpinnings. <br/><br/>I've watched the movie a couple more times before writing this review. I find nothing superfluous, bloviated, unnecessary. It's a compact story that's equally divided between setup and execution. What's truly sad: Imagine had Gary Ross been the director of Prometheus. Yes -- Gary Ross is a genius. <br/><br/>What about the acting? The only weakness is the lack of chemistry between Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) and Liam Hemsworth (Gale). Liam seems a miscast hunk out of place in an ugly dour world. Too bad they didn't cast Miley Cyrus as Katniss's younger sister. <br/><br/>But there's a much larger problem: The source material. The audience has to keep swallowing incredible incongruities just so we can be continually hit over the head with multi-level anti-authoritarian messages. This is an amoral society on steroids that exists only as a foil to propel the thematics. We can't help but become angry at the atrocities foisted on Katness and her conscripted compatriots. Maybe I would have understood better if Katness had worn a six-pointed star. <br/><br/>So, I'm giving this movie 9 stars largely on the excellent execution / beautiful realization of Gary Ross's vision."

","With Harry Potter and Lord Of The Rings opening to both commercial and critical acclaim, it was perhaps inevitable that Hollywood would continue the trend of adapting novels into big screen blockbusters. These adaptations have ranged from the outstanding (Lord Of The Rings) to the downright abysmal (Twilight) with more than a few straddling in between (The Golden Compass, I Am Number Four). Thankfully, The Hunger Games is significantly better than a lot of other young adult adaptations, but not entirely flawless.<br/><br/>The story revolves around Katniss Everdeen, a teenage girl living in the dystopian district of Panem, who is thrown into a large scale fight to the death with 13 other teenagers from different districts. Those familiar with the Japanese satire Battle Royale, will notice more than a few similarities, with the movie often feeling like a watered down version. Still, it is quite intense fare for a young adult film, with a number of young children engaging in some fairly brutal violence and political allegories not normally associated with teen movies.<br/><br/>As is often the case with literary adaptations, it feels like director Gary Ross is trying to fit as much information in as he possibly can so as not to upset fans of the book. Take the opening, which has the unfortunate task of explaining the book's lengthy exposition before we can even begin to think about the games themselves. The problem with this is, as a casual viewer, you are eager to see what all the fuss is about and after just over an hour of build up, it is perhaps inevitable that the games are slightly disappointing. After a suitably brutal opening brawl which claims the lives of a number of participants, we follow Katniss as she survives in the harsh wilderness like a futuristic Bear Grylls. <br/><br/>There are some moments of inspiration, such as Ross' decision to almost completely strip the soundtrack during battle sequences, giving them a war movie aesthetic rather than an all action blockbuster. There is also a wonderful moment involving a key characters use of make up, which has to be seen to be believed but throughout the 2 and a half hour runtime, one can't shake the feeling that, given the source material, it could have been so much better.<br/><br/>A dark and disturbing teen movie with some interesting political messages about class and the media. A fantastic central performance from Jennifer Lawrence elevates it above the likes of Twilight but it also suffers from trying to appease fans of the book and subsequently feels a little bloated."

"willcundallreview","7","0","3","3 July 2014"," An adaption that boats a lot of good action
","The Hunger Games is a survival film based on a book and which I think was well adapted to boot. With some truly thrilling sequences and acting from up and coming stars, the film oozes teen movie, But I do think generally that anyone can and will enjoy this. It's starts a series off well and you can already tell by the time you finish it that this is the start of something good. I felt it was solidly a good film, and here is why so.<br/><br/>The story starts very slow and you may think ""Oh wow this is going to be dull"", but it then really gets into a groove. The pace starts to go along nicely and we are introduced to new and big things that provide an entertaining end. It probably is good to say that the film really gets going when they actually start to really do things(basically enter the game itself), yes the story goes well with such things going on and the movie really isn't afraid to shock the viewer, very entertaining though.<br/><br/>I found Jennifer Lawrence here to, well she didn't actually seem at her best at times but she does what is asked of her, provides a strong lead character. Josh Hutcherson also provides a good supporting character and his role is very un heroic but of course it works in parts and really brings out the potential the man has. Donald Sutherland is only seen little but you remember his face quite a bit, same goes for Woody Harrelson and both stand out mostly because of there resume in film.<br/><br/>Gary Ross directs this and well, with books yes they already have a script but I think he was able to add things in maybe for dramatic purposes and his sure hand of directing stabilises the movie in it's more slow parts. I wasn't a massive fan of some the effects on show such as the city and natural effects seen but I guess we aren't supposed to focus on them, and with the a bigger budget maybe they could have been done slight bit better.<br/><br/>The main criticism really for me though is the way the film starts slow, it is just TOO slow paced and it really affects it in some ways, not enough happens and the dialogues doesn't do enough to draw you in. I also wasn't sure about some of the more dramatic scenes which seem well, over dramatic. The over dramatics don't make you hate parts but they damage it and chip away at it's rating. <br/><br/>Fans of the book should be satisfied I feel, even if it may differ at all, it still provides a good show piece for the series and what is to come from the sequels. I think those less accustomed to the series should also enjoy, as alluded to many see it as a teen movie but it really isn't, has some good action but also some smart dialogue which I think can catch any movies fans attention and let them have some fun with it.<br/><br/>Overall it is Solidly a Good film. I said about it being chipped away at and that is what happens, it doesn't end getting worse it kind of gets better as it goes along and you shouldn't be bored by the ending, that's the best part. I felt there is a chance you can have an emotional bond with the characters especially in certain scenes, you want to support them all the way through and only the most hardened of cynical people would want to see them fail."

Woody Harrelson is the former winner from her sector who teaches her and the male participant from the same sector, Peeta. Harrelson seems not to care and is a drunk but as the film goes on shows perceptive insights as he lobbies on behalf of both the participants as well as training them on how to survive.<br/><br/>The film is a mish mash of various themed films such as Battle Royale, Rollerball, The Running Man, Westworld, The Truman Show.<br/><br/>Its entertaining but in a daft way. The young actors give it their all, Lawrence shows why she is one of the best young actors out there. However what kind of society which televises this tribute called The Hunger Games thinks its fair that a 12 year old can go up against a 18 year old? Never mind that the viewing public has such a blood lust to watch televised murder on screen when its clear during the selection process that the public are not happy that their children could be selected to participate in the games.<br/><br/>The film is also overlong, it is sanitized enough to keep its teen audience happy without the violence being too visceral. Its surprisingly enjoyable but adults are likely to be more discerning than a younger audience."

","I just finished watching it. I never read the book. For a couple of years I hear nothing but praise for the film. For the protagonist too. There is nothing particularly wrong with the movie, it's OK, but nothing special. Jennifer Lawrence was the main attraction, at least for her beauty. This is the first and only film I have seen her in so I am not going to be critical about her acting. Visual and special effects were good, but nothing special. If I ever see it again it will probably be to see her. Other than that...so average. Alexander Ludwig was very good, especially near the end of the movie. Isabelle Fuhrman too had a memorable presence.

","When I first went to see ""The Hunger Games"" at the cinema, I did not quite know what to expect. Was it going to be a mediocre PG-13 film with a bad plot and with bland performances like that of the ""Twilight""- franchise, or would it lean more towards uncompromising violence and a story of the human condition when faced with the extreme like in ""Battle Royale""? I left the theatre thinking it was neither of the two and perhaps that it was a bit constrained.<br/><br/>Finding the dystopian look on future North America to be compelling though, I decided to give the book a chance at reading, curious to see if it was any better than the film. The book instantly got me hooked and I realized I needed to watch the film adaptation over again. To my surprise, it was better than the first time.<br/><br/>The film is very true to the source material and director Gary Ross envisions the different milieus of Panem perfectly. The locations in every scene are in absolute compliance with those in the book.<br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence, playing the lead character Katniss Everdeen, delivers a great performance as a vulnerable adolescent girl with a tough exterior. Although her character could have developed a bit more, she is in no way devoid of emotion. Emotion she shows aplenty throughout the film. I also liked Woody Harrelson's portrayal of Haymitch. He was funny, believable and easy to like. As for the rest of the cast, their performances were good in general so kudos to the casting director.<br/><br/>Another thing I liked was the score by James Newton Howard, arguably the best composer for cinema these days. It really set the mood for the various scenes and I especially loved the song Rue's Farewell.<br/><br/>One of the things I disliked about the film was the shaky camera during the battle scenes. It did perhaps add to the sense of suspense, but one could see fairly little of what was going on at times. Understandably, this was to be able to reach out to a larger crowd of movie-goers. Additionally I found it slightly ironic and puzzling how little actual hunger there were in the games.<br/><br/>So overall ""The hunger Games"" was enthralling and quite excellent. It is satirical and in many ways, it surpasses most films aimed at a younger crowd. The film series will be worth looking forward to in the years to come and the prospects for the upcoming sequels are looking bright I would say."

I cannot wait for the next 2 movies, I will probably cry when they are finished. The film is unbelievable leaves you thinking for weeks even months. I watched hunger games back after a year and it still had that emotional impact. You really get to know the characters. It's an indescribable feeling when you watch it. I am not over exaggerating. Many people don't feel this way you really have to throw your self into the film. I am just a massive fan."

","Honestly I watched this film under pressure from friends and enjoyed it, much to my alarm, so out of curiosity I decided to watch it on my own and I enjoyed it even more. Firstly what made the movie for me was the performance turned in by Jennifer Lawrence who took the core elements and grittiness mixed with a subtle and not weakling like vulnerability, I'm sorry but I was totally bought into the film on this alone. The actual story was handled in a very 'grown up' manner for a film of this sort (based on a teen book series) cause I'm sorry for the most part they suck. I am a 31 year old man and Twilight-esque teen melodrama does not float my boat. The Hunger Games has shown me that if handled well films of this kind can be pretty darn good. Secondly the condensing of the story hugely satisfied me as I hate things being overly drawn out just because the director is trying to not only remain faithful to the book but also recapture it for the big screen. Many fans of the book have in fact complained about this element claiming it gave no real depth or insight but hey everyone is a critic these days. I for one found myself totally immersed in the story without an unnecessary amount of back log. So watch with an open mind and forget everything you would normally assume of 'teen flicks' and enjoy. Brutal in parts and with moments of sheer nerve shredding tension shows how this film is truly head and shoulders above the rest of it's kind."

","Katniss Everdeen volunteers for her younger sister in the Hunger Games. The Hunger Games is a fight aired on television where two teenagers are chosen from each district and they fight to their death. In total, 24 people fight in the hunger games. Only one person is supposed to be left alive.In Hunger Games, the main characters are Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence)and Peeta (Josh Hutcherson). It is a movie that is based of a book by Suzanne Collins. <br/><br/>It is only the first movie in the series, there are 2 more books, but the movies for the last one isn't out yet. I think teenagers would like this movie the most. I like how Jennifer Lawrence portrays the character of Katniss and you can see true emotion behind her acting. I don't like all the fighting and the blood though, I think it's kind of disgusting. Basically, 2 people are chosen from each district (they are districts 12) and they fight to death with everyone from the other districts. The name of this fight is the hunger games. I love the plot of the hunger games, there are a lot of plot twists and everything that happens is stuff that I wasn't expecting. <br/><br/>Overall, I think Hunger Games is an amazing movie but they could have shown less fighting scenes. The way everything is acted out is so amazing, it makes you believe that they are actually sad at someone's death. I love this movie, and it is definitely one of my favorites."

","The film 'The Hunger Games' queues in the first category of my favorite movies. Because of many action scenes, it contains a lot of tension. But there are also touching scenes which make the film sentimental. The story is compelling and also understandable for people who did not read the book. The introduction explains the situation of the character's life well, so that the audience can follow the subsequent storyline. The actors perform their role heavenly, so they act convincing. They are well chosen, so they match into the atmosphere. The costumes and the make-up underline the story and are conducive to the ambiance. Based on the clothes, you can notice the life situations of the characters. The backdrops of landscape and sceneries seem real and they are animated well. The same applies to the special effects. They are not used too often, but they are, like in every new film, amazing. I also love the soundtrack. It is fantastic, touching and matches the feeling of every scene perfectly. The method of utilizing no music is also used because the missing of music sometimes expresses more than every piece of music. The film ""The Hunger Games"" is very close to the book. That's why it is the best adaptation we have seen for a long time. This film is unique because there are just a few films which have this kind of ending. This ending whets the audience's interest for the next parts. All in all the film is a perfect mixture of action packed and sad scenes. It is a good choice to watch the recommendable film.

","When I first picked up a copy of The Hunger Games to read, Mockingjay had yet to be released. There wasn't as huge of hype about the movie at the time. What made me interesting in reading the novel was Stephen king's review of it.<br/><br/>I picked up the novel and had a lot of trouble putting it down. I figured, ""this would make a good movie"". A month or two later, the announcement was made that the series would become a movie.<br/><br/>Not nearly as many people spend time reading these days, at least in Alberta. The book wasn't extremely long. Adults seem more used to easier reads. I read this book in two sittings because I forced myself to take a break half an hour into the first sitting due to work. I read the entire rest of the book on a weekend evening in about 5 hours, which is still somewhat slow in my opinion.<br/><br/>The book series is written with the intention of showing how horrible war actually is. Its designed for teens to enjoy. There's a lot that a teen can legally read which they cannot actually see in a motion picture.<br/><br/>I believe it was a good decision to make this fit for pg-13. The movie wouldn't have been so successful as an R rated movie. It wasn't necessary to make into an R rated movie. The book didn't have curses, nor sex scenes, so why go that far if it wasn't there in the first place? The book takes a lot of influence from an Asian gem, which we all know. I do not believe at all that it is a replica. Its quite similar, but follows its own storyline.<br/><br/>I'm not going to ruin anything in what happens in the movie or book, so pardon me for being vague.<br/><br/>I rate this movie a 7/10 because of the camera work. If it wasn't for the shaky camera, I'd rate it a 9/10.<br/><br/>Movies have never and will never be exactly the same as the books. While this isn't a perfect adaptation, its worth watching and enjoying throughout. There were some poor casting choices in my opinion, but the lead role was exactly how I pictured her, same with Peeta. I believe they were a little off on how they presented Gale's character, but this is the movie and not the book.<br/><br/>The sequel, Catching Fire, is a much better adaptation in my opinion. I believe there is a lot of potential in making two movies out of Mockingjay.<br/><br/>The book is entirely in first person point of view, while the movie shows other character's points of view. Mockingjay is a lot more complex with a lot more room to extend the length. It makes sense to me to make the third book into two movies because it would be hard to follow and miss too much of the book being in one movie made for teens and older.<br/><br/>The Hunger Games movie itself I enjoyed once through. I was not interested in re-watching after I saw it in theaters. However, I could take a younger nephew or niece to enjoy this movie.<br/><br/>Action movies have become a lot darker in modern times. People always enjoy violence on the screen, especially men and children. Its nice to have a movie like this where we can include a younger audience.<br/><br/>There's a ton of haters on the movie, but it does not deserve any rating below 6. Enjoy it for what it is, and rent or buy it for your kids."

Sure, it isn't the greatest book-movie adaptation ever, but as a movie itself and especially compared to book-top movie adaptations of other Young Adult novels (eg. Percy Jackson or Mortal Instruments), it is very well done. I'm a massive fan of the series, I've read every book several times and was very exited for this movie. I feel it did not disappoint. Yes, they had to cut out some aspects to fit it into a movie that is already over two hours. If people are looking for a film exactly like the book they are never going to find it with anything. It called an adaptation for a reason. And as a first installment to a movie series this was done very well. Casting choice was perfect. Absolutely. Usually aging up some of the characters can ruin elements, fortunately Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence), Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) and Gale's (Liam Hemsworth) casting was some of the most brilliant I've seen. Other characters including Haymitch (Woody Abernathy), Prim (Willow Shields), Effie (Elizabeth Banks) and President Snow (Donald Sutherland) were exceptionally well cast as well. The actors are, personally, the best thing about the movie. Portraying the characters and their stories (with what is not the best screenplay) was very well done. The costumes, score and production design was also very good. Unfortunately cinematography is not - though the ""shaky cam"" adds to the realism of the situation it also adds to the realism of a headache if you watch too closely. The screenplay was not the best but still kept true to the book. Overall people are treating it too harshly, they did well. But if you do want to see an exceptionally accurate book-movie adaptation, go watch its sequel, Catching Fire."

","The Hunger Games' trilogy is one of the most beloved young adult book trilogies every written. You would expect a similar rating for the movie, but unfortunately for Suzuanne Collins, it falls short. The action scenes would be generally good if it weren't for the annoying shaky cam. This is something that cinematographers of today implement too much into action movies, and I like it when it is used in the correct time and not excessively used. In almost all the scenes in this movie, the cameraman can't stay put. As for the acting, it's not really anything special. Jennifer Lawrence does a decent job, Josh Hutcherson does a decent job, Woody Harrelson does a decent job, and pretty much everyone was decent in this movie. Probably the only stand-out performer was Elizabeth Banks as Effie Trinket. A major problem with this movie is that I think the delivery of the lines from the books were not exactly what I imagined them to feel like. In the end, I think this movie is nothing special at all, and I hope that Catching Fire can fix the errors this movie has made."

I had no idea of what this film was about but now that I've seen it, The Hunger Games looks like a toned down version of the violent Japanese film, Battle Royale that is clearly targeted at a younger audience & although it had the capability to be a brilliant adventure but it's not due to many noticeable flaws.<br/><br/>What works in favour of this film is its theme, a darker tone than its counterparts & Jennifer Lawrence who turns out to be the thread that holds this movie together as Katniss Everdeen and even though her character never fleshes out as much as we would've liked, it still maintains a level that can be appreciated. What doesn't work is that the story had the scope to give us the entertainment that's worth our money but is indeed very much toned down; maybe for monetary reasons or whatever. The character never develop throughout the story, the production design, costumes, makeup etc felt cartoony & the acting from everyone else was mediocre & lacked depth.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, The Hunger Games manages to be a decently entertaining but entertaining nonetheless, is briskly paced, well-carried by Lawrence & presents an intriguing view of a dystopian society. There are setbacks & falls along the road but it manages to crawl by all of it to come out on the other side & compared to its genre counterparts, is a much better beginning than what others have offered us until now but there is also a lot of things that this film can improve upon & it will be interesting to see if it learns from its mistakes in the upcoming sequels. All in all, The Hunger Games is a good film but had the potential to be even better; an opportunity that went wasted."
"michellidsferreira","Null","0","2","21 January 2014"," The hunger games
","A movie to think<br/><br/>Directed by Gary Ross in 2012, "" The Hunger Games"" is an adventure movie starred by two main actors Jennifer Lawrence (Katniss Everdeen) and Wes Bentley (Seneca Crane). The movie tells the story of a population that was divided into 12 districts that must follow the rules of a higher class, which apparently can bring them peace and order, and for that reason the districts are obliged to offer an annual ""tribute"" to them. These tributes are two people of each district that in a monitored place must fight against the others until the death, and just one of all the tributes can be alive and win this game. <br/><br/>During these 142 minutes of tension, the movie brings us an idea that this game its really similar to a reality show, like Big Brother, where the players must entertain the public and it doesn't matter what will be necessary to catch them involved in their survival into this isolated place. So the behavior of each player is being watched and consequently, the participants can pretend their feelings and actions to make the public agree with them and give some incentives. On BB the participants according to their behavior during the game, can be voted to stay or live the house,while in The Hungers Games, it's possible for the players to receive some external help, like a food, a medicine, something that is being necessary to keep the person alive. On this point, it is good to observe the main actors performance. Katniss is an excellent shooter that went to the games in place of her younger sister. During her stay she gets closer to Seneca, the boy that is from the same district of her. And they insinuate a kind of affection for each other that is a great point for discussion. Because during the movie I couldn't know if her feelings for him was just pretended to get the public involved in a love story and help them or she was really falling for him. So she had a good performance all long the movie. <br/><br/>A weak point in my opinion is that even the visual effects are really nice, and the setting in the forest is always changing to beautiful places full of trees, animals and waterfalls. All scenes are full of deaths and blood, which made me figure out that they were just exaggerating to get the attention of public with a weak story. But looking in another perspective, I really got interested in the drama, because while I was watching the movie I had some kind of feelings, like hate for the this injustice game and hope for have a fair ending. And I think when people can feel something about the movie, and just after watch they continue think about the story, it shows that this is a strong point about of the movie."

","In my opinion the book was much better than the film. Sure the film had good actors but thats all it was. In the book it describes how the characters look and act which leaves the reader to use there imagination and it had a lot more action in it than the film did. All people do these days is watch a film without reading the book and this film, even though it was good it had missed out on a lot of what was in the book and it wasn't as exciting and it didn't really make you want to watch more whereas the book kept you on edge and made you want to read it till the end.

","I watched this movie purely out of having no other movies to watch at the time; I wanted something to watch while doing work and turned to Netflix's suggestions to guide me towards something to watch. Though I had heard good about the film and that it stayed true to the popular novel it was based off of (I haven't read the books, by the way), I was rather disappointed upon actually seeing the film myself.<br/><br/>My main problem with this film was that it was EXTREMELY predictable- after about the first 15 minutes into the movie I could tell that the main character, ""Katniss,"" was definitely going to live through the hunger games, and all of the horror that she may experience while partaking in the hunger games. This quite detracted from the experience for me as even though this character faced many near-death situations I still knew that she was going to live through them all. With this, I was no longer faced with any attachment to this character, as again, I knew I wouldn't have to worry about the possibility of her dying. In summary, The film wasn't really thrilling.<br/><br/>On the other side of things, The camera-work and GFX in this film were quite great, and any scene that required its set to be made in 3D looked quite real. Though I couldn't imagine any of these sets to be what future civilization may look like, they still looked pretty for the sake of the film.<br/><br/>The musical score was unremarkable, To say that I barely even noticed it throughout the film. Nothing more to say on that matter. The acting was also somewhat unremarkable, Though I couldn't say any of it was really bad- Just... somewhat mediocre.<br/><br/>Overall, I kinda enjoyed this film, though as mentioned earlier, it wasn't thrilling as it was really predictable. I shall patiently await its sequel to arrive on Netflix; Until then, I shall hopefully watch some more thrilling and less predictable films."
"DeniseNY","6","0","1","9 January 2014"," Intriguing story with disappointing results
","Let me start by saying that I have never read The Hunger Games books and I had no idea what the full story was going to be about. In watching THG, I had hoped to learn more about the fictional time period that our characters are living in, who they are and what their lives were like before being thrown in to main event. Sadly, I was disappointed.<br/><br/>The story line is an intriguing idea: In a post-apocalyptic society, 24 teenage children are culled from 12 poverty-stricken communities and are tossed in to a survivor-like arena where they are expected to fight each other to death purely for the entertainment of the ultra-wealthy class. <br/><br/>And that is about the plot right there. No back-story. No character development. Nothing about Katniss' background, how she became such a good hunter, what family life is like for her or her relationships to Peeta (the other tribute) and Gale (the boy she left behind). THG desperately needs to fill in these gaps to round out the story, but the director chose to ignore these aspects and focus on the main event. Did he assume that every movie-goer watching this film had read the book? Truthfully, one shouldn't have to read a book in order to fill in all the plot holes that a lazy director deliberately avoids. Don't you think?<br/><br/>It should be noted that this is not a kid's film. The idea of kids murdering kids for entertainment purposes is pretty sensitive material for any age let alone adolescents and young teens. However, they did manage to subdue the violence enough to garner a PG-13 rating. Thus making it quite easy to target the younger generation with THG's branded toys and trinkets. <br/><br/>Now don't get me wrong here. Despite it's lack of character development, The Hunger Games is not a bad movie overall. The climatic battle for survival is pulled off rather tastefully. As I said earlier, the violence is subdued to a level where it's not thrown gratuitously in to the face of the viewer. And, for me, that's not a bad thing. I don't really want to see gory battles of children murdering children anyway. As for the rest, the visuals are quite nice. The District 13 city is beautiful. It's citizens are as plastic as you would expect - right down to their monochromatic clothing and hair. Some of the acting is predictably cheesy such as Woody Harrelson as the sarcastic drunk, Haymitch Abernathy, who in 4 days turns in to a supportive mentor. I was actually surprised by Lenny Kravitz as Cinna. His heartfelt sincerity towards Katniss seems believable. So I gave THG a 6 star rating. As the movie is definitely not bad and certainly watchable. It just feels like something is missing. Does that make sense?"

Some things should be given more value like the mocking jay pin.

Marxsims in this movie is a great example due to the fact that the social classes all have have different amount of wealth this leading to rebellion which is what the theory states.

","Okay, just got back from The Hunger Games. I rather liked the movie. I'm not going to talk about the actors. No one made glaring mistakes and I haven't read the books, so can't compare. I'm going to discuss the movie style a bit, then the story itself.<br/><br/>The handling of the camera and the general cinematography aspect was rather ""fashionable"". The shaking during the action and the lots of close-ups are all the rage nowadays. The shaking was a bit overdone. Especially in the beginning. Luckily a bit later it calmed down, because it sometimes makes me nauseous. The close-ups were good, just the right amount at the right moments. Especially because it wasn't 3D. You can't do so many close-ups in 3D nor shake the camera, because the mind can't keep up.<br/><br/>The story was good. I knew to expect a dystopia. As a genre they are usually defined as portraying the worst of all possible worlds. They are also usually critiques of the present society. I could see that very well. I have to constantly change the channel from the various idiotic reality shows that are mostly just porn and a bunch of people pretending so that they can be the most popular. Of course, in The Hunger Games it's their lives at stake. In dystopias, that is usually the case.<br/><br/>Katniss is the archetypal protagonist of dystopias. She's the kind of person who is playing along to survive under awful and impossible circumstances. She is generally a good person, someone who doesn't subscribe to the popular culture. However, the fate of these people is to have their lives changed in a way that they can no longer sit idly by and have to go against the establishment. We could already see that towards the end of the movie and I'm assuming in the following two that is going to be the theme. The only thing I'm wondering about is whether the author followed the genre to the end. The sad thing about dystopias is that the protagonist inevitably fails. The odds are just too great against them. I'm curious to see the story to the end.<br/><br/>All-in-all, I did enjoy the movie from an intellectual standpoint. I do have to admit that I like dystopias as a whole, so that was my bias."

","In my opinion, I think that the film, The Hunger Games (HG), resembled an incorporation of both 1984 and Battle Royale (BR) because in BR and HG, there are children that are in a game and they slaughter themselves whereas, in 1984 and HG, it is a dystopia, communist world where the government (Capitol) is corrupt with the affluent people have more freedom than the deprived areas. Also, the conditions that are portrayed in the film are similar to the USSR during the last two centuries of the Cold War. The themes in the film are well portrayed and show what a poor country is probably like. Also, the acting was high quality and did not diminish the tense atmosphere. The plot included many twist and plots including the end where both Peeta and Katniss escape morality and this causes civil unrest much like the unrest when the USSR municipalities wanted independence at the end of the Cold War. In conclusion, I think the film has great historical and political references however, I felt that I was missing at as I didn't read the book and the fact that some of the detail was omitted in the film."
"geminiredblue","9","0","3","3 December 2013"," The Girl On Fire!
","Shortly after this movie came out, a lot of viewers wondered if Suzanne Collins was inspired by a Japanese flick called BATTLE ROYALE. Having viewed both, I can see where one might've inspired the other. But did Collins deliberately steal from the earlier work? We may never know. So, allow me to review this film on its own merits. The story: Some time in the future, America has become a dictatorship now called Pan-Am. Parts of the country are broken into 12 districts. Once a year, two children (from ages 11-17) are chosen from each district to participate in a death match called THE HUNGER GAMES. Only one can emerge victorious. In District 12, that honor (if you want to call it that) falls to Peeta and Katniss. Though the human drama takes up much of the first hour, the main story takes over when they start the game. While much of the book's violence has been toned down to ensure a PG-13 rating, it's still disturbing to watch teens killing each other (sometimes with sadistic glee.) Jennifer Lawrence's wonderful performance as Katniss placed her on the map as a talented and rising star. Everyone gives their role 110%, which includes Donald Sutherland as the icy President Snow and Woody Harrelson as Haymitch, District 12's mentor. Forgiving some laughable CGI effects late in the film, this movie is excellent all around and I would recommend watching this on a double-bill with BATTLE ROYALE. Both are equally strong! Also, keep an eye out for CATCHING FIRE, now in theatres!!!"

","It is no wonder actress Jennifer Lawrence has won multiple awards for her performance in The Hunger Games. Based on the book written by Suzanne Collins, this film stars Jennifer Lawrence, Josh Hutcherson, and Liam Hemsworth. The story takes place in a future setting in a nation known as Panem, which is divided into 12 districts and the capitol. This science fiction, adventure-filled film is bound to have the viewer on the edge of their seats. <br/><br/>Each year, in the nation of Panem, two young adults are selected by lottery to represent their district in ""The Hunger Games"", a televised fight-to-death that the rest of the citizens are required to watch. When Katniss' younger sister's name is called to represent District 12, Katniss volunteers herself in order for her sister to remain safe. The male drawn as Katniss' partner for The Hunger Games is Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson), whom she has dramatic history with. Immediately after being selected, the two are sent away to training where they must gain the proper skills to survive The Hunger Games. Given only a small amount of supplies, Katniss and Peeta are sent into the woods where they compete against the remaining 22 opponents. Katniss finds herself a nice tree, where she is able to make a small platform for her to sleep on for the night with the hopes that no one will spot her. Day after day, Katniss and Peeta must remain a team to protect each other for survival. Obstacles appear, and suddenly the game is unpredictable. Throughout the film, the audience gets an intense look as The Hunger Games play out, leaving them on edge and unsure of the end results. <br/><br/>The director of this film, Gary Ross, did a fabulous job of directing this film. The angles used within the film helped the audience to get a better understanding of emotion within the film. Despite the fast-paced, extreme situations that each opponent faces throughout The Hunger Games, the audience is able to feel the connections between the characters. Furthermore, the audience gets a chance to feel as if they are part of the film, finding themselves cheering on the main characters as they fight for their lives. <br/><br/>The set design and costumes were also done really well in this movie, as it allowed the viewer to believe this actually took place in the future. The set design was a perfect fit for this film, as a majority of the film took place outside in the woods. The set design allowed the film to bring to life the world that Suzanne Collins had created in her novels. Additionally, it was very easy for the audience to see the difference between life in District 12 and the capitol, where life in the District was poor and rural with washed out buildings, and the capitol was futuristic with modern decorations and bright colors. <br/><br/>This film was strategically put together, allowing for the audience to feel a sense of belonging, as though they were involved. From the very beginning to the very end, the audience is hooked, and more often than not, begging for the sequel. From the cast, to the set design, to the directing, The Hunger Games is a high quality film that is strongly recommended for any teenagers, as well as any one interested in adventure films."

","The Hunger Games is basically a live televised battle which takes place every year. There are 12 districts and 2 people (1 male and 1 female aged between 12 and 18) from each district are chosen at random to compete in 'The Hunger Games'. Competing in the Hunger Games is mandatory as the 12 districts are governed under a Totalitarian regime. The Hunger Games is no ordinary battle and the contestants have to all battle against each other until the death until only one person remains. To make matters worse, not only do our unlucky gamers have to battle it out against each other, but they also have to contend with 'Career Gamers' - these are specially trained people who are experts in this field. When Katniss Everdeen's (Jennifer Lawrence) sister Primrose (Willow Shields) is chosen to take part in the Hunger Games, Katniss volunteers to take her place as she fears that her little sister will not survive the Hunger Games. Her male counterpart is Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson). All 24 gamers are put into battle together with only 1 person able to win; <br/><br/>One of the main problems with the Hunger Games was the pacing. I felt that it took far too long to get to the 'meat' of the plot. The first 2/3 of the film were excruciatingly slow and I was starting to lose interest. Thankfully, it did pick up and the final third (where the Games takes place) was fairly tense. The next big problem were some issues relating to the script;<br/><br/>**********************SPOILERS FOLLOW*************************** <br/><br/>There is a scene towards the end of the film where Katniss is fighting one of the 'Career Gamers' and she fires 2 arrows into the Career Gamer's chest, but this has no effect on her opponent. After this scene I was scratching my head as I couldn't understand why arrows to the chest would have no effect on a person. Fortunately, I watched the film with someone who had read the book and they confirmed that it was because the Career Gamers wore body armour - great!!. It would have been nice if this had been explained at some point in the film. This one major flaw shows that this is not a particularly good adaptation from the book.<br/><br/>There is also a scene where Katniss drops a large wasp's nest onto the Career Gamers. We are told that these wasps are dangerous and that if stung by them the victim will end up hallucinating, severe swelling will occur and in some cases the victims will die. OK - one of the Career Gamers gets killed by the wasps and all the rest of them get stung multiple times, yet a couple of days later all the Gamers that have been stung are fine and seem to have been unaffected by the wasp stings -are we really expect to believe that?<br/><br/>The film did have its strengths; I thought that Jennifer Lawrence was fairly good in the lead role (although her character didn't have a great deal of depth, I found her character to be a fairly likable heroine who I actually started warming to). Woody Harrelson was great as the alcoholic mentor of Katniss and Peeta - his performance for me was the strongest.<br/><br/>To sum up then, the Hunger Games is a bit slow to get going and it definitely suffers from some scripting issues. It is also a bit weak on character development. The sequel Hunger Games; Catching Fire is now playing at the cinema. Will I be watching it? Probably; but I won't be rushing out to the cinema to see it."

","Usually I tend to be annoyed with Hollywood's way of treating foreign cinema productions as little more than rough drafts or mock-up models, a worthy few of which are honored by being properly re-staged as Hollywood blockbusters. However in this case I have to admit that ""The Hunger Games"" manage to take a scenario that seemed outlandish, tacky and lacked context in the original film (""Battle Royal"") and provided it not only with a plausible background story, but with real depth. What appeared as cheap and almost pornographic in the Japanese adaption is turned into what amounts to valid social commentary on how authoritarian societies manipulate the masses by instilling just enough hope to foster initiative yet enough fear to keep them in their proper place, promoting simplistic mantras as eternal truths and endorsing all sorts of escapism and infighting to keep people from questioning assumed authority. <br/><br/>Why, and I used to actually suspect Hollywood as part of such a machinery..."

","The Hunger Games, based off the wildly popular novel by Suzanne Collins, is a spectacular movie and a very good adaptation of the book. The film effectively manages to take the raw emotion of the book and transfer it to screen. This film makes you care about the characters and it gives you insight on some dystopian politics. This film has some good action scenes and some intense survival scenes, but I feel like this film is carried by the raw emotional power and the great acting.<br/><br/>Gary Ross's film takes place in the country of Panem. There are 12 districts and every year each district has 2 young people who participate in the hunger games which involves one victor and everyone else dead. For this game, Katniss Everdeen volunteers in place of her sister and along with District 12 other player Peeta, they both go these violent games in the Capital and try to survive these games! The acting is nothing short of brilliant. <br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence is a young, talented actress who has a very broad emotional range. Stanley Tucci and Woody Harrelson are also nothing short of magnificent. Wes Bentley and Donald Sutherland are also good in their roles. Finally, Elizabeth Banks probably has the best wardrobe I have seen in recent films.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a fantastic adaptation of the original source novel. In many ways, this film improves on the novel. In the novel, I was not fond of Katniss's thinking. But luckily we did not have to deal with that here. Movie-wise, I was not fond of the shaky camera but thankfully it didn't take anything away from the film. I rate this film 10/10."
"genstarzz","8","0","4","19 November 2013"," It may surprise you
","I didn't see this movie in theaters because of lack of interest. In all honesty, based on the trailer and hype, it just didn't seem to grab me and none of my friends really seemed interested either. Some of my favorite films in the action/fantasy genre include the original Star Wars films, Many super hero films such as the dark knight and iron man, the first two terminators, etc. so the Hunger Games didn't seem to be up my ally. Since then, I have come to learn that two of my closer friends were actually big fans of the first Hunger Games film. With the release of the second film coming this weekend, and with the convenience of the it's availability on netflix, I decided to watch the 2012 film last night.<br/><br/>I don't regret giving it a shot at all. I was very pleased with what I watched! First, I am going to talk about the negative aspects of the film in my opinion, just to get them out of the way. The pacing of the first hour is just a tad slow. Nothing painful, and it does make the later parts of the film all the more thrilling, but it does move just a teeny bit slower than needed. I wasn't particularly fond of Josh Hutcherson's performance. Also, the cgi within the last 20 minutes looked a little fake. Some of the make up on some of the characters were a little silly. They looked like they came right out of Ron Howard's 2000 film How the Grinch stole Christmas. But these characters don't have massive roles or anything, and it's a very minor complaint. I'm scraping the bottom of the barrel at this point.<br/><br/>Now on to the good stuff. I fell in love with Jennifer Lawrence in this movie. She's a very good actress and is very attractive. She's my new celebrity crush. I really cared about the character she played, Katniss. This had to be at least 60% because of the gorgeous actress and maybe 40% because of the script. The fact that I cared so much about this Katniss was in peril, I very enthusiastically routed for her. The story was also interesting and fairly creative. I haven't read the book it's based on, so I can't say how it works as an adaptation or if it does great justice to the source material. As someone who knew very little about The Hunger Games going in however, I think they did a good job.<br/><br/>I touched on the performances a little bit. I mentioned that I though Jennifer Lawrence was perfect, and how I didn't care for Josh Hutcherson. As for the performances as a whole, I think the movie was pretty solid though. Woody Harrelson was probably the second best actor in the film and played one of the more memorable characters. Everyone else was serviceable for the film. While I said I thought the pacing of the first hour was a little slow (which was very slight), the remainder of the film flew by. I was glued to the screen. There was a surprising amount of violence. I was expecting the film to be on the lighter side of the pg-13 rating, while it was actually quite the opposite.<br/><br/>If the film took the violence any further, it would have easily gotten an R rating. I think this works very well for the film as it makes the world seem all the more realistic and dangerous, and makes the drama more effective. There are actual deaths in the film as well, which I didn't expect, which also added to this. If people die in this world, that also means that the main protagonist can die as well, which raises the stakes. There are also quite a few interesting twists and role reversals in the film that keep you invested.<br/><br/>Overall, if you are skeptical about this movie as I was, I recommend at least giving it a shot. If you get to the 80 minute mark, and are not satisfied, then you can turn it off, but I urge you to get at least that far before forming an opinion. I went into the movie expecting something targeted towards children around the ages 7-12, while in fact it seems to target a bit of an older crowd, probably between 12 and 18. It also managed to please me, a 21 year old. This movie was very entertaining, and I expect great things from the sequel."
"nayanackat","8","0","5","16 November 2013"," This is a review for The Hunger Games
","Just as the books have made their fame among young teenagers the movie is a superb hit as well. The Hunger Games were a box office hit around the globe, making a worldwide total of $686,533,290 seeing that many fans came to enjoy the wonderful thrilling excitement this motion picture had in store for them. The production of the movie itself had cost $78 million but even if this was the case director Gary Ross was still able to make the movie a great success.<br/><br/>The movie like the books are for teenagers who will like a bit of action twisted with traces if romance. The movie followed the book precisely and correctly from the very beginning to the end. The high quality audio moves the story along and keeps it flowing as well as brilliant video quality which lets us experience the world of Katniss in our own way.<br/><br/>The story is based in the distant future where the ruin of what once was North America is known as Panem. Panem is ruled by The Capitol, a place full of people living in luxury and style. The nation is divided into 12 districts from which there are to be 2 competitors, a girl and a boy who are in their teens, to take part in what is known as The Hunger Games – a form of entertainment for the people of The Capitol. In these games the contestants are to be involved in a fight to the death in which there can only be one survivor and winner. Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) takes part in the game, in place of her younger sister, along with her counterpart – Peeta Melark (Josh Hutcherson). <br/><br/>Will they be able to win? Will Katniss survive and fulfill the promise she made to her sister – to win the game for her? It can only be revealed as you lose yourself in the action of the movie yourself.<br/><br/>Although the beginning is a bit slow it is not a boring movie. As we get to know the characters we feel ourselves becoming one with them and Ross has captured that essence perfectly. We can feel when the characters are facing difficult decisions and when they are feeling like they have done a good thing. It is a perfect movie for teens as we can see the characters reach crossroads and have to make their decisions and have to think if it is the right choice or not because teens face obstacles like theses in their everyday live.<br/><br/>The one down point which I have to point out is about the filming. The camera is a bit jerky since it doesn't really focus on one shot. For example the camera is still moving about are switching views whilst two people might be talking. This creates a restless atmosphere to those who are watching the film.<br/><br/>The Hunger Games is amazing and a must see for action-craving teenagers. But don't forget to read the book either since you will learn more about Panem from the books. It has been shot up high towards it target of capturing many action-hooked fans."
"Ilharn","8","0","4","11 November 2013"," My take about this story.
","My son found this movie on Netflix and got me to watch it, I enjoyed the movie. When I spoke to my best friend he was disappointed by the movie saying ""It lacked the fullness of the book"" He sent me the audio books and I listened to them all. He was right a lot of details are missing, but I'm grateful I saw the movie first. Seeing a movie before reading the book is in my opinion a good thing to do. In this case the movie gave me a very different image of the capitol city than I woulda from the book, also some of the characters looks than I got from the book. My best example is Rue, if I had the books first she woulda looked very different, an I freely admit I felt more for the character after the book. In short watch the movie first than get the book and get the whole feel. Sad part is there are still today place where people live in such poor conditions as district 12.I also like to mention that Jennifer Lawrence was perfect as Katniss Everdeen,I often wonder how much of herself is in that character,and no one but Woody Harrelson coulda pulled off Haymitch Abernathy. In closing watch this movie with an open mind, try to enjoy the fun, get angry at the cruel, and have a great time."

"Clockwork-Avacado","8","0","9","6 November 2013"," The most charismatic mainstream film in a long time
","In the run-up to ""Catching Fire"", I realised it was about time to finally knuckle under, and watch the first ""Hunger Games"" movie, which I've been previously put off because it looked like a bunch of whiny teenagers running around a forest killing each other, and a society of very camp people in ridiculous clothes watching. Well, to be fair, it kind of...is. It's also probably the most human ""blockbuster"" film of the last twenty five years, defying narrative obscurity, massive CGI set-pieces, smarmy heroes, and people posing about trying to look ""dark"" and ""cool"". ""The Hunger Games"" is small-scale, intensely personal, and well-crafted. So why does everyone like it then, in this age of over-kill? I honestly don't know, because it's not at all your average blockbuster.<br/><br/>All this said, there's no denying that there really isn't anyone in the cast who, pardon the pun, really sets the screen on fire. Most of the cast are acceptable enough (Jennifer Lawrence, Hutcherson, Hemsworth, BAnks, Tucci, etc) with only a few duffers. (Kravitz, Ludwig)The main thing is, though, there's a strong story at work here, and Lawrence's rather opaque performance as Katniss Everdeen shows depth in places, which hopefully will be exploited in future movies. She's a good heroine for this film, don't get me wrong. She's just nothing special as an actress.<br/><br/>Director Gary Ross has excelled himself here, with a very subtle film. The action scenes have been intentionally filmed in a very realistic, low-key fashion, where things aren't glorified, or ""stagey"" in any way. In a film about a world which glorifies killing, this is a very wise choice, and adds immensely to the threat. For once, the threat has been calculated very simply, with the assumption that less is more, and the minimalistic sense of danger is more powerful than any one of countless CGI-driven action movies out there, because the threat, to, is human. It's ""Lord of the Flies"", meets ""First Blood"". It may all be set in the future, amidst elaborate trappings, but what it boils right down to, is a very dark tale about survival.<br/><br/>It's relevance to contemporary society cannot fail to be missed. How long before we're watching things like this? How long before our society will be taken over by camp, garish people like this? It isn't glorified in any way, and the implications are all very explicit. It's a sugar-coated critique, and, like the best dystopian fiction, it is done in a very extrovert fashion, to make the point all the clearer. It isn't a complex film, like say ""The Dark Knight"", but what it is, is an intelligent film, with more balls in it than any dozen other big budget ""epics"". It never loses sight of its' human characters, as shallow as they may be. The plight focuses on concerns so simplistic, that we don't need hours of moping about and soap-opera. It's about kill or be killed. That's all you need. And the drama remains poignant and undiluted. People fall, and we see their leg bloody and wounded. For once, we're not treated to computer-game like visuals. These are real people here. We feel their pain. Nothing is over-done. It's a film about simplicity, and, unlike every other ""dark"" film out there, is actually grounded in the laws of reality, however romanticised the story itself may be.<br/><br/>Along these lines, is James Newton Howard's score, very stripped back and poignant, and yet, it isn't in any way intrusive, hence allowing for the retention of the atmosphere of reality. Rarely has a major film been so unashamed to fly in the face of cinematic tropes. The action, of course, is limited, and you're more likely to be surprised than excited by this film, because of its' stylistic bravery.<br/><br/>The only thing, which IS especially modern, is that there is that creeping ""sequel"" mentality. There's a feeling of restraint to the sub-plots, especially Donald Sutherland's President Snow, who looms intimidatingly, promising great things, but doesn't get a chance to do anything. Similarly, the political unrest in the districts is glimpsed briefly, and the ending hints strongly at the events of the next ""chapter"" in the saga. For any film, even if the sequels are already in production, the story should have a beginning, middle and end. It should be self-contained, and not rely upon the fact that we're going to see the next film. Because it's thinking like that which stops second films from being made. As it is, ""Catching Fire"" looks set to be incredible, probably better than this, with more political intrigue now that we've got all the introductory work out of the way. The only sad thing is, no Gary Ross for the sequel. Regardless, though, this is a solid action/thriller, which stylistically feels like a grittier, more honest seventies movie, but one which has a profound relevance for contemporary society. Entertaining, and with more charisma than you'd ever imagine."

","Jennifer Lawrence (Catnis) Josh Huterson (Peeta), Liam Hemsworth ( Gale) play three of the biggest roles in The Hunger Games which was released in 2011. The film is set in out lying poor district of a very high tech futuristic world. It moves from this place to that of a game arena created by the master minds who are behind the games themselves. The game that all the tributes will ""play"" is a duel to the death. The games are annually played because of a revolution all the strict tried to have against the highest power. These games are now played to keep them in check and under control.<br/><br/>The movie begins with you meeting Catnis and her family. She quickly show the emotions and love she has for her sister, and lets the audience understand that a bond such as this will never be broken before the story even begins. The viewers are given a glimpse into the life of this family as they show flash backs of how they lost a loved one, and how each of them delt with this grief. Viewers then follow Catnis to a place where she feels most at home. She begins to show you the skills she will use in the game and is interrupted by a friend. Gale, played by Liam Hemsworth surprises her in the woods, and they are then both surprised by the peace keepers; who fly over them in a ship landing to begin preparation for reaping day. Reaping Day is one of the most important scenes of the entire movie. The audience is given an understanding of why the mayor of these districts forces a male and female tribute from each district to take part in a duel to the death that he calls The Hunger Games. After everyone has been chosen for the games you are taken with the tributes on a trip to the new lands. The audience experience the awe that they feel as they are whisked away to these new lands. During this experience you meet their mentor who is supposed to guide them to bring out the best of their abilities. He is used to give them skills in the games, but the tributes ( Catnis and Peeta) soon realize that he is dealing with a few demons of his own. After approaching the world they have never seen before, they are presented to the people of the town in a tribute parade. This is the time that they have to make themselves remembered and the tributes from district 12 (Catnis and Peeta) do just that. Finally we are sent into the games with the tributes and from there only one can be crowned. The journey to find this victor involved alliances, betrayal, and twists and turns that the audience will never see coming.<br/><br/>The acting in this film is impeccable. Many of the actors and actresses must act their own deaths and make it believable. When they witness a horrific event they must make the audience feel the emotion that their character would feel. One example is at the beginning of the games as each individuals stands on their platform the director utilizes a wide angle shot. This gives the audience the ability to see each tribute's face. Each viewer is able to see which tributes are confident, which ones are petrified, and emotion in-between. For these actors to be able to portray that in a group of people without saying one word was incredible.<br/><br/>Another fantastic aspect of this film was the decisions of shots. The director did a good job of making the shots as if you were seeing through the eyes of Catnis. Again when they are first coming into the arena where they will be playing with the sun is incredibly bright. The director uses a view faced directly at the sun as if you are looking through Catnis's eyes trying to adjust to the new bright light. In another scene,Catnis is in a tree with many other tributes on her heels. The camera is placed at the bottom on the tree so as an arrow is shot at her you see her entire body and the arrow. This gives you an understanding to just how close she escaped death as she sat high up in a tree away from her enemies.<br/><br/>Finally,this is a film I would recommend. It has romance, thrill, and a director who knew how to captivate his audience. The movie is a personal favorite of mine,not only because of the plot line, but because of the cast and techniques used during the production of the film. I would recommend this movie."

I think there was enough character development for movie standards, as a matter of fact most movies do not have as much character development as this movie does. I think that this is an unwarranted accusation against this movie by book readers. <br/><br/>Consideration of Content<br/><br/>OK, here comes the prude in me. We are entertaining ourselves with a movie that is portraying a very violent and evil situation. One has to ask themselves if we are like the Romans, or Citizens of the Capital getting enjoyment from seeing people being forced to kill each other. There is a sense, however, of good vs. evil, & strong vs. weak, the evil teaming up to kill the good, & the strong teaming us with the weak to defend the weak, & to help each other to defend against evil. The good is, basically, only killing in self-defense. <br/><br/>Due to the violent nature this prude would not let a teenager, (especially a younger teenager), see this film. <br/><br/>Overall a good movie, but I do have problems with the content."

","This is a distressing movie to watch. 24 handsome randomly picked teenage couples are forced to fight to the death until only one survives in a state sponsored spectacle. Only one of the 24 actually relishes killing off the others. The rest do it just to save their skins.<br/><br/>The society that arranges this is technologically advanced, decadent, highly artificial, somewhat reminiscent of the foppishness of the court of King Louis VI. This is indicated with impractical clothing, overly elaborate shellacked hair styles and extreme makeup with strange colours.<br/><br/>I kept wondering if the players would subvert the game, and refuse to play. But they were just randomly chosen teenagers, not heroic societal architects, who after a bit of flirtation with rebellion, did just what their handlers asked of them. Quite a downer ending.<br/><br/>The movie can be taken as a metaphor for war, where people who have no grudge against each other are conscripted to kill each other.<br/><br/>The movie can also be taken as a metaphor for show business, with the cut-throat competition, the sponsors and the way everything is faked, and the way those in control use people as toys to provide entertainment, and their complete lack of compassion, honesty and fair play."

I do think that she should have fell in love with her friend back at home, he was cute and cared for her so very much. Her fellow Tribute was cute too and I eventually fell in love with his character as well. I like how they finished together and showed the creators of The Hunger Games that they could beat it without slaughtering anyone in a viscous attempt to win. I personally think that they got all of the perfect actors for this movie. Jennifer Lawrence is beautiful and she just looks like what i would imagine would be her. She is a wonderful actress and I believe this movie launched her career big time. I would be honored to act along side of her in another amazing movie.

","The Hunger Games, the adaptation of the Susanne Collins novel of the same name, was one the most popular and successful movies of 2012. This year, in November, its sequel – The Hunger Games: Catching Fire – will hit the theatres world wide, and there will be even more sequels spawning in 2014 and 2015. So, I decided to sit down and re-watch the first movie, and try to analyse once more if it's really as good as everyone says, and whether it deserves/needs its announced sequels. Like many other people, I hadn't heard of the novel until I had heard of the movie, and I never actually read it; therefore, I can't say if this movie is a faithful adaptation or not.<br/><br/>The Hunger Games is, amazingly, about the Hunger Games – an annual manifestation in which two young people (one male and one female) are chosen, from each of the 12 districts set in a dystopian future state, and put into an area where they fight each other to death, and only one comes out alive as the winner. In case you don't understand this concept, don't worry – the movie will go out of its way several times to explain you the rules. Anyway, in the 74th annual Hunger Games, two young people from district 12 are chosen as tributes for the game, one of them being Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence), who volunteered as a tribute to save her younger sister from the same fate, and the other being Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson).<br/><br/>In a certain way you could call The Hunger Games a 'style-over- substance' movie, because it spends more time developing the environment/setting/premise in which the characters interact, rather than the characters themselves. While the premise of the movie – people fighting to death until there's only one left standing – certainly isn't original (Battle Royal comes to mind), it's still a pretty interesting premise that will keep you entertained. Being set in a dystopian future, the movie nicely executes the portrayal of this future – with shots of the Capitol and the districts, the portrayal of the everyday people, their costumes, fashion and, of course, their fascination with the Hunger Games.<br/><br/>However, the movie falls flat on a technical and character level. The technical problems in the movie include the unnecessary shaky cam, which makes the movie sometimes hard to watch, and the awful CGI (scenes with fires and monster dogs). The situation with the characters isn't much better: the male lead Peeta should have been introduced earlier in the movie, some potentially great characters like Haymitch (Woody Harrelson) and President Snow (Donald Sutherland) should have had more screen time, and some other characters should have been more developed – like the bland bad guy Cato (Alexander Ludwig) and the forgettable little girl Rue (Amandla Stenberg), whose death exceeds her importance. The character of Katniss Everdeen is developed just fine, but the actress portraying her, Jennifer Lawrence, has an unusually stiff delivery and doesn't show her true acting capabilities. That is a shame, since she is a talented actress and she even won an Oscar in 2012 for her role in Silver Linings Playbook.<br/><br/>All in all, The Hunger Games is a flawed movie but is still entertaining and has an amusing concept. So I think I would like to see more movies from this franchise and, hopefully, the sequels will learn from the first movie's mistakes and be even more enjoyable. If nothing else, the director Gary Ross – the man responsible for all the shaky cam – passed the opportunity to direct the sequels. Thus, the movies will certainly be somewhat better, at least on a technical level. <br/><br/>Rating: 6/10 Read more at http://passpopcorn.wordpress.com/"
"callanvass","7","0","3","1 October 2013"," Overlong, but an engaging and enjoyable start for the franchise
","Like most adaptations from books. I've yet to read any, so this was the first time I was exposed to anything Hunger Games related. I actually dug this movie for the most part. It has stylish direction, as well as excellent acting, especially from Jennifer Lawrence. Her strong performance as Kitniss was a main reason as to why I enjoyed this movie so much. I must also commend the somewhat audacious subject matter. Other than Battle Royale, I can't think of any other films that have dared to have teens killing each other. The Hunger Games also has some solid character development. I dug the subtle relationship between Jennifer Lawrence & Josh Hutcherson. It did a good job of making us care about them, and their fate. Credit must be given to the action scenes as well, which were quite enthralling at times. The Hunger Games has plenty of tension and suspense. I didn't expect much when going into this one, despite the rabid fan base. I ended up being very surprised by how much I liked it. It is flawed and a bit overlong, but overall I enjoyed it very much. I'm looking forward to Catching Fire<br/><br/>Rating: 7.5/10"

","To protect her younger sister, Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) volunteers to take part in The Hunger Games. This is a televised battle where twenty-four teenagers – two from each of the districts of Panem – are forced to fight each other to the death. Blessed with incredible archery skills, Katniss uses all her resources and luck to try and make it to the end.<br/><br/>When I first heard about this movie getting made, I rolled my eyes. It just seemed like Hollywood was looking to piggyback on the success of the Twilight saga by bringing yet another teen novel franchise to the big screen. And let's face it, they were piggybacking. But, and this is a big but, 'The Hunger Games' defied all my expectations.<br/><br/>I'll be honest, if this film was just okay, I'd have been pleasantly surprised. The fact that it's actually brilliant is a slap in the face. You have a very strong plot and story – while I don't think the film properly explains the reason behind why this barbaric event takes place, it's a very interesting concept. There are also the obvious connections to 'Battle Royale', but 'Battle Royale' paid more attention to the blood and the violence. 'The Hunger Games' pays much more attention to character development and the emotional drama.<br/><br/>That's not to say the violence wasn't good. In fact, the violence was extremely well-directed. That very first action sequence when the Games start is a visceral pleasure, enhanced by shaky camera effects and a lack of music. Director Gary Ross is equally adept at handling these violent scenes as he is at getting us to engage with the characters on screen.<br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence is one of my favourite actors right now, and she proves why in this film. Katniss Everdeen is very similar to the character Lawrence plays in 'Winter's Bone' (for which she was nominated for an Oscar): a young girl who is mature beyond her years, with an entire family dependent on her. Katniss cannot afford to show emotion or weakness; all she can do is carry on living, and carry on supporting her family. It makes her cold and distant, but it also makes her a survivor. Lawrence exudes all of these things perfectly. While the outcome of the movie is obviously very predictable, it's the journey she goes on that appeals. She's surrounded by a cast of great actors (Elizabeth Banks, Stanley Tucci and Woody Harrelson stand out), but this is all about Lawrence.<br/><br/>Like most films, 'The Hunger Games' is probably far too long. Half an hour could have been shaved off and it would have been perfect. But it is on the longer side, and that's a small price to pay, I suppose. But what makes it more grating is that, despite the long running time, a lot of stuff isn't explained enough. It makes me want to read the books (which is good, I guess), but the film should not unwittingly leave you with questions.<br/><br/>'The Hunger Games' is a brilliant film, and I am genuinely interested in seeing the sequel, and where the character of Katniss Everdeen goes next."

","I have not read the Hunger Games books, so I cannot compare the film to the book, but I really enjoyed it. The acting was also very good.<br/><br/>It is set in the future where is there is a competition called ""The Hunger Games"" when a boy and a girl from each district, there are twelve, are chosen to fight to death. The movie is about a girl named Katniss Everdeen, who's younger sister is chosen to take part in The Hunger Games. She then volunteers to take part instead of her sister, and the film is about her journey.<br/><br/>It's like a game show, it's broadcast on T.V.'s across the districts. The contestants are also interviewed and shown off before they start the games, so they can get sponsors who help them by giving them things they need, e.g. medicine or a bandage.<br/><br/>So overall I thought it was one of my favourite films from 2012 and I gave it 9 out of 10."

","I must admit I had some issues with the movie but I still can't understand all the negative reviews. The first time I watched it the action seemed a bit slow and the idea of the love triangle was pissing me off. Moreover, the boys seemed somewhat cheesy and stupid. I haven't read the books at the time but I wasn't disappointed. It seemed OK for a teen movie. I'd prefer kids to watch The Hunger Games instead of Twilight. At least you have an idea in the first one. <br/><br/>Some months later a very good friend of mine recommended the books and she was very enthusiastic about them and very critical towards the movie(especially the fact that it didn't represent the feelings of Katniss accurately).<br/><br/>So I decided to give the book a try. I was fascinated. The language was poor, it wasn't a masterpiece of literature but I felt very drawn to the idea. I was moved by it. I read the books for one or two days . Then I watched the movie again. Yes, some of my favorite scenes were missing. For example, when Rue dies and District 11 sends Katniss a piece of bread, as far as I remember with the sign of a mockingjay on it, which was the first case of a district sending something to another district's victor. It was touching. You can see the reaction of the ""other"" public. Also, you don't get the protagonist's emotions and thoughts that much if you haven't read the book. <br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence makes a fine Katniss. However, if you ask me, her acting skills are a little bit overrated. I honestly think she didn't deserve that Oscar but that's a different topic. Gale and Peeta are exactly what they must be. I said I found them cheesy and stupid before reading the books and now I know that this was the whole point. Katniss is just not that attracted to either of them. The actors who play Rue, Effie and Caesar are all great. Lenny Kravitz is perfect for Cinna, exactly what I imagined while reading the books. <br/><br/>The first movie is not nearly as important as the other two and I can't wait to see how they will turn out to be. I gave it a 7/10 and I consider it a nice movie even though it has some problems."

","I put off watching this for ages and couldn't decide because reviews were either ""it's amazing"" or ""it's the worst film ever"".<br/><br/>It's not the worst film ever.<br/><br/>If you're a fan of the books (I haven't read any) then you'll love this no doubt. If, like me, you had never heard of this before then you will likely think the film was good but too clichÃ©d.<br/><br/>I think if the next film has a much bigger budget and they make it more 'Transformer-ish' in terms of slickness in the production then it might be a lot more exciting.<br/><br/>I watched it when bored and I didn't turn it off. I have seen a LOT of films though so I'm quite cynical of films that repeat what has gone before.<br/><br/>Well worth watching but you won't rave about it if you haven't read the books.<br/><br/>6/10"
"Lopez06-761-84127","7","0","2","10 August 2013"," Better Than Average, but not Great
","As a fan of the series, I would have to say that ""The Hunger Games"" succeeds in some ways beyond the others because of one thing, or one person, and that is the actress Jennifer Lawrence.<br/><br/>She's an interesting young actor. I've only seen her in a few films, but found her always believable. If you replace her in ""The Hunger Games,"" with someone who was originally considered for the role of Katniss (Abigail Breslin, Saoirse Ronan, or Emma Roberts for example), it's difficult to say the film would work as well as it does. Not that those other actresses aren't talented, or couldn't do a good job in the role, it's just that Lawrence seems to be perfect casting and she runs with the film. She really anchors the film by underplaying. Also when her insecurities and unlikable characteristics surface, her movements and line readings come across as completely genuine.<br/><br/>The same can't be said about most of the other major players, particularly Wes Bently as Seneca, Elizabeth Banks as Effie, Stanley Tucci as Caesar, and Woody Harrelson as Haymitch. Although Harrelson at least has a bit of a character arc, he and the others mostly play their characters in broad strokes, often the problem in these dystopian films. Donald Sutherland as the president fares a bit better, but his role is written that way. Josh Hutcherson as Peeta, the boy from Katniss' district 12, unfortunately doesn't succeed in making us deeply care for him or make us buy Katniss' affection for him. It's difficult to say what it is about him, because his performance isn't bad at all. Perhaps he was miscast. He just lacks something that would make me warm to him. His scenes with Lawrence seem to lack the needed chemistry to ignite the on screen romance.<br/><br/>What did work far better, however, was Katniss' relationship with Rue, played by Amandla Stenberg. Rue's demise was the only one to elicit emotion in me. Although Rue is still not much developed as a character, she's a nice surrogate little sister for Katniss. Script-wise this works because we already understand Katniss has special warm feelings for Primrose, her younger sister (Willow Shields), having taken her place as her district's female tribute for the games. Stenberg is so remarkably cute that we can't help but fall for her. Her demise is sad indeed, and given weight by the well of emotion from Lawrence.<br/><br/>The rest of the tributes are undeveloped, just bodies to get knocked off one by one. This is a film that could have used more time to develop them. That would have upped the stakes if we understood them better. I've never read the book, but I would imagine they are developed further in it. The script was very manipulative in how the announcements kept changing the game rules right up to the last minute. Too little explanation is given, and that is just sloppy movie making."
"mardebae-761-90875","8","0","4","10 August 2013"," Good movie, but could have been better
","As a movie, it remained faithful to the story, despite the changes for cinematic purposes, more-so than other book-to-movie adaptations. <br/><br/>However, despite following the book closely, the character development in the movie was lacking, especially for Peeta and Haymitch, despite great performances by Josh Hutcherson and Woody Harrelson. They captured the essence of their character perfectly, but weren't given much to work with.<br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence was great as Katniss and her performance was very believable and not at all trite (say compared to the performances in Twilight). However, the character development of Katniss in the movie is different from the book. In the movie, she's very sullen and serious and almost cold, while in the book, she was also funny with a sarcastic, dry humor and she was less sure of what she is doing in the games. <br/><br/>AS for the screenplay, I did love the addition of Snow and Seneca Crane and the behind the scenes of the Games. However, despite following the chronology of the story closely, it missed a lot of the themes and messaging in the books. The screenplay merely depicted the Games as a horrible reality show, but never really showed the social justice issues tackled in the books. I think they missed a real good opportunity by not explaining the tessarae system more explicitly and they should have followed the books more closely on why the Capitol was forced to change the rules to allow TWO tributes from the same district to win. District 11 rioting didn't make much sense when young tributes have died in the games many times before.<br/><br/>Technically, the special effects and the shaky cam action were atrocious. The arena and District 12 scenery were good, but the world building of the Capitol was underwhelming. I would loved to have seen the futuristic technologies of the Capitol mentioned in the book on screen. In the first Harry Potter movie, the best thing about it was seeing Diagon Alley and Hogwarts come to life, and I hope for the same in this movie. The costumes were also sub-par. I think they spent all their costume budget on Effie, as she was the only one who looked and sounded like true Capitolite in the movie."
"MattyGibbs","8","0","5","4 August 2013"," Much much better than I thought it would be.
","I am 40 and have never heard of the book and not being a massive fan of Jennifer Lawrence had little desire to see the film. The premise seems quite similar to Battle Royale, a film I enjoyed a lot so on a whim I decided to see what it was like. <br/><br/>I was aware that this was only a 12A so would be a watered down version but I prefer to make my own mind up about a film not blindly knock a film because it's seen as 'uncool' or not specifically aimed at my age or gender bracket. <br/><br/>The film boasts an excellent cast and Jennifer Lawrence is slowly winning me around. She was perfect for this role. Donald Sutherland and Wes Bentley also put in good performances. <br/><br/>The Hunger Games grabbed me early on and the set up explained the set up well which made it a lot easier to follow what was going on. People have complained at the slow build up but I found it to be necessary in this instance. In any case although it may have lacked action for me it was never boring. <br/><br/>The film has a fair amount of tension and whilst the deaths are understandably not gory it doesn't hinder the film too much. If you're looking for gore then stay away from 12A films. This is a story led film and it tells it's a story told very well. <br/><br/>This is an impressive film, forget what the self appointed trendies say. It's easy to sit behind a computer and criticize to make yourself feel more important. There really isn't anything bad you can say about this film. It's targeted at a certain audience who judging by the films success were more than happy with the end result and ultimately that's what counts. <br/><br/>The Hunger Games took me by surprise at how enjoyable and well made it is. It isn't as good as Battle Royale but it's aiming at a different audience. If you watch it with an open mind you may enjoy it as much as I did."
"amberm18","6","0","3","4 August 2013"," Doesn't stand alone from the book.
","I hadn't read any of the books when I watched the movie, then around 6months later I read the books and rewatched the movie. I have to say that the adaptation was pretty mediocre. For a film to reach a wide audience it's important that they make sure to add in relevant material from the books so that people know what's going on. The first time I saw the movie I was a bit lost, I liked the characters but there wasn't a whole lot of backstory and I didn't understand some of the motivations properly. I'll break down the main differences from book to movie.<br/><br/>-Checking in to the reaping with a blood test. Completely unnecessary, wasn't in the book, didn't add much to the story aside from taking up a minute that could have been put towards explaining something else.<br/><br/>-Tertiary? I think it was called in the books. They didn't properly explain how horrific it was that her sister was called out, because every year kids can put their names in multiple times for more food the following year. Prim only had the 1 ticket. Gale who didn't get picked, had his name in there over 40 times.<br/><br/>-Mockingjay pin. The character that was lost didn't add too much, so that was an acceptable cut. But I think by not explaining the origin of the mockingjay bird and how it's mocking the empire, takes away a small bit of the defiance that she's showing by wearing it, and how much it inspires people and later becomes a symbol of the resistance. Perhaps this will be in the next movie.<br/><br/>-Katniss's internalizations. The entire first book is carried by Katniss's thoughts and experiences. It's very hard without having her voice-over her thoughts, to portray this in a movie, and so we missed a lot of story and her motivations at different times. This is my main issue with the movie and the reason it doesn't stand alone to someone that didn't read the story first.<br/><br/>-Peeta teaming up with the careers. Katniss never even asks him why he was with them, they never discuss it. In fact in the movie he is telling them where she was going because he tracked her snares. This is the opposite of the book, where he does it to mislead them and keep her safe, downplaying what her skills are. He doesn't lead them to her on purpose.<br/><br/>-A lot of people complain that you don't know most of the other tributes names. This is somewhat better explained in the book because you are following Katniss and she is just keeping a low profile during training, and doesn't talk to anyone or show what she can do. She doesn't learn their names because it makes them harder to kill.<br/><br/>-One thing you definitely don't realize if you watch it first - Katniss is internally preparing to kill Peeta the second they get on the train. She doesn't want to talk to him or get to know him in anyway whatsoever. In the movies it looks like she does slowly return his love and the end looks promising for them. But in reality, what makes her such a strong character in the books is that she literally has no second of time to think about Gale or Peeta or dresses or who she likes. She's 100% geared towards survival and getting food to her family. She breaks Peetas heart at the end of the first book by telling him she just went along with it to win, and she damn well means it at that time.<br/><br/>-The district riot did not make a lot of sense to me after I watched the books. When Rue dies, district 11 gathers money and buys her a loaf of bread to send into the games as a thank you. It's much much later in book 2 when she is actually visiting district 11 that a riot starts there. A district riot does start after the games in the first book, but it wasn't in district 11.<br/><br/>Overall to recap, I thought it was pretty mediocre the first time I saw it. The books held my interest a bit better, and I found myself liking the movie a lot more the second time after reading it, but only because I finally had all those gaps filled in. To make a movie impossible to understand for someone that didn't read the book is simply inexcusable."

","This was the movie of the year (my opinion). Not only because the actors, but also for the story. This movie brings us for a new Age were we are chosen with a purpose: fight for our district and win. The story is centered in a girl named Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) and a boy named Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) that gonna to the arena as a double. With everything left behind (family, friends...) they have to win if they want back home. There are 2 problems: the first is that just one can be winner, the second is that are 12 districts (they are the 12th) and if for each district will be 2 persons fighting so they have to win against 22 (without themselves). Is a film that brings a desire to see again. Perfect!"

","Many people compare this movie to Battle Royal, I am not going to. I like this movie for what it is in itself. It's dark, it's exciting and it's breathtaking. <br/><br/>Katniss Everdeen is trying to survive a life of poverty in District twelve. She lives there with her little sister and mother struggling to be the breadwinner in the family when the worst thing that could happen, happens - her sister is being randomly picked to fight till death in the 74. annual Hunger Games, a game of which only one out of 24 young kids can survive. She enters the games and from there on out it really is ""game on"".<br/><br/>This move is critical to our society, were we use and abuse the less fortunate to be able to live our luxury lives in the western, modern world. And if your thoughts about that subject reaches further down than a thimble you will also see that connection. <br/><br/>I like the way they have portrayed The Capitol (the city that runs everything), it is a superficial world where appearance is on top of the list. There are a few sci-fi elements, and that is because the filmmakers wants to make a point out of the fact that this is a setting in the near future. Some of the scenes are majestic, and makes you hold your breath. The cast is very good, although I hope I get to see Jennifer Lawrence, who plays Katniss, relaxes into her role a bit more in the sequel. And that is also why I gave 7 out of 10. It could have been and eight if she was a little better at portraying Katniss Everdeen, but in that case it really helps that the very talented Woody Harrelson plays one of the characters closest to Katniss as her coach.<br/><br/>All in all, it's great entertainment on a Saturday night tucked under the blankets with some chips and coke to nibble and sip on. Enjoy!"
"smijatov89","7","0","4","22 July 2013"," A thrilling adaptation
","While I am no fan of ""The Hunger Games"" books - nor did I really hear about them until the film came out - and I took a whole year to actually get to watch the film, I must admit it is quite good. As a matter of fact, I am quite shocked at how good it is. In my head it was somewhat of a ""Twilight"" phenomenon, so I discarded it immediately. However, it was misguided. ""The Hunger Games"" has an interesting premise, and a rather well thought out idea. The screenplay is well written and it achieves to keep one fully immersed into the film, and provides necessary thrills throughout the entirety of the film. I was so absorbed and intensely connecting with the characters, I got acid reflux from all the tension. Oh, no, I am not joking. <br/><br/>Anyhow, the technicalities of the film need no discussion, really. A film with such a huge budget will make sure to clean up nicely and ""The Hunger Games"" is no different. The performances were, surprisingly, quite convincing and were not forced. Jennifer Lawrence is pitch-perfect as the leading lady, and all the supporting cast does a good job. I was especially stricken by the emotional connection with, and performance by the young Amandla Stenberg. It is sad we will not be seeing her in the second instalment of the series, but what can one do.<br/><br/>Overall, it was a real pleasure to watch this film. Not only did it deliver unexpected thrills (at least unexpected to me), but it also managed to take the audience into that dystopic world of the future. How dystopic it really is is another question to be asked, especially in light of reality television and its ever-brutal entrance into the real lives of people. Quite often with dubious ethical, moral and taste breaches that leave one baffled."
"donuthaters12","7","0","3","30 June 2013"," Superficially entetaining and thematically deep
","The Hunger Games was one of the films in 2012 I expected to be a disaster but hoped that it was carfted well. My hypothesis of the film was clearly wrong and my hopes for the film was very much proved right.<br/><br/>The plot of this film is very simple allowing audiences to be interested and earn the studios some profit. Though it is not the film's plot that made me, for the most part, enjoyed this film but it is the film's themes of political and commercial manipulation to ensure the peace and cooperation within the Capitol and the twelve districts. So much of this film reminds me of Ridley Scott's Gladiator as it also incorporates the importance of winning the audience as a tool of surviving in the arena. The film's focus on romance drew me out for a bit as it felt a little tiresome, though it's use in pleasing the sponsors was very interesting.<br/><br/>Gary Ross' direction is, for the most part, great. He really seems to understand the source material and accurately and entertainingly transfers Suzanne Collins novel to the screen. Ross has chosen to create a gloomy atmosphere in showcasing the districts and the world of Panem. Though the Capitol is almost the complete opposite of the twelve districts; Ross still maintains that depressing feel when displaying the Capitol by showing that these people, who root and applaud for the chosen tributes, are animals who wants to see these children destroy themselves for their entertaining (Something that is also similar to Gladiator). I am happy with Ross' decisions and direction but there is one area where I found him a bit weak at and that is the action. The action sequences in this film didn't entertain or excite me as it should have. They feel generic and lackluster, though the scene with Katniss running in the flaming forest was done well.<br/><br/>The cinematographer for this film was Tom Stern, who usually is found as the DP of Clint Eastwood films. Stern knows how to create a mood with his photography, Gran Torino and Million Dollar Baby, and he successfully does that for The Hunger Games. The colors are muted and has this blue hue that fills the image, particularly in shots of District 12. The Capitol on the other hand is captured with breathtaking wide shots and fantastic lighting. There was a particular moment in the film where Katniss is hallucinating from the Tracker Jackers, this moment was created excellently. There will be a few people who will find the shaky cam to be too overbearing and frequent but it did not bother me so much.<br/><br/>The pacing of this film was handled excellently with fast cuts that move the film along at a pace that does not slow the film down or bore the audience. I feel that this film should have some sort of extended cut or director's cut to show a little more with Donald Sutherland's character to set him up much more for the next installment.<br/><br/>One of the film's main highlights is the production design of the film which to me feels very inspired by the Romans and made me think back of films like Gladiator. The Capitol's design draws similarities to Rome in Ridley Scott's Gladiator. The costumes and make up in this film is very wild and eccentric and I think fits very well and not at all distracting.<br/><br/>James Newton Howard's score fits well with the film's tone and setting. I hate coming back to this but again I found certain segments of his score to resemble Hans Zimmer's score in Gladiator. The score never at a point dominated a moment which made me stop and adore but it I did notice it's presence and fit well with the film.<br/><br/>Now the actors in the other hand are a bit polarizing with me as the leads I found to be a little disappointing. Jennifer Lawrence portrays Katniss passable enough that she wouldn't be seen as the down side among the actors in this film. I felt that she, and also Josh Hutcherson, did not show the emotions that I hoped they would experience given their situation. These two were placed in a horrible situation that may result in death and somehow they don't convey any signs of anxiety, fear or anger. It felt that they went straight to acceptance. I would have appreciated it if they showed it even a little so it won't affect too much of the character. Hutcherson in my opinion is the weakest link and the main reason why I felt chemistry was a bit lacking between him and Lawrence. He doesn't seem to be in touch with his character and at the same can't challenge Lawrence's acting. Though the moments with Katniss and Rue, Lawrence did these scenes perfectly and shown the protagonist's vulnerability. In the supporting cast, there were some scene stealers and these were Woody Harrelson as Haymitch and Elizabeth Banks as Effie. They are spot on with their comedy and hit their marks when they deliver their lines. Harrelson embodies this troubles soul so deeply that you are really convinced that Woody may actually just be playing his regular self. Liam Hemsworth, i felt was not in the screen long enough to actually show his relevance but this may change in the sequels. Lenny Kravitz did fine but nothing noteworthy. Donald Sutherland should have been used more in this film as he is truly, i felt, is the main protagonist and still will be in the upcoming sequels. At the end, Sutherland felt menacing and dark which gladly sets up his goal in the next film.<br/><br/>The film's plot may be simple but it's use of symbolism is great. Beautiful cinematography, excellent pacing, spot on score, and fine acting ensures that this film is definitely worth a watch at least twice or own on home media."

","This movie was pretty okay, however the camera shook a lot and that bothered me. <br/><br/>After discussing the movie with a group of Hunger Games fans on my facebook page, we all agreed that the movie could have been so much better. The mutts should have had the dead tributes faces like in the book, and Katniss should have gotten the mockingjay pin from Madge, who is not in the movie what so ever.<br/><br/>As a fan of the books, I was pretty disappointed that the movie did not follow the book all that well. I was really hoping to see who would play Madge Undersee, but sadly she was cut from the movie. <br/><br/>Another thing that angered my friends and I, was that Effie Trinkets name was NEVER mentioned in the movie.<br/><br/>I gave this movie an 8 because I really enjoyed the casting for the characters."

","THE HUNGER GAMES<br/><br/>I was not very eager to see this. I saw the trailer and thought it looked just like a rip off of one of my favourite foreign movies, Battle Royale.<br/><br/>It had it's similar parts, but in the most part it made the story it's own.<br/><br/>The film is about a TV show called the Hunger Games. Every year 2 people from different areas have to compete in the games... they have no choice. 24 people are in an area and must fight to the death until there is only one person left alive.<br/><br/>The film centres around one character from District 12, Katniss. She is a talented hunter which definitely helps her with the Games... but she has a nightmare along the way.<br/><br/>The acting was actually quite good. There were a lot of good actors in this movie... some I had heard of before and some that are new to me. Katniss was played by Jennifer Lawrence. I had only ever seen her in X- Men First Class. She was good in that, and she was good in this also. Other cast members are Woody Harrelson, Josh Hutcherson, Liam Hemsworth, Elizabeth Banks, Lenny Kravitz, Stanley Tucci & Donald Sutherland.<br/><br/>I am a big Woody Harrelson fan... he is in one of my favourite films ever... Natural Born Killers. I didn't know he was in this until I watched it... it was a good surprise.<br/><br/>The characters are great. I love the look of the film and the characters. Their make-up and costumes were awesome. They reminded me in a way of a Tim Burton movie. They were colourful but creepy. The effects were really good too.<br/><br/>The action was really good, but a bit gory for kids. My 12 year old daughter watched it and I thought it was a bit harsh for her. She was fine though and loved the film. I really enjoyed the action. There was some amazing fighting scenes. It was well choreographed and put together.<br/><br/>I will give this film 7 out of 10.<br/><br/>It was very enjoyable and I am looking forward to Catching Fire.<br/><br/>If you would like to read more of my reviews, please like my Facebook page:<br/><br/>https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=tn_tnmn"
"Dancefever94-561-396391","7","0","2","10 June 2013"," good film but doesn't follow the book enough
","I love the books, I think they're brilliant but I don't think the first film adapted to the book as much as it should have. Don't get me wrong the film is good but they missed some vital stuff from the book, for example; the pin wasn't given to her by the old women (greasy sae) but by Madge, in the second book this scene plays a quite vital part.<br/><br/>Also the trilogy plays on the budding romance between the two main characters but I don't think they showed that in the film enough. The flashback of their first meeting (the bread being thrown) I thought was brilliant, the way they did it was just what I had in mind while reading it. The other scenes though between them I though weren't strong enough, the romance started the day the bread was thrown well from his side of it anyway, they didn't add the dandelion part in which showed that she was hopeful and peaceful at the time. This may sound strange to those who haven't read the books but that dandelion should have played a major role.<br/><br/>Also, the cave scene I thought could have been better, there wasn't enough romance between them. I know the film isn't supposed to be a romance but it plays a seriously strong role in all the books, its what shaped the second and third book. The scene in the cave was mostly about them coming clean about their feelings for each other, the kiss was outstanding, it was brilliantly staged in the situation of the scene.<br/><br/>Overall I think the film is definitely worth watching but the books are a serious must have especially if you plan on watching the next two films, it will help a lot."

","Last night I decided to watch ""The Hunger Games"" on Amazon Prime in my home theater. A couple years ago I was a full time student at a private college I transferred to where we were given ""The Hunger Games"" book as an acceptance gift. I hate reading books and sadly never even skimmed through THG. I remember saying to a friend in these exact words, ""I think I'll wait for the movie"". Little did I know were we supposed to read the book and would have a dinner with the dean of the college to discuss it! Anyway, 2012 hit and this movie came out. Unfortunately with the release of so many other good movies (The Avengers, Spiderman, etc.) I passed on seeing this film. I finally sat down last night and decided to see what the hype was about. Despite having the book and so forth, I had absolutely no clue what ""The Hunger Games"" was remotely about. Only that is was a very popular best-selling book. I was very hesitant and skeptical at first about watching this movie. But in the end, I'm glad I did and I really enjoyed it!<br/><br/>Without going into great detail about the story, I have to say I found THG to be a fantastic film from start to finish. The story is very deep and compelling. The whole concept of this movie is very interesting. We think of children so lightly in our society today; to think of throwing innocent children into a battle arena for entertainment, it's just insane. Albeit the concept is incredible, I have to agree with other reviewers on here whom have read the book. Being a PG-13 movie, it seems that they slightly cherry-coated the death/slaughter of of the children. I think this movie would have been more powerful if they turned up the dial on the violence. But I understand that the movie is PG-13 and aimed towards teenagers, so in other ways it made sense to keep the violence i a certain minimum. Jennifer Lawrence was phenomenal in this film. She is a great, dramatic actress who fit the role perfectly. It felt like Hollywood picked someone this time with talent before looks (although she is very cute). She absolutely blows away (in terms of acting) people like Megan Fox and Anne Hathaway who often give a stale performance and are there for eye candy more. Previously I was not a fan of hers from the media/spotlight that surrounds her, but I have to say I really enjoyed her work in this film. She is also the same age as me and for the level her work is at, it's just incredible. (also by the laws of man I have to ask, Jennifer Lawrence will you go on a date with me?)<br/><br/>Besides the toned down violence, my only other complaints - I could tell that a lot was crammed into this movie to make it work. It seemed like the contestants/characters each could have had more back story (which from what I read online they did in the novel). Also, the ending was flat-out predictable. Other than that, fantastic film. Excellent camera work mixed with traditional (non-digital) film (which we rarely see anymore) combined with epic IMAX shots. The soundtrack was fantastic and the rest of the cast perfectly complimented Jennifer Lawrence's performance. Hollywood has a bright future with the new ensemble of actors who were in this film. I give ""The Hunger Games"" an 8/10. It's not a game changer and young males/elderly viewers in particular maybe turned off from it. I'm a guy but in no way did I find this film negative, bad, or ""pro-feminist"". And although it has kids in in, it no way did it feel like a kids movie. It just felt like a good movie with a solid lead actress, almost reminding me Sigourney Weaver in the Alien franchise. If you like sci fi and want a good story telling, heart pounding movie, this film has it. and I am already considering seeing the sequels on the big screen!"
"Rebe_gonzalez","8","0","4","8 June 2013"," A good movie
","""The Hunger Games"" By: Rebeca Gonzalez Few months ago, I watched the movie ""The Hunger Games"" directed by Gary Ross and based on a novel, with the same name, by Suzanne Collins. To start I would like to say that I am a huge fan of the book and therefore I would like to give out my opinion in regards of the things I liked about the movie and at the same time the things that I disliked about it. It is a movie that contains action, adventure and science fiction all at once, and due to that the audience can easily either feel a connection with the movie right away or simply don't like it at all. The movie is based on government's oppression towards the population. The movie takes place in the ruins of a nation known as Panem, a place once known as North America, where twelve districts are manipulated by a shining Capitol. Long ago, the districts waged war on the Capitol, showing their rebellious desperation towards their oppression, but they were defeated by the Capitol. As part of the surrender terms, each district agreed to send as tribute, one girl and one boy to appear in an annual television event called ""The Hunger Games"", a fight to death on live television. Sixteen year-old Katniss Everdeen, (Jennifer Lawrence) who lives with her mother and sister, regards it as a death sentence when she is forced to represent her district in the Games along with Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson).The terrain, rules, and level of audience participation may change but one thing is constant: kill or be killed. Even though the book and the movie present differences in regards of the cast, both main characters portray exactly what both author and director wanted. In one hand Katniss is presented as a simple girl that is trying to protect her family, which considers herself one of the rest, which in the other hand, Peeta struggles to get what he wants and at the same time try to fully represent his district. The main difference is that in the book, their situation, as teenagers that have to struggle with death and love is more precise and you know exactly each though they have, while in the movie, you as the audience, have to infer their feelings and try to keep up with their situation. Even though the main characters did a good job in portraying their role, other secondary actors didn't such as Effie Trinket, due to the fact that the audience can see how fake her character is, and at the same time how over reacting her expressions are. Every movie has its ups and downs and despite the fact that I enjoyed the movie, there are several things I didn't like and actually liked. One of the things that cached my attention the most was the colors they used in every scene. Every scene had a particular color, and that was used to demonstrate the feelings and situation each character was going through. In matter of fact, an example would be the costumes the Capitol residents used versus the color of costumes the district residents had. For example, the scene where Effie is about to pronounce the tributes, everybody is wearing neutral colors, such as white or gray, while she is wearing a striking purple. As I mentioned before, her fake expressions and striking colors were just elements the director used to emphasize all the attention on her and at the same time make her represent the wealthy class rather than the lower- oppressed class. In the contrary, one of the things that I disliked the most about the movie was that the director emphasized much more on details rather than major scenes. My point here is that the director rushed through the movie. The main objective of the movie should have been the one of giving relevance to the title, but instead more than half of the movie is based on teenagers being chosen to represent their district. The point here is that the interesting parts such as the teenagers struggling and fighting for survival was rushed, so the audience had no time to experiment their situation. The setting of the movie, especially the one in the woods was amazing. The setting helped the audience understand the difficulties the actors had and also revealed the qualities each had in the movie. One of the best scenes in the movie was when Katniss, still fighting for survival, demonstrated the authorities that they might have power, but she still has emotions and respect for the other districts, and no matter what they would do to her, she stood up and proved them wrong. The strong dispute between the rebellious populations towards the Capitol is what makes the movie interesting. The fact that they are fighting for survival, to cause joy to the wealthy ones, and the fact that they have to make choices in regards of their death, just to represent their district, are the main things that makes the audience like the movie, and actually connect with it. Sometimes the message is much more important than the image, as it can be seen in ""The Hunger Games"". The movie managed to show the audience that instead of fighting with authority, we have to work with it, because they are what sustains us and leads us to the future. I support the PG 13 rating the movie received, but I would rate this movie with an R. Even though the movie doesn't gloss over or sugarcoat anything for their audience, there is violence presented throughout. The movie deals with themes such as survival, oppression, governmental control, grief and resignation, so despite the fact that there is little graphical violence, there is no way a kid could understand the reality in which the actors are placed in and the strong criticism the movie is demonstrating.

"mike-wright-1","6","0","3","4 June 2013"," Could have been great
","This is a review of the Hunger Games movie. Not a review of how good an adaptation of the book Hunger Games is.<br/><br/>The Hunger Games is clearly a film with a primary target audience. So any criticism should be mindful of that. The fact that it is a targeted film yet remains eminently watchable for people outside that demographic is to its huge credit.<br/><br/>I think most people by now know the basic story so I won't go into that. The strengths of the film lie in its tremendous premise and the back story around it (accusations of plagiarism in relation to Battle Royale are harsh). Also the performance of Jennifer Lawrence is a powerhouse and she has a wonderful career in front of her. The action scenes are filmed very sympathetically, leaving you in no doubt of the horror that is happening without really showing anything to compromise the target audience.<br/><br/>The film does fall down in a couple of areas though. It seems completely unaware of some of the powerful themes it has at its disposal. Not nearly enough was shown of the relationship between the populace of the Capital and the outer districts. Perhaps this is dealt with more in later instalments. The characterisation of the tributes was also thin on the ground, and the idea of the games as a true test of skill, endurance, psychology etc was massively underdeveloped. Perhaps this was deliberate to show that the organisers were obsessed with controlling the action. If it was, then I would say it was a mistake.<br/><br/>Overall I think the film is quite a rarity. It has some wonderful ideas and although enjoyable, it feels like it was reined in to ensure it met its target audience. It's arguable that in movie making, there are few greater crimes."
"chucknorrisrules","8","0","3","2 June 2013"," Intense, exciting and enjoyable
","First of all I'm going to start by saying that I have not read the books, so I can't comment on how close the movie resembles them.<br/><br/>The Hunger Games begins in the future. Nuclear war and rebellion ruined mankind whose society in America was rebuilt into a new Orwellian nightmare where people slave away in prison camps with no freedom. As a punishment from the authorities for rebellion, each of the 12 districts (1 being the richest and 12 being the poorest) have to fight it out in a battle royale called the Hunger Games, a modern version of Gladiatorial combat or Mandingo Fighting with a bit of Bear Grylls survival thrown in for good measure.<br/><br/>When a girl is picked as the female participant or ""tribute"" of her district, her older sister - played by the wonderful Jennifer Lawrence - volunteers to take her place. After preparation, training, advertisement to various potential sponsors and an Olympic-esque opening ceremony, the participants are released to fight for survival.<br/><br/>The film is very much 1984 crossed with Lord of the Flies, and has a strong cast. Jennifer Lawrence plays the role well as a strong character albeit with a vulnerability. Unlike most other participants, she is not a typical ""action girl"" but simply uses her wit to survive. The rest of the cast is excellent and the settings immersing and atmosphere intense. But also it is very clever in its portrayal of a nightmareish totalitarian society where freedom is nonexistent, and how far we would go in surviving in such a society. Very much worth your time!"
"tolga_fb1997","9","0","3","26 May 2013"," I think;
","Simply, many over the age of 18 read these books and loved them, and it wasn't because there was a girl, a boy, and another boy in a love story. It was about an awful political system where children faced to the death for their survival with awful paragraphs of cruel brutality. This is part of what made the book unique. The movie, was an attempt to draw a crowd like Twilight for money, and completely blurred out children killing each other to survive so that it could be made PG13. Ridiculous. Jennifer Lawerence is an perfect actress though, and she did a great job. Throughout the movie I was never convinced that she lived in district 12 nearly starving..."

","The special effects and acting in this film are brilliant. The scene where Katniss goes up in the tube to enter the arena is my favourite. She acts the scene perfectly and allows the audience to feel the emotions that she is feeling which makes the film all the more gripping. I think that the way the book has been portrayed in the film is brilliant. All of the actors chosen fit the profiles perfectly and act their parts fantastically. I think that the costumes and makeup in the movie are done the way readers of the book imagined them, both futuristic and realistic.

","I'm a huge fan of The Hunger Games trilogy of books, so it was only natural for me to want to go see the movie when it came out in theaters. I went to go see it on the opening weekend, and I wasn't disappointed but not quite satisfied either.<br/><br/>I think they more or less cast the actors right, and I was happy with the acting, especially Jennifer Lawrence's who perfectly portrayed Katniss as I pictured her when I was reading the books. Also, I was surprised by how good the Capitol costumes turned out to be on screen. There were exciting parts in the arena (during the bloodbath) and I was glad with how they filmed the last act with the last 3 tributes fighting on top of the Cornucopia.<br/><br/>However, I think they could've incorporated Madge in the movie, instead of Katniss just finding the Mockingjay pin at the Hob. Madge was one of my favorite characters and I was let down when I found out she wouldn't be in the movie. Also, the muttations. I had always pictured them as ferocious wolves, but not quite as big bulldogs...<br/><br/>The book was very thrilling and I couldn't put it down when I was reading it for the first time. To me, the movie didn't capture all the exciting aspects and suspense but as any other fan of a novel, I know that you couldn't possibly fit every single detail in a 2 hour slot of a film.<br/><br/>I found the movie entertaining, and even though I wasn't completely glad with how the final product looked like, it stayed more or less true to the book which is the most important thing."
"Rishad","8","0","3","17 May 2013"," A stylish and sensitive adaptation of a complex young adult novel
","This film came out last year, and I grabbed a copy at the library last week. I knew a little bit about the back story, but made it a point not to oversteep myself in the story before watching it, because I'd heard good things. In a nutshell, it's set in a post-Apocalyptic North America. Most of the population has been wiped out, except for a large wealthy centralized city, with smaller populations in widespread districts who are forced to pledge allegiance. In order to maintain political control, the authorities enforce food rationing by way of brutal televised games involving children from the various districts. The games involve fights to the death out in the wild, ""Survivor"" style, until a final winner is declared and their district is allotted food rations.<br/><br/>Although the original novel is targeted at teens and young adults, I found the material rich and complex enough to satisfy older viewers. Themes of conflict, loyalty, betrayal, heroism, political intrigue, as well as a little bit of teen angst, are all composed against the backdrop of a constant fight to survive. The film has Jennifer Lawrence, Josh Hutcherson, Woody Harrelson, Donald Sutherland, and a surprising good role by Lenny Kravitz.<br/><br/>Stylistically, I enjoyed the portrayal of the futuristic Capitol and its upper class citizenry, shown as essentially colorful, ornately dressed puppets, compared to the stark utilitarian clothing of the district dwellers. It brought shades of ""Aeon Flux"" and ""Metropolis"" to mind, as did the entire film - a dystopian society on the verge of massive change and upheaval, brought about by gross injustices, founded upon its own underlying inhumanity. This film is part one of a three-part series, and I do hope the remaining films are made."
"jukangliwayway","6","0","2","9 May 2013"," The first scene grabs your attention: It has a promise of substance and it's not your typically manufactured eye-candy popcorn movie.
","WHAT I DIDN'T LIKE:<br/><br/>Story/plot/characters are underdeveloped, but then again so is the book.<br/><br/>There are some scenes (like the parade of the tributes) which felt like crappy CGI work. But I decided it's just part of the dystopian look, and i let it go.<br/><br/>The relationship of Katniss and Rue is also underdeveloped that it made Katniss' reaction seem unbelievable. That partnership in the book was one of the more important highlights for me, and I didn't see that in the movie. Disappointing.<br/><br/>While it's okay for the book to have only mild violence, it's different when it comes to movies especially if you packaged it as an action sci fi movie. Audiences will expect violence, fast-paced action, and a bit more blood and gore. But they're kids so I guess the tone-down is a must. I appreciate that the movie pretty much stayed close to the book, but they could have turn this average novel into something substantial and kick-ass. They didn't. What a shame. What they did is they adapted an average book with a somewhat unique plot into a mildly interesting average movie with a somewhat unique plot.<br/><br/>THE VERDICT:<br/><br/>The cast and the visuals categorized this movie as a somewhat serious dystopian sci-fi flick, but it retains the Young Adult feel of the story. The plot is not something to boast about and I blame that on the writers (the author and director both wrote the screenplay) for sloppily handling it. 2 hours and 20 minutes is more than enough to infuse some substance and they didn't do much about it. But i did enjoy it, it's fast-paced enough albeit lacking in action, and the cast gave this movie spine. <br/><br/>MY RATING: 3/5 - I enjoyed it. Although I'm not sure if the reason why I enjoyed it is because I read the book - seeing the scenes/narratives come to life was part of the entertainment I got."

","For those who complain how bad the movie was, it is one of the top ten most grossing box-office hits ever, making an estimated 152,535,747 opening weekend and it did so well all four movies are being made. That says something.<br/><br/>Having never read the books, and never liking the whole ""twilight"" teenage hyped up crap, I wasn't really having high expectations of this movie. I was never even sure I wanted to see it in the first place, but I'm gad I did. First of all, I think Jennifer Lawrence did a fantastic job as archery heroine Katniss Everdeen, and was perfect for the role. Nobody could have done it better. Second, I absolutely LOVED Josh Hutcherson as Peeta. Great cast and superb acting. That's two ups for me. I loved the storyline, the dystopian setting. There was very good character and plot development, I felt like I really got to know the characters and their way of thinking.<br/><br/>The movie kept me in suspense most of the time, I could really feel Katniss's fear, desperation and hopefulness and was experiencing everything from her point of view, also. That was another point up for the movie because for me to actually ENJOY a movie, I need to able to relate to the main character(s). Which the hunger games did for me.<br/><br/>It had good emotional scenes, really making me tear up at times because it was so sad. I loved that.<br/><br/>Yes, the camera was shaking at times, but it wasn't THAT bad. It didn't bother me at all.<br/><br/>Overall, I loved the movie, and will definitely be going to see all four.

"raressocaciu_06","7","0","4","4 May 2013"," Featuring a fearless young actress at the top of her game, The Hunger Games is a thrilling, smart and unforgettable book adaptation that puts others to shame.
","""Welcome! We salute your courage and your sacrifice and we wish you Happy Hunger Games!"" - President Snow<br/><br/>Time and space is very well established within the first five minutes of the film. We are in Panem, a future version of North American which is divided into a series of districts (consisting of poor people put under oppressive rule – the security force resembles the policemen in George Lucas' THX 1138) and a wealthy city known as The Capitol (which is in control over the districts). Each year, two young members of every district are chosen to fight to the death (on live television) in an arena until there is only one of them left. The reason? Is there any? They say this is some kind of a tribute in order to maintain peace in Panem. President Snow says that hope is the true reason behind the Hunger Games (""Hope, it is the only thing stronger than fear.""). I don't even think there is a reason.<br/><br/>Half of the film takes place in an arena filled with video cameras that made me think of The Truman Show and I was afraid of the fact that it might feel repetitive. However, this isn't the case here. Gary Ross (the man has already got four Oscar nominations), does a good job and I found his shaky camera technique perfect for the kind of action that takes place in the movie. Ross manages to make the film look brutal and violent even though its PG-13 rating. Seeing a young man holding a bloodied brick in his hand while another contender is lying dead at his feet is enough to make you think that you have actually seen a bloodbath. <br/><br/>Another strong element is the wonderful cast consisting of some of the best actors in Hollywood today. Donald Sutherland and Wes Bentley make perfect use of their limited on-screen time sharing some incredible scenes while Stanley Tucci gives a charming and funny performance as talk show host Caesar Flickerman (His fellow colleague is Claudius Templesmith – played by an even funnier Toby Jones).<br/><br/>Elizabeth Banks' Effie Trinket was something I was initially skeptical about because the trailer made her look like an annoying villain-like megalomaniac. However, Effie is actually a unique presence in the movie, a symbol of Panem's aristocracy and although I felt like Banks' performance was a little over the top, there are some really funny moments between her and former Hunger Games winner Haymitch Abernathy (another great performance from Hollywood's flexible friend, the always phenomenal Woody Harrelson). <br/><br/>Effie's role throughout the movie is not as big as I thought I would be but her presence is extremely important. She really stands out in the ""reaping"" scene where all the other characters (the inhabitants of District 12) are dressed in simple gray-colored clothes to symbolize their lack of options, the poverty and the constant hunger while Effie Trinket looks like a strange mixture of the Pink Panther and Tinker Bell. You might think that she is just a crazy, spoiled, luxury-loving person but the entire high society seems to be dressed like her. They're all some sort of clowns with strange haircuts and expensive clothes which make them look ridiculously unnatural. I quite liked the contrast between the social classes. The aristocrats' lives are superficial and they do not seem to care or even be aware of how difficult the lives of the people who live in the Districts really are. The supporting cast is terrific but it is actually Jennifer Lawrence who shines here more than ever and gives birth to one of the greatest movie heroines of the 21st century. When her little sister is chosen for the Hunger Games, Katniss, she does the right and selfless thing and volunteers herself as tribute. By doing that, she loses everything (including a potential relationship with Liam Hemsworth's Gale Hawthorne with whom she shares her disgust towards the Hunger Games) but somehow it feels that she hasn't anything to lose. Fighting for her loved ones (her little sister and even her irresponsible mother) becomes her goal and she has to survive no matter how. She is beautiful, intelligent, skillful and strong-willed and by the time she enters the arena you'll be rooting for her like your life depends on it. <br/><br/>On the other hand, Peeta (the other tribute from District 12, played by Josh Hutcherson) is going through different emotions throughout the film from fear and the certainty of his own death to love and the will to sacrifice. He doesn't want the game to change him, he sometimes looks like he does not know exactly if he is doing the right thing and I can honestly say that there is a bit of Peeta in all of us. Both he and Katniss become characters you come to care about. And that is because of the acting, the direction, the captivating action scenes, the smart script and the human element which is present throughout the entire movie. <br/><br/>From star-ships and trains, to CGI creatures, the visual effects are very impressive. There is particularly one scene that I found phenomenal in which our heroine tries to escape a fire in the forest. The interesting thing is that the fire was actually started by the game makers, the ones who pull the strings and make the game turn out the way they want it to be without feeling any remorse and having no concern for consequences. <br/><br/>But in the end, I think that the big question is ""Would you do it?"". Would you be able to adapt to survive, to hunt and kill other human beings just like you? What about watching a televised blood-fest like the Hunger Games? I just hope that our future is a lot brighter than that."

The acting-in-general is contrived and overly perfecto, and there are definitely a few holes and cop-outs in the plot. Yet, THE HUNGER GAMES is so one-of-a-kind that its flaws, some of which would be ruinous in a lesser film, are forgivable.<br/><br/>All the same, there are ways that THE HUNGER GAMES might have been better; e.g., it would have been a plus to see more virtually created creature phenomena such as the were-pitbulls (or whatever they are) toward the end. Another thing: Considering the brutality of the premise, what actually happens during the ""game"" is fairly tame. Having said that, I'm not sure how it would have worked better--It certainly would NOT have been enhanced by creating a horrific ""It's either me or you"" gore-fest. It often descends into sentimental, politically correct, teeny-bopperish romance, but just when things start to get too maudlin, new things arise.<br/><br/>I am sure that this film does not do complete justice to the book trilogy, which I have not read but am now very eager to read. The mere fact that the film version made me--and I'm sure many others--want to read the books says something for it."
"sosnh","9","0","5","26 April 2013"," One Of The Greatest
","This movie is fantastic. It captures the emotion that Suzanne Collins implied when writing the series, and the music and language was superb. I loved the book, and I was thoroughly glad that the book had been transformed into a movie. It was exactly what I wanted and more. In saying this, and this is why I have ticked 'Contains Spoilers' is because it doesn't exactly follow the book in for ways than one. For example, you do not see much of the stylists, and Madge isn't even shown. A huge part of the book for myself was the injury repairment, being Katniss' ear and Peeta's leg, but that wasn't shown either. Despite my criticism, this is one of the greatest movies I have ever seen. I hope Catching Fire, which is released November of 2013 will continue to develop nicely. Many thanks and congratulations to the people who made this movie possible."
"ChristianUnchained","7","0","4","23 April 2013"," Could be better, could be worse
","PSA: I've read the book. HAPPY HUNGER GAMES! The odds are in the favor of this film adaptation of The Hunger Games. Not only is Ross' Games a faithful adaptation, but also an extremely well paced wonder - The Hunger Games ramps up, gets tense and never really lets up until the very end, just like the novel. The book to film adaptation is extremely solid; while much character development is lost (as well as some of the characters themselves) the movie still makes you root for the main characters. The rising action is quite tense because the movie has to move at a brisker pace to cover the major pivotal plot points - this works in favor of the film...mostly. What truly stood out to me as both a fan of the books and of film was the way that the sets and moments of the book were imagined, filmed, and displayed on screen. The stark contrast between the drab District 12 and the Capitol, the humor and personality and lifestyle of the Capitol citizens compared with those being initiated into the Games. But most of all is the Games themselves. Ross, thankfully, did not lighten up on the actual Games segment of the film. The Hunger Games is a dark and very violent novel; the movie follows suit. The scenes, especially the very beginning of the Games, are just as I imagined as I was reading the novel; the scenes themselves are as descriptive as Collins' writing. What The Hunger Games is known for is also the underdog protagonist, Katniss Everdeen. Similar to the novel, Katniss' character is one to root for and to enjoy. The acting across the board is strong; Lawrence is a perfect Katniss, Huthcerson (who I couldn't stand in earlier films such as Journey To the Center of the Earth) plays a surprisingly good Peeta, and Woody Harrelson steals the show as the drunk and lovable Haymitch Abernathy. The other characters (Caeser, Snow, Effie, and Cinna) are great characters in the book are also well acted and well adapted for the screen. (side note: Although Effie's name is never said. That's weird!) From a fan perspective, the scenes that were left out (such as further explaining the dogs, the tracker jacker and mocking jay history, the whole Avox backstory and others) were great source material that I wish would have made the cut. I understand that things had to be cut (especially since the film itself was already 144 minutes), but considering the adaption is pretty strong, I can live with the cuts. There were also some scenes that were altered that I wish had played out like they had in the novel, but what happened in these scenes (in the film ) was still coherent and understandable. There were also scenes added (the District 11 scene in particular) that were well done - artistic leeway payed off. Small side note on sound design: very well done in this department. While the film remains fairly quiet, the few orchestrated tracks that are played are for emphasis - and they create a very tense mood, especially at the start of the Games. The sound design is also fantastic; the forest in the arena is very lively and watching it in the movie theater was a treat. The sounds truly create an enveloping atmosphere. What I can really be proud to say is the adaptation is actually good. It's a very fine film that people who have never read the book will most definitely enjoy. And for those that have read the novel, the payoff is large: to see a very clear and well planned imagining of an extremely good and well imagined universe is rare. And with the film actually being good, well acted, and not cheesy (except for one scene - you know what I'm talking about) it will hopefully encourage a greater following of the series - not that the fan base isn't bursting at the seams or anything! The only negative aspect of this film as a film - not an adaption - is its panicked feel. Not the whole film, but rather the beginning and part of the Games. While it gets the job done, It feels like the film at certain points comes out at breakneck speed and maintains it. Never letting go, never letting up, and never getting the audience a chance to breathe - and stumbling in the process. It had to be extremely difficult to direct The Hunger Games. Even at 144 min. runtime, the film still felt rushed. All in all, The Hunger Games is a phenomenal start to the film adaptations of a very respected series. While much is cut in the transition from movie to book (the book is definitely better folks - but thats always a given), the movie doesn't cut what makes The Hunger Games an extremely interesting and intense piece of fiction - underdog hero, intense relations, and a drive to come out on top and win the Games. ""The Hunger Games"" comes highly recommend - especially because it is a standout adaptation as well as a pretty darn good film in itself."
"thereelqueen","7","0","4","21 April 2013"," Well made but intense
","This movie is a very intense movie and story line. It is a well made movie though. The story is these people are broken up into 1-12 districts (there were 13 but the capitol destroyed it). They did to keep wars and uprising from happening again. In order for this not to happen, 1 person from every district must participate in a a battle to the death called the Hunger Games! We see the district 12 which is where our main characters our from is very dirty and we see the people our hungry. Each district serves its purpose. District 12 is a mining for coal district. The people who make the kids who are 18 and under in the games are very rich and silly looking. They live in riches while people starve. They view the games as entertainment not realizing the damage it is causing. Our main love interest is played by Jennifer Lawrence, Josh Hutcherson, and for some reason there is Liam Hemsworth. It a very intense and emotional story and I would not take anyone under like 13 to 15 and the youngest! Even though the story is a disturbing it is very creative and well made! <br/><br/>Pros: Creativity, costuming, hair, cast, script, camera geography, story<br/><br/>Cons intensity, story, love triangle"
"lilsisasu","8","0","3","20 April 2013"," Not the best adaption of a book, but not the worst either
","Before I watched the movie, knowing that Suzanne Collins wrote the screenplay, I thought that the movie would be one of the best movie adaptations of a book. I was wrong. Sure it was pretty good, but I've seen better movie adaptations of books come from screenplay writers that didn't write the book as well. Maybe that was what they should have done with the movie. Or it could be the fact that there were multiple writers. Sure, multiple writers are okay for an original screenplay, but when it's a screenplay that's being adapted from something, I think it might have been better with just one person writing it. It also felt rushed. I know that it would have been a lot longer if some things hadn't been cut, but the beginning especially seemed rushed. I think maybe they could have shown a little bit more of the reaping day. Even though I'm all for getting people to read, if someone had come to watch this without ever having read the first book, they wouldn't probably understand what was happening. One way they could have done that would have been by having a voice-over of Katniss talking about the Hunger Games. Now, I'm not saying it wasn't good, it was, but unlike with the Twilight Saga or the Harry Potter series, I don't feel like I want to go see a midnight premiere of it. I can't exactly put my finger on why it wasn't as good to me, but it just didn't seem as good. Now, I'm currently in the middle of reading the series for the first time, so, my perspective may change after I finish it.<br/><br/>Also, the movie had a little too much gore for my tastes. True, I think I subconsciously censored what I saw in my mind when I was reading the book, but some of the stuff, I thought was pretty gruesome. Like, showing what the tracker jackers did to one of the tributes. I also didn't like when the showed Cato break the one tributes neck. Also, it seemed a little more gruesome because of the reason as to why they hold the games. Actually seeing it made it worse knowing that the career tributes had been raised to kill people and that the ones who weren't, had to kill others, whether they liked it or not.<br/><br/>I think the movie could have been better, but it wasn't the worst movie ever."
"FairlyAnonymous","7","0","2","15 April 2013"," While not perfect, it is still enjoyable
","I am one of the people who haven't read the book, so that might be why I enjoy this movie. To me, The Hunger Games has an interesting take on an already well known concept. The idea of kids fighting to the death in gladiator combat has been done before and thankfully The Hunger Games pulls off the fear and brutality of kids murdering each other quite well and makes the combat legitimately intense. However the movie does suffer from some problems such as a lack of explanations to what is going (which is probably explained in the book), the annoying wardrobe, and the made for TV style camera angles.<br/><br/>The movie establishes that in the future there are twelve districts that compete in a contest called The Hunger Games. For those of you who don't know, The Hunger Games is a competition where two kids from each district come together to duke it out with one another in a giant forest. Fortunately, the people who run the games care very little about the lives of the children and see them merely as entertainment, so some elements inside the forest are controllable just for the sake of making things more intense. <br/><br/>The main character is Katniss, who is a quiet and responsible girl who knows how to use a bow properly. I will say that the acting is quite good in this movie, though I feel like Katniss should've looked a little bit more poverty stricken since she lives in the poorest district. The other actors all do a fine job, while I will say that Peeta kind of annoyed me a bit. One small annoying thing in this movie is that the wardrobe is ridiculous. I understand that it is the future, but it looks like the future of style was designed by Nicki Minaj. It just doesn't make any sense why the wardrobe is so goofy.<br/><br/>Now there is something about this movie that I like and don't like at the same time: the camera angles/atmosphere. The movie is all about a show where kids kill each other, so naturally it makes sense to shoot the movie in a way similar to a TV show. There are a lot of facial close-ups, shaky cams, interviews, and stuff like that. This makes the movie feel like you are watching a TV show about a world with a violent TV show. While this is good in one sense, it also means that the movie is kind of pointless to watch a second time and in the long run the movie doesn't really feel like a... movie. That is why I can't ever see myself ever paying to watch this movie or its sequels because it feels more like I'm watching a television show than it does a movie. Some people may like that, I thought it was interesting but not exactly good.<br/><br/>Overall, The Hunger Games is a good movie that does have some faults here and there but is still worth watching. Ironically the movie is talking about violence in entertainment and yet it is a movie where the audience is enjoying the violence in it. Still worth watching, though it isn't anything too deep or engaging."
"seshimaroo","5","0","2","13 April 2013"," Downright Disturbing
","I really didn't like this movie. I didn't like the book at all, either. I am not in anyway saying that the Hunger Games was a bad film or novel. I just didn't like them. The movie disturbed me more than any other film I've ever seen (with maybe a few exceptions I'd rather forget). Yeah, I know it was supposed to be like that, convey the message that teenagers aren't supposed to kill each other, corrupt government, tone of the film, and blah blah blah blah blah. I just didn't like to see the slaughtering of kids portrayed in such a way. I was also very annoyed at how much people freaked out over how amazing the books were and all of these girls treating it like some sort of dramatic soap opera that just came on TV. I also hate how people now ask questions like ""what would you do if you were forced to do this"" or ""what if the country ended up like this"", because I'd rather not think about it. Also, I think that all of the die-hard fan-girls and fan-boys of this story had totally annihilated the true message and reason of this book and film. Kids ust focus on the love triangle and Peeta Vs. Gale or how awesome that katniss is a girl protagonist, rather than even give a second thought to why it was written. Not that I know the author's purpose, but i know it was not written to be some stupid soap opera.<br/><br/>Despite how much i hated the idea of the film, how it was made was outstanding. Thea acting was amazing (with the exception of Josh Hutcherson, who did not do so well as Peeta), the camera work was great, the CGI and special effects were great and nobody needs to ask about the makeup (how it was not eligible for the Oscar for best Makeup, I don't know). <br/><br/>Summing it all up: I did not like the idea of the film but it was outstandingly filmed."
"nyf85","8","0","4","7 April 2013"," Missing Points
","There were so many important & informative points that did not come out. Like how Peeta was throwing way more hints to his true feelings for Katniss. How Haymitch noticed and kept trying to hint it to Katniss. Long before the interview. They spent a lot of time in the cave and I wish the sweetness came through better. I never thought Haymitch or Cinna were using Katniss to get the districts rallied up. It just happened that way but mostly from how Katniss ended up there, her district's reaction and Rue's death. They did however get a good drop on President Snow's menacing behavior. I think considering how much was missed but the large amount of info included in the 1st book they did an OK job. Make up for the rest in the next."
"dallasryan","5","0","2","5 April 2013"," Interesting Concept But Very Insulting
","I haven't read the book. No nothing about it. Based on what I watched though in The Hunger Games, the concept is brilliant. Wars destroying everyone and everything, reverting back to Roman like times but also having a mix of modern times with Reality TV, having tribute games to satisfy the 'the suffering/the anniversary of when it all ended and/or satisfying the Gods in some sense of the matter', et al. <br/><br/>But the big gap in the film, the major gap that is insulting is having kids do the fighting as the tributes, kids killing each other in gruesome, horrible ways. No one in their right mind would accept this and there would have been a lot more riots from the get go then the one that is in the film. Not saying that children/adolescents haven't been executed in time of wars or just killed in wars period, but the point that people would actually want to watch a Reality Tribute TV show about adolescents killing each other is just plain stupid. <br/><br/>I can buy that people could be conditioned over time with watching tough warrior adults killing each other on Reality TV, that's why Arnold Schwarzenegger's The Running Man is a good flick because it could ring true. Plus in The Running Man, they are criminals killing each other in the Arena. But with kids being picked to kill each other, no way, there's just some things people would never be conditioned on no matter how much you tried to condition them to accept it, and watching kids kill each other on Reality TV is one of them. <br/><br/>It is said that Michael Haneke hates human beings. This may or may not be true. But it has also been said that Michael Haneke was so upset on what movie audiences liked, such as torture films that were glorified to be cool and entertaining. Ergo Michael Haneke made a film called Funny Games. Haneke demonstrates in both versions of Funny Games how unbelievably awful true torture is, that it isn't entertaining or glorifying in any way, so in some sense of the word, Funny Games was Haneke's way of bringing people back into reality and was also in some sense his big F U to audiences who love torture films. <br/><br/>My point is, if Michael Haneke was ever to get a hold of directing any of the sequels that were to come for The Hunger Games(which i'm sure there will be a dozen, only until they stop making lots of money), you better believe Haneke would show the true nature of what it would be like to watch kids kill each other on TV. Nothing glorified about it, as was the case with The Hunger Games, Haneke would make us sick to our stomachs the way he did with Funny Games after he was finished doing a Hunger Games Sequel. But of course, Haneke would never get ahold of a sequel to The Hunger Games. That's just a hypothetical. The Producers of these types of movies want to make money and keep people in the dark, not brought into the light."

The way Jennifer Lawrence acted was superb and I can't imagine this movie without her. Even the other primary characters were great. I think the movie is very actual for the themes it explores. First, the movie is about the difference between rich and poor people where just poor people have to suffer. Second, the unjustified violence made just for a sadistic society. Third, it explains the way our society manipulates us. The only flaw I found in this movie was the way Gary Ross directed the movie. In fact, I found the direction not awful, but a little bit monotonous in some parts and I think director Gary Ross lost the possibility to make his masterpiece."
"diane-chandler-75","9","0","4","15 February 2013"," Riveting storyline and authentic characters
","First of all, I have not read the books. Watching a film after reading the book can be nothing but disappointing. A book has so much more opportunity to give the story and the characters depth and background. When that fails to transfer to the screen, I am always disappointed. After hearing so much about this film, I didn't want to spoil it by reading the book first.<br/><br/>I don't know that any Director other than Gary Ross could have made this film. It is unique to any movie I have ever seen that seemingly targets the teen/young adult audience. For one thing, the language is clean. I find that utterly refreshing. There is no salacious sexual contact or even innuendo. I also find that refreshing. The attention to allowing each actor/actress to bring their own kind of 'life' to the character is without comparison in other movies of this target audience.<br/><br/>As for the actors/actresses, I find the casting absolutely without fault. Who could have been Cinna if not Lenny Kravitz? He is the one person Katniss and Peeta meet in the Capital who seems like a compassionate and real person. He is integral to the development of Katniss as a warrior with a heart.<br/><br/>Liam Hemsworth has a small role, but brings an influence to the film that is present with every scene because he leaves his quiet message of love for Katniss. Even in the late scenes where it seems Katniss is developing this romantic relationship with Peeta, brief glances at Hemsworth's face reveal his depth of love for Katniss. His pain is evident when seeing her kissing Peeta, yet he has only smiles when she returns home. He loves her and she survived and that is what is important.<br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence' portrayal of Katniss is cinematic perfection. She is a courageous and loving young woman who faces her worst fears with integrity and compassion for others in her lot. She is vulnerable, yet tough; caring yet determined to stay alive; full of fear yet completely confident and resolved. Jennifer Lawrence IS Katniss Everdeen.<br/><br/>I don't do a lot of movies targeted for this audience, so I wasn't readily familiar with Josh Hutcherson. My first impulse was a complete dislike of the character. However, as the film progressed and Peeta opens up, I liked him more and more. He is complicated, not easily readable so you are unsure as to where he stands. That can be both a good thing and a bad one. In my opinion, Josh Hutcherson parlayed that quality into a definite advantage for his character.<br/><br/>I don't generally enjoy Woody Harrelson, but I must say his interpretation of Haymitch won me over. The seething angry drunk in the beginning somewhat confirmed my presumptions about both Harrelson and Haymitch. However, as the film advanced and Haymitch became more human, I found myself enjoying Harrelson's portrayal very much. It seems he suddenly became a responsible adult with real compassion for his protégé. By the end of the film, Haymitch had actually become one of my favorites.<br/><br/>Then, of course, you have Donald Sutherland. Is there any role Donald Sutherland cannot play and do so with absolute success? If there is, I don't think I know of that character. He is a consummate professional with depth and abilities rare and difficult to find. I don't always like his characters, but I always enjoy his portrayal because he is always on the mark.<br/><br/>My last observation would be about choice of locations for the shooting of the film. I cannot imagine that anywhere else on earth would have been more perfect. The Appalachain Mountains of North Carolina lend a haunting effect to the hunt that few other locations could have. It was so much more enjoyable to see the forest and hear the sounds of the forest than to see blue screen adaptations to make it appear like a forest. The authenticity was a remarkable addition to the entire film.<br/><br/>When I first decided to watch this film it was quite honestly due to the fact that Liam Hemsworth was in it. If you're gonna look at something, it should be something enjoyable and stimulating to look at. No woman in the world would honestly say that Hemsworth was not both enjoyable and stimulating to look at. However, the experience became so much more than that. I would watch this movie over and over again because the story is riveting, the acting makes the characters believable, the location is stunning and the casting and directing are without flaw. That's a full package in my book and I'm happy I watched. I will most definitely be waiting to see if #2 can bear the standard set by #1."

Jennifer Lawrence delivered an effortless performance for the movie. Josh Hutcherson managed to look different from his usual chocolate boy teenage roles. Woody Harrelson was also in his usual standard. Other than the Rue's farewell score, there was nothing much on the film that makes one remember the hunger games.

","After reading the books beforehand, then watching the film, i was very disappointed. I can't count how many pointless scenes with shaky-cam this movie was stuffed with. It's extremely overused and ruins a lot of the scenes with it's sad attempt at being ""realistic"", maybe it is when your having a seizure. Also the CGI looks cheap in a few scenes. Now to address the acting. When she isn't sad or worried, Jennifer Lawrence delivers boring lines devoid of any color. The supporting characters aren't that likable and don't have much of a purpose. When in the book you get to know them and how they think and act. Overall the acting is pretty bleak for the most part, you'll see a few good characters, but thats about it. Another problem is that the film gives you too many unanswered questions that most likely will never be answered in the next few films. The action in this movie is OK, music is fine. Overall, the film is disappointing and pretty dry, its sad to know the author of the book helped with this film. I hope the next movie is better."

","I have not read the book so the movie was new to me.<br/><br/>The shaking camera is the worst thing to happen to cinema. And I am not the only one to dislike it. I hope movie makers get the message to STOP IT! This movie disturbed me. It reminded me of stories we have heard regarding the Roman coliseum. People forced to fight to the death. I had hoped to see a total rebellion that would overthrow the cruel people who rule from the center and subjugate every one else. That did not happen. Maybe the writers left that open for a sequel.<br/><br/>The scene where the tributes enter the stadium with the huge crowd cheering gave me flashbacks to videos I have seen of assemblies of the Third Reich. Creepy. I suppose it was done to add to the threatening atmosphere.<br/><br/>Another aspect that disturbs me is people who have commented here and elsewhere seemed disappointed that the fight scenes weren't clear and graphic. People complain because the scenes weren't gory enough? Makes me wonder if those violent video games are priming our youth to be insensitive to gore and the sanctity of human life.<br/><br/>The thought of teen aged youth hacking and chopping each other to death made my skin crawl. So maybe the movie did what it intended to do.<br/><br/>The acting was good, the only reason I rated it as high as #6, and the fact that this movie raised an awareness of archery. Target shooting of archery is an excellent means to learn patience and concentration. Skills not taught by most video games and skills many employers find lacking in new hires.<br/><br/>SPOILER FOLLOWS. DO NOT READ IF YOU HATE TO KNOW HOW IT ENDS.<br/><br/>The ending left me feeling cheated. The evil empire still rules. The subjects return to their miserable hard scrabble lives. YUUCK!

","I liked the movie, even though it was far from perfect. I found it original, although as it went on there were some similarities to The Running Man, and The Long Walk, both, incidentally by Stephen King. I found the political situation interesting. Likely fleshed out a lot more in the novel, but from what I gathered, there had been a civil war about seventy years in the past, and they seem stuck in eternal Reconstruction. Instead of binding the nation back together over time, as we did, the losing side's territory has become occupied and exploited colonies, even four generations later. I also noted that many of the characters from the ""Capitol"", the winning territory, had Roman names, e.g. Cinna, Octavia, Flavius, Cato, Seneca. Hmmm. Well, I don't quite care enough to read the book, and likely not enough to see the inevitable sequels."

","If you're reading this I assume that you have not read The Hunger Games book, I have not nor do I plan to anytime soon. I have read quite a few of my fellow reviewers opinions and predominately they are folks that say the movie compares poorly with the book. I have no doubt they are probably right, in my experience only about 10% of the movies are as good as or better than the book (my one big exception that was Jaws). I cannot watch a movie based on a Stephen King novel, I thoroughly enjoy his books but they rarely, if ever, translate well to the screen.<br/><br/>I had very low expectations for this movie. My take on it was that it someone trying to cash in on the Twilight series craze, and maybe it was but in my opinion this was not a bad movie. This was my first exposure to the young Ms. Jennifer Lawerence and I am here to tell you, she is going to be back in more and more movies, she literally carries this movie. So if for no other reason I glad for that.<br/><br/>If you are looking for something to watch that won't hurt your brain and won't make you think too much this is good movie for you. It is fairly predictable, in ways that it mimics other ""future Earth"" movies. My only complaint on that score was that it reminded me too much of ""The Running Man"" which was not a good movie, but the concept was very similar.<br/><br/>As I said, if your looking for something that's entertaining and you don't want to have to think too much, give this a watch, if you want a movie that changes you and in substantial way changes how you view life, don't think that you are going to get that here"
"Hitchcoc","7","0","3","22 January 2013"," Something Lacking
","I have no experience with this book series, so I went into the theater with only a cursory knowledge of what I was to see. Mostly from word of mouth and random commentary. This allowed me to view it as ""just another movie."" While I thought the premise interesting, I could never put aside the question as to why these events had evolved in this culture. I know the whole thing is a metaphor showing how media, left to its designs, could be the destruction of us. That said, I think that ""Rollerball"" used the same basic premise, the hero tilting at the oppressive gamesmen. Here we have the young woman, who in order to save a small child from certain death, finds herself in a fight for her own life. Everything is orchestrated as a TV show with smiling show host who have somehow managed to be put in positions of power. There is apparently a greater power which is never defined that has a stranglehold on the populace. Other than being chosen to be on the show, it isn't clear what their methods of control are. I guess they will starve them to death. Maybe they have weapons that could slaughter an entire population or something of this sort, but I never got the message. I thought the competition was also confusing. Why did the powers intervene at times? Was it just good television or did they have favorites? Maybe I'm dense, but I also had trouble understanding the point of some of the competitions. The acting is quite good and so are the special effects, and I didn't dislike the movie. I just felt that it left a lot of questions unanswered, and that most of the issues have been dealt with more effectively in previous films. A side-note: Other than their being visually interesting, is there any other reason for the wacky appearance of some of the characters who hold power. Are they like the people who dress up for NFL games in the most bizarre costumes, face paint in all."
"thesar-2","5","0","3","21 January 2013"," The Running Girl
","There have been a lot of comparisons between the new series of The Hunger Games and the Twilight (so-called) ""saga"" lately, and I'm not innocent of avoiding paralleling the two. Well, the moment The Hunger Games begins, those unfair similarities should be tossed. The two franchises are as close as the Star Wars episodes and The Alien films.<br/><br/>While The Hunger Games isn't perfect by any means measurable, it's light-years ahead of the Twilight duds. Better acting, dialogue, suspense, action, emotion, heart and special effects are just the tip of the iceberg on how much better The Hunger Games is, but then again, that's just denouncing the comparison.<br/><br/>So, I digress. The Hunger Games has really only one major thing going for it which is actually making me encourage all to see it: Jennifer Lawrence (or J-Law.) The actress herself and her fantastic character of Catnip, er, Katniss are worth the price alone. I already liked her tremendously in Winter's Bone and come to think about it, I believe I said the exactly the same thing about that movie. So-so movie, EXCELLENT performance, so much so: everyone should see it just for her.<br/><br/>Other than J-Law, this movie was really...eh. Yes, the cinematography was splendid – WHEN THE CAMERA WASN'T SHAKING all around when no one else was – and some of the effects were pretty decent. But, damn, was it ever slow, predicable and has the most LOL vision of the future. I literally did laugh out loud every time the clowns of the future were on screen.<br/><br/>Before any fans shoot arrows at me, I have NOT read any of the books. But, even if these ugly and unnecessary 1960s Star Trek rejected costumes and makeup designs were in the source material that does NOT mean they have to be in the feature film. I mean, if the screenplay writer or director didn't update certain characters/costumes, Robin of Batman Forever/& Robin would look pretty...well, molestable from the much older Bruce Wayne. And the X-Men even commented on the ridiculous yellow suits and look how great they turned out. Well, for the first two installments, at any rate.<br/><br/>(Sadly, they failed to hear this kind of complaint for Captain America in the forthcoming Avengers movie. Hey! There's still time to edit out that hilarious uniform, Disney. This goes for you, too, Thor!)<br/><br/>Anyhoo, what I am guessing is hundreds of years into our future, the reality TV show lives on (THANKS, America) only this one has the kids killing other kids. As much as I'm against that, if Jersey Shore stole this idea, I would finally watch my very first episode of that awful MTV show. Repeatedly.<br/><br/>Not really a spoiler – seen a movie trailer lately? – but Catnip volunteers/sacrifices herself in place of her weakling sister for this wooded and hologram'med death match of 2 younglings from each of the 12 districts (why the aliens from #9 didn't participate is beyond me.) She leaves behind an obvious love choice and must fight/help a new love choice (Dang, there's that Twilight comparison again) in order to survive the ""game"" of life.<br/><br/>The idea's not new (The Running Man anyone?), but this new horror of kid on kid deadly violence is. This absolutely should've been Rated R and be more serious. 'Course, they wouldn't make the money they'll know they'll make by copping out to the PG-13 crowds.<br/><br/>In all seriousness, this has a VERY violent movie premise and whenever the movie tried to make some lite comment or joke, I barely laughed because it's like making a teeny-bopper movie about everyone being a rapist or molester, but everyone still can enjoy a few laughs from time to time.<br/><br/>Also, as I mentioned, it was slower than it should've been, felt very much like the first in a series and seemed to take far too long to get to the actual ""Games"" than it should've been. All along, I felt this was a perfect prequel movie that should've been the fourth film – à la The Hobbit after we're already invested in the series.<br/><br/>Okaythat all saidagain, it's worth a viewing due to the absolutely Oscar-nomination-worthy performance of J-Law – who delivered the only unpredictable aspect of this movie (I never knew which way her character would sway while all other characters or scenes were A-B-C) and maaaybe a consideration for Woody Harrelson, whom I normally don't like, but did great here. No one and I mean no one – even the VERY cute guys – did great, but they were 16-acting-classes ahead of Robert ""Eerie Edward"" Pattinson, Kristen ""Blah Bella"" Stewart and Taylor ""Jake the Dog"" Lautner of the Twilight series. Oops, sorry about bringing that up again. See? I'm not immune to the comparisons.<br/><br/>And finally, the movie, quite honestly, grabbed my attention enough that I really, really look forward to part II. No spoilers because I haven't read the novels, but I strongly want one of my new favorite characters, Catnip, to take down the establishment. The ideas, though preposterous, are sadly and minutely accurate (ah hem, Nazis or Republicans, you pick) of a possible and tyrannous outlook of mankind. They're horrifying, although, if this were a 1980s/1990s action flick starring Arnold or Sylvester, the ""man"" would've been taken down by now.<br/><br/>Since that isn't the case and this wasn't made 20-30 years ago (though you would believe it was with the costumes, makeup and hair), I'm really looking forward to seeing my new heroine take on Kiefer's dad and put an end to the games. You go gurl!"

But they are missing almost the whole train trip to the capitol, the preparing for the hunger games is almost 66% of the the book when the preparing in the movie is like 40%. And they make the hunger games look like it's only is played in a few days when it's played for almost three weeks in the book. And they took away almost all the violence in the movie which made it look like it was made for 7 year old kids. And Katniss have a lot of interesting flashbacks in the book that she don't have in the movie. The good thing is that Jennifer Lawrence make the roll as Katniss excellent. But the movie is still pretty similar to the book. It's not how it was with the Eragon movie who was very different from the book."

","The Hunger Games had a lot of hype so since I missed it in the theater I had to see it when it came out on the DVD. Well, I thought it got off to a promising start and enjoyed the first part, up to when the village girl volunteers to take the place of her sister in the Hunger games, but after that, the movie went downhill and became increasingly boring and routine. The story line didn't have any twists and turns and was uninteresting, and the acting was just ""OK"". The only character who I thought had any spark or interest was the world-weary adviser and mentor to the kids, played by Woody Harrelson. He should have had more screen time and that would have made the movie more interesting.<br/><br/>Besides him, I thought Lenny Kravitz did a good job in a small role, and didn't recognize him until after looking up the credits. But the other characters didn't make any impression and were all pretty much flat and one dimensional, including the stereotypical villain played by Donald Sutherland.<br/><br/>That said, the movie did have nice wilderness scenery and some suspense when the kids are stalking one another, and is not a terrible film. Though I also didn't like how the ending was so blatant in setting up a sequel, I dislike it when movies do that. Still, overall it is a passable entry in the action-adventure genre."

Plus, it all happened so fast in the film, it was a little hard to believe. I know the film was long already, so you really couldn't rectify that.<br/><br/>The best part of the film was Hutcherson and Tucci. Hutcherson is quite the handsome young man now and his character, Peeta, is my favorite in the book.

","The Hunger Games is a futuristic movie like its book. Firstly, I read the book, and then I went to the cinema. When I watched the movie, I actually disappointed. Because the book is better than the movie to me, but it doesn't mean that I didn't like the movie. I like the movie, surely, but I just have so much expectations. I think actors and actresses who are chosen are right. While I read the book, I imagined characters like people who played at the movie. Especially, Josh Hutcherson and Jennifer Lawrence are suitable to my imagination, and I'm glad about that. For its subject is so interesting, millions of people loved the movie like me. While I watched the movie, I was impressed. Because Katniss Everdeen struggled to survive, and she chose to go to Capitol for the Hunger Games. She was so close to death, but she just thought her sister, and surely there is a love story at the movie, but it is little bit complicated. Because she didn't realize her love to Peeta, but Peeta fell in love with Katniss. It also is interesting thing at the movie for me. All in all, I look forward to the Catching Fire. I read the book, too. I'm excited about it, and I expect so much things, too."

","The trailer of this movie made me want to read the books and I'm glad I read those first. The movie has the overall plot but lacks the details and depth of the books. And damn those are important. <br/><br/>The movie stays right at the surface of the plot and cannot give the viewer the same emotional and cognitive involvement that the books have. I almost cried for some deaths in the book while it didn't even register in the movie.<br/><br/>I also feel that that the film lacks gore and desperation. I am not much of a horror fan or even an action fan but the whole premise of the story is that the games are awful and to bring that across on the screen you need more gore then the bit of blood they show. <br/><br/>I won't say that the movie is awful as so many have done before me. It is good enough, it just doesn't reach the depth of the books. The only reason therefor to watch this movie is because you cannot read the books."
"danalaura-cazacu","7","0","4","1 December 2012"," A watchable movie
","Although other reviews strongly criticize the movie and the book series I do not intend to compare this with the golden age of fantasy and Science fiction, nor will I compare Suzanne Collins to Asimov, Tolkien or Herbert. It will be inconceivable.<br/><br/>It is indeed minor literature and minor movie making. I remember reading Dune when I was 15 and than again when I was 22. It took me 7 years and a lot of philosophy and political readings to finally get a decent grasp on those books. Yes indeed, Hunger Games doesn't have that much of subtext, but it is certainly a nice story.<br/><br/>Than again look around you and try to find a good movie of this kind that isn't a remake or a good book that is truly original. I guess from the massive pile of bad movies and no substance characters, The Hunger Games might be considered decent enough to watch and read.<br/><br/>Now too the movie. You have to keep in mind that Katniss is a 16 year old girl. With barely education at all, deeply traumatized and forced to survive in dire conditions. That's even before she entered the arena. You will not say much either. I think Jennifer Lawrence portraits her pretty well. Her acting is not so vocalized, but lets us guess a lot of what is going inside her. Decent acting on the rest of the cast as well.<br/><br/>The sets are great. The contrast between the district and the capitol is exactly how I've imagined it. And the arena is simply well made. The makeup and costumes are fabulous.<br/><br/>The story follows with little exceptions the one of the book. For example the mocking jade pin is given by Marge in the book and by an old lady in the movie.<br/><br/>A decent and watchable movie, considering the alternatives.<br/><br/>I apologize for not asking for more."

","This review is going to be short and written by a rookie.<br/><br/>I think it is very hard to review the movie once you have read the book, or at least objectively.<br/><br/>For me this movie seemed pretty loyal to the book, but of course many details had been cut. But if there had been possibility to make a 5-hour- movie, it could have been great.<br/><br/>In my opinion Jennifer Lawrence just nailed it by acting rebellious Katniss. I didn't like her at the movie ''Like Crazy'' at all but in this movie she seemed to be in her element. Also other cast supported the movie pretty well. Only Wes Bentleys act didn't make any impression. I just couldn't find the same feeling with him and the book's Seneca.<br/><br/>In the movies it is vital to be able to squeeze those hundreds of pages into a 2-hour-movie. This one didn't execute that perfectly, but I would still say: go see the movie, it was good."
"brando647","8","0","3","20 November 2012"," THE HUNGER GAMES is Surprisingly Good for Teen-Oriented Series
","I never intended on giving THE HUNGER GAMES any attention. All I knew from the marketing campaign was that it was based on a series of young adult novels all I could think was TWILIGHT. When the reviews started coming out and the word was overwhelmingly positive, I figured I might have to rethink my position on the movie. Not enough to see it in theaters, but I did check it out when it was released on home video and I was pleasantly surprised. For the most part, it lived up to a lot of the hype as a great film for both teens and adults. The movie is based on the first novel in a series from Suzanne Collins set in a dystopian future when America has suffered through a great internal struggle. The nation, now known as Panem, is now separated into the high class of the Capitol and twelve poverty-stricken districts that each specialize in a particular resource. The Hunger Games is an even held each year where two tributes are chosen from each of the twelve districts, one male and one female between the ages of twelve and eighteen, and placed in a battle to the death until one victor remains. The Games are meant to remind the people of Panem of the Capitol's dominance and discourage any future revolutionary behavior. When her sister's name is called as tribute for the 74th annual games, Katniss Everdeen volunteers in her place and must now fight for her life against 23 other tributes if she hopes to survive the Hunger Games.<br/><br/>Honestly, I'm surprised this is as popular as it is with the teen/preteen crowd. This is a well- thought science fiction tale set in a future where the wealthy have tightened their oppression over the lower class to the point where they force them to murder each other for their own amusement. It's reality television taken to a whole new level, and we know how much America loves its reality TV. After everything I'd heard about the laughable love story in the TWILIGHT movies, I really expected this movie to be the same. I just assumed that's what it took to grab the attention of the teen girls that made this movie such a phenomenon. Again, I was wrong. There is a blossoming relationship in the movie between Katniss and a fellow tribute, but it's not the central focus. If anything, it's a subplot. Katniss's motivation in the movie isn't to find true love, it's to survive the Games and see her family again. Despite how good this movie turned out to be, I won't be running out to buy the novels anytime soon so I couldn't tell you if it's something that develops later in the series. I sure hope not. THE HUNGER GAMES has a good thing going here and I'd hate for it to break off into some melodramatic love triangle. I may not be interested in the novels, but this movie has guaranteed my interest in the inevitable sequel.<br/><br/>The production design was probably the best part of this movie. The world of Panem is a bizarre one. The twelve districts are almost primitive in their designrural and low tech. The Capitol, on the other hand, is massive and colorful. People dress in abstract fashions with freakish hairstyles and flashy wardrobes. Think Victorian England on LSD. The action in the movie is as good as one can expect in a PG-13 film aimed at teenagers. Despite the bloody premise behind the movie, the action is mostly cut fast and bloodless. A lot of chaotic camera shaking and implied violence before cutting away. As a result, the violence doesn't hit as hard as it could but, again, this movie was based on a book series aimed at kids that can't cough up ticket money for an R-rated bloodbath. And then there are the characters, each of them memorable in their own right. Jennifer Lawrence is amazing as Katniss. Beautiful and stoic, she's a strong character and Lawrence is guaranteed to go on to a great career. Woody Harrelson stands out in the movie as a past Hunger Games victor who acts as mentor to Katniss and her fellow District 12 tribute. He's tortured from his time in the Games and persistently drunk, but he soon finds faith in Katniss as a potential winner. There's a lot of talent gathered here in both the cast and crew, and director Gary Ross has done an awesome job. As someone who can't stand the usual teen-oriented entertainment, I can say that I'll be following this series when the sequels arrive."

","Although most of the recommendations I got were accompanied with the phrase ""the movie was too slow"", I disagree up to a point. I would have enjoyed it more if it was just a bit shorter... some scenes were not that crucial for the plot. But, never the less, 90% of it was enjoyable for me. Here's a breakdown of the formula according to me: Cast - spot on; Acting - good; Story - very good; Costumes - horrible; Make up - not good; Special effects - average; Idea - already seen but it was refined much better; Directing - Bad, not sure why these directors today like the shaky camera that much. One of the most important aspects of any movie is that the audience needs to be able to see what is going on without developing a headache. The camera is shaky all the time, even when there's no need for it. Apart from that it was OK."

","I've never actually read the Hunger Games so my review will mean nothing to some people. There were some things I liked about this film and others I didn't really like. From what friends have told me, the books were beautifully written whereas they complain about the film lacking much of the themes the book possessed. <br/><br/>What I liked<br/><br/>-The introduction scenes were good- The build up to the name selection for District 12 was well done. -The girl, Rue, was actually interesting character to me -Some promising actors and a pretty good script -The ending was pretty well done<br/><br/>However, that being said there were many things I didn't like about the film that I felt were strangely put in even though I haven't read the books. One thing is that the short battle sequences made no sense whatsoever. The biggest problem are the ""bad"" characters who actually try to kill Katnis, Peter and Rue. I mean, it only makes perfect sense if the ""bad"" guys showed at least some emotion but here they are shown to just enjoy killing people. This felt more like a slasher film- No emotion, no remorse just killing machines<br/><br/>This seems very strange as the different districts are no enemies. In fact, most characters should kill ****reluctantly**** and ****hesitantly** There also wasn't much character development as this is really a franchise. With the second film due next year, a lack of character development is quite a big issue.<br/><br/>However, that being said its definitely a watchable film. Its not a bad film. Its actually quite enjoyable if you haven't read the books I guess as its regarded a very bad adaption."
"mrshev","7","0","3","25 October 2012"," Excellent Adaptation
","Adapted from the book of the same name I found myself constantly comparing the book to the film - that is inevitable - and because of that I struggled to separate the book from the film. <br/><br/>The film is very faithful to the book (even though it obviously has to cut a few corners in terms of narrative) and this is both to it's credit and to it's detriment. On one hand the book is great and veering away from that would be a mistake...on the other hand if you had read the book then it felt a little bit like a dramatisation of the novel scene-for-scene and as I imagine most of the audience would have already read the book it becomes somewhat predictable. There is also the problem that the romantic stage play that Catniss is part of is very much a battle of conscience for her in the novel but is portrayed as a simple love story in the movie.<br/><br/>That being said I liked the way the film was shot and the sombre colour palette used - that was a bit of a surprise. I thought the acting was very good and the realisation of The Capital and the actual arena were skilfully crafted and well thought out - they were almost as I imagined them. <br/><br/>It's just that I can recall a few novel adaptations that enhanced their origins; Harry Potter, Misery, Blade Runner, The Shining, One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest - all were adaptations that resulted in films that were very watchable whether you had read the book or not...because they were great films. I still remember being shocked, surprised and delighted watching these films even though I knew the story. <br/><br/>So although this is a very, very good film it is not the best book adaptation I have ever seen."

","The Hunger Games. Now, to start this off, I did not read the books. I will not make any remarks on adaptation.<br/><br/>On the whole, I thought this film was generally good. I didn't get the hype, and quite frankly, I was afraid it was going to be another teen hype, with Twilight as its ancestor. However, I saw the trailer, and I heard a variety of comments telling me that it was nothing like a classic teen movie. Voices told me it was suspenseful, it was good, and it was in a way, terrifying.<br/><br/>Now I'm not sure about the terrifying part, although I must say, seeing films, reading about historical events and reading experiments, I'm always surprised by the human mind. People would go into all ends to save their own skin. This story portrayed this well, though maybe that's more to thank Suzanne Collins for than the makers of the film.<br/><br/>I believed that the story was indeed, suspenseful. It started off, introducing the main character, Katniss Everdeen (played by Jennifer Lawrence) and the district. From this, you could conclude that district 12 is poor in comparison to the rest of the world, and you could see that Katniss was a tough, young and adventurous young woman. This didn't last in my eyes. The character development was in some ways not very strong. Katniss went from a strong, independent, young woman to a woman who'd trust too quickly. In the end of the film, I believed her to be weak. Furthermore, you didn't get to know the other characters at all, save from Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) and Rue (Amandla Stenberg). I didn't care who died and who lived, save from the latter (Rue), who in my eyes, did a wonderful job of portraying a strong girl, brave until the very end.<br/><br/>I did get amazed by the reality of it all, considering the story. People going crazy on the outside, publishers doing anything to keep it interesting and tributes who'd do literally anything to save there own skin. I was content to see that this was not merely a love story, and that it actually involved some visible killing (since that was where the hunger games were all about wasn't it? Killing and survival). I also like the cinematography. The camera-work was wonderful, creating that shaking effect whenever something was happening (think running, bombs and killing). However, occasionally, it was too rushed, too shaking. Even though you did get to see the killing, it left loads of it up to your own imagination. Bit pitiful, you didn't get to see what was really going on at that exact moment.<br/><br/>But overall, I think this was not a waste of my time. It isn't always the case, but in this film, the suspense weighed more than the faults. - That's why I've given it a royal 7/10."
"charles-semon","7","0","3","1 October 2012"," A rather well done movie.
","I recently rented this movie (Three days ago to be exact). I was a little apprehensive about renting it because from what I had seen I had related it to something the likes of Twilight but, I was pleasantly surprised. I rather enjoyed it. Although it does seem mildly campy in some areas (The capital high class people) but, that is to be expected of a futuristic high class society so I must applaud them for the look, the colors were vibrant and the characters were well portrayed. Now I also went into the movie thinking that it was going to be one of those PG-13 movies that would be rather bland on the action and that it'd probably be one of the ones that it would still be alright to take a kid along to and again, I was surprised. I KNEW the premise was was 12-18 year old kids fighting to the death but I did NOT expect it to be as graphic as it was. In the first few moments when they when they're raised into the arena in front of the cornucopia I expected a couple kills but, I did NOT expect a slaughterhouse. Overall a pretty good movie and I look forward to see where the sequels go."
"Fizgig777","Null","0","2","30 September 2012"," Watchable, but not great
","I'll preface the review with the fact that I did not read the book(s) it was based on. While, an avid reader, it's normally not the type of book I'd pick up with any great interest. However, the movie trailer got my attention as did the premise behind it. Not having heard of the book(s), it struck me as a more unique and interesting story than the usual fare offered in movies these days.<br/><br/>The movie wasn't terrible. It has issues, though. Without nitpicking at the little things, the biggest short-coming is the lack of character development. It's hard to get emotionally invested in any of them because there's very little effort made (or maybe just very little success) to give the characters any real depth or characteristics that a viewer can really identify with. There are just too many holes in the story.... How the world got where it got and so on...<br/><br/>So, in short.... The movie was watchable, but it obviously fell very short of what it could have been. I really feel that they should've gone with better, more extensively detail in their adaptation of the book and taken the R-rating that would obviously have come with it. The teenage drama they tried to make believable just didn't work given the context (even their version of it) and the lack of character development.<br/><br/>While I can't call this type of movie ""entertainment"" given the context, it does make one think and question the depths of depravity people can fall to.... Is such a world so far-fetched? Might not be..."

","The Hunger Games completely took me by surprise. After seeing the advertising and realizing that Jennifer Lawrence was chosen for the lead role, I was positive this would be a good movie. When I saw the movie, yesterday, my expectations were... moderately fulfilled.<br/><br/>The movie has strong points such as the lead actors.<br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence was great as Katniss Everdeen. She was awesome in X- Men: First Class. I admit that she was the only reason I watched this movie. I haven't read the books, but Jennifer is the right person to convey Katniss's development as a warrior and as a person.<br/><br/>Josh Hutcherson was an ""okay"" choice as Peeta Mellark. I don't exactly put too much attention to his career. There is nothing else I can say about him.<br/><br/>The odds were not exactly in Liam Hemsworth's favor. I did like his performance as Gale Hawthorne. I admit I only know him because he is Chris Hemsworth's brother and Miley Cyrus' boyfriend. Unfortunately, he is only a glorified, advertised extra.<br/><br/>The action scenes were great, but some of them are not awe-inspiring. In fact there are some scenes that are downright terrifying. Maybe that's the point, but I didn't buy that.<br/><br/>What I didn't like is the overall tone of the film. When I became aware of the premise, I knew The Hunger Games wasn't going to be set in a big, happy world, but too actually see it... I don't know what to say. It is very bittersweet at best, and borderline depressing at worst.<br/><br/>Still, it is an enjoyable movie. I recommend it."

","I thought this was an entertaining movie on the first viewing. It got me interested enough to read the books, which were pretty addictive on their own. I don't think either this movie or the books have much repeat watch/read value for me. I thought Jennifer Lawrence was a good choice, but she was more effective in Winter's Bone. In that movie, she played a similar character with similar motivations--a girl from a poor family struggling for her survival. But after I read the third book, it negated much of the admiration I had for the character, whereas in Winter's Bone, when the movie ended, I really felt like the character had accomplished something. So skip this movie and the whole Hunger Games trilogy and just go see Winter's Bone."

","When I looked at the cast and saw Jennifer Lawrence I told myself that this movie is something.In my opinion she is a very talented teen that deserves better and greater chance to prove herself. I remember her career in winter's bone which she was a girl trying to find her father and protect her family and save their house. In this movie as well she has a young sister that she must participate in a foolish game and surely she will be dead but she volunteers and won't let her little sister get hurt. Although she acted nice in movie but I think the opposite role ""Josh Hutcherson"" was bad a choice.I think they should switch the roles of Hutcherson and Hemsworth because he has more talent and of course More sexier. Hemsworth has a short career and seemed to be just a friend for katniss than a lover . though we never see these two kiss each other even when Hemsworth come to says goodbye. In other hand Hutcherson was more like a little kid to me than a lover warrior. and I don't understand what Elizabeth banks doing in movie with that funny make up. script is good but at the end it will be a little cliché . The two lovers decide to die together but the authorities won't let them and made them both wins and they return home happily ever after. But who will be her boyfriend ? Gale or Peeta ? Maybe we find out in the second part."
"t_maly","5","0","2","23 September 2012"," Full of potential, but fell short
","I found the dystopian premise interesting - in a seemingly totalitarian future - kinda a mix of the blind obedience of 1984 and the sensuality of Brave New World - children are sacrificed to fight to the death as some remembrance of a rebellion. As hard as the powers to be try to show it in a prideful light, you just can't help but see the sham that it is, how gladiator type of games of punishment towards the working class are turned into frivolous entertainment.<br/><br/>It sounds a lot like society of today. I kept on trying to think about how this dystopia compares to here and now. We have capitalism which we are all on board with thinking is a great thing, but it becomes a dog-eat-dog situation that we rarely really question about being on top or not. We all desire to be on top and yet only a small percentage can be so. The rest of us are moderately compensated with half-decent lifestyles or mostly downtrodden.<br/><br/>This is where the potential lies in this book/movie, but it falls short because I kept expecting the main protagonists to rebel against the games somehow. After all, the whole thing is a show of entertainment, one based in the punishment and suffering of random people for things they have nothing to do with. In the end I found it interesting they'd rather die together than one kill the other - but when the games were suddenly over because of this threat to the entertainment value, and they went on their merry business like they were just glad it was over (instead of being outraged at those who manage these events). I found that incredibly disappointing and the fact that the movie/book lacks this moral makes it feel like the main characters aren't intelligent or worth liking at all. It has all sorts of awareness on how much of society is a total show, but something needs to be done about that. Simply being glad to be alive is a cop out, if you ask me. <br/><br/>I also was expecting more rebellion, anger, etc and less butt kissing from these kids. It reminds me of how much high school graduates suck up to colleges to get admitted, and how college graduates suck up to employers to get work. It's all bull, if you ask me. We're selling our souls/lives to others for their gain, and we pretend we actually care about what matters to them just so we get them to want us. To act like we're commodities and bothering 'selling' ourselves is a profound disgust of this society we live in. <br/><br/>I was hoping the kids would band together and realize that they are the target of mutual punishment and mass entertainment, and that the real enemy is NOT each other, but those in charge. They are only there to end up all (but one) being killed, so why go along with sucking up to the public and acting like a bunch of drama-loving superficial celebrities? It was disturbing how quickly they went to kill each other, and I sincerely hope that such kind of behavior is not in our nature. I would only hope for a future where our children learn to come together to fight bigger enemies than the minor quibbles with each other. I sincerely hope that our youth have the smarts to defy the rules realizing that our world is rigged rather than comply and fight over scraps in the process.<br/><br/>I also found that the whole romance thing between the boy and girl was an interesting thing to 'milk', but I found it so artificial. Obviously he had a crush on her, but I felt like her advancements towards him were out of place, even with the intimate setting of mutual injury and survival. He didn't seem like the kind of guy you'd want her with. His character was so underdeveloped. I felt it was also out of place to introduce in the beginning the friendship she had with the other teen boy from their district only to interject this romance story with some boy she's hardly noticed. I was also waiting for this 2nd guy to somehow find a way to enter the grounds of the game to help her out, etc. It just felt out of place for the other guy to be introduced and that storyline not be fully developed or get some closure on.<br/><br/>You know you've watched a movie based upon a children's/teens' book when you have underbaked stories and sub-stories, no overall moral, and action/violence shown off like it's okay. At least with R-rated films like the James Bond movies, you get a feeling that the guns and violence are okay because it's a 'good vs evil' thing. In a lot of half-baked children/teen books, there is no concept of 'good vs evil'. It just advocates gratuitous violence for no reason.<br/><br/>The total lack of an overall morality when it's so blatant that there should be, just leaves this among a certain fatalistic viewpoint that sadly promulgates a lifestyle of senseless pleasure rather than purposeful living. I feel bad for our youth when they are given stories that are severely lacking in morality. What exactly do they walk away with from all this? In the end, the two main characters end up going along with the sham of an entertainment show. The girl says exactly what the audience wants to hear for mass entertainment, instead of speaking of her true heart and putting these atrocious games in their place.<br/><br/>Our youth absolutely NEED morals to our stories. They need to be told to rebel against a rigged system rather than just be grateful to be alive in the end of a violent lifestyle."
"JackCerf","6","0","1","22 September 2012"," Not Hungry Enough
","A safe, workmanlike adaptation of a much stronger book. The book was told in Katnis's interior monologue. The film had to be opened up so that it could be shown, using Ceasar and Seneca as expositors. (Seneca's death was cleverly done.) But, as many have pointed out, the story was heavily sanitized to get a PG-13 rating. Since author and co-writer Collins is an experienced screenwriter for tween TV, I assume she knew the choices she was making. Here's a partial list:<br/><br/>Haymitch drinks a bit much but is not introduced as an apparently non-functioning alcoholic.<br/><br/>No avoxes.<br/><br/>As to violence, the initial melee at the Cornucopia was OK -- Katniss's own impressions were fragmentary as she grabbed the backpack and ran. Glimmer's screaming death from tracker jacker stings was ghastly enough. But Rue's death was seriously blanded down. In the book Katniss has to watch her be speared, she shoots the D1 boy in the throat, and she watches him drown in his own blood with angry satisfaction. Not in the movie -- it's quick cuts and clean wounds, and an Old Hollywood death scene. As the emotional high point of the story, it called for Private Ryan.<br/><br/>We don't see Katniss overcoming her disgust to clean the pus out of Peeta's wound, and Peeta doesn't lose his leg.<br/><br/>Biggest problem is no hunger. It's not just that Lawrence looked nothing like a 16 year old who's been underfed her whole life. It's that in the book food and hunger are central to Katniss's view of the world. She constantly thinks about both. At home she's glad to get a bowl of wild dog soup when she can. Bread is her first connection to Peeta. What impresses her about the Capitol is the endless supply of exquisite things to eat. She comprehends its wealth by figuring out how much time and effort it would take her to duplicate one dish. In her interview, saying that she's most impressed by the lamb stew projects her as a real country girl from the boondocks. In the arena she starts out half dead and delirious from thirst, spends most of her time hunting, and is always aware of exactly how much food she has on hand. She bonds with Rue over their shared experience of hunger back home -- Rue gets to eat a whole groosling leg for the only time in her short life. D11 thanks her for Rue's funeral with bread. None of that makes it through the adaptation. It could have, with a little more time at the Hob, some different dialog, and with gaze and reaction shots. Without the hunger, it's a much more routine adventure story than it should have been."

Unfortunately I am not a die hard Hunger Games series fan and saw the film having not read the book, but after being pleasantly surprised by a somewhat intriguing story line and an (almost) original idea,I found myself delving into the book for a better look at the Hunger Games world. I'm pleased to say the film stayed true to the book with only a few tweaks here and there (minor story altercations, no doubt to make the film a bearable 142 minutes long). <br/><br/>As a huge fan of post apocalyptic movies I went into the film with high hopes and came out with them still intact and non-trampled.

","Let me start by saying this: this was a decent movie. It is one of those movies which is just that: a movie. There is nothing special about it, and you can't REALLY complain. <br/><br/>But yes, yes you can. This movie has taken a book with a great message and turned it into a whole other thing - which it is really not. This is not some random book-nerd's rampage against the movie not being exactly like he imagined it, but I will tell you about the book to state my point. <br/><br/>The book is about how people live off fear, violence and gore. We love it. The more violence the better. DRAMA, DRAMA, DRAMA. We worship it. The book criticizes this part of us - by implicitly stating that it has once happened before (gladiator fights etc.) and by referring to the society we live in today. A society almost drowning in reality TV-shows which make the self-absorbed participants victims of our desire for ""blood"".<br/><br/>But the movie.. It doesn't show that at all. It is playing on the same boat that it was trying to sink. <br/><br/>To make something good out of something that is already good, is not an accomplishment. For an adaptation to be good it has to bring something new to the story, or at least casting a light on the book that will bring forth the best of it. This adaptation does nothing of the sort. <br/><br/>And I'm not saying the book is 100 % right and good and all that. But the movie.. it's bad - super bad! When all of that is said: it is entertaining to watch. It is not badly made and the costumes are rather great. It is just souless and empty. That's it. Another shallow Hollywood production, reminding us all, that money and art can't go together anymore. <br/><br/><ul><li>And don't get me started on Jeniffer Lawrence. She is a great actress, but this role is not fit for her. She is too old, and (sorry) too fat, to play a starving teenager! - and even though she is doing a great job she is not entirely believable in this role. She was picked for the movie, so it would sell more tickets, and while that IS an honest motive, it is not the right motive, when what you are making is a criticism of just that same concept - the heartless capitalistic money-making focus that has surrounded the movie entertainment business. It would be like making a movie out of ""The Catcher in the Rye"", when Holden explicitly states in the book, that he hates movies.</li></ul>"

But what it really has is a wafer thin story line and themes that have been hashed out numerous times. Most characters perform with conviction as they play roles that go through desperation, fear and display of primal instinct. Apart from this, nothing stood out for me. Most of the aspects felt generic like the special effects, background score, screenplay void of any twists etc. With not having read the books, I couldn't see where this plot could ever lead to spawning 3 more sequels.<br/><br/>Lawrence gave her best and is worth watching for her.

The sound tracks of the film could have been more impressive and majestic and I felt that music was not played at the right points of the movie. The final wolf seen was well done, with a good surprise and exhilaration. More emphasis could be placed on district twelve but the tribute selection was quite intense. If the film had been extended it would have been beneficial, and although those who didn't read the books found the movie very good, those who did may have thought it boring and it was. They persisted too much on Peeta and Katniss' romance and not the the action. Overall an average but recommendable film.

A good concept (OK its not original) is wrecked by plywood performances all round, and staggeringly boring set pieces that fail on most levels to excite or engage. The first act within the district is almost interesting yet frustratingly light on detail. Its a wafer light depiction of a future totalitarian society that simply never convinces.

","Suphie Wesner 9/13/2012<br/><br/>Movie Review for the Hunger Games: Produced in Year 2012 AD Well, actors Liam Hemsworth (current beau/fiancée of Miley Ray Cyrus), Josh Hutcherson, as Peeta Melark (a fictional name, of course), Lenny Kravitz, Stanley Tucci, as Caesar Flickerman, and others, including, not to be stingy, (the mother of the protagonist), verified as complete as well as actors and actresses, in the following order: Jennifer Lawrence, who played the role of 16-year-old Katniss Everdeen in The Hunger Games, a film based in post-apocalyptic North-American, conglomerate, ""Panam.""<br/><br/>Indeed, this movie is very reminiscent of the types of mind-control that sometimes, people are capable of producing, and, going through, themselves. It is a very scary situation that, the character (our heroine, but, also our victim, must face). The book itself was written by an authoress named Suzanne Collins. Indeed, in the scene, ""Very Lethal"" one can tell what that chapter of the movie, film, Hollywood production, or just about whatever you want to call it, must be about. It turns out to be about fire-balls being thrown everywhere by another group of simply evil animals, and they choose her as their main target, for some odd reason. The whole point of the movie appears to be, to the lay-viewer, again (this is just my point of view, so, again, don't mind me), showing the desire, or the fear, that one who is avoiding death at all costs must have to go through; it is not pretty, as new hurdles keep getting thrown in her direction by the unkind, non-compassionate, game-show hosts. All in all, though, I do not have time to finish this darling review which is quite near and dear to my heart; the film is quite bloody, though I wouldn't say there is much gore, per se, visible until the end (the movie palpably builds up the gory suspense, as when the panthers eat away the body of a teenaged-boy and the lead-role characters mercifully pierce his body dead with an arrow). But the truth be told, it is a very gory, very violent, and uniquely immoral film; unique and insightful, I say because it supposedly does teach us about the threatening destruction that can be wrought by harmful, by violent, by people-devaluing, horrible societies, and new world orders, so to speak, but it does not teach us anything about how to do something about it. The best moral lesson that this film offers, indeed, is the tried and true moral morsel of wisdom that love conquers all (the girl in it, and the boy in it, Peeta, and the leading actress played by Jennifer Lawrence), sharing is caring, and, indeed, that ""thou shalt not kill..."" In general, though, if so many of our American youth (it is, after all, an American film, so, this notion is not far-fetched want to kill each other, then this film might be the very reason that people like James Holmes do what they do... Why else would A few fictional elements are thrown into the film, too, to make it more realistic: mocking jays, a bird by whose call one can figure out the time, night-shade berries that are supposedly so venomous that they will kill you ""in a minute"", and even some huge packs of modern wasps, as well as computers that are designed to conjure up a pack of panthers in minutes. It is all too much to believe, that the new race of humans could have so much hatred, for each other, certainly, but it is the evolution of the human race here. Hatred from man to man, back-biting, and, indeed, lots, and lots of ""games-sponsored"" killing, and efforts to weed one another out at the expense of their lives, and to save one's own life, is the reality portrayed in The Hunger Games. Gary Ross, was the twisted director. To give one's imagination some clue as to how horrid this film portrays the human race in the year 3,000, or so, one merely has to turn to the praise given by Writer and producer Stephen Spielburg to the movie, whose own books border on the sci-fi, horror, and social engineering to make man more ""perfect."" Indeed, ""perfect"" at the expense of cruel devastation and destruction, is what this society has achieved in its own barbarous way; people all look like one another, they all wear weird, outlandish costumes, they wear their hair oddly, and they even wear strange make-up. People who want to participate in the games are told to dress in this Lady Gaga-esque garb, and they even get waxed, manicured, and steamed up, but at the cost that their lives might be spent, later...It is not worth it as producer and director Gary Ross tries to tell us, I think, societal perfection will never be achieved through wearing blue wigs, trying to tell the teen public that they must form districts, clans, and posses, and then try to kill each other, out-maneuvering one another, sneakily, and ""out-couraging"" each other, if you will. Unity doesn't come from too much destruction, anyway; one simply has to try to use one's judgment, and be discerning... Only then can we achieve, the ""perfect society."" Not by stealing other people's food, as they try to do in the games, even to the extent of blowing up ""apple carts,"" nor by being so mean to each other that one tries to kill off someone's boyfriend (as happens in the film), out of jealousy of their love, nor by trying to eliminate other teams, simply out of rivalry, nor by killing little children out of cowardice, nor by declaring that ""one only"" can be the winner. These are all sick fallacies of judgment, and must be stopped. Declaring that one style, one type, one race only can be allowed, these are all perversions of judgment. They are not only highly detrimental to any type of peace-loving society, they are destructive, war-loving, and sick, ill, mentally unhealthy."

Amazingly, they have.<br/><br/>I've just finished watching The Hunger Games with my 11-year-old daughter (who kindly gave me a running commentary on exactly how the film compares with the book) and was amazed at just how much I enjoyed its grim dystopian vision—a post apocalyptic world where freaky future-folk with crazy multi-coloured hair happily watch a group of kids killing each other with a variety of sharp/pointy things in an arena where genetically altered killer wasps, computer-controlled forest fires, and mutant man-eating dogs also present a very real danger.<br/><br/>With decent direction from Gary Ross, a fine central performance from the rather lovely Jennifer Lawrence (who reminds me of a young Renee Zellweger, which ain't a bad thing), plus memorable supporting turns from Woody Harrelson (so cool), Isabelle Fuhrman (so scary), and Donald Sutherland (so loathsome), I have to admit that the film was a lot more fun than I expected it to be."

","Occupying the familiar milieu of one of science-fictions' most well worn conceits, the dystopian future society, in this case an impoverished set of states ruled over by a decadent totalitarian elite, teenager Katniss Everdeen hunts and scrapes to keep her family alive until fate forces her to volunteer as ""tribute"" for the annual Hunger Games, a form of brutal gladiatorial combat designed to keep the masses in their place. Twenty-four youngsters will enter but only one can come out alive.<br/><br/>With Harry Potter now done and dusted, and the finish line of Twilight just around the corner it's no surprise that studios have been hunting for the next big teen-lit franchise to bring to the screen, or that Suzanne Collins' mega-selling sci-fi adventure would be one of those in the frame. But in spite of the driving linear narrative, featuring plenty of set-piece thrills and a love-triangle backdrop, adapting The Hunger Games, with its sullen heroin, extensive internal monologue, bleak atmosphere and brutal violence, may not have been the safe bet one might assume, and director Gary Ross and colleagues have trodden a tricky balancing act to a surprisingly effective outcome.<br/><br/>Crucial to their success is Jennifer Lawrence; already a rising star after her Oscar-nominated performance in ""Winter's Bone"" and who, as Katniss, delivers just the right combination of introspection, steely determination and just a touch of vulnerability. But much credit too must be given to the support of Woody Harrelson and Elizabeth Banks as her drunken mentor and absurdly coiffured escort respectively, both of whom carry roles that could easily have tipped into parody with much restraint. Indeed restraint could be the watchword for the whole production. On the page, the description of Capitol City's preening, rococo fashionistas seemed worryingly likely to translate to the screen with Fifth Element style campery. But this is kept firmly in check by an atmosphere of quietly unsettling disconnect from reality, always underplayed, and always taken seriously, underscoring the juxtaposition of the hollow, vacuous lives led by these privileged bourgeoisie against the spartan hand-to-mouth existence that is the only way of life our protagonist has ever known. Indeed these act-one sequences contain some of the film's best moments, effectively pulling the audience into Katniss' isolation and dreadful predicament with minimal fuss.<br/><br/>Once the games themselves kick into action, the need to achieve a target-audience friendly 12A rating does start to assert itself somewhat. The Hunger Games does not need graphic violence to deliver the thrills, but it does need things to become truly desperate, and in this regard the film seems to pull a few too many punches, with some deaths passing perhaps a touch inconsequentially, and little visible signs of the physical stresses of exposure, hunger and injury showing on the always clean and presentable contestants (or even evidence of stubble on the male team members after several days in the game). It's here also that the film makes its greatest departure from the book. Rightly judging the difficulty of relating some events via the first-person internal narrative of our heroine, fresh scenes are introduced depicting the power-brokers and puppeteers behind the games. It's a logical departure from the source structure that just occasionally falters by delivering a few ham-fisted Basil Exposition moments, but, by way of compensation, adds to the implicit parallels with modern-day TV and the trend towards ever more ghastly and extreme ""reality"" entertainment.<br/><br/>Much has been made of the similarity of Hunger Games' concept to that of ""Battle Royale"", and clearly a debt is owed. But while that Japanese subversive cult favourite is very explicitly an adult piece of satire that happens to feature school-kids bludgeoning each other to death, this is by intent a much more straight-ahead adventure, and the setting owes at least as much to the classic dystopian visions of ""1984"", particularly the impressively monumental authoritarian architecture. But as the downtrodden citizens watch on helplessly and those in charge manipulate the results for their own ends, I began to recall another movie that is perhaps the most interesting and unexpected antecedent: ""The Truman Show"", and like that brilliant work, The Hunger Games ends a touch ambiguously, leaving you with a lingering and disturbing question ""would you watch too?""."
"barnabyrudge","6","0","3","13 September 2012"," Good - not great - opening salvo in the Hunger Games trilogy.
","Based on the first novel in Suzanne Collins' bestselling trilogy, The Hunger Games is a film that gives itself an extraordinary amount of hype to live up to. Overall it is a pretty good film, but there's a nagging sense throughout that this is just an appetite whetter, a starter course if you like, for something bigger and better and that the forthcoming parts 2 and 3 are likely to provide a meatier main course and more fulfilling dessert.<br/><br/>In post-apocalyptic North America, now known simply as Panem, the wealthy Capitol is surrounded by twelve deprived districts. Each year, a ritual known as the Reaping takes place where a boy and a girl from each district is selected by the Capitol authorities to compete in a savage televised contest called the Hunger Games. They are placed in an outdoor arena and forced to fight to the death over a number of days and weeks until one victor remains.When weak 12 year old Primrose Everdeen (Willow Shields) is chosen to be the female representative from District 12, her older sister Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) steps in and offers to take her place. Katniss is a skilled archer and has a far greater chance of survival in such a brutal competition. The other competitor from District 12 is Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson), a baker's son who once helped Katniss and her family by providing them with bits of bread when they were starving. In the battle arena the 24 combatants quickly split into various cliques, some forming into marauding groups intent on helping each other to wipe out the strays and loners; others going solo and trying to survive independently for as long as possible.<br/><br/>Straight away, a quick scan of the plot synopsis invites comparison to other films and stories. The concept of televised fight-your-rivals-to-the-death is reminiscent of The Running Man (1987) and the hunting-humans-for-sport theme dates all the way back to The Most Dangerous Game (1932). Then there's the Japanese cult hit Battle Royale which seems strikingly similar to The Hunger Games some have criticised Suzanne Collins for ripping off that story, although she has always maintained that any similarities are purely coincidental. Lawrence is very good as Katniss in a part which may lack the depth and richness of her breakthrough role in Winter's Bone, but is still interesting enough to earn her plenty of well-deserved plaudits. Apart from Katniss's District 12 compatriot Peeta, the other contestants are not really built sufficiently as a group of characters. Most disappointing of all is the under-development of the main bad guy, a born-to-kill fighting machine named Cato (Alexander Ludwig). Little snippets of Cato's lethal prowess are shown along the way, but nowhere near enough to make his rivalry a truly meaningful suspense device in the film. The plot is certainly intriguing and thought-provoking. Director Gary Ross gives the film a slick, polished look throughout and makes sure all of the $78 million budget is up there on the screen. Whatever else you might think, there's no denying that this is a great-looking film. The film ultimately falls short of the hype it's a good movie, yes, but not a great one. Does this trilogy have the staying power to develop into something genuinely outstanding? Only time will tell, but there's more than a glimmer that a truly great movie is lurking somewhere in the continuing adventures of Katniss Everdeen."

","I recently purchased this last Wednesday after being rather unimpressed by it when I saw it at the cinema and I have to say, it was better than I remember. When I first saw it in April, I wasn't too fussed by it, I felt it skimmed the book instead of going into detail and it was a fairly forgettable film. When I watched it again, it was pretty good. The setting is decent and the score is also really good(James Newton Howard, Dinosaur and Peter Pan, 'nuff said). If there is one criticism I would make about it, it would be that it doesn't go into the detail the book did. But they did what they could to remain it as a 12 and for what detail it does go into to, it's not bad. It was close to being a 15 anyway so I would have put in the depth and rate it 15, but that's my opinion. Overall, fairly decent and not the worst book-film transition I've seen."
"Darkweasel","6","0","2","11 September 2012"," Flawed but still reasonably entertaining.
","First things first. Firstly, no, I haven't read the books. Secondly, writing this as a 40 year old bloke, I have had to realise that The Hunger Games may not exactly be directed towards my specific demographic. Therefore, looking at it a little differently, like maybe I was writing this as a 15 year old girl who liked good looking boys, fearless heroines and had never seen Big Brother, The Truman Show, Battle Royale, The Running Man, or Logan's Run then I would have to say it was the bestest, most originalest film I've ever seen. LOL.<br/><br/>Er, so anyway... It's the old dystopian future scenario but this time, and as well as featuring some dubious looking wigs, comedy teeth, and daft costumes, the future now has twelve Districts and a Capitol, and each year two teenagers (1 boy and 1 girl) are chosen to fight in something called The Hunger Games. What the Hunger Games are is never fully explained and is all a bit confusing as everybody looks healthy and very well fed indeed.<br/><br/>Trained and mentored by drunk-one-moment-completely-coherent- the-next Woody Harrelson, our good looking hero and ballsy heroine types have to fight 22 other ""Tributes"" to the death to become the eventual winner. A flimsy reason for this is given and glossed over by a perpetually grumpy Donald Sutherland who plays his character with all the depth of a surly pantomime villain. But, I have to remember, I am a fifteen year old girl so I probably don't notice these kind of things. <br/><br/>So off we go into the woods full of baddies, genetically engineered wasps, the occasional help package, some magic dogs, and out of place love stories. Truth be told though, once the action starts and the pace picks up it's not actually too bad. During some parts, even to someone as weary and over-the-hill as myself it actually became quite enjoyable. Sure, it had to make some sacrifices to get it out to a wider (younger and more impressionable) audience, in that the violence is so toned down that even though over twenty people are killed, only a couple of them show any signs that their bodies actually contained blood in the first place.<br/><br/>Still, as enjoyable as some of it is, the lack of explanation to certain things (what's that three fingered salute all about?) and the glossing over of major plot points make the film something far less that great. And without trying to give the ending away, are we really expected to believe that in 74 years of the Hunger Games, and with seemingly every base covered with evil strategies and aided by some seriously superfangled technology, the situation we're faced with at movie's climax has never once arisen before and has absolutely no contingency plan in place to nullify it? <br/><br/>Apparently, there are one or two more films still to come so I can only hope they serve to shed more light on an enjoyable, if very flawed first film.<br/><br/>6.5/10"
"ezanini","7","0","3","7 September 2012"," HG Movie-Book Comparison
","Suzanne Collins sold 200,000 copies of her book, The Hunger Games after one year of publishing. The box office sold over $200 million in tickets in the first week of the movie release. Did the movie really deserve the millions of views it got? The Hunger Games is about a game in which 2 tributes from each of the 12 districts compete in a game to the death. When Katniss volunteers for her sister as tribute, she tells about her feelings and the process of being a tribute in the Hunger Games, emotionally and physically. The Hunger Games movie is far less powerful than the Hunger Games book because it didn't give deep detail about the personalities, events, and emotions of the characters.<br/><br/>The Hunger Games movie doesn't show the Character's personalities as in depth in the book. From chapter 15-18, the book talks about Rue and her relationship with Katniss. Particularly on pg. 208 when Katniss says, ""Rue has decided to trust me whole heartedly. I know this because as soon as the anthem finishes, she snuggles up against me and falls asleep. Nor do I have any misgivings about her, as I take no particular precautions."" The movie doesn't show Rue's relationship with Katniss, which makes it seem that Katniss was exaggerating when Rue died. This evidence proves that the movie is far less powerful and interesting in comparison to the book because of the deep connection between the characters that we are able to witness. In chapter 2, Katniss talks about her Dad and how he died in a coal mining accident. On pg. 26, Katniss says, ""My father had been killed in the mine accident three months earlier in the bitterest January anyone could remember. The numbness of his loss had passed, and the pain would hit me out of nowhere, doubling me over, racking my body with sobs."" She also explains how her mother ""shut down"" which left her the responsibility to feed and take care of her family. This describes Katniss and how she came to be a great hunter and resilient young woman. The movie scarcely mentions her dad at all, which makes Katniss's personality seem different from what it truly is. This evidence proves that the movie is far less powerful and interesting because Katniss's life is interesting, and if you leave out a big part of her life, she isn't as interesting. Chapter 1 explains Gale and his personality and relationship with Katniss. On page 6, Katniss says, ""In the woods waits the only person with whom I can be myself. Gale."" This shows how Gale and Katniss are close, and not just strangers. The movie shows short scenes of Gale which makes him seem different from what he is really like. The movie makes the book seem far less powerful. This evidence proves that the movie is far less powerful and interesting because without the personalities of the Character's, the story would be confusing and dull.<br/><br/>The Hunger Games movie fails to include crucial events that happened in the book. One example can be found on pg. 49 when Katniss throws away the cookies that she received as a parting gift from Peeta's dad. She says she doesn't want them to fool her by being nice so Peeta can plan a strategy to kill her in the arena. The book doesn't show this scene, and doesn't really show anything about Katniss thinking that Peeta is a threat to her. This proves that the movie fails to include crucial events that happened in the book. Another example that proves that the movie fails to include crucial events can be found on pg. 38 when Katniss gets the Mockingjay pin from Madge. She later thinks about her friendship with Madge in the arena which gives her hope and pushes her to keep going and not give up, unlike the movie. The movie doesn't include Madge at all, which proves that the movie is far less interesting than the book because the crucial detail is very important in the story line. The final example can be found on pg. 168-171 when Katniss almost dies from dehydration. When she is in this situation, she thinks about Haymitch and if he really cared about her enough to send her some water so she wouldn't die. On page 170 when Katniss says, ""I have misjudged Haymitch. He has no intention of helping me at all."" In the movie, Katniss gets water immediately. She doesn't have to ponder about Haymitch and if he really cared enough about her to save her. This event was very important in my eyes, which proves that the movie is far less powerful than the book due to the fact that it failed to include crucial events.<br/><br/>Although the Hunger Games movie was nothing in comparison to the book, it was a fun, action-packed, and interesting movie. I would recommend that you see the movie, but I also recommend that you read the book. The Hunger Games movie was far less powerful compared to the book because it didn't include some of the characters' personalities, crucial events, and Katniss's emotions. The book was more engaging and interesting because of its deep detail, so I STRONGLY believe the Hunger Games movie is far less powerful than the Hunger Games book. I can confidently say the Hunger Games movie was far less powerful than the book."
"badgerboy1977","6","0","2","7 September 2012"," Not exactly bad but certainly not great either.
","Not having read the book I can't say how true it is to that version but for me the basic premise seemed fairly flawed, the reason for the games just didn't have enough weight behind it and left you not really rooting for the main characters enough.<br/><br/>Also they're were other instances where the story didn't seem to hang together, one example for me was how the young lad it seemed purely due to the fact he'd decorated cakes was able to fashion extremely convincing rock and bark disguises that completely hid him from sight out of very little.<br/><br/>It's hard not to draw comparisons between this and for example the Japanese film Battle Royale which isn't perfect but had much more emotion and edge to it.<br/><br/>This isn't to say its all bad, its always good to see Donald Sutherland and there were some fairly clever moments in the look, feel and some action sequences but overall it just felt a little hollow."
"miumiu66","7","0","3","5 September 2012"," The Hunger Games---be hunting or hunted
","The name of this movie is The Hunger Games, which is combined with two words: Hunger and Games. So what is hunger? Hunger for what？ If it is so-called Games, who are the players? What are they hungry for? The nation of Panem is set up in a post-apocalyptic land (I wouldn't say North America, because it could be anywhere after the end of civilization) with a Utopian city, which is called ""Capitol"". The Capitol is not only the capital of this land, but more likes a representation of the hegemony of a totalitarian government. It's a magnificent city. People living there are enjoy with food, costumes, jewelry, energy and hi-technology that are supported by the other 12 districts outside of the Capitol. The protagonists, Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark, are reaped form District 12, a place full of nothing but poor and starvation. These districts are under control of Capitol, and of the dictatorial President Snow.<br/><br/>Come back to the questions. Who are the players? Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark or the President Snow? For Katniss and Peeta the hunger is starving, and they are hungry for surviving; for the President Snow (and his staff) the hunger is controlling, and he is hungry for power. The land is totally divided into two parts, inside of the Capitol and outside of it. Or, we can simply say the heaven and hell. If Capitol is defined as a Utopian city, we must understand the concept of Utopia. Utopia is an ideal community or society possessing a desirable socio-politico-legal system. Chronologically, the first recorded Utopian proposal is Plato's Republic. In this place, there is no lawyer because it has few laws to obey; there is few military for resources but not for wars. The wisdom of the rulers will supposedly eliminate poverty and deprivation through fairly distributed resources. But in Panem there is no equality but the cruel laws and military. Inside of the Capitol, people are masked with colorful cosmetics and costumes; they are being served by the red waitresses and protected by the white soldiers, who have no expression or no face at all. Each one looks like elegant and civilized, but they tread the lives of the other districts as games or gamblings. Are they real human beings or a kind of creatures without soul that are produced by the framework of the Capitol? This framework represents the power of politics which is controlled by the government or the upper class group, and also represent that the benefit of this group is bound to stay out of the other districts'. So, actually, the citizen of Capitol are also players. They play their lives under the framework of Panem; they are hungry for losing their positions of the Capitol. They are masked because of the fear; the fear of disobey the rules of the games and then they will lose everything---just like Seneca. I think Seneca is a tragic character. He thinks he is clever enough to surmise the ruler's mind, but unfortunately the power of Snow is not allowed to provoke. Seneca thinks he is mercy, yes, for love, but the mercy of the President is not for him. So his mercy earns him the toxic berries.<br/><br/>As Rousseau's Discourse on Inequality discusses that there is always an inequality, natural or physical and ethical or political, so the real Utopia will be never existed. The hunger games will be go on forever."

","I think what I like about this film the most is the discussion or reviews that people have posted about it. I'm not going to go into the mechanics of the film, only the thoughts and ideas which I had from reading reviews and of course the film itself.<br/><br/>What you get a sense of immediately is post apocalyptic authoritarian future and divided societies, the oppressed and the blood hungry rich, which hold no real new significance. However it serves to remind us that disconnected societies can turn into hateful enemies. Our sense of right and wrong can be shrouded in anger and (possible) vengeful atrocities only send society back into the social dark ages. AhhemcoughsplutterAMERICA!<br/><br/>What comes to mind and many reviews have said is that the contestants would just not fight. That might be the case in some societies but an undeveloped society which is about survival would contain people of this nature and this is the way that the districts are depicted. Of course they have to come across as lovely people and that it's not there fault in anyway so you cheer for them. Thats the boundary at which Hollywood, a politically controlled puppet, will never go beyond and where this movie and so many others lose gravitas. I find it astonishing that everyone argues about realism when talking about movies but never this point.<br/><br/>This takes me into my final intrigue. Some people have mentioned a relevance to Lord of the flies when the games begin and in a small way it does. The loss of innocence and the violent primal nature of selfish individuals against the rational best for all ideal. In turn what I find ironic is the large amount of people complaining about the hand-held camera work so they can't see the violence and killing. The people who have watched this film, gone to the trouble of writing a review about it and have no recognition of their behaviour gives this film even more weight which I find bitterly amusing.<br/><br/>I just flicked this film on when I was bored and I enjoyed it. Of course it's a film for teenagers but a good one. I just find it hilarious that the hormonal viewers thirst for violence only fuels the irony of it's ideology. A bunch of violence hungry people watching a bunch of violence hungry people watching young people fight to the death. It couldn't be more poetic.<br/><br/>Enjoy!"

","Warning, this review contains frequent references to Battle Royale. If you are tired of hearing this comparison, please move along. I have not read the books, so I saw this movie from a blank slate.<br/><br/>My biggest problem with the movie is that it failed to portray the real horror of what exactly is going on. This government is forcing 12-18 year-old kids to fight and die for others' amusement. That's a truly horrifying prospect, but Hunger Games treats it as if it's an everyday occurrence. And in the context of this movie, it might very well be an everyday occurrence, but the audience can't possibly adopt that mindset. Battle Royale shows the Games for what they are: cutthroat, violent and incredibly emotionally taxing. It showed me what goes through a person's mind when he is forced to kill his best friend.<br/><br/>The big problem with a contest-style movie being portrayed from a first-person perspective is that you automatically know who is going to win. Battle Royale averted this problem by portraying the story from a variety of viewpoints. It switched between first and third-person perspectives and focused the battle on several different characters. The winner of the contest was never a clear choice, as no one character could be identified as a ""main"" focus. In Hunger Games, there is no tension or suspense in the storytelling. In fact, the most tense moment in the film lasted for five seconds near the end of the movie when the couple contemplated eating the poisonous berries, thus letting the Games end with no victor.<br/><br/>If you're going to make a movie about children cutting each other to pieces with various pointy things, stop shaking the damn camera! I know this sounds terrible, but I paid money to see teenagers killing each other and dammit, I want to see what's happening.<br/><br/>There is a big problem with your violent, child-assassination movie if I find the culture of this world and the side-characters more interesting than the actual fighting and maiming. Seriously, my favorite character was not the main girl whose name I can't remember. I liked the blue-haired douchebag who hosted the contest. What was his story? I want a movie made about him instead! Also, when I saw the former champion mentor guy, my world exploded when I thought that Owen Wilson was actually doing a good job portraying an interesting character. Imagine that! Owen Wilson is actually ACTING! But then I realized that it was Woody Harrelson and the world promptly un-exploded.<br/><br/>I don't understand what point the movie is trying to get across. It leaves me with so many unanswered questions. Are the Games bad? Do people want to abolish them? What is it about Districts 1 and 2 that they train children to fight from infancy? Why do they train gladiators, but no other district does? If people hate the Games so much, why are they content to surrender their children to die for such a vile practice? If people don't hate the Games, then why don't they all train fighters to bring fame and respect to their district? What was so special about the little black girl that prompted the districts to rebellion? She was a cute little girl, sure, but why should I care about her? Surely she wasn't the first innocent girl to die in the previous 70 Games? What was the deal with the large-chinned guy who stayed behind in District 12? Why was he in the movie? Does he even care that his best friend is kissing another man? I think so, but all he ever does is stare blankly off-screen, so I can't be sure. Why did the other kids trust the blonde guy after he joined their alliance? Shouldn't they know that he is untrustworthy after clearly saying on national television that he is in love with the girl they are trying to kill? Why did they trust his judgment from the very beginning?<br/><br/>All in all, The Hunger Games was an average movie. I liked it, but Battle Royale is by far the better film. I know it may not be fair to compare the two films since they were intended for different audiences, but I can't help it. They are just too similar for me to separate them."

","I was really looking forward to this movie. The idea and what I had seen from trailers appealed to me. However, once the movie got started it didn't. It didn't appeal to me and it took forever to get started. I know there's the development of plot and characters, but this was just beyond tedious. There were all the elements to evoke emotion from the audience. I tend to tear up at a lot of good movies, and at great movies, I just weep. This one didn't get a single tear. I thought the story was written well enough, but though they spent enough time on character development, perhaps they spent too much on the main characters. There were scenes where the elements of love, even sacrificial should have brought more emotion, but died in the scene. There was one good scene which was a salute to the fallen. That one gave me a little warmth. All the moments which could have produced more response from the audience were so singular in nature that there was no momentum. The audience was simply sent packing to the next scene. An okay movie to rent, but wouldn't add it to a collection."
"pferwrit02","4","0","1","27 August 2012"," Not worthy of the books
","This movie is a pale shadow of the book. In fairness, because Katniss Everdeen is the first-person narrator of the series, there is a lot of psychological depth to the character and her experience that is extremely difficult to translate into a visual medium without accompanying the action with narrative voice-over or a similar device. That said, the liberties taken with the novel are pretty significant.<br/><br/>The movie follows the general framework of the story, but is incredibly frustrating in its lack of depth. A peripheral character from the novel becomes central to the movie, while the writers eliminate more important secondary characters whose emotional impact within the book is much greater. As the movie progresses, it takes a slash-and-burn approach to the novel's narrative, discarding sub-plot after sub-plot until much of what made the world of the novels so harrowing evaporates. In fact, the whole thing felt so rushed and poorly composed that I found myself wondering if it was filmed over a weekend. While I eventually warmed up a bit to Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson as Katniss and Peeta, neither really won me. Choosing Stanley Tucci for Caesar Flickerman was entertaining, and casting Lenny Kravitz as Cinna was a nice touch. Woody Harrelson worked better as Haymitch than I expected, but the movie made alterations to the emotional dynamic between him and Katniss and Peeta that did nothing to enhance the story. In fact, the movie introduces enough changes that I'm afraid they'll snowball in the sequels until the whole trilogy is essentially rewritten on-screen.<br/><br/>Although the comparison isn't entirely fair, when Peter Jackson & co. had to take liberties in their adaptation of the Lord of the Rings, they did so with a respect for the original material that, in my opinion, preserved the majesty of the trilogy. In contrast, I came away from The Hunger Games wondering if Gary Ross and his writers had so much confidence in the selling power of the book that the quality of the movie seemed inconsequential: it was going to make a mint no matter what they did. (Imagine my surprise when I discovered that Suzanne Collins herself received screenplay credits.)<br/><br/>In short, the movie doesn't do the complexity of the books justice. The psychological and physical horror of the Games is largely absent, many of the subplots that give the novel so much emotional substance are gone, and the failure to stick to even some fairly basic details - like the Cornucopia being gold rather than an olive drab bunker - makes the whole thing feel hasty and ill-conceived.<br/><br/>I didn't expect the movie to live up to the book, but I also didn't expect it to fall so far short."

I must say, Suzanne Collins' novel was ingenious and I found myself not wanting to put the book down. I finished the book in 3 days then went on to watch the movie, here are my thoughts.<br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence plays Katniss and I must say, she embodied the character so well as her performance was strong and captivating. If it was one thing that was adapted perfectly it was bringing Katniss to life with this great actress. Woody Harrelson who plays Haymitch, a drunk who was a former winner of The Hunger Games nailed his role! He was spot on and did a great job with the role. Elizabeth Banks as Effie Trinket, Liam Hemsworth as Gale, Willow Shields as Prim, Amandla Stenberg as Rue and Alexander Ludwig as Cato, all did excellent jobs with their roles.<br/><br/>However I'm not sure where I stand with Josh Hutcherson. The love-struck Peeta from the book did not transfer across in the film. For instance, in the book Peeta and Katniss kissed at least 5 times and were so much more romantic in the book than in the movie. He did a good job with the role but I think he could have done better. For those who have read the book you would have noticed that certain details were not included and the ending wasn't exactly the same. However the scenes that were vital in the book as well as the imagery - The awe of the Capitol in contrast with the poverty of the Districts - was so well done.<br/><br/>All in all I enjoyed this film and would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to see a movie about hope because ""Hope. It is the only thing stronger than fear."""
"dominique-alvarillo16","5","0","1","24 August 2012"," I just wish it delivered rather than disappointed like they always do when books are turned into film.
","So after I read the book I watched it with my sister. As always when it comes to books being made in to films I tend to worry because it often happens that the story is not followed which ends up ruining it, well for me. It is understandable that it is difficult to make Panem realistic but they have. A lot of the props used are just right for the movie and the setting of the story.<br/><br/>However, just as my fears were, some parts in the book were not followed and to me they were very significant in the story such as the Mocking jay pin that was supposed to be given by Madge to Katniss during the visitation. Also the visit of Peeta's dad to Katniss. For me, they both had a significance such that they play a part in the upcoming events. In the book it made me wonder why his dad visited her and what part does the pin play in the story. It seems like such a huge deal for it to come from the mayor's daughter.<br/><br/>The scenes wherein Haymitch was supposed to give advice to them were also important because it showed a side of him that actually cares and knows what he is doing despite the initial appearance of his character being a drunk. Instead, the movie made him continuously look like a drunk and insufferable except for the scene when he went to get sponsors in order to send her an ointment for her burn.<br/><br/>Also the scenes that involve the planning of making Peeta and Katniss the star-crossed lovers from District 12. The theme of romance was not much played in the movie or at least I could not see it as much as I did in the book. They made Katniss look like she hardly cared about him the entire movie while in the book there was some feeling that was shown including the part when Peeta tells her when he started liking her. When his dad told him that he was supposed to marry her mum but she went off and married a miner. How Peeta knew from then that he had no chances with Katniss and then finds out that he does not have any competition. And also when Peeta finds out on their trip home that she's only been playing a part for him and he ends up feeling betrayed. These scenes help build up the tension not only in Peeta and Katniss's relationship but also Katniss's relationship with herself and to Gale. The confusion she had when he said they could leave the district and survive and be well off with what they have. The film failed to show this one aspect that affects Katniss.<br/><br/>One thing I did like the most in the film is the scene that they added when Rue died. I think it would have been great if it was mentioned in the book. It almost made me cry, or maybe I would have if I was not watching with my sister. It shows so much emotion and drama. It shows exactly what the people of Panem feel about the Hunger Games. However, this confuses me when I think further because I recall from the book with the upheaval of District 13 which is now obsolete might end up being the same fate for District 11's riot. It is a powerful scene and very moving. I hope it does not become a source of difficulty for Catching Fire.<br/><br/>It is only the riot of District 11 that was inspiring. But without the key scenes from the book being followed, the absence of the dialogs which are key to answering questions that arise in the beginning, presence and absence of characters also having roles in the story and help build it up, I can not like it more than how I do now. I might be choosy but it frustrates me when this happens and so this is all I think it deserves."

"darthmatthew-442-606491","5","0","3","21 August 2012"," An above average movie that does the book justice
","After reading ""The Hunger Games"", I was determined to watch the movie. And so, on Friday I did. The result was a good movie. Not a great movie; however, because of its loyalty to the book and thus good storyline, it is still a good movie.<br/><br/>The story, as I said earlier, is well done, seeing as the author of the books worked closely with the writers for ""The Hunger Games"". When the movie did take liberties with the book, it executed them quite convincingly. Never did any of the added scenes seem unfeasible or uncharacteristic of the book. I thought, ""Yeah, that could've happened."" Although the beginning seemed slightly rushed, the plot regained its pacing and was fine from there on. I particularly enjoyed how effectively the movie reflected the perverted atmosphere of the Hunger Games. Many times amongst all the glamor and flair of the whole production of the Hunger Games event, I forgot that the movie was about teenagers battling to the death. The movie portrayed it almost like it was just Superbowl Sunday.<br/><br/>The acting was generally good. None of them necessarily shined, but they all delivered solid performances. The actors were excellently casted; they were perfect for their respective roles.<br/><br/>The cinematography technique however, was questionable. The camera shake in ""The Hunger Games"" made the ""Bourne Ultimatum"" look like a movie from the 1920's. I found myself a little irritated with the overwhelming amount of camera shake, especially in for instance just normal shots of people walking. During the fight scenes, the problem was dampened, as it is a fight scene after all. However, I usually spent the time being lost on what exactly is happening the tussle, and at which point I saw a splatter of blood; I suppose that means someone just died.<br/><br/>The soundtrack was actually surprisingly good. It had the right feel to it, matching the tones of the scene well.<br/><br/>Overall, ""The Hunger Games"" is a good, entertaining movie, but from what I've heard, you should read the books first. This movie is a fan-pleaser; it was very loyal to the books, and added a couple of new scenes that Hunger Games fans will enjoy. ""The Hunger Games"" is a truly exhilarating movie, with some surprisingly intense action sequences, and sometimes, it would have its emotional moment also. My recommendation is to read the books first, and then watch ""The Hunger Games"" for a fun and enjoyable experience."
"TdSmth5","7","0","3","20 August 2012"," Great story, good movie.
","I haven't read the book so I can't compare the two. One would imagine that since the author was involved in production, the movie is to some extent an accurate rendition of the author's intent. The story is well known so I won't summarize it here. There are two parts to this movie, the events prior to the actual hunger games and the hunger games themselves. In the preparatory part we get to know about the world this takes place in and a tiny bit about our characters.<br/><br/>The world of The Hunger Games is emphatically separated into two classes- the working class and the wealthy class. The working class has nothing and lives in a colorless misery comparable to those living during the Great Depression. The wealthy are a colorful, depraved and repugnant bunch and look like something out of a Mozart musical combined with a gay parade. They don't seem to do anything other than revel in opulence. A whole lot is made in speech about training the candidates and about them gaining sponsors although for the purposes of the movie and the hunger games all this doesn't really amount to much in the end. Our heroine, Katniss is your typical Hollwood powergrl- like a CEO wanna-be with rabies. She treats everyone around her like dirt and we are suppose to admire her for it.<br/><br/>Fortunately during the hunger game, Katniss becomes human and develops weaknesses, fear, and a heart. We learn almost nothing about the other participants/districts. One of them seems to house plenty of black people, and their candidates are also the good guys of course. The bad guys are the kids who represent some Sparta-type district that actually prepares their children for this monstrosity. They of course are the blonde blue-eyed devils. Fortunately we don't get to see a whole lot of child-on-child violence except earlier when a video of the games of the previous year is shown. The ""games"" themselves are terribly unfair by virtue of the random choosing of the kids. As a result you have adolescents fighting against children.<br/><br/>Performances are overall good in this movie. Stanley Tucci stands out the ludicrous fake TV host of the games' broadcast. His fake ultrawhite over-sized teeth, his nasty laugh, his colored hair that's not fake black-blue but blue blue, is a delightful mockery of the fakeness of the media and its worms with their larger than life personalities.<br/><br/>But the star of this movie is the story and how it maximizes social injustice to clarify it to audiences who probably don't understand that it exists. The vile and depraved upper class with its garish taste is not too far from what they look and act like in their gated conclaves. It's not enough that they have it all and that the workers and producers have nothing, they have to humiliate and debase them every year with this absurd ritual that sacrifices 23 children to discourage any future uprisings that could threaten the unjust status quo. There is some romance as well, which is tasteful, and well done and given Katniss' caricaturesque action heroine attitude, downright welcome. We also learn something about the thinking of those pulling the strings of the world. They don't want to offer much to those who have nothing, but a little bit of hope, but not too much. Direction is pretty good, but they could have cut some scenes short, and I'm sure there more background story, perhaps we'll learn about it in the sequels. It's good to see a movie aimed at young people that isn't entirely stupefying."
"abhinav-prkash","3","0","3","19 August 2012"," It missed the beat
","The Hunger Games<br/><br/>I hadn't read the book ' The Hunger Games' so I had no frame of reference to carry when I decided to watch this movie. A lot of my friends and online pals had recommended it. Adding to it was fact that it's directed by Garry Ross of Pleasantville fame and a near impressive 7.4 rating on IMDb. I couldn't afford to miss out on a candidate with such impressive resume. <br/><br/>Now after spending 2 hrs 22 minutes on this movie, I neither grudge the recommendations nor the ratings. From entertainment point of view alone, the movie should deserve it laurels. The dystopian setting of the future USA is shown convincingly -although I feel it comes nowhere close to masterful dystopia of 'Children of Men'. The direction is taut, story moves briskly and there are sufficient number of thrills, tensions and suspense points put in to keep viewers in their seats. <br/><br/>On the other hand this movie is also a perfect example of what bad actors and two dimensional direction can do to a script laden with so much potential. Perhaps Ross and the directional crew allowed themselves to be overwhelmed by scope of story to ignore the casting as well those finer points that could have elevated The Hunger Games from the general to master class. <br/><br/>To begin with, Jennifer Lawrence has given an unbelievingly shallow performance in the lead role that deserved someone of far better acting capabilities. She has a blasé wide- eyed-open- mouthed expression to which she has resolutely stuck in every scene no matter what's the situation. To realize that just watch the scenes where she volunteers herself for death games or when she enters the chariot parade or when announcements changing the rules of games are made during the death struggle. It's easier to spot a change in frame than any change in her expression. I wonder what richness and range of emotions someone as talented as Emma Watson could have brought to this role. <br/><br/>Second, the complex relationship between Jennifer Lawrence (Katniss Everdeen) and Josh Hutcherson (Peeta Mellar) looks hustled and compressed in a very uneven tableau. The character of Peeta Mellar is presented as an opportunist, calculative and manipulative through a third of the movie, which Katniss detests. Then suddenly she changes the mind ( not the expression :) ) and falls for him. It's like a phase change. One minute there is nothing. Next minute there is love and understanding. <br/><br/>Then there are those minor imperfections which don't stop a movie from earning millions But they sure help decide in its elimination from hall of fame. The Hunger Game has several of these imperfections. The most glaring one is the Spick and span looks of contenders even after rounds of bloodshed and spending several days in wilderness. All the time they give an appearance of having just stepped out of shower after a good 8 hours sleep. Also despite the continuous talk of deprivation and food scarcity in the 13 districts, the characters look so well fed and cared that I thought perhaps only kind of hunger known to the film makers is one that they feel on account of a skipped snacks. <br/><br/>To conclude for me The Hunger Games was a good one time watch but I do not opt to keep it in my library for an encore. <br/><br/>My rating. 6 out of 10."
"witster18","6","0","2","19 August 2012"," Not terrible, but you could still do a whole lot better in this genre.
","I struggled between 5 and 6 here.<br/><br/>I had a few problems with some of the effects, and the film just didn't have the huge epic look that I was expecting from such a blockbuster release. They really maximized the profit margin here. I swear they put half the average-to-meeger blockbuster budget in marketing. Hard to believe that Kurt Wimmer made a film that looked as good(or should I say as slightly fake) as Hunger Games with his nearly decade old release, Equilibrium. Only Kurt did it with a million bucks, and the movie was significantly better!<br/><br/>That said, I'm a little disappointed in this one. It's not terrible. It's not good either.<br/><br/>One of the films major flaws is the complete lack of chemistry between the leads. The way the two leads are written - you almost think they should hate each other. They do early on, but the ""growing"" relationship part of this story makes no sense whatsoever. Just no chemistry at all here. Peeta Malark comes off as a cold, heartless coward, and that just really belittles Katnis Everdeen's character when she starts to ""Fall"" for this nincapoop. I liked the fact that Katnis learned her media lessons throughout the film, but I was never sold on any attachment to Peeta. One minute Peeta is helping the others hunt Katnis down - the next minute they're kissing in a cave.<br/><br/>This was an alright passing of the time. I didn't reach to turn it off. The pacing was OK. I won't watch this again even if it's down the road on cable.<br/><br/>Significantly over-rated at it's current 7.4 here. Just thinking about a film like ""Frantic"" from Roman Polanski being .6 lower at 6.8 kinda makes me queesy. <br/><br/>This one made me feel like I did after watching ""The Running Man"" for the first time back in the 80's. It's a little cheesy, and a bit disappointing.<br/><br/>57/100 You MIGHT like this if you liked:The Running Man(slightly better or about even), Logan's Run(better than HG), Battle Royale(better than HG), No Escape(ever-so-slightly worse than HG), In Time(equally average)or Gymkata(much worse)"

My major problem with this movie is the idea of such ""games"" as well as the existence of ""districts"" that seem to be like native reservations and/or feudal work farms vs the big cities that lack nothing. Too little is done to elaborate on the pretext of the plot, rather some glamorous and for the lack of a better word ""fake"" characters are introduced and that's it: show's starting, ""this is it"".

","The kind that Edmund was given by the White Witch – it tastes good initially, but it does not leave you with a good feeling.<br/><br/>This is a well-made film and it does the book justice; so much so that it throws a particular aspect of that book into stark relief. The ancient roman games were a visual spectacle and now that this film presents these 'Hunger' games as just that – a visual spectacle – there are questions that can no longer be left unasked.<br/><br/>When I read the book I had to ask myself whether the story justified the violence. I found myself unconvinced – my problem was that for so much of the book, the violence was the story. Now I have watched the film I find my lack of conviction goes further; I worry that story is there simply as a metaphor to enable the violence.<br/><br/>This is not a film about the horrors of a group of young children and teenagers forced into a gladiatorial arena; it is a film about that horrific gladiatorial combat.<br/><br/>The film, like the book, is careful in its portrayal of the combatants; with one exception we are prevented from getting to know any of them. And that one – well she is used almost callously, for a moment of poignancy – a moment of meaning to counterpoint the meaninglessness of the violence that is playing out all around. So we have the death of Rue. She is killed and Katniss kills her killer. There is sorrow and sadness. Katniss sings to Rue and the body is laid to rest amongst flowers. But what of the young boy, he was only doing what was forced upon him – he was simply striving to live. No tears were shed for him. Of course not, he and the other 'red shirts' had to die. ""Bread and Circuses,"" I can almost hear the cry.<br/><br/>Ultimately everyone who watches this must find their own truths. I hope they will ask themselves why they watched and more importantly, how they feel about their reactions to this film. For me the real horror would be to hear that people enjoyed the killing and the violence."
"tomgillespie2002","6","0","2","10 August 2012"," Interesting film that fails to engage
","It could be argued that we are living in the last decades of Western Civilisation as we know it. The connotations of our popular culture has all the elements of distraction from what actually matters within our society. Reality television is now the most watched entertainment, with it's collection of delusional contestants vying for their 15 minutes of fame, along with the populous need to both humiliate and celebrate people of little worth. This format of mass-distraction is mirrored in the fall of the Roman Empire, which had its Gladiatorial Colosseum's as both a form of distraction and control. In the 21st century, television (along with other forms of media communication) is used to control and sedate the masses, and foment apathy in the population. It is also a form of contagion that infects those who believe they can also be rich and famous with little or no ability or talent. This seems to be what The Hunger Games is attempting to comment on, within the context of a distopian future.<br/><br/>Set after an uprising during a war, North America has been divided into 12 districts controlled by its centre, The Capitol. Each year one boy and one girl between the ages of 12 and 18 are selected by a lottery from each district to fight to the death in a televisual show. From district 12, Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence), volunteers herself for the event after her younger sister was selected. Along with male contestant, Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson), are transported to the Capitol, which resembles the Roman cities that the film is attempting to align itself with. After training and attempts to get sponsors, they are let out into a forest world to fight.<br/><br/>I really can't be bothered to explain any further the plotting or character narratives within this film, as you will more than likely have seen it before: The Hunger Games has similar themes, and has an incredibly similar storyline to both Battle Royale (2000) and The Running Man (1987). Whilst it's central character is played well by Lawrence (she has a slight presence on screen with her ordinary beauty), she has very little to do in a weak script, and obvious plotting. The films iconography is lifted wholesale from Roman history, and its depiction of a vapid elitist population fails to enlighten the initial premise (that admittedly could have been good). Within the first hour the film also manages to insult the spectator by repeating certain scenes of dialogue only 20 minutes after it was initially shown (""We are totally aware that that happened, cause not much has happened since, and it happened moments ago"").<br/><br/>Writer Suzanne Collins has stated that the inspiration for the book came from channel hopping between reality TV and the Iraq war, but she fails to find a voice strong enough to contextualise all the information into a credible framework, and simply seems to use the idea to speak only to the idiots who watch the reality TV that she seems to want to criticise; in other words the idea has been produced in much more intelligent ways elsewhere, whilst The Hunger Games decreases its concepts to feed it to the masses. Back to the 2010's, it has been suggested that around 90% of teenagers desire fame. In this narrative world, this desire simply is not there. In conclusion, interesting idea which fails to interest - the film is too long, and it simply does not engage.<br/><br/>www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com"

","Surprisingly grim, gray and bleak considering the target audience, this is as close to dystopian as PG-13 gets. An inordinate amount of time is invested in world building and scene setting here, which makes for some great, functional locales, but also relegates the plot to secondary status. Jennifer Lawrence is well-cast as the brooding, bow-wielding introvert Katniss, but the rest of the cast underperforms - especially Woody Harrelson, in a role he was seemingly perfect for, as her pathetic, booze-drenched adviser Haymitch. Readers with a fresh memory of the novels will get the most out of this interpretation, which assumes its audience knows most of the finer points of what's going on and summarily neglects any form of deeper investigation. It's gorgeous, though occasionally a bit too eccentric (some scenes in the capital look like they were ripped right out of a Final Fantasy cutscene) and non-fanatics will probably find it too narrow and fluffy."
"ragingbull_2005","6","0","2","5 August 2012"," Terrific beginning, terrible denouement
","Let me begin by confessing I haven't read the books by Ms. Collins. So I can't comment upon the faithfulness shown to the work by Gary Ross, the director. However, as the script writers included Ms. Collins herself, I can assume that the movie is a fair resemblance of the book. I have been intrigued by the trailers of the Hunger Games for the past 5 months. I have read and seen Stephen King's the Running man and read the Long Walk which are also post apocalyptic books about the fascination of the Americans with deadly games. Here, the US is Panem. There was an uprising by the 12 ""districts"" and as an act of repentance, one young man and a woman from every district has to go and participate annually in the Hunger Games. 24 people go, one comes back. The first half is sensational. The buildup is laced with truly great moments showing the tense selection process for the Games (called the Reaping), the training, and the hunt for sponsors by the participants and then trying to woo the crowd either by their stylish entries or by their swashbuckling interviews. It is in the ""Games"" themselves that the movie falters. The violence is minimal which was, I believe, done for the PG rating. But that takes away the greatest element of surprise from the movie as you see the protagonist not even breaking a sweat for the victory. There is no character development for any of the other participants except the protagonists. The acting is generally competent but a bit wooden in places. Donald Sutherland as the President of the republic stands out in his chilly act. Woody Harrelson is wasted as the drunken mentor. The direction in the first half is very good as it is backed by very strong screenplay. However, if only the director had decided to take a few leaves from the director of ""Battle Royale"" on which this seemed to be loosely based for the action scenes, this would have been a total winner. This is a tale of two halves. For the first half, I give 4/5. For the second my rating is 2/5."

The book is incredibly detailed and while the movie maintained the story well the detail and emotional factor of the book does not work its way into the movie.<br/><br/>The sets and costumes matched very well with the book, District 12 being the best. I do agree with most other reviews that nobody in the district really looked starved like in the books. The cast was great, but Josh Hutcherson didn't really seem to be into the role. Jennifer Lawrence did a great job playing Katniss, and Woody Harelson was exactly what I pictured Haymitch as when reading the book.<br/><br/>There are a few changes from the movie to the book that, to me, seem like it could make a sequel odd. For example, in the book the Mayor of District 12's daughter, Madge, gives Katniss the Mockingjay pin. In the movie there is not even mention of her or the mayor and they both appear more in Catching Fire. Another thing that wasn't shown much was the emotions between Katniss and Peeta. In the movie they just skim the surface of their relationship. <br/><br/>The only part that really bothered me about the movie was the ending. The last five minutes showed the last seventy pages of the book. They completely skipped the hospital parts after the games and the interview with Caesar could have been longer. Also the train ride back to District 12 should have been extended a bit. In general the movie should have been fifteen minutes longer.<br/><br/>The Hunger Games was a good movie but if you read the books and didn't see the movie, you probably shouldn't. And for anyone that saw the movie but didn't read the book, go out and the book it is much better than the movie.<br/><br/>7/10: Good movie with a great cast, the effects were nice and overall the movie was worth watching. I take points away for the lack of intensity, emotion, and detail that IS The Hunger Games."

","The film is a bit confusing for viewers, especially at the start. It can be seen that there are many events that are not shown in the film. Very interesting film, has some flesh backs, has never bored while watching it, but I have a feeling that a lot has been left out in the second part of the film itself. Since I know it was filmed by the book can feel that the good parts of the novel stripped. So, what we see is very good. Drawback is that (as usual) the first part of the movie still have many gaps and areas that would be much better look that the film is divided into two parts and take at least 3 hours. I wish that the characters are described in more detail. I have the impression that this movie is just warming up for the rights of the events have to come... That is not good."

","After hearing all the hype about 'The Hunger Games,' I went out, bought the book, and read it, anticipating something that was worth my time. In fact, I really enjoyed it, and while it's not as great as Harry Potter, I think 'The Hunger Games' is something pretty great.<br/><br/>'The Hunger Games' takes place in a post apocalyptic America where, instead of states, we are divided up into districts. Every year, the government chooses one boy and one girl from each (12) districts and they are forced to fight to the death in an arena, like a sport. We follow the main character, Katniss, as she struggles to stay alive, and fight her feelings for her opponent.<br/><br/>One of the main criticisms this film has received is the concept of children killing children. I, for one, am not the type that is against movies and their content, mainly because it is an art form. So the concept really didn't bother me in this film, and I can say, it was really good. The leads are likable, the dialogue is good, and the action is fun to watch. There are a few tense moments, but that leads me to my problem with the film. Sometimes I felt the direction was a bit shaky, and it kind of distracted me from the experience.<br/><br/>Overall, I think 'The Hunger Games' is a worthy adaptation of a great novel, and it lives up to the hype, and I can't wait for the sequels."
"coltyn_emmerich","7","0","3","20 July 2012"," Battle Royal Rip
","I loved The Hunger Games, don't get me wrong. It had amazing visuals, the character development pulled me in, and everything about it was well written. The only problem I have, is that the author says that they had never seen ""Battle Royal"" until after publishing their books. I'm sorry, but that's a blatant lie. Just like thousands of movies and books that have ripped off another countries version, this is no different. The author saw a way to make money by ripping another movie off. It wouldn't be that easy to tell ""Battle Royal"" was ripped off by this, if not for the fact that it's so very similar. Next time the author decides to steal the idea of another, way better movie, they should probably at least credit it. Overall it is a great film, but the Author needs to be a bit more honest with their fans."

","my friends and i have been waiting for this movie ,but after reading some reviews we felt that it wasn't worth seeing .but then later i decided to check it out anyway . i started the movie with a very critical attitude based on what I've heard and read about it, but then i actually began enjoying it . i never read the book so i can't comment on whether it was faithful to the book or not ,but all i can say is that this is an enjoyable movie that could have been better or more epic . The story of the movie is great ,the idea of real lives being used as TV entertainment is appealing . it's about the cruelty of governors ,starving their people ,using their children as animals to hunt each others for their entertainment . So apparently it's a great story ,the only problem is that they could have done a lot better with it ,i don't know exactly what was missing but i think maybe it wasn't gory enough .i wanted to hate the people who held the competition and i wanted to sympathize more with the children .maybe if this movie was rated R ,it would have been much better .it would have really shown the violence ,really made us feel the message it was supposed to deliver. Also another thing that didn't work so well ,is the way the camera moved sometimes ,shaking then focusing on a face ,it was weird and a little disturbing sometimes ,there were some points i felt that someone was shaking the camera deliberately not to make me see what was happening. overall it was a good fun to watch to movie but not great."

","I'll keep the spoilers to a minimum but recently I watched the movie that's been buzzing around for the last few days the hunger games, here's what I think of it. The Hunger Games (which came out recently for me) was based on the book of the same name written by Suzanne Collins and it is directed by Gary Ross. In short the story is about a dystopian version of North America after a war which nearly wiped out everyone, in a new country called Panem. Panem is split up into districts including a rich capitol who rules over the other 13 districts. By the time of the film it has been 74 years since a civil war ended with the destruction of the thirteen district and every year since the capitol has forced the twelve districts to enter in one male and one female from the ages of 12-18 to fight for the death in the hunger games, in which only one person leaves as the victor. Jennifer Lawrence stars as Katniss Everdeen a 16 year old girl who comes from the poorest suburb of district 12, who volunteers to participate in the hunger games after her sister Primrose's name was called out in the annual reaping (the process in which the capitol chooses the two teens from each district) joining Jennifer Lawrence is an all-star cast including Josh Hutcherson, Liam Hemsworth, Elizabeth Banks, Woody Harrelson and Donald Sutherland as the male tribute from District 12 Peeta Mellark (whom is the male lead of the movie), Katniss' best-friend Gale Hawthorn, Effie Trinket who escorts the tributes from District 12 to the capitol for training and media interviews, Haymitch Abernathy the mentor to the tributes from district 12 who won the 50th hunger games and President Snow, the cruel and evil leading figure of Panem respectively. The actors did a magnificent job in my opinion portraying the characters from the book, which I have read a few times. As always the book is far superior to the movie in the way that it can capture a story and emotions in a way that film in my opinion will never be able to. The cinematography of the film was great, featuring a range of shots which could be considered to be a form of modern art. With all this information my final decision of the quality of this movie is that this movie deserves a rating of 8/10 due to the great acting on all parts by all involved and for a good all- around experience while watching it."
"gino_monaco","7","0","2","11 July 2012"," good, not great
","Having not read the books, I was pleased with The Hunger Games as a movie. However, I do not know why it is the 3rd highest grossing movie for an opening weekend ever. It is likable, but it is no Dark Knight or Star Wars or Titanic. It is a good movie but not a great movie. The acting was solid. The mood and contrast complimented the story's dark tone. The story is very well thought out and it made me want to know more about it. For example, I wanted to know more about the individual significances of the 12 districts. For a two and a half hour movie, they could have used a little more time elaborating on the districts. I was surprised they showed the amount of blood that they did for a PG-13 movie. The only reason it did not garner an R-rating was for the lack of graphic violence. It really enhanced the movie's realism, and that is something you hardly ever see in a PG-13 movie with a serious tone. But what this movie does, that is similar to many movies now a days, is the way the camera captures the action scenes. The picture is very cut up and shaky, and so heavily edited that you can barely see a thing, during the action scenes. They say hand held movies are supposed to be the shaky nauseating ones but I have to disagree when it comes to action scenes that are depicted in this one. However, I was very pleased with the camera work that did not feature action. It was very clear and dark simultaneously, and it really captured the setting. I look forward to the next Hunger Games movie, even though the ending could have had more of a hook for the audience. Mainly, what pleases me most about this movie is if it is supposed to be the next series phenomenon, I prefer this over Twilight any day. 7 out of 10"

","Hunger games.<br/><br/>Yes, I know, the book is better, that's always the case, but in this case, especially! The movie shows no character development and the ambiance that the book portrays is non-existent. The 'hunger' factor also complete lacks in this movie, while it is quite an important factor in the book.<br/><br/>The movie does follow the storyline of the book, which I think is positive, but it's nothing more than a short summary without any depth, which makes the experience so good.<br/><br/>I'd give it a 5 for effort if I had not read the book. Seen through the eyes of someone that has read the book, a 3, tops."

","i absolutely love the hunger games trilogy written by Suzanne Collins it was a great mix of a love story, and sci fi yet still very believable as it was based in the undated future. a lot of people have said that trilogy's are to much like twilight but i 100 percent go against that as people said the same relating twilight to harry potter. in the hunger games their are no vampires, werewolves or wizards, just ordinary people.<br/><br/>America was split into 13 districts after tough times and ruled by the almighty rich capitol where the lucky and wealthy got to live, but as the book starts there are only twelve districts remaining as 74 years ago district 13 tried to rebel against the capitol and there fore got took down with bombs and to the day each year, each district must offer up one young man and woman ages 12- 18 to be placed in an arena where they must fight to their death on live television. the story is based on district twelve a starving district where people mine.soon to be two main characters live, katniss is the heroine in the story and provides for her family so when her 12 year old sister gets chosen for the game, she soon volunteers to take her place. and is sent to the capitol with fellow tribute and district twelve citizen peeta, to get ready to train and make an impression for sponsors which could mean the difference between life and death.peeta soon reveals he has always had feelings for katniss leaving them to saving one another a number of times in the arena.<br/><br/>i thought the twists in the film were great. yes there is a love triangle like twilight but there is a completely different dynamic to the story. as katniss does care for peeta she doesn't love him in the first book, in the second her feelings grow and by the 3rd she can not see life without him. i thought josh hutcherson and Jennifer Lawrence (peeta and katniss) gave such a beautiful performance which bought fellow cast members to tears. Alexander Ludwig and Isabelle fuhrman also made a great impression playing Cato and clove from district 2 and even though they will not be in the next two films they were very purposed characters. i do believe as the trilogy goes on the more emotional it gets. its a captivating story. and i could not put the books down and managed to read all 3 in 3 days. try them out.<br/><br/>i did feel the last few scenes were rushed, and one missed out, but it made you want to watch the next. <br/><br/>i suggest everyone watches these films as there not just for teenage girls but everyone. the violence isn't graphical and its rushed so you do not see gore. i always believe a book is better than the films but as Suzanne Collins, the author, co wrote the film. it made the film reflect the book so well.<br/><br/>Gary Ross the director did an amazing job and its sad that he wont be directing the next but with such a great cast i doubt it will be a bad film. <br/><br/>the hunger games catching fire the mockingjay"

","Before I start I need to note that I only wanted to see this movie to have my own opinion about it, even though I knew right from the start that it won't be very entertaining to me. However, all that buzz surrounding The Hunger Games made me realize that maybe I should watch it just to be up-to-date with the movie news.<br/><br/>I've never read the books, and, really, the topic of a 'game, where people hunt each other down in order to see who survives the longest' has been repeated in many pictures over the decades. Survival of the fittest, as one intelligent man once called it.<br/><br/>I won't bore you with the synopsis, because it seems actually as simple and trivial as a child's story. The beginning is so simple, yet so tragic, that it is undeniably obvious what must happen through the 142 minutes screening time. After Katniss Everdeen has so bravely protected her little sister from taking part in the murderous, and tremendously unethical, annual Hunger Games the viewer already knows what must happen at the very end.<br/><br/>I'm not really mad that the movie was so predictable. It is, after all, a big budget blockbuster, which was geared towards earning horrendous amounts of money even before the real production had started. It wasn't supposed to boost one's intellect.<br/><br/>I just can't understand why they had to make such a long movie, with so many unnecessary and boring scenes and promote it as one of the biggest hits in the teen flicks category. I won't deny that it stands out from the crowd of such flops as, oh let's say, the whole Twilight series. But the overall excitement that appeared right with the premiere of The Hunger Games probably left many people totally unsatisfied. I know I was.<br/><br/>As for some of the positive aspects, there were a few scenes that made the movie a bit more enjoyable. Even more, if it weren't for the part, which presented the stage of preparation for the Games, it would be a pretty decent action movie with some entertaining fighting sequences. <br/><br/>I must also say that the movie is well directed and presents some stunning cinematographic achievements in the sense of visual experience. <br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence did well. She is now on the list of many production studios as the new leading female. Because the lack of actual heroine characters in the last few years made her, and the role which she played, appear as a definition of the thing that Hollywood needs – a strong and independent woman that can support a picture on her own. Josh Hutcherson's character – Peeta - was just a supplement. He wouldn't be able to survive without the help of this brave young girl. <br/><br/>Don't expect any blood splattering over the bodies of deceased teenagers or gruesome scenes of murder. This is a PG-13 movie. If you want a real survival picture you would be better off watching Battle Royale, a fantastic Japanese flick that presents a similar concept, but with a 100% more violence and ruthlessness. And it goes straight to the point in just a few minutes.<br/><br/>All in all, The Hunger Games happened to be exactly what I expected it to be: a movie focused on a group of teenagers, who are in need of yet another teenage drama with a whole lot of heartfelt romance. Watchable, but definitely not a movie for the ages – 5/10."
"phillwillkill","6","0","2","14 May 2012"," In a nutshell...
","...A bit disappointing Probably because I'm a bit too old for this. But I expected a bit more action and bloodshed for my buck. Kind of like Running Man for 2012- sounded similar- 24 enter only one can leave. Instead it's like Running Man for the Twilight Generation, light on substance (crumbling society apart- which could have been more interesting, if not brushed over) and low on action and violence. I am not a violence junkie, but if a film has 24 participants whittled down to one through fighting you'd expect to see bloodshed wouldn't you? This film highlights a bigger issue with Hollywood releases in recent years whereby studios have sought to maximise revenue by releasing for the age group 12A (PG-13, whatever), which is why I really appreciate when a studio goes for it and makes a proper 18 film- see ""Drive"", awesome movie, great plot, fantastic characters, beautiful back drops. Sometimes violence is necessary to a film, imagine Goodfellas without the whacking. Anyway, a good movie? Yes. A missed opportunity? Definitely. Some good acting from the youngsters though- no doubt, although Woody Harrelson stole the show again."
"martinrobertson300482","7","0","3","10 May 2012"," I will probably read the book now.
","Being hailed as the next ""Twilight"" wasn't what drew me into going to see ""The Hunger games."" I actually wanted to see it because it sounded like more, and something interesting in a year over populated with remakes, rehashes, and sequels.<br/><br/>Set in the not to distant future, ""The Hunger games"" sees a complicated world split up into districts. Where 2 children from each district must compete in ""The Hunger games,"" a nasty game off survival where only one will survive. Think ""The Running man"" meets ""Lord of the flies."" <br/><br/>Now I'm going to technically stick up for this flick. Some have dismissed it straight away because off its love story or because off its restricting PG13 rating. But I've got to admit that a majority off the movie had me glued. Its just a shame that the unpredictable direction I thought it was going in (which made me want too see it right through to the end) takes the easy way out, which just so happens to be the most unlikely way.<br/><br/>Overall, I think it's better than what adult men would assume from it, but not the work off genius that teenage girls will be making it out too be. Its a great concept, let down a lot by not playing it's own rules, and the time it takes too get too the friggen point might put some people off too."
"paudie","7","0","3","9 May 2012"," Mostly delivers on an intriguing premise
","I was curious to see ""The Hunger Games"" because of the intriguing premise and a good trailer. I haven't read the book so I can't comment on any similarities and/or differences between the two versions.<br/><br/>The story is set in the future where country is divided into 12 Districts and ruled from the ""Capitol"". Around 80 years before the Districts rose up against the rulers but were defeated after a bloody conflict. As punishment and a reminder the ruling classes started the annual ""Hunger Games"" where one male and one female under 18 from each district are selected by lot and brought to the Capitol to compete in a televised survival competition which continues until only one contestant survives.<br/><br/>The film focuses mostly on the female contestant from District 12, Katniss Everdeen. Unusually she has volunteered to compete, after her much younger sister was chosen in the lottery. She is reasonably well equipped for the contest as she is the main breadwinner for her sister and widowed mother and is skilled at hunting for food.<br/><br/>When they get to the Capitol the contestants find that they are huge celebrities. The contrast between futuristic Capitol and the poverty we saw in District 12 is stark. <br/><br/>Each pair of contestants is allocated a mentor to instruct them on how to prepare. The District 12 pair is lucky enough to get Woody Harrelson, (with shoulder length blond hair!). He is a former winner who is now living the good life. Initially he doesn't show much interest in the prospects for the young pair but soon he realises that Katniss, in particular, has the skills to have a good chance of survival and tells her this.<br/><br/>Once the survival ""show"" starts Katniss puts her survival skills to good use but the show producers are determined to give their viewers a good show and can manipulate conditions when they want to. The action sequences in this part of the movie are very good.<br/><br/>I wasn't entirely convinced by the acting of Jennifer Lawrence in the main role. I thought her facial expression was almost blank a lot of the time. Woody Harrelson and Elizabeth Banks were good in the supporting roles. Donald Sutherland is suitably malevolent as the Capitol President, who recognises the spirited Katniss as a potential troublemaker.<br/><br/>Overall I enjoyed the movie. Even though it is over two and a half hours long it didn't drag as there three distinct parts to the movie – Introduction and the lottery – Preparation in the Capitol – ""The Show"". <br/><br/>As I write this review I can think of a few weaknesses in the plot that I didn't notice as I watched the movie but maybe that is a good sign of an action movie. <br/><br/>On the downside I thought the last half hour of the movie was disappointing as it involved a dose of teen romance and a ""neat and tidy"" ending. There are also sure signs that there will be other movies in this series."
"sharpcourse","7","0","3","2 May 2012"," Good but not worth all the hype
","I didn't intend to see this movie as my taste in over-hyped blockbusters easily waned alongside my clocking my early twenties. I stumbled into the theater as a result of schedule change with the movie I wanted to see having being shifted. The hype though still succeeded in affecting my curiosity so I went to see this.<br/><br/>I haven't read the books no. Though I have taken a word or two from past reviews knowing its a first person narrative organized in a post-Apocalyptic future, written by movie writer and Author Suzanne Collins.<br/><br/>Though set in a post-Apocalyptic world, its not your regular post-Apocalyptic movie. You'd have had residual damaged cities, sparse population and..... maybe flesh eating zombies as they usually do. The beginning of the movie was promising I must say.<br/><br/>There have been mention of poor characterization of the tributes with the exception of Woody Harrelson's and Elizabeth Banks' characters respectively. Then there's that of physical portrayal; Katniss and the tributes from the other districts do not seem to be going hungry- and then the exploitation of the districts, haven been a major plot point in the books is barely seen in this motion picture.<br/><br/>In my opinion Effie Trinket was captivating. Elizabeth Banks really does justice to her. Woody Harrelson was especially brushed up as Haymitch. His lines kept me laughing at times but it was Jennifer Lawrence who stole the show even though its said she is not starved enough. The fears, inner strength and purposefulness she shows all seem very moving and quite carries the movie on its own but Josh Hutcherson's Peeta was quite flat. Though I haven't read the book, it seemed unconvincing and lacked emotional depth affecting the dynamic between him and Katniss. If he had been lost in the games, I doubt anyone would really miss him save for the fourteen year old girls with the buzz of ""guy loves girl loves guy"" triangles in the air from the twilight sagas. Even Katniss' chemistry with Liam Hemsworth's character, though not in romantic terms seemed to carry a lot more weight.<br/><br/>There may be a lot more to the entire story than shown in this movie and its a pretty average made huge budget blockbuster compared to the hype all over it. Apart from the opening scenes that portray a hungry society that seems to have lost hope, the rest of the story lacked depth. The arena battle lacked any tension. It was like watching chronicles of Narnia without the magic.I don't want to start on the stereotypical tributes of the other districts even though there was a fine attempt to minimize the on-screen violence for the sake of the much younger viewer understandably to attract a wider Audience. They seemed like they were all having fun in the jungle.<br/><br/>For Katniss and Amandla Sternberg's character as Rue, I give this movie a 7 and I'd recommend a few bucks for it. Don't expect much. Maybe the sequel does better. Enjoy"
"chaitov","6","0","3","1 May 2012"," Did Not Love it,Did Not Hate it
","I didn't read the book and therefore had no idea what the movie was about. After reading a few reviews,I decided to give the movie a chance. Firstly,I found it much too long. For the first hour and a half,I felt like I was watching American Idol,or America/Canada's Got Talent. I could just see Ryan Seacrest up there as MC before the games began. It was so predictable at that point,even boring. Also,the people in this dystopia looked very weird and not believable. When the games started,I was getting very dizzy with the shaky camera work. I imagine this was to give it a PG rating so as not to show too realistically any of the teens killing each other. It was just touched upon,not that I would want to see too much violence either. When the Hunger Games were in full swing,I really kept thinking of the reality TV show,""Survivor."" There were a few inane twists at the end but all in all,I never felt fully immersed in the movie.For the last hour,I kept looking at the time.This doesn't take away from the great performances by Jennifer Lawrence,Woody Harelsen,or Donald Sutherland. All in all,I wasn't moved by this movie. What were the reasons for the present state of affairs in the future North America.And show us some depth in the main characters. Forty years ago,in 1972,I saw a very intense movie about a future dystopia,""Soylent Green,"" with Charleton Heston and Edward G. Robinson. I have never forgotten it. We saw people starving,begging for food,etc. There was deep emotion and you could identify with the characters. This was not the case for me watching The Hunger Games. By tomorrow,I will have forgotten most of the movie. Wait for it on DVD is my advice or go on a day when rates are reduced."
"bessy_dacow","6","0","2","28 April 2012"," Enjoyable but not amazing
","I'd like to start off by saying I've never read the books so obviously my judgment will differ from those who loved the books. I didn't think the film was brilliant, but I found it enjoyable and I was never bored. In fact, I felt myself getting quite emotionally invested in the characters. This was achieved through the fantastic acting by the cast. Jennifer Lawrence was outstanding. For example, friends who have read the book told me that she is supposed to be faking her love for Peeta, and I had actually gotten that impression out of her acting, even though its never explicitly said in the film. There were a few plot holes that didn't make sense to me and I would have liked to have had more of the back story about the rebellion etc, but I didn't find their absence detrimental to the storyline; i was still able to understand what was going on. I have read a lot of reviews about shaky camera work, but I honestly didn't even notice, and I am someone who is normally quite sensitive to that (The Hurt Locker gave me a headache after 10 minutes). I've also read many reviews that complain about the lack of a feeling of despair and ""hunger"", created in part because of the toning down of violence. I do agree with this, and I think that's where the film is lacking most, as it does seem that many of the characters aren't quite on edge. However, although I am sure it was done in part to attract a larger audience, I do think that the sight of children killing children is quite disturbing, and has more of an impact on screen than in a book, so maybe it was a wise choice. Overall its an entertaining watch and whilst I do agree it is over hyped, I did enjoy watching it and would even watch it again."
"fallgeek","8","0","4","22 April 2012"," Awesome Movie!!!
","I really, really enjoyed this movie-it was far better then most books- turned-films are.(And I've read the books.) Although there was lots of violence and suspense/intensity/disturbing scenes in this film, there was just the right amount of humor to balance it all out. I thought the casting was absolutely perfect, and the acting and setting/special effects were beyond great. I was expecting to walk into this film that would have lots of gore and gross scenes, but it really didn't. Most scenes didn't bother me-the scene where Glimmer is killed by the tracker jackers was sort of disgusting, and of course Rue's death was sad, but when it really came down to it, it wasn't as gory as the media made it out to be. Sure, it was violent-I mean, what would you expect from a film like this?-but it wasn't gory. Despite how much I loved the film, I do have some complaints: <br/><br/>1. Cinna was barely in it at all! In the book he was practically a main character, and in the film he's only in two or three scenes; I know they wanted to focus mostly on the arena, but seriously? 2. They cut out Madge completely! It really bothered me how Katniss got the mocking-jay pin at the Hob rather than Madge giving it to her 3. I know this is a very small part of the film, but Buttercup (Prim's cat) wasn't yellow nor ugly. I mean, the cat's only in one scene, but couldn't they have at least found one that looked even remotely like the book's description? 4. They skipped two important scenes with Haymitch: first of all, they skip the part where he falls off of the stage at the Reaping, and where he falls in his own puke in the train car-call me crazy, but I was sort of looking forward to seeing that! 5. When in the arena, Katniss didn't receive any bread from District 11 (as she does in the book) for helping Rue. 6. They never get into the story about the Avox girl (which didn't really bother me all that much, but it bothered my cousin-who saw it with me-to great levels)<br/><br/>All in all, this film was really, really good, and definitely worth the time and money-can't wait for the DVD!!!"

"dalelawson-1","6","0","5","15 April 2012"," A slow and frustrating film that is held together by its strong and capable cast
","Because of all the hype surrounding The Hunger Games (Dir. Gary Ross, 2012) I presumed it was going to be heavily entertaining and enjoyable. But on the contrary, it was slow and frustrating. I found little empathy for any of the characters and struggled to understand what should have been a very simple plot that somehow became more and more complex as the film dragged on. <br/><br/>I will firstly point out that I have not read the books and so I went into the film with only the understanding that The Hunger Games focuses on a yearly event where children end up fighting other children to survive. By the end of the film I discovered that The Hunger Games was essentially a desensitised Hollywood adaptation of Battle Royale (Dir. Kinji Fukasaku, 2000) with a greater back story. Also because The Hunger Games is based on the first in a series of books I was able to tell that nothing bad would happen to the protagonist, which perhaps helps in the films slow narrative progression.<br/><br/>The Hunger Games rushes the beginning plot in order to reach the games, and therefore a lot of the story is lost. This rushed first hour forces a sense of mild confusion onto the spectator, as we are unsure of the significance of multiple characters and symbols that only fans can relate too. The camera-work of the opening twenty minutes before Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) is swept away to the capitol is fantastic. The uncomfortable camera angles followed by quick cuts or jump cuts create a sense of fear and uneasiness. This same effect is used when the games finally get underway to emphasise the violence that is taking place, without focus on the blood and gore. However the games also drag on for another hour. Many of the scenes within this section feel overextended and a few of them unneeded. Surprisingly, in the last twenty minutes of the film it increases pace and enjoyment before rushing through the final few scenes, in order to reach the two hour mark.<br/><br/>For an expensive and high grossing blockbuster one would expect the CGI to be believable and realistic, which in majority they are. But in one scene in particular where Katniss and Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) are arriving on chariot into the capitol, they are both wearing suits that are supposedly on fire. Whether it is the audience superimposed onto the green screen behind them, or the fire that doesn't even look like fire, this scene was sickening to watch in what was otherwise a beautiful and creative film.<br/><br/>Acting-wise, Woody Harrelson and Elizabeth Banks exceeded my expectations as they provided a surrogate mother and father, to an extent, for Katniss and Peeta. The characters presented in The Hunger Games are all very different as they have individual traits. Unfortunately because of these differences there is almost no attachment created between the audience and the characters, except perhaps Katniss as she is the protagonist. However due to her cold nature and bland facial expressions Katniss is also not entirely relatable to.<br/><br/>When a film mentions its own title almost every minute it is never a good sign and The Hunger Games was no exception. The lack initiative or common sense used by the majority of the characters throughout the games is heavily frustrating – look out for the tree scene or a scene with Rue (Amandla Stenberg). Many characters are introduced and then forgotten, which can only be preparation for a sequel, a flaw that The Lord of the Rings trilogy managed to avoid. All in all The Hunger Games was an enjoyable watch with many avoidable flaws. Perhaps its sequel will be more entertaining<br/><br/>http://dalelawsonreviews.tumblr.com/"

","If you want to see where the spawn of The Hunger Games may have come from see ""Series 7: The Contenders"". Roger Ebert's provides a good review of the film. Don't believe one was better than the other. Both were about a 6/10 for me. The Hunger Games was just better marketed and less philosophical. A real summer blockbuster one could say. I could have a used a lot more of the philosophical and political underpinning for the games existence. Not sure there would be a logical reason for the games other than to sell movies tickets to the mob. Liked Clove, about it. Most of the remaining parts of the film very fairly predictable."
"moshdesigner","6","0","5","8 April 2012"," Too many clichés, logic holes, but still a tad enjoyable.
","An interesting idea mash-up of 1984, Lord of the Flies, Logan's Run, reality shows in general, with (good) special effects, albeit the ones you see all the time from Sci-Fi films realised in the US.<br/><br/>The plot: in the future, the Government holds a yearly contest among forcibly chosen youngsters from different conquered towns. They are shortly trained and later released in a small woods area with minimum equipment, letting them kill each other. The whole series of events is transmitted to the population on TV. The winner will take... well, I think nobody knows what he or she will win. I am not even sure if it is food, given the obscure name of the movie.<br/><br/>Even though the plot has some freshness to it, the movie stumbles constantly with horrendous clichés. It takes only three seconds from some scenes to know who the bad guys and the heroes/heroines will be and who are going to be only cannon-fodder. Lots of coarsely sketched characters, with whom you don't feel related to at all.<br/><br/>The mix between digital and real is confusing: digital monsters which can be harmed with real weapons? Digital fire which can burn the skin? Meh...<br/><br/>There's also plot loopholes a plenty, as well as illogical, poorly- explained or hard-to-believe situations: the inhabitants of a starving town seem to be completely attentive facing TV screens, even though they've been running then for several days, instead of working in order for them to get food. At the mere signal of the heroine on the screen, they start fighting the guards, even though they didn't lift a finger when the kids were taken away to be slaughtered. -_-<br/><br/>The film is not particularly bad, but it's also no big deal. As an additional frustrating detail, this seems to be only the first part of many. Go watch it only if you don't have anything better to do. If you are into WOW, THOSE ARE INCREDIBLE SPECIAL FX and that's what you normally care about from the movies, then you're in for a treat."
"andreas-inderwildi","Null","0","5","8 April 2012"," Subtle and Shocking
","To appreciate ""The Hunger Games"", one has to recognise that it works on quite a few different levels. Sadly, some people seem unable to see beyond the superficial and to appreciate the clever subtlety and complexity of this film. On its most basic level, of course, ""The Hunger Games"" addresses many issues relevant to adolescents, such as taking responsibility and dealing with a world dominated by adults. It's about finding one's way and standing one's ground even when this world of adults is utterly unable to provide role models for even the most basic ethical behaviour.<br/><br/>On further levels, however, it also deals with totalitarianism, a lack of ethical frameworks and modern exploitative mass media with its total disregard for privacy. The beauty of ""The Hunger Games"" is not just that it addresses such diverse topics, but that it manages to bring them together in a single and coherent commentary on our cultural and political situation. It's a delight to see how today's politics and television shows are cleverly exposed for all their totalitarian tendencies as well as for their stupidity, manipulation, hypocrisy and cruelty. And the totalitarian state of Panem provides the film with a setting in which all the adolescent's concerns, such as growing up and taking responsibility, become especially urgent and relevant.<br/><br/>Some people criticise the film's love story, claiming that it detracts from the cruelty of the games and banalises it. If one fails to recognise that this film is more than a story for teenagers with some random violence and action thrown in, this might seem accurate. But nothing could be further from the truth. This love story is primarily about manipulation, about a brutal intrusion into the emotional life of teenagers. Those in power try to instrumentalise the potential love story to strengthen the totalitarian system both by providing the audience with a clichéd image of ""young love"", thereby disencouraging them from revolt, and by weakening Katniss's emotional power over the audience. On a different level, Katniss herself instrumentalises this love story (to a certain degree) in order to make her (and Peeta's) survival more likely. In the end, their relationship seems fragile and ambiguous, abused and violated by the manipulative and totalitarian system. Therefore, the film's love story further emphasises the brutality of the games.<br/><br/>I believe that ""The Hunger Games"" is an important film for all adolescents struggling with this world and trying to find their place in it, encouraging them to disagree, to criticise and giving them the hope that change for the better is possible."
"lasttimeisaw","7","0","4","4 April 2012"," The Hunger Games
","A cinema viewing of this soft Sci-Fi phenomenon, Jennifer Lawrence is the only impetus for me and the aftermath is unexpectedly satisfactory, with several inevitable grudges, among which is the shakily giddying cinematography, it may intend to be stylish, however one should not stay too much nearer the screen and it is not well-manipulated.<br/><br/>The film is nerve-absorbing in its narrative particularly before the game time, the stunning sets and inhabitants tableaux of the rich capitol is better-than-expectedly glistening, but when the children-slaughtering begins, there is deficit in imagination and the SFX mainly falls flat.<br/><br/>The film has already whisked away a TWILIGHT-sega triumph in the North American market, of which the worldwide popularity may fall short, but the sensational trend is irreversible, and as myself has completely sidelined TWILIGHT-sega, THE HUNGER GAMS is on a long run to be conquering an even wider demography (a more maturer one for sure). <br/><br/>The performances are pleasantly orchestrated, an Oscar-nominated Jennifer Lawrence does strike a memorable and convincing embodiment of our heroin, imbues her a role-model paradigm for the young generation around her age, she is invincible in nearly all her scenes, grabbing all the attention and only a polychromatic talk-show host spoofer Stanley Tucci could steal some meager thunder from her. Among others, Josh Hutcherson is controversially add some juice to the flavor, I haven't read the novels, so his character maybe have more space to show off his personal panache in the sequels if he is supposed to be the male leader. <br/><br/>The killing is much diluted by the scratchy editing, but the ideal here in the novel and film may ring a bell of the violence-etched backbone of our society, especially for youngsters, the wackily colorful future (for the rich area of course) depicted in the film is too Utopian to be worshiped, and a female-dominated love-triangle has been slickly formed near the very end of the film, a wishful thinking is that the second one will not veneer too lachrymose like a TWILIGHT facsimile, as for the likeness with Japanese BATTLE ROYALE (2000), I haven't obtained any say-so by far without watching the latter. Anyway writer-turned-director Gary Ross (notably for SEABISCUIT 2003) is catching his fire to the next chapter, may it will break the sequel curse and we will be desperate in a hungrier condition after HARRY POTTER, TWILIGHT all come to an end."

","This was a good movie, not a great movie, just good. There was a lot of subtext, in a lot of ways like the James Caan movie, Rollerball. It had, good acting and a good script, BUT, the director??. What is with this constant moving camera, extreme close-ups and fast cuts??? Whatever happened to the long shot. It all seems to have started with the Bourne movies and Paul Greengrass. Every director thinks it is cool and realistic for close-ups and moving camera. It's a crock. Its confusing in a lot of scenes as you spend half your time trying to work out what Is going on and in the action sequences looking for the sick bags because you are getting vertigo. Even in the scenes with more than 2 people, close up and fast cuts were used.<br/><br/>Like when Peeta throws the weight in the training area. He picks up the weight, CUT to see the strain on his face, CUT to see the concern on Katriss's face, CUT to see the look of disrespect on Kato, CUT back to Peeta OH the strain, CUT to again see the concern on Katriss's face, CUT to see Kato laughing with his team mates, CUT as Katriss looks with disdain at Kato _ _ _ THROW THE DAMN WEIGHT ALREADY! A lot of people do not like 3D, Hunger Games wasn't 3D, but if it was it may have saved the movie from being edited like a gunfight in a spaghetti western.

The movie was dead on, except for a few minor deviations; first being that the mayor's daughter gave Katniss the Mockingjay pin and not Prim..... but a minor point. The movie fulfill my every whim.... though I was expecting Cenna (Lenny Kravis) to be a little more flamboyant....lol!!!! My most anticipated scene was when the tributes... are first introduced in the Capitol.... from the book, the flaming costumes of peter and Katniss were remarkably described, and again the film did not disappoint. A small scene that must ended up on the cutting room floor, but which I enjoyed in the book, was when the loaf of bread from District 11 was delivered to Katniss and Peter; after Rune had passed.

"ferguson-6","7","0","9","3 April 2012"," Don't Fear the Reaping
","Greetings again from the darkness. Having not read the Young Adult novels of Suzanne Collins, my comments will be limited to the movie only and not a comparison to the books. The screenplay was a joint affair from Ms. Collins, Billy Ray, and director Gary Ross (Seabiscuit). Whether or not you read the books, you surely know that this has been an anticipated film version in the vein of Twilight and Harry Potter. My analysis is that it falls short of Harry and is superior to the vamps.<br/><br/>What this film definitely is ... proof that Jennifer Lawrence is for real. She burst onto the scene in her Oscar nominated turn in Winter's Bone and once again, her squirrel recipes come in handy. Lawrence plays Katniss Everdeen, a tough as nails and very resourceful resident of the dirt poor District 12. She provides for her little sis and their emotionally vacant mother, and does so by honing her bow and arrow skills hunting in the vast woodlands.<br/><br/>Without going into too much detail, the dystopian world of Panem is divided into 12 districts and a Capitol. As a combination entertainment and price for a previous rebellion, an annual lottery is held to select a boy and girl from each district ... ""tributes"" to their community. Those drawing the proverbial short straw are entered into brutal fight to the death, where 23 are to be killed and one left standing. In the 74th annual Hunger Games, Katniss volunteers to take the place of her little sister. So she and Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson, The Kids are All Right) are whisked away to the Capitol to meet their mentor, Haymitch Abernathy (Woody Harrelson), a one time winner who celebrates daily by downing as much alcohol as possible.<br/><br/>In stark contrast to the hopeless community from which they arrive, the Capitol is a gleaming, bright-colored land of enchantment filled with wildly costumed residents seemingly bored by the atrocity of the annual event. Seneca Crane (Wes Bentley, American Beauty) is the man in charge of staging and manipulating the event for the highest possible ratings and entertainment value. He carries out his duties while sporting a very unique satanic beard, unlike you have seen before.<br/><br/>After prepping, the tributes appear in front of a futuristic Ryan Seacrest played by the flamboyant Stanley Tucci. His Caesar Flickerman is charged with interviewing so as to help the audience make a connection. Lenny Kravitz plays Cinna, a futuristic Tom Ford clone whose duties are to make Katniss and Peeta ""presentable"".<br/><br/>It takes a full hour, but the actual Hunger Games finally begins. Quickly the faceless characters disappear and the game of brutality and brains begins. Lawrence is truly a standout here since she has tremendous ability as an actress, and sells her athletic ability quite well. I can't say I was as taken by Mr. Hutcherson, who spends most of the film looking like a wounded puppy.<br/><br/>While the PG-13 rating keeps it from becoming a gore fest, I found the action sequences to be quite entertaining. More interesting to me was how the story and characters are posed so that a viewer might interpret meaning in just about any manner one cares to twist. There are political views and human nature traits and commentary on the Reality TV world that are primed for claiming ... regardless of one's opinion. To me, that's a weakness. I would rather the story take a stand and make a statement. But then I remind myself that this is the first in a trilogy of Young Adult stories. It's not designed for deep thought. The movie succeeds in reaching the goal of producing a strong young female character in a world run amok."
"dhardman04","10","0","9","3 April 2012"," Perfect
","One word that describes this movie: perfect (at least in my opinion). I bought the book 24 hours before seeing it and finished right as the movie started, so I had the book fresh in my mind. Yes, the movie does not copy the book word for word or scene for scene. But that doesn't mean it wasn't a fantastic movie. I loved every aspect. The acting was superb (Lawrence, Hutcherson, Banks, Sutherland, Tucci, Kravitz, Stenberg and Bentley). I really felt Lawrence did a beyond brilliant job of portraying Katniss. I felt the emotion in her performance. I have never been moved by a performance, but this young actress took my breath away, especially during Rue's death. I had chills and tears were forming in my eyes. My friend (who really didn't know anything about the book) was balling her eyes in three different scenes. I was moved throughout the entire thing. Rue's death was the most emotional scene ever. That little actress was amazing. Seneca, Snow, Haymitch and Effie were greatly cast and their parts were expanded from the book and I liked it. Cinna and Katniss' scenes were by far the best. When he is comforting her before the games, I nearly cried again. These actors spoke to me and made me feel what they were feeling; beyond superb. The arena scenes were also amazing. The shaky cam was used excellently in my opinion. I wasn't bothered by it at all. Really brought a sense of urgency and fear (as it is from Katniss' POV). It really captured what I read in the book. Yes, the cornucopia looked like a wreck, but there really is no need to complain about it; if it worked, then it worked.<br/><br/>Now, some little things I didn't like: the Mutts (wish they could have made them like the book), Cato and Clove's death (again, like the book)and the shortness of the cave scenes. But I do understand that the need for a PG-13 movie and that everything cannot be incorporated from the book.<br/><br/>Overall, a perfect movie. I will definitely see it again, cry and be moved all over again because it is a fantastic movie. Couldn't ask for a better movie experience. Seriously, the best one I have had ever."

Then, they made so both kids from District 12 would win.<br/><br/>The reason for that was Young Love.<br/><br/>Their trainer wanted them both to win, but President Snow didn't want that to happen. He didn't like District 12 from the looks of it. he was mad that they both won.<br/><br/>I find it interesting that the people in control of the Hunger Games kept adding more things in the arena. I find it sad that 23 kids have to die, leaving only one winner in the beginning."

It's definitely a movie aimed at younger people because the content is very emotional, but there is nothing noteworthy about the plot, the actors, camera or soundtrack. Everything is done by the book and the result is effective but predictable and ultimately shallow and clichéd.<br/><br/>I want a movie to surprise me, either with its story, or effects or any other cineastic means.

It honestly comes off as cheap. The effects, like the fire costume were really bad! I am sorry, but there were movies made years ago that are more stunning. Over all, it was nice to see my favorite characters come to life! Haymitch is exactly as I imagined. And Rue is awesome! I will definitely see the next two films (whenever they come out, seems that they are really spreading them out.)

"saschakrieger","9","0","5","29 March 2012"," Bread and Games
","As a series of novels, The Hunger Games is a phenomenon. Its premise could hardly be more violent, more brutal, more cynical more inhumane: As a punishment for a long forgotten rebellion against a totalitarian state that has long replaced the United States as we know them today, but more importantly as entertainment for the rich, privileged and bored, 24 children and teenagers between the ages of 12 and 18 are forced to slaughter each other until only one remains. Yet the series has become a huge success among younger readers, rivalling that of the Harry Potter or the Twilight books. And it is threatening to do the same on the big screen: Even measured against the giant expectations, the first film has been a huge success. And all this without holding anything back, with a bleak, unforgiving, completely anti-escapist view of the world. The Hunger Games is a frighteningly honest defense of humanity that is heavy on its destructive, merciless, selfish side as well as a stinging indictment of today's media culture. For the ""Hunger Games"" are nothing other than excellent ""Reality TV"" brought to its logical conclusion.<br/><br/>The film centers around Katniss, a tough teenage girl acting as the surrogate mother for her little sister and takes her place when the latter is picked in the lottery that determines the ""games'"" participants. Jennifer Lawrence has proved in Winter's Bone that she can carry her film with her strength, her truthfulness, her complete and utter believability and she does so again here. Her Katniss is a young girl grown before her time, stubborn, angry, harsh. She has built a protective shell around her which hides her vulnerability and fears. She is forced to be brave, she has no choice but she is only human and she remains so.<br/><br/>One of the film's aspect is a carefully told coming of age story as Katniss finds her inner strength without losing her compassion and the fear that makes her human. Accepting no advice at first she learns to trust others, to forge alliances, to play the game. First and foremost, she learns how to survive: from her fellow combatant Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) who is much faster on the uptake and sheds his pride more easily to do what needs to be done or from her jaded, hard-drinking but ultimately decent mentor (Woody Harrelson). As the ""games"" advance she understand she needs to become part of the game and walk the thin line between accepting the necessary and staying true to herself. Peeta is more easily willing to give up his pride but he never loses side of his primary goal: Even if he must die, he wants to remain himself even in death. Play the game if you must but remain the player not just the pawn the others see in you. On the other side are those competitors who have been trained for years to do this, who don't know anything else than kill. They have been stripped of their souls, turned into sad figures for whom death is delivery from a life they lost long ago.<br/><br/>For a film targeted at a younger audience, The Hunger Games paints a surprisingly honest picture of the mechanisms of totalitarianism. It is not just the cruel spectacle itself, it is the discrepancy between the comic-like splendour of the ruling ""Capitol"" and the oppressed, starving 12 district, the use of spectacle to build a fake community, to distract as well as scare, to keep the people from thinking from themselves. Donald Sutherland gives a chilling performance as the perfectly Machiavellian president. It is the trusted Roman concept of ""panem et circenses"", bread and games with a good measure of fear thrown in. The most important task is to keep people to think for themselves. Distracting them, making them focus on feeding their families, keeping them afraid of what will happen if they step out of line are mechanisms employed by dictators all over the world and throughout history and they are used and shown here.<br/><br/>In addition, The Hunger Games is also a biting and disturbing satirical unmasking of the workings of television and other means to manipulate the masses. What might seem harmless enough in our society can only too easily be made to serve any purpose at all. The ""games"" are first and foremost brilliant entertainment, gripping, full of suspense and nail- biting intensity, a perfectly produced TV show personified in Stanley Tucci's unsettlingly excellent showmaster. More than once the audience find themselves the the role of the spectator, drawn into voyeurist mode, enjoying this a little too much. It is the basic principle of the ancient gladiator battles as well as today's ""Reality TV"". Others' suffering is our entertainment, their humiliation or triumph. There is something thoroughly totalitarian in this and the film does a great job at showing this, giving the viewer an uneasy feeling about being entertained.<br/><br/>There is much more to be said: about the skillful use of the hand-held camera to convey the fear, the the horror, the stark reality behind the entertainment, the fact that people are paying the ultimate price for others to have fun; the frightening realism which never make one feel this to be a distant future; the brilliant cast that fills these characters with more life than we can handle. The Hunger Games may cater to the same market as Twilight and the like, but it does not play in the same league, it does not even play the same game. Director Gary Ross has turned Suzanne Collins' novel into a gripping film which makes no compromises and does not spare the audience. And they still love it. Maybe Hollywood has underestimated their audience in the past? It can only be hoped the message is not lost."

"rogerdarlington","Null","0","5","1 April 2012"," A successful franchise kicks off
","Following the ""Potter"" and ""Twilight"" transpositions of a series of young adult novels into a sequence of money-spinning movies, the gap in the market has surely been filled by ""The Hunger Games"", the first of three books from Suzanne Collins and the first of four films planned for the new franchise.<br/><br/>Set in the near future in a land once called North America and now named Panem, the games are an excessively grandiose and violent version of reality television in which 12 impoverished Districts are required annually to select at random one boy and one girl aged 12 to 18 who will fight to the death, leaving only one survivor, simply for the entertainment of the pampered citizens of the Capitol. There are many other films that have deployed a similar theme, the one that comes most to my mind being ""Rollerball"" in 1975, but this version is created with panache and appeal with a mix of splendid sets, outrageous costumes, sustained tension, and a (barely) sufficient degree of violence.<br/><br/>At the heart of the novel and the movie is the selfless, brave and resourceful 16 year old Katniss Everdeen - the first name comes from a plant and the second from a character in a Thomas Hardy book. She is wonderfully acted by Jennifer Lawrence who was so brilliant in ""Winter's Bone"" and is clearly set for stardom. Josh Hutcherson is winsome enough as Peeta, the other District 12 ""tribute"", and there are some colourful adult support roles from the likes of Woody Harrelson and Stanley Tucci.<br/><br/>For me as an adult viewer, the only real problem was the violence - or lack of it. In order to secure a PG13 rating in the US and a 12A rating in the UK and enable the age group at which the book is aimed to see the movie, the amount of gore had to be contained, but this takes the edge off what should be a horrific set of encounters and certainly ""Rollerball"" hit much, much harder on this score."
"frankw6895","7","0","6","30 March 2012"," The Hunger Games
","The movie version was well done. Elizabeth Banks was excellent. Jennifer Lawrence was too tall and well-fed for the book's smallish Katniss. I thought the young actors, except for the tall, tough-looking blond actress, Leven Rambin, who played Glimmer, looked too small and soft, especially the actors who played Cato and Clove. Cato and Clove were huge in size and ferocious-looking in the book. Cato was especially a major presence in the book, but much less so in the movie. I thought the tough-looking Mr. Hemsworth should have played Cato, and the tall, tough-looking Ms. Rambin should have played Clove. Too many times pretty boys and girls in Hollywood don't look and talk tough enough, and that's why they can't transition to adult action roles. I was disappointed in the book and movie that religion was left out completely, especially Christianity. Latinos were non-existent, yet they are the fastest-growing minority in the U.S. right now. Maybe they were wiped out in District 13?"

","I was very curious about the whole hype. Did not know much about the movie before watching it, nor did I read the books. I found the story revolves about quite a disturbing theme: young people and kids have to kill each other until one remains. Is this where we are heading in the future? That is a troubling thought. But considering how extreme shows have to go to get an audience and one has to be more extreme than the next, who knows. Too nervous camera - OK, it adds to the dynamic, but in the movie theater it is a bit too much. The movie is otherwise well made and I will go see the next installment. But I can't get the thought out of my mind relating to the killing each other off bit. Maybe that's the point...."
"terjehy","6","0","6","30 March 2012"," Great movie production, but to much speculative violence
","Futuristic landscapes, cities, buildings, people with the most amazing costumes, was making the film a great cinematic experience.<br/><br/>Content-wise, however, I was very disappointed. The cinematic was, as I said, very good, with exciting ""sitting on the edge"" fight scenes, etc. However, there was no exciting twist in the film. Only a story of how the elite in the society suppressed these 12 districts, by allowing 24 youths between 13 to 18 (?) years old, kill each other in a speculative reality television series to the delight of the master race. It all ends with a slightly sad love story, where we can see that the female lead actor loved another.<br/><br/>If the 24 youths along the way in the ""sick"" game had seen it pointless to kill each other, and had initiated a revolt against the master race, the history would have a much more meaningful content.<br/><br/>So - Great movie production, but the story was so thin, that it for my part, came out as speculative violence."

","The nation of Panem makes its districts to send a teenage boy and girl to compete in The Hunger Games. The Hunger Games are a televised event in which ""Tributes"" have to fight each other until one survivor is left standing. A young girl, Katniss, played forcefully by Jennifer Lawrence is forced to rely upon her instincts, along with being coached by a drunk - a former winner. The VOICE meets SURVIVOR? Well, no. A reality show that is completely insane like NETWORK? Okay, no. But The Hunger Games does entertain and the cast, the whole cast is fun to watch. Good performances from Jennifer Lawrence, Josh Hutcherson and Liam Hemsworth top off the cast. The action was big, but not necessarily ""epic"" and it didn't move as fast as did the book. However, I did like the movie and would definitely go back and see it again - or the sequel. It is a fun movie and, at times, it is intense."

After the games end, there is about five minutes of different clips all jammed together, and then it ends.<br/><br/>The camera was way too wobbly, and there were a lot of parts where I couldn't even understand what was going on, because of the camera.<br/><br/>It was a fantastic movie.

","Jennifer is an excellent actress. I am not sure she was meant to play this role however. I think she should have been smaller than her co star... As was described in the book. The actor who played ""Peeta"" was at least two inches shorter than ""Katniss"". He was supposed to be large and strong. She was supposed to be small and hungry . Perhaps it was Peeta who was miscast. There is nothing wrong with meat on the bones...but casting should be accurate. She could have done a better job of conveying her inner conflict and her defiance as well. Also... The cinematography was out of control. A Dramamine is highly recommended. They had such amazing scenery and set design and such psychotic photography. The costuming and casting is, in many respects, excellent. All in all, I wouldn't want the task of taking this brilliant novel and trying to turn it into a film... So ultimately it warrants my undying respect and approval. It's just difficult to transition from the medium of the written word into film. There will inevitably be things that fall through the cracks."

","I'm a huge fan of the novels, so going into this movie i set my expectations low. The film was actually very entertaining. Being PG-13 not much blood and guts were shown, which I wish there was more, then again we have to remember that kids will be seeing this movie too. The plot of the movie is set in the future. North America as become a country known as Panem. Panem is set into 12 districts (there were 13), and there are all run by the Capitol. Every year the Capitol holds The Hunger Games, where one boy and girl ranging the ages from 12-18 are randomly drawn from each district. Those 24 kids have to fight to the death while being broadcast for their country to see. Katniss is the main character to volunteers to take her little sister's place. Jennifer Lawrence played a perfect Katniss, she is exactly how I pictured the main character being. Woody Harrelson plays a great Haymitch, who is considered a big drunk. I would consider the movie to be very well done, if I hadn't read the books, but like I said before, I knew there would be some disappointments in the film."

","As I was pulling out of the drive in after watching ""The Hunger Games"" I noticed a young girl stand up on her pick-nick blanket and shout to the stars, ""That was the best movie ever!"" And I tended to agree with her. But as I drove home, Listening to my brother praise what they had just saw, I realized I was not participating in the praise. Because a dark negativity was building up in the back of my mind... ""What was wrong with this movie? Why did I not enjoy as much as every one else?"" Then it hit me... ""Because I read the books."" I did consider myself caught up in the hype when i hurded ""The Hunger Games"" was going be a movie, but I should have known that i didn't stand hope of being satisfied. This Movie could have been so much more.<br/><br/>there's nothing wrong with the actors, aside from JL being a bit to old for the part, all the performances are strong.<br/><br/>And Then there's the camera work. Oh, that Camera work. Who ever filmed this movie definitely had Attention deficit disorder. It look like it was filmed by a ten year old girl playing hopscotch.<br/><br/>But that's not what erked me the most. Lets start from the beginning.<br/><br/>There's no hunger in the hunger games. Everyone (exspecialy Katniss) looks plump and healthy. Making the bread toss scene, where in the book Petta throws a near death, starving Katniss a loaf of burnt bread, completely without meaning.<br/><br/>A complete lack of brutality on the Governments part. In the book the Governemnt is this evil, Vile state that will execute anyone at the mear hint of rebellion. But in the movie, when district 11 breaks out in protest of the games, what do you think the Government does? Massecre them all with machine gun fire? No. they send in the Riot police and blast them with water canons and beat them with sticks. which, correct me if I'm wrong, is what we do today? And the one character that could have given a glimpse of the Governments ruthlessness (The Avox Girls) is cut completely. We are given no reason why we should fear this government.<br/><br/>Now we come to the Games themselves. None of these kids look like they're about to enter a cage match to the death. at the beginning of the games when they rise up out of the ground, they all stand there poised like they are about to take place in a fifty yard dash where at the end the winner gets a cookie. there's nothing on these kids faces that suggest any sort of fear that many of them might be dead in a matter of moments.<br/><br/>And it just gets worse from there. The careers, the most trained and prepared members of the tributes, skip and giggle through the woods with no sense of danger. It feels like a high school easter egg hunt.<br/><br/>Katina's is made to be far to capable. She finds water, hatches plans, and traps food with little or no effort.<br/><br/>Katniss and Rue's relationship is barely given time to mature before Rue meats her fate. And Katniss and Peeta love efforts are miss handled, mainly do to some unnecessary changes. It's not even worth a ""let's just be friends"" scene at the end.<br/><br/>Over all, I felt Thresh was the moist interesting character and he's only on screen for about five seconds. The Movie is hit or miss as far as doing the books justice and for those who would say ""you need to review the movie on is own Maurits"" well... This movie would not be doing the victory dance it's doing if it weren't for the books.<br/><br/>6/10 for getting it a little more then half right."
"stak441","7","0","5","28 March 2012"," Could have been great...
","The good: This looked promising from the beginning, the setting, the idea behind the game, the main character. I was expecting another action-centered movie based around a sadistic game show that, for some, reason manages to be highly accepted and liked by the society, without raising the question ""Wait, isn't that wrong""? The film makers, however, took their time to rationalize such behavior and to explain why the game participants actually try to get the audience to like them. <br/><br/>The characters are quite believable and some of them have sufficient character development. Still, I think the character of Woody Harrelson is highly underdeveloped and he appeared to be the most interesting and promising one. I really think the director should have put more screen time and emphasis on him.<br/><br/>Now for the bad: The initial pace was OK, but the culmination came and ended to quickly. In the end I was like ""Duh, was that it?"". At some point in the movie there was a hint that the plot will continue also outside of the Games (the riot at district 11). This, however, was just a teaser. The action in the whole movie was very limited, but that might be a good thing because the shaky camera made those scenes unbearable to watch.<br/><br/>Overall, the Hunger Games had a lot of potential but it was never fully realized. But this is to be expected from book adaptations, isn't it? 6 out of 10"

","Im going to start like everyone else and say i am a big fan of this series and i was excited when i heard about this movie. When i watched it, i wasn't disappointed, it brought my whole imagination to life. The director did a good job of adapting a challenging novel like this. Some movies like Percy Jackson just didn't live up to the franchise, but i thought that they did a great job here, of course nothing like lord of the rings quality, i mean there were some missing scenes and a few things that weren't explained(I will get to that later) But overall a great effort.<br/><br/>Like I said i am a big fan of the franchise, there was just one problem, i haven't read the book in 2 years so when they did the big hand gesture scene and riot, i thought they could've at least explained about it more, and my friends who have not read the book were just really confused. <br/><br/>But other than that i really enjoyed it, maybe a little more back story about the time period and other districts would have helped, but i cant complain this is a really complex novel to convert into a full length film."

I know that they were trying to be as true to the book as possible and some things had to be left out but they didn't include enough from the book to allow some one who hadn't read it to know what was going on.My nephew purposely avoided the book until he could see the movie and he was disappointed.. 'Reminded me of 'The Running Man' he said. The movie makers included some bits from the book that would have explained a lot and could have been very dramatic on screen but they just skimmed over the parts with no back ground info, so after viewing the scenes people are asking ""What was that supposed to be about...like in the scene *****SPOILER ALERT!!!... where the District 12 children give her the hand gesture, and then its repeated in the arena, or when Rue's district pooled what money they could find to sponsor Katniss so they could send her food...don't get me wrong it was a decent movie, but John Carter was a lot better."

","Okay,let me start of by saying great movie, stayed true to the book.

They make up like 20 percent of the fans, almost 3/4 of my school are reading them. 11-13 year olds! Not to mention that it will lose many viewers. The rating was good, I think they even passed that pg.13 rating. Who cares if you didn't see this kill part or that kill part? As long as you get the feel of the brutality of it. Lions gate kept it under control, no too violent, not too gory.<br/><br/>Camera work-Ugh, at the beginning of the movie I started feeling sick with the camera jerking all over the place...Its supposed to make u feel action, but it just made me feel dizzy... Especially in the arena? Whoa, I had to close my eyes for like 2 minutes....<br/><br/>Scenes were a bit too short-Each scene was so short! When I read the book, it felt longer. For example when Katniss gets the visitors? Yeah, short. Even rue's death! Also, cato's death.....<br/><br/>Overall, amazing movie, I just rated it down to six for these reasons :/ but I'm pretty sure im going to buy the CD when it comes out!"

Libertarians like myself in particular will love the anti-state, anti-war messages of the film, which shine through quite well. <br/><br/>Cons: Feels like what should have been an epic 3 1/2 to 4 hour long R-rated movie brutally cut down and condensed in order to reach a broader 'tween' audience with short attention spans. The reasons for doing so are obvious: draws in a wider audience and makes more money. This is understandable from a studio perspective, but the result is a good movie instead of a great one, which I find tragic, given its potential."
"macho_mz","8","0","10","27 March 2012"," Don't listen to the haters...
","I usually dislike movie adaptations of books I have read, but this was a pleasant surprise! A lot of fan reviews have been way too focused on every itty bitty detail that wasn't exactly like they pictured it- guess what, no movie will be. Yes, some actors don't look much like the characters they portray and some scenes didn't follow the book word for word. Overall, I thought they did a good job of capturing the spirit of the book. They put in as much detail as they could while maintaining a PG-13 rating. It wasn't overly graphic, but you still got the same feel of the original story. My only criticism is that because the book is so full of detail, the movie might feel a bit rushed if you haven't read the book first.<br/><br/>On a side note, for all the haters that say Suzanne Collins poorly plagiarized the Japanese novel, ""Battle Royale,"" you need to read more. The basic plot of citizens in a dystopian society being forced to fight is NOT an original plot. The idea has been used in literature for years, most claiming Roman gladiator games as the inspiration. ""Battle Royale"" was not widely released in the US, so it isn't far-fetched that Collins said she had never heard of it until the comparisons started. It's like the man who sued Dan Brown over ""The Da Vinci Code"" because he wrote a book about 20 years earlier discussing the idea of the true nature of the Holy Grail. Those theories have been around for centuries (which Dan Brown noted in the book's preface). Why not claim that ""Twilight"" was a rip-off because it wasn't the first book about a human falling in love with a vampire? Broaden your horizons people!"
"JKhop","7","0","3","27 March 2012"," The Hunger Games - Family Friendly Version?
","The Hunger Games certainly exceeded my expectations. Advertised heavily with similarities towards Battle Royale which never received an American release with the controversy surrounding the subject after the columbine school shootings. This film takes a far more delicate approach to conveying the violence contained in the film making it more appealing for a larger audience.<br/><br/>The world that Suzanne Collins created in her novel comes together on film like I imagined,with the exception being the Capitols guards look like the stormtroopers from Spaceballs. After getting past that, the stage is set for why the Hunger Games exist and how it is a form of entertainment for the Capitols citizens, and a cruel reminder for the districts past transgressions.<br/><br/>Once the Games begin the film starts to fall apart. Having such little knowledge of tributes killed off early leaves you feeling no emotion. The weapons that are available for the tributes are far too shiny and elegant and lacked the crude nature I had envisioned. An important concept that seemed lost in the film was survival, not just from those who mean you harm, but the environment; Starvation, dehydration and desperation. The psychological aspect of the reality of their situation never really settles upon any tribute. That is where it falls short, and the characters become less believable. Sadly making this film more violent would have created a stronger emotional impact, it lacked pain, both physical and emotional. The games themselves should have made the viewers feel uncomfortable. If the second book is made into a film it will have issues showing why the characters act they way they do in a believable manner.<br/><br/>While I liked this film, I still believe the games themselves could have been better portrayed. This is however difficult with a younger audience as its intended viewer.<br/><br/>7/10"
"Robert-63","7","0","5","26 March 2012"," Fine adaptation, more action-heavy than the book, well worth seeing.
","This is a fine action film which I think will leave both those who have read and those who have not read the source material pleased. It's faithful to the source in its broad strokes, if a little disappointing in leaving out some key scenes I felt made the book special. I was surprised they kept in as much of the ending as they did, but felt they did it well, considering what they excised in getting there.<br/><br/>When a movie is adapted from a well-known book, some people will always have anxiety that lines of dialog, characters, actions, pieces of jewelry will all have some deep hidden meaning that they are somehow missing out on fully appreciating if they have not read the book.<br/><br/>Some people recognize that the way to fix this is to read the book before they see the movie. Some people, alas, do not. Instead they see the movie with someone who *has* read the book, and at every change of scene ask, ""What is that, is that important?"" apparently completely forgetting the simple dictum of films made for the general public that IF SOMETHING IS REALLY IMPORTANT IT WILL BE EXPLAINED TO YOU.<br/><br/>A person of the latter type and his enabling date were sitting behind me for _The Hunger Games_, and it was during the tracker jacker sequence that I nearly had to turn around in my seat and remind him of this simple dictum. In the book, Katniss has a page or two to explain, after she spies the hive, what tracker jackers are. It can take a few minutes to read. In the movie, it takes literally a few seconds for the broadcasters of the Games to explain what is going on, and yet somehow there was time for the anxious gentleman behind me to ask his date, ""What are 'tracker jackers'? Are they important?"" *and* for her to actually start answering him before the 0.4 seconds of screen time passed that it took for the characters to answer his question for him.<br/><br/>Turning this simple dictum to a later point in the film, I would say that the wild dog beasts are sufficiently well-explained as created by the Gamemakers to provide a new challenge to the Tributes without going into the Muttations as they are explained in the book, and without needing to add the emotional conflict created by the specific origins of these Muttations.<br/><br/>I have to say, two fine points of Collins's writing did not strike me until I was watching the movie. One is related to the wild dog Muttations and Peeta's desire to die ""as himself."" The other is the nice touch of the final outcome of the Hunger Games being decided by something they choose to eat."

That reason is because I'm 13, and like most 13-year-old girls, we believe that Josh Hutcherson's hotness shouldn't be messed with by giving him an artificial leg like they did in the book! Clearly in the movie they don't give him a fake leg, so his hotness remains intact, even when he is covered in mud. However, I give this movie a 9/10 because of the crappy camera shaking and the important details that were unfortunately left out. But hey, it's a movie, and time is limited. Every other scene that wasn't trimmed or altered was pretty cool and seriously accurate. I especially loved when Katniss hallucinated Peeta telling her to, ""Run!

Snow was just as I thought, Donald Sutherland portrayed him well as evil, and although we didn't see much of him in this first film his evilness really came over. Loved all the wacky costumes, they were as in all the books. Haymitch was also as imagined from the book, although I thought the drunk acting in the beginning could have been better, but he did get better when he started coaching Katniss and Peeta.

","I need to begin this review by saying that this film really does live up to the hype it's receiving. I've read the books and was looking forward to seeing the story unfold on film and it didn't disappoint. Having been previously let down by Harry Potter and Twilight movies because they deviated from the book, I loved that this script was faithful to the book and only minor changes were made. The acting is fantastic, enough cannot be said about Jennifer Lawerance, she did a great job. Without revealing to much I'm glad the emphasize was not on gore and brutality and more focused on reactions and how horrible the situations are. You see enough to be shocked but at the same time you don't become desensitized by seeing bloodbath after bloodbath, I think it was handled well. My only compliant would be the hand held cameras. Having moments were everything is blurry and you can't focus is good at driving home a point, (that Katniss is overwhelmed or shocked) but also can make one dizzy and frustrated because we do want to know what's going on.

","This movie is near perfect, and as far as book adaptations go this film is right up there with Harry Potter and the Lord of the Rings films. The tension that Katniss is feeling in The Launch Room literally had my stomach in knots, never had I personally felt a connection to a character in any film i've seen than in that moment. With the mention of Katniss, Jennifer Lawrence's performance in this film is sublime. Her normally bubbly, charismatic personality is non-existent in the character she portrays, Katniss truly stepped out of the book in a near ""Oscar"" worthy performance ( seems slightly exaggerated, but it was breathtaking).<br/><br/>My Exact thoughts: Peeta.......jeez (marry me) The Capitol itself as beautiful as it was I still wouldn't live there, place reeks of evil.<br/><br/>The arena, spot on.<br/><br/>Effie, my new Halloween costume.<br/><br/>Haymitch, weird.<br/><br/>Cinna my third favorite character.<br/><br/>Honestly the only semi negative I can say about this film, hence the 9, is that even though the film was two and a half hours long, some scenes felt rushed, and some scenes were too long, other than that this film is wonderful and cannot in anyway shape or form be compared to twilight (sorry had to do it).<br/><br/>To keep it short, go watch it, even if you haven't read the book please go see this, it a wonderful adaptation that will make you actually want to read the book, but more importantly will make you a fan of the hunger games.

","I just watched this movie, and I was not disappointed! I read the entire book series, and the first one was my favorite, so I was very excited.I don't usually enjoy science fiction books or movies, however Collin's writing had me hooked. So even if this doesn't sound like the type of book you would enjoy, still give it a try. I recommend reading the book before seeing the movie, because I believe it will enhance the world you discovered through the books, but even if you don't, I think you will be able to follow along for most of the movie. They give a brief explanation of what will be occurring as soon as the movie starts. <br/><br/>What I enjoyed the most about the movie was that the story and events were not altered or changed during the translation from page to screen. I'm not sure how they pulled it off, but they somehow included practically everything that was in the book! I noticed only one change that concerned me due to the plot in the following books, but I'm confident they will find a way to make it work in the later movies.<br/><br/>****SPOILERS BELOW**** There was one scene I really wish they would have included because it was one of my favorites in the book, however I understand they couldn't include everything from the book while still keeping the movie at a reasonable time. I really wish they would have added the cave scene where Katniss tells Peeta she wants to go home. I think this scene would have shown more of each person's character's personality. <br/><br/>****END OF SPOILERS<br/><br/>The costumes and sets were perfect. They were almost identical to what I imagined from the book. The acting was phenomenal; every actor was able to portray perfect emotions as to what was going on. Every person fit perfectly to the character they portrayed. <br/><br/>I would recommend this movie to anyone, but especially those who read the books.

"ZombiGurl","7","0","6","25 March 2012"," Happy Hunger Games and may the odds be ever in your favour!
","Hunger Games is set in a futuristic society in which there is a huge difference in the society classes. The Society was set up with 12 Districts under the control of the state. At some point, there was an uprising against the Government in the past. The rebels lost their fight and as punishment, the Districts are strictly controlled. They are only allowed a small amount of food and resources. The surplus of goods are sent to the Capitol City where the inhabitants live a lush lifestyle. As a reminder not to start an uprising again, each Distict is forced to enter their children into the Reaping. At the Reaping, two children (a boy and a girl) are chosen too participate in the Hunger Games. The Hunger Games are a no holds barred fight to the death. Only one participant is allowed to win, so children are forced to fight to the death. All of this is televised live in the Capitol City and the other Districts. <br/><br/>Capitol City is beautiful with large glass buildings and beautiful scenery. Everything is very high tech and fashionable. All the inhabitants have to do for food is push a button and food arrives fresh, steaming, and delicious. Their showers are equipped with lovely smelling shampoos and soaps with a touch of a button. The people in the city are dressed outlandishly in bright colours and garish outfits. I got the feeling that they are supposed to be extremely shallow and only concerned with fashion and gossip. In sharp contrast to this are the other districts. The people in the Districts are literally starving to death with not enough food. They quite often have inadequate shelter and the clothes they own are old and worn. They have to work hard for anything they have and they value their family. Family is the most important thing to them.<br/><br/>Katniss Everdeen is a skilled hunter with a bow and arrow. She sneaks under the electric fence surrounding the city every day and hunts for food all day long to feed her family. She trades in her daily catch at the market downtown for anything her family might need. Without Katniss hunting everyday her family would soon die of starvation. Gale is a good friend and helps her hunt and they share everything they catch. <br/><br/>It is mandatory that Katniss and her family attend the Reaping. Katniss' younger sister, Prim is chosen as the Tribute in the Reaping. Katniss is appalled and offers herself up as a volunteer to go to the Hunger Games in place of her sister. Peeta, the baker's son, is chosen as the other tribute from District 12. Katniss and Peeta are whisked away to the modern and outlandish Capitol City where they are trained and scored to get ready for the Hunger Games.<br/><br/>I was impressed with how the movie closely follows the book's description of the Capitol City and it's inhabitants. There are some things that are changed, but I think it was in order to let the story flow nicely. Even with all this, the characters don't seem as well developed as they should be. The relationship between Peeta and katniss seems forced, like there wasn't enough time to develop it properly. I think the movie didn't adequately portray what was going on between them. Also I didn't feel as if they got the point across clear enough that people in the Districts were starving to death. The opening scenes in District 12 seem bleak but not lethal.<br/><br/>My biggest problem with the movie was the shaky cam used when it came to the fight scenes in the Hunger Games. I think they had to gloss over the really brutal and inventive death scenes that were so vividly described in the books in order to give it a PG-13 rating. It was hard to focus when the camera was shaking and blurry during any kind of fight scene. Maybe this made them seem more action packed to the audience? Maybe this helped gloss over the fact that 12 year olds were killing each other? I am not saying that I am disappointed with the level of violence shown because I wasn't expecting anything more graphic, I just think they down played it a bit too much. When a major character dies during the games, it seems too rushed or forced with false emotions. As is if the audience never got to know that character in the first place and then the grieving seems excessive and out of place. <br/><br/>I could tell they were setting this movie up to be the first in a very popular series. But, I enjoyed the movie for what it is...A futuristic Sci Fi Action movie. If you are expecting a Horror genre movie, you will be sorely disappointed. However, if you are expecting a nice action movie with a bit of romance in it you will enjoy it. So I would recommend going to see it with an open mind and no pre-conceived ideas of what it should be. Do not compare it to any earlier movies, because it has it's own unique story, characters, and setting. Happy Hunger Games and may the odds be ever in your favour!"
"Richardohyeah","8","0","8","25 March 2012"," A great movie with a mediocre ending
","People seem to apply a superlative and exclamation point on anything they're interested in. ""This is the coolest thing you've ever seen!"" ""This is the best thing ever!"" As with general statements like these, anticipated movies have their reputation of being over-hyped. The most recent culprit of this clichÃ© paradigm is ""The Hunger Games,"" which was made out to be the film that replaced Harry Potter and Twilight as the teen sensation of motion pictures. <br/><br/>The films starts out as many films tend to do. It shows us the grim ghetto of District 12 and the poverty lifestyle that its inhabitants experience. The setting is beautiful, including memorable environments like a lush forest and a futuristic metropolis. The film does a great job of sucking you into its world. Everything from the flashy costumes of the wealthy to the miracle, fast-fixing medicine fits perfectly. <br/><br/>Katniss Everdeen, one of the residents of District 12, is an independent, strong provider for her family. She's a great hunter, a clever intellectual, and shows affection only for her little sister. Jennifer Lawrence does a superb job in capturing Katniss' emotional traumas that she experiences throughout the film. After her sister is chosen as tribute for an annual violent show known as ""The Hunger Games,"" Katniss volunteers to take her sister's place. <br/><br/>The contestants that get screen time do relatively great in their roles. Josh Hutcherson is a treat to watch as Peeta, who seamlessly transforms from a scared boy, to an enthusiastic participant, and finally to the love interest of Katniss. Woody Harrellson is hilarious as the ex-champion of the Hunger Games and Katniss' aid. <br/><br/>The action scenes in this movie are filmed in a shaky cam perspective(Cloverfield, Blair Witch, Chronicle), and although it's vastly more realistic, it's also distracting at times and annoying. Sometimes I just want to see what's happening, not just take a guess. It's not as bad later in the film, but it's still irritating. The action is intense and bloody, albeit for a PG-13 movie. One scene in particular, the start of the Hunger Games, is an absolute thrill ride. The tension built up until finally, the games started and there was silence. It was genius. <br/><br/>The movie did not feel as long as it's runtime. It was slow in the beginning, but it picked up and never slowed down its pace, which is related to the main fault I have with ""The Hunger Games."" The series has 3 books, yet the end of the film felt a bit rushed and sudden. It didn't really hint at any sequel potential, although it had a few unanswered questions. This is my main complaint, however I believe it's still a great movie. <br/><br/>""The Hunger Games"" wonderfully captures the violent tendencies of human nature in addition to our selfish urges. The movie has its fair share of breathtaking moments, but it's muddled by its messy ending. It isn't a Harry Potter killer to me, but it was a great start and I'm very happy to see how the trilogy plays out."
"joshuaiyer","8","0","10","25 March 2012"," A fast-paced film that should be seen by all.
","I went and saw this film on opening day. It was very crowded, but people really got into select parts of the film. I think The Hunger Games is a great movie that should be seen.<br/><br/>First of all, the movie followed the book pretty much through and through. The first half was all about preparing for the Games, and the second half was the actual Games, which was fast-paced, action-packed, and very well done. What was cool is that they showed how the Capitol put in obstacles, like the fire. I liked the design for Katniss's bow and arrow. The first half wasn't bad, but, like the book, was a little harder to get into. I really liked how the train moved fast; that was something I couldn't quite visualize in the book. Some scenes during the first part (i.e. interviews with Katniss and Peeta) were a little slow.<br/><br/>Though this movie is amazing, it isn't without its flaws. This might not have been a problem with some people, but Peeta did not look as I pictured him. There were also several action scenes when the cameras zoomed in so much I could not tell what the heck was going on; whether this was intentional or accidental, I think they should have done something more about this. The music, though not terrible, wasn't exactly as I was picturing it. I did like the song for Rue's death; it was perfect, and added that extra touch to make the scene even sadder than it needed to be. It is my strong philosophy that music tells half the story, so having good music is really important for me during a film; these songs weren't bad, they just weren't good either. <br/><br/>All in all, The Hunger Games was not just an amazing movie, but it was fast, intense, and well done. They followed the book very well, and it helped fixate visuals from the book. On the flip side, various scenes were hard to tell what was going on, and the music, though not terrible, wasn't great. However, The Hunger Games is an incredible film that you should definitely go see, and when it comes out on DVD, buy."
"zornes-6","9","0","11","25 March 2012"," I loved it!!
","As someone who has read the book series I found this to be a very well done movie adaptation of one of my favorite books. The acting was wonderful and all of the main characters were portrayed perfectly. The contrast between the Capital and the Districts was perfect. I was as emotional watching the movie as I was reading the book, However, there are a couple of minor things that kept me from giving it a 10 rating...<br/><br/>I can see how people who have not read the books may not enjoy this movie as much as those who have. I feel that the movie could have shown more development of other tributes besides Katniss and Peeta. It is not as intense watching the death scenes when you know nothing about the tribute. I also feel that Rue's death was much more intense in the book. In the book you are reading Katniss' thoughts and she keeps comparing Rue to her little sister, which then makes Rue's death heart wrenching. In the movie I feel that that connection between Rue and Katniss may have been lacking a little. I also feel that the difficultly of Katniss and Peeta's friendship in the beginning could have also been discussed in more depth. And I feel that the death scenes were not as intense in the movie as they could have been. The camera was also very shaky at times, especially in the first few minutes of the movie, and it was a little hard to watch at times. <br/><br/>However, I thought this movie was very well done and a very faithful adaptation of the book. I think you will get more out of the movie by reading the book first, but you do not have to read the book to enjoy this movie. I give it a 9/10!"
"corneliusdion","7","0","8","25 March 2012"," Not worth an 8.0, but more emotional than twilight saga
","Well, I've just watched it yesterday, and..really? An 8.0..? Please, I think it's a little bit overrated. The chemistry between Jennifer Lawrence and Josh was good, even better than Edward and Bella. Even without saying anything melancholic, they surely have the chemistry. The idea of the film itself is good enough for a teen movies, making it the most epic teen movie ever made. But what I don't like is, why Katniss that in the beginning of the movie, seem to be a strong woman, but in the end her heart easily captured by Josh (as she kiss him spontaneously, and do whatever he said). This movie was quite emotional, really, there's a little girl killed in this movie, and there's betrayal, sadness, loneliness, this movie got all emotions, that's what I called different than twilight. Quite stunning, but not too good. For the next sequel, use more special effects that more eyegasmic than this one, not only with the actors/actresses, that's what make this movie seem to be shadowed by ""Twilight Saga"". But finally, Jennifer Lawrence surely make the odds be in this movie's favor."
"ozzy86433","7","0","8","24 March 2012"," Very Good
","This movie is very well done considering its target audience. If you want a violent movie with a lot of cussing in it, this movie is not for you. However, if you want a dramatic film that is a safer alternative, and something to take your kids to, then this is Perfect. Its violence and drama are on par with the Narnia series, and Woody Harrelson's performance will be enough to get a few laughs from all you parents out there. It is a little bit cheesy in the same way that most Post-Apocalyptic films tend to be, but over-all I found it very enjoyable. I was glad that I went to see this film BEFORE I even saw the trailers, or watched any of the cast interviews or anything like that. I went it to the theater completely Raw, I had never read the books, or seen any of the ""hype"", and having seen the film First, and then investigated it further afterward. This film measures up to its publicity quite well. Do not base your decision to see this film based on what you've read, just GO see it and make up your own mind. In the famous words of Levar Burton on Reading Rainbow... Don't Take My Word For It."
"Jax0524","8","0","11","24 March 2012"," The Hunger Games: a review from a spectator
","I wanted to read the book first before going to see the movie. I enjoyed the book with a few complaints here and there but overall I enjoyed it. As for the movie it was a great adaptation. While a few things were changed from the book it didn't really bother me as much. One scene that was altered for instance:<br/><br/>SPOILERS: The character of Madge was removed completely from the story and originally it was written that Katniss received the Mockingjay pin from her. In the film they made an interesting change and switched it so that Katniss had given the pin to Prim and then later Prim returns the pin to Katniss as they say their farewells. To me it made it all the more poignant and I preferred this as opposed to the way the Mockingjay pin was introduced in the book. So that was a good change.<br/><br/>END OF SPOILER.<br/><br/>The casting choices I thought were great. Jennifer Lawrence plays a terrific independent,headstrong, Katniss. What I liked about her character is that she is strong but its almost to the point where she is cold but with good reason. She is first and foremost a protector, provider, and survivor. You get that she has to be hard,she guards herself from emotion and doesn't attach to people easily because to her its a weakness. Because she's such a hardened character it can be difficult to like her at times.<br/><br/>SPOILERS:<br/><br/>Josh Hutcherson was great as Peeta. The romantic aspect between him and Katniss was taken down a notch and I appreciate that because in the books I felt it was just too much. As the saying goes ""Less is more."" Simple a lot of the time is usually better. We don't need the director making these two kiss each other every few minutes just to show the audience just how much in love these two are, fake or not, Which is what I felt Suzanne Collins was doing in the books. In the film their relationship felt pretty ambiguous you couldn't really make heads or tails of it was it real? was it for show? For those who read the books already know the truth but I'm glad they left it the way they did<br/><br/>Woody Harrelson great Haymitch. Almost exactly how I picture him in the book.<br/><br/>Stanley Tucci, loved him as Caesar Flickerman. I swear every time that man cracked one of those exaggerated smiles showing all 32 of those big white teeth I just burst out laughing. Loved him.<br/><br/>Now for some negatives<br/><br/>I liked the character Rue, unfortunately I wasn't able to get invested enough in her character to feel sad when she died. It was sad but not THAT sad. I will say though that I like her chemistry with Katniss just by the simple gestures you could tell how Katniss was reminded of her twelve year old sister. But I knew the role of Rue's character before I even read the hunger games. She's the character you kill off to let everyone know how sick this game is and how evil the capital is, but just to make it worse lets make it a twelve year old. Almost as if Suzanne is saying are you angry now? But after she died the scene that followed was awesome, Katniss doing the 3 finger salute to the people of District 11 (Rue's hometown) and then the revolt that followed was simply moving and I did about 10 fist pumps when that happened.<br/><br/>And lastly,fire the cameraman because honestly what the hell was going on? was he having a seizure? That camera was all over the place even when the shot didn't require any action that stupid camera was moving. It was awfully distracting.<br/><br/>Overall I say go see this movie. Its enjoyable. Though the camera might be distracting the story is good. I also don't get this comparison between the Hunger Games and Twilight they're not the same. This movie had a plot and I would pass up Twilight to see the Hunger Games any day."
"taydancer77","9","0","12","24 March 2012"," Books fans will LOVE it!!!
","Okay, so I am a hardcore Hunger Games fan, and I was really impressed with the movie. Obviously, they had to leave a lot of stuff out because it's a 2 1/2 hour movie but they managed to pick out the most important stuff from the book and have it in the movie, so that was good. The actors/actresses did a phenomenal job. ****SPOILERS BELOW**** The book was written from Katniss's point of view but the movie didn't just stick to that. We got to see inside the game makers room, and people's reactions inside District 12. We also got to see Haymitch trying to get Katniss sponsors. I thought they made really good decisions about what to add in and what to leave out. I actually disappointed with how short it was. There wasn't much of the ""cave scene"" but what they did have was good. The cornucopia was ridiculous. I mean, I get why they made it look so blockie, so it was easier for Katniss and Peeta to climb at the end, but Suzanne Collins described so well in the book I was shocked when they first showed it. Some parts. I wouldn't recommend for kids under 10, even with parental guidance. There was a little bit of swearing (damn, hell) and some scenes were just downright scary. When the mutts first popped out, literally everyone in my theater screamed. Rue's death is kind of gruesome and really, really sad. All in all it was a really good movie and I was super impressed. And it was mostly because I wasn't expecting it to be that good. I wasn't expecting it to be by the book at all, but it was so much more than I expected. The movie was just really good in its own way. If you haven't read the book you might be a little confused about some parts, but I think book fans will be happy. I know I was."
"jackbelisle","7","0","8","24 March 2012"," The Hunger Games
","I really, really wanted to love this movie. BUT. It was good. Not amazing, but good. I thought most of the action sequences were badly choreographed (very, very shaky camera work) to the extent that if I had not read the book, I would not have known what was going on. Shaky cam was way overused in the beginning scenes of District 12, and the editing was quite choppy. With all the shaky cam though, I did love the set pieces. Being an extra in the film myself, I got to experience the District 12 set in North Carolina, and it was spectacular. It really gave the feel of a run down, depressed town. I loved Stanley Tucci's portrayal of Caesar, equally good was Kravitz's performance as Cinna. Woody Harrelson as Haymitch was a bit too much, and they dulled down on his entire drunk demeanor. Overall I give it a 7 out of 10"
"EmmaDinkins","7","0","7","24 March 2012"," Chix Chat on Film review: Survival of the fittest.
","The excitement surrounding the premiere of this movie was a little unexpected for me because when I read the book I thought that the story was a good one, but not so much as to throw me into a frenzied state with anticipation to see the film. It seemed to me that a huge investment was made in the assumption that the audience that would see The Hunger Games movie were familiar with the book series and were knowledgeable fans, and I think that if that were not the case you would not understand some of the images like Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) in the rain and the loaf of bread encounter with Peeta (Josh Hutcherson). The film did in fact do a good job of making the whole dynamic of their relationship clear, although it did not make it so clear the nature of Katniss' relationship with Gale (Liam Hemsworth). I was really interested in how the final battle would appear, since much of what was discussed in the story specifically relative to the train, the capital and the final battle would be difficult to showcase without very strong special effects. The special effects in this film were nicely done, but the final battle was not as intense as I had imaged it would be. However a pleasant surprise was witnessing the control room as the games unfolded, which was a nice touch. The costuming of the citizens was useful in making it known that the flavor of the Capital City is eccentricity, which is somewhat made clear from the trailer with the over the top appearance of Effie Trinkit (Elizabeth Banks) and Caesar Flickerman (Stanley Tucci). The film made the presence of President Snow (Donald Sutherland) more accessible so that you get a feel for the type of person that he is, no warm and fuzzy from this character. I liked the film, but more so because of my having read the book, I don't feel as though I would have been as understanding of the running time and the lulls in the action sequences, otherwise. It's not possible to unread a book and have that fresh unbiased perspective but aside from the strong performances of the actors and the special effects I would have found the film to be sluggish and I didn't really get emotionally invested until actually experiencing the Katniss interaction with Rue (Amandla Stenberg). For the most part the film was very true to the book, but if you don't know the book, you will be left out in the cold on this one, I give it an amber light."
"LillyMomma","9","0","11","24 March 2012"," Very good, for Hollywood.
","I think the movie was very good considering all the hype from how awesome the books are. I am a huge fan of the books and was very excited to see how well they stuck to the heart and storyline of the books. Keeping in mind that you can't put every single detail from the books into the movie, I thought overall it was very well done.<br/><br/>While depicting the violence quite graphically, camera angles and moves kept the on screen gore to a minimum. Very artfully done and kudos to the director and all editors. Yes, certain aspects of Katniss's relationship with certain characters, like Gale and Peeta weren't entirely fleshed out but it's not surprising. In the book she is completely uncertain herself. She bounces back and forth manically from ""I don't want to hurt Gale but look I'm kissing Peeta to save my life and get sponsors."" It's confusing enough in the book and almost impossible to get that kind of mental confusion on screen without her actually voicing all of those thoughts out loud, which would be weird.<br/><br/>In respect to the anger and oppression felt by the districts toward the capitol... well they kinda got there. Gale and Katniss talk about it a little at the beginning. But for an audience that has not read the books - I think it's almost a little self-explanatory that there is anger at a government that makes them sacrifice their children every year in a 'game'. There weren't any kids fighting from the capitol just the districts, so resentment there really doesn't need to be explained that is just human nature.<br/><br/>There was no mention of District 13 and that was disappointing. But in the second movie they will be more able to show the districts rage over not just killing their children every year but at their anger at the capitol itself and it's unjust treatment of the districts. First movies have to take more time telling back story to set the stage because exposition takes longer and is slower on film than in a book.<br/><br/>So I liked it, I want to go see it again, and I will buying it on DVD. :)"

","I, along with my brother and a co-worker of mine, went to the opening of the Hunger Games and my high expectations were met from the opening credits until the end. The film stayed true to the books, but several things were left out. Avoxes were missing, no Madge, some of the murder scenes were changed (Katniss shooting the arrow into a tribute's stomach instead of through his neck), and a few more. The movie was nearly 2 1/2 hours long, but it felt like it was short. The acting from Jennifer Lawrence was superb (especially the trembling scene). The capitol looked just like how I imagined it to be. Fans of the book will not be disappointed by this movie at all."
"LoveYourMovies","7","0","8","24 March 2012"," Blockbuster Season Get's Underway With The Hunger Games
","With award season over, movie fans seamlessly movie right into blockbuster season. These are the big budget pure entertainment films that make summer exciting and tend to get blood pumping. Blockbuster movies over the summer tend to be the action movie and comic book movies and phenomenon movies and this year looks like it will have a plethora of choices for everyone.<br/><br/>Blockbuster season got off to a roaring start with the adaptation of the first of the wildly popular trilogy of books, The Hunger Games. While they are already projected to be as popular as the Twilight series and some say possibly even Harry Potter. <br/><br/>Set in the distant future world of Panem which is a remnant of the United States the story revolves around a 16 year old girl named Katniss from the poorest district of Panem known as district 12. In Panem all children aged 12-18 from all districts are entered in a lottery to be chosen to participate in what is known as the hunger games. In the hunger games, one boy and one girl from each district is chosen to play a survival game in a wilderness arena where only one winner emerges and that is the last one living. When Katniss' younger sister is chosen in her first year of eligibility, Katniss volunteers to take her place in the hunger games. She is then put through various training scenarios and put on somewhat of a media tour in order to gain sponsors to help provide her with needed supplies during the competition. Along with her fellow district 12 tribute, Peeta, she sets out and changes the outcome of the games and the way they are played much to the dismay of those in high power.<br/><br/>Not having read the books I am forced to look at the movie strictly as that, a movie. Hunger Games is a fairly well told story with great background on characters that aid you in gaining feelings for Katniss and Peeta. With a fairly basic look at what a post apocalyptic world may be it still emits it's own taste as to what upper class is like in Capitol City. While the acting is, like in the majority of blockbuster movies, is nothing to rave about, Jennifer Lawrence solidifies herself as an up and coming star of film. Lawrence already has one academy award nomination under her belt for the haunting and brilliant, Winter's Bone. She is joined by one of the best actors working right now and commonly underrated, Woody Harrelson. Harrelson feels somewhat out of place in this type of movie but begins to fit the character better as the film goes on. <br/><br/>Hunger Games does a fine job of bringing the intensity of the action that is the hunger games to life. While the movies tends to run a little long for having been a story geared towards a younger audience, the time does move rather rapidly and I suspect this is the film maker doing his best to do true justice to the books. <br/><br/>With some visually stunning scenes and a decent amount of action it is not a movie that will leave you feeling unfulfilled. The film makers leave a fine opening for the follow up film. On a pure entertainment level, Hunger Games doesn't miss at all. It has all the elements a summer blockbuster looks for and an originality that has lacked in recent years. It does all this with minimal CGI or special effects, although it doesn't lack in that department for fans of this. Hunger Games has something for everyone and is quite refreshing to not see a vampire or supernatural creations of some kind which tend to be an easy out to try and be creative. <br/><br/>It is the perfect start off for the blockbuster season which looks to be one filled with highly anticipated movies with the likes of The Avengers, Spiderman's reboot, the final installment of the Twilight series and the crescendo of all these movies looks to be The Dark Knight Rises which most likely will shatter any record any of these movies will set beforehand.

"harrisonbradley646","7","0","8","23 March 2012"," Worth the watch
","The trailers made it look so very good. I had three movies I wanted to watch this year which I thought were going to be amazing. The Hunger Games, Prometheus and The Hobbit. So far is has started on a bit of a dip.<br/><br/>As I was saying, great trailer, so much hype and hey this could be a great westernish version of Battle Royale. But it is not. Would I have liked The Hunger Games more if I hadn't watched Battle Royale? Probably. I suppose it is not fair comparing the two. It is like comparing Star Wars with Star Trek just because they are in space, or Tomb Raider with Indiana Jones just because they're both adventures but it is an immediate starting point, and the only other movie I can compare it to.<br/><br/>When I went into the theatre I was expecting great things. Maybe the next Harry Potter type franchise, because lets be fair, there is a hole to be filled. I was however impressed. It was a great film just not worth the 90%+ ratings I have been or rotten tomatoes.<br/><br/>If anything (despite being not new) the concept of the movie was always going to keep me interested. I'm a huge fan of Battle Royale. Both have deeper meanings. The Hunger Games on the act of oppression and the obsession of entertainment whilst Battle Royale was more a social commentary on the fears for children after the humiliation for Japan after WW2, (sort of). The Hunger Games focus' more on story and love whilst Battle Royale is more character building and revenge and love. So completely different yes.<br/><br/>SPOILERS BEYOND<br/><br/>Anyway, The Hunger Games was interesting. It spent about half of the movie building a character for Katniss so we can care. I knew she was going to win in the end. There are three books after all. What I didn't get is the lack of character for any other person. Battle Royale which is extremely violent has more character building and we are supposed to feel less for most of them who are cannon fodder bar the main guys. I can't decided whether The Hunger Games wanted us to care or not for any of them apart from Peter and the Girl from district 11. That scene I did not get. The girl from district 11 was one of the youngest and had no speaking lines except up until 15 minutes before she is quickly killed by a spear through the chest (which we don't see due to is being a pg-13/12a rating). Of all the faults I picked with the movie it was this. Because it was made fairly obvious we were supposed to care, exemplified by Katniss' crying and laying of flowers. Overall it felt quite, disconnected. Like you were just watching the fight and not a part of the fight. If that is what they went for I think it was a bad idea. For example, the black male saving Katniss then having no on screen death and just out of the movie. It just felt like, 'Oh this guy is dead, was just an unimportant extra to fill the full 24 participants for the games'. I do understand this it probably due to the book, but the script can be re-written.<br/><br/>Anyway, I liked the film. It is worth watching, it is by no means a waste of time or money. I look forward to seeing the second and maybe third one because quite frankly I want to know what happens from now."

","If you've read the books this will contain no spoilers what so ever but if you have not read the books as of yet this will. I've seen amazing books ruined when they were made into films e.g Eragon but this film will not be amongst them this film starts slow with them showing the relationships with Katniss giving her a back story, and this only helps the film with the later stages being one adrenalin rush after another. With the little breaks for example when Katniss takes the time to put flowers over and around Rue's body and then back to the adrenalin when you see what reaction this has in Rue's district (The Riot). I must also tip my hat to Jennifer Lawrence when I first saw she'd been cast as Katniss I wasn't sure she could pull it off but I was wrong she did it amazingly. When this film ended I and quite a few other people in the cinema clapped once or twice it was just that good all I can say is bring on Mockingjay. To end I will say this if you liked the film you'll like the book and if you like the book you'll like the film. Or as in my case if you loved the book you will love this film."
