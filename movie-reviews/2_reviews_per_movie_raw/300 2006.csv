","This film isn't for all people. That's to say about a lot of movies in general of course, but this one in particular brings up a big clashing point between critics; What do we want to see in our movies? What is more important, to portray a fictional setting for the sake of giving people a mind blowing visual experience or to amuse and amaze them with clever plot twists and intelligent dialogs?<br/><br/>First lets analyze what exactly this film is made of. Basically, the whole thing is just one epic fighting scene after another. Most noticeably is the camera work and the visual effects. Every shot seems like it was intended to be a work of art. The colors, the characters, the costumes, the backgrounds... every little detail has been given so much attention. During the big fights you'll also instantly notice the unique editing. There are a lot of ""time slowdowns"" throughout the battles which show what exactly is happening. Fatal wounds that slowly leak blood spatters in the air, decapitated heads traveling in slow-motion across the screen... it's all there. <br/><br/>The story on the other hand isn't very complicated, in the sense that the whole movie could probably be described in a sentence or two. The dialogs are simple and most often talk about moral values like freedom and honor. If you would look at the script, it would probably look like another movie that has nothing more to offer then idealistic visions of how life should be.<br/><br/>Reviewers of this title seem to be split up in two groups. They either love it with passion calling it an epic movie of the 21th century, or hate it even more and throw it off like a piece of garbage consisting of mindless action and silly clich√© phrases. I feel reluctant to take a position in this argument. Normally it's tolerable to weigh out both sides of this matter to result in a fair judgment about a movie. Not in this one. On the one hand the visual are surely among the best to be witnessed in a movie. Every detail, every background, every special effect set to the scenes are so mindblowingly stunning. On the other hand the plot and dialogs are of the most simplistic and quite frankly dumb kind. ""I fight for freedom! I'd rather die in honor then live in shame!"" Sounds familiar? <br/><br/>Of course it could be debated that this movie was never intended in the first place to have a unique plot that makes your head spin. But from an objective point of view it's still lacking in this department, so it should be noted.<br/><br/>Now that's fine and all, but does that all make of the film? Is it worth watching or what? I think it is. For me the good outweighs the bad by miles. From the second the movie started it grabbed me and didn't let go. Every battle, every scene of the movie had me at the tip of my chair. Everything from the strong acting to the wondrous visuals to the war-shouts of the soldiers was just so stunning... it was truly a wonderful experience.<br/><br/>I did not one single moment felt like the movie lacked anything. But I could imagine why other people did.<br/><br/>So here's the deal.<br/><br/>If you are easily impressed by beautiful landscapes, wonderful camera-work and editing and powerful acting then go see this. Right. Now. You'll be missing out if you don't. There is so much to see, so much power in the way this comic is translated to the big screen... It'll leave you in awe.<br/><br/>However, you are looking for a good story, clever plot twists, some innovating to the world of the movies then skip this. 300 contains nothing of this, nor does it wants to give you this. <br/><br/>I enjoyed this movie so much, but I know there will be people that will pass of as rubbish, and that's understandable. Just be sure to make up your mind about what you want to see when you go to the theater yourself instead of being drawn into bias by the tons of reviews this site has to offer."

","After I saw the teaser for 300 I knew I HAD to see this movie! From then on I avoided all other previews, reviews, etc. as not to influence my expectations of the movie. I then went into the theater on opening night with no knowledge of the plot... only that it had something to do with Greeks and Frank Miller! Ignorance is bliss! I was absolutely blown away. I'm a 26 yr old female who generally doesn't watch violent films... but I found the battle scenes so well done and breath taking. I had chills and goosebumps virtually the entire film. I'm with many other reviewers, who felt like they had to contain themselves from shouting ""yeah!"" at times. Maybe I'm crazy, but I thought the whole movie was very sexy and passionate, whether it was the sex scene, a battle scene, or Leonidis addressing his men.<br/><br/>I think it is a shame that so many people are condemning this movie for it's historical inaccuracies, or it's ""racism"", etc. People are reading far too into this movie. Whatever happened to enjoying a movie simply because it is entertaining and pleasing to to the eye? Don't people watch movies anymore to escape from the daily grind of life? I know I'm not as well spoken as many who have posted here. I just think this was a fantastic movie. I didn't go see it to learn anything! I just wanted to be entertained! And boy was I!"

","300 tells the story of the 300 Spartans who defended their homes against the Persian army. The movie is a phenomenal action packed story that sticks pretty close to the actual events. The movie is done in a style similar to a graphic novel which adds high contrast and beautiful slow motion scenes. Overall, the movie is incredibly entertaining and tells a fascinating story."
"CrassActionHero","9","784","1381","31 March 2007"," Forget the Naysayers, 300 Delivers!
","300(2007) <br/><br/>Review: 300 has been given lots of criticism. People like to view in the political way. That is not the way. Here's my take.<br/><br/>300 is an entertaining movie. This is all about the action and it's Spartans. The movie takes about the first 30 minutes to give us plot development before the Spartans take it to the battlefield.<br/><br/>The action is the key. The slow motion action is what really delivers. This is like a ballet of blood done so nicely. The action needless to say is satisfying. We are given lots of campy dialog and some good humor here and there that works. Gerard Butler is wonderful. He embodies the great king. Becomes him.<br/><br/>Now, on to the politics, 300 has it's own politics, but it was also based on a comic book written back in 1998. How can this be a pro-Bush statement? This is just like another Frank Miller picture, Sin City. The point is to make the comic book come to life. 300 was written by Frank Miller almost a decade ago and you think this is right-wing propaganda? <br/><br/>Listen to me. Take a deep breath and lighten up. Okay? <br/><br/>One last thing, this movie is NOT a history lesson. This is based on a graphic novel, similar to a movie made back in 1962, and is inspired by the battle in 480 B.C. This is not racist either.<br/><br/>The Last Word: 300 delivers what is was sent out to do. Action. Entertainment. Skin. Ignore the naysayers and enjoy. Excellent popcorn fun."
"shoukanmahou","9","431","748","21 May 2007"," A great movie!
","It seems that everyone who hated this movie must have written a review, so I thought I'd throw in my two cents to even things up a bit. First, if you assume every movie is made simply to uppercut some sort of ideology into the audience's chest, then yes, it does seem very racist, xenophobic, and the like. However, this film is based on a freakin' comic book! The Spartans were some of the most skilled, nastiest, nationalistic fighters out there, and certainly had reason to be more driven and nationalistic than Persia's, which was not an army of individuals fighting for their land and families. Should they have been portrayed differently simply to satisfy the current political climate? Are you mad? The cheesy one-liners are also evidence that this movie IS BASED ON A COMIC BOOK. The exaggerated characters is further evidence that this movie IS BASED ON A COMIC BOOK. This is not a historical movie, it is a movie which seeks to put a rockstar, no-holds-barred spin on a particular historical event. It isn't attempting to be accurate, or balanced, or anything of the sort, and it SHOULDN'T, because that isn't it's purpose. It shouldn't be obligated to do anything of the sort. It's ENTERTAINMENT. Nothing more. And it's damn good entertainment, in my opinion.<br/><br/>Every scene is beautifully crafted. I found the slowdown to be stylistic and much of the dialogue, which is apparently cheesy and fascist to everyone else, to be at least somewhat inspiring, and certainly engaging. These Spartans were trained their entire lives to be warriors, their entire culture is built around success in battle, and you don't expect them to be quite skilled, much more so than a slave army, and quite patriotic? Also, this movie was from the point of view of the Spartans. How would this army have appeared to the Spartans? Wouldn't their stories now be over-exaggerated, over-simplified, almost legendary? There isn't a great amount of character development because this movie is about a battle, ONE battle, THE battle for the continuance of the Western world, and yes, IF the Spartans had been simply overwhelmed from the start, and if their Athenian allies hadn't completely CRUSHED the much larger Persian navy at sea, the West simply could not have existed in any similar manner as it has. And yes, the Western world is guilty of arrogance, overextending it's boundaries to the point of imperialism, however, it has given our world a plethora of all-too-important philosophical ideals that are simply irreplaceable if we want to live in a free society.<br/><br/>I realize I spent a great deal of my time being critical of other reviews, so I would like to take the time to apologize for perhaps wasting the time of someone who was simply searching for a detailed point of view on the film. I can assure you that the film is action-packed. The scenes are absolutely beautiful, every one of them. The film is gory, but artistically gory, if that makes any sense. You'll know what I mean. The story is simple, direct, and inspiring. The acting is excellent. The movie, overall, was a tremendous experience. I give it a 9."
"Alex_Priest","8","1388","2587","15 February 2007"," The Evolution of Epic Battles
","After gaving us some of the greatest epic movies in the last 50 years,it was clear that filmmakers needed to take them to the next level. <br/><br/>But how can you make a new movie,for the audience to like,without recycling old material? <br/><br/>Answer:You improve what old filmmakers couldn't:Graphics. <br/><br/>Ben Hur,Braveheart,Gladiator,Spartacus and perhaps even Troy are only some of the epic movies that gave the audience so big thrills that they cannot be repeated. Almost every epic movie that will be made today,no matter how good the story will be or how faithful will be to reality,is bound to repeat itself.We got examples from Alexander and Kingdom of Heaven. <br/><br/>300 doesn't apply to this category.Besides it takes the epic to the next level.And more are like to follow. <br/><br/>Just like in the Lord of the Rings,much CGI was used here. <br/><br/>The result? This movie was a pleasure for the eye. <br/><br/>All the camera work and graphics exceeded my expectations. I thought they were comparable,if not better,to the LOTR,go see for yourselves.<br/><br/>I could write something about the plot or the actors's outstanding performances(especially Gerard Butler's..you see,being Greek-Italian,I wanted the best from the actors..Butler gave it. The anger in his eyes,the fury in his voice and the violence in his actions really reminded an ancient Greek king),but I won't ruin it for you. You must see it to understand how great this movie is.<br/><br/>But always remember that this is a movie that is based on a graphic novel and is by no means a faithful depiction of what really happened in Thermopylae in 480 B.C. All those who will pay the ticket to see this movie,must be prepared not for a historic movie,but for a stylish battle movie. <br/><br/>This movie,together with the LOTR,is the entrance to the 21st century's new epic movies. <br/><br/>Kudos to Zack Snyder,who came from nowhere and has,already from Dawn of the Dead,proved that he is a brilliant and capable director. We will surely see more of him in the upcoming years.<br/><br/>So,you read my Comment?<br/><br/>Aren't you curious? <br/><br/>What are you waiting for?<br/><br/>Run to the nearest cinema,see this piece of art and when you are finished don't forget to come to IMDb to vote. This movie is destined to be at least in the top 100.<br/><br/>C'mon people!Hail for 300,the Evolution of Epic Battles!"
"EdWont","3","624","1157","10 March 2007"," Much worse than the trailer
","In a word: disappointment.<br/><br/>I was one of the fanboys who loved the graphic novel, and watched the trailer on repeat for months. I'm half Greek and love action and comics, so I was superbly amped. Sadly, the movie fell so short of the mark that I was immediately reminded of how I felt after watching Star Wars: Episode I for the first time. I left it thinking, ""I liked it? It was good? Right?"" But I knew that it wasn't. Here are some of the ups and downs.<br/><br/>Let's start with what's good in the feature. The battle scenes are spectacular. The choreography didn't hinge on speed as much as it relied on visually stunning, artistic brutality (it sounds like an oxymoron, but it applies in this context). The timing during these scenes was unique, too. The motion sped up and slowed down in a way that really complimented the film. Of course, the entire movie is a mindblowing visual experience: The art direction and cinematography were stunning. This is especially true of the costuming and ""creature"" effects. My favorite aspect of the art direction was this profound grittiness (manifested in the dirt, bloodshed, contrast, and other details that were brought forth because of the filming technique) that almost became a character in itself, contributing to the harshness of the plot. All these things were simply standout.<br/><br/>Now, for the reasons I gave this film 3 out of 10 stars. The plot aspect of this film was practically nonexistent. In terms of character development, not only was it predictable, but almost tragic that they didn't pursue other avenues. I especially mean this when referring to the Queen Gorgo subplot that wasn't bound by Miller's original concept. There were a variety of plot holes including, but not limited to, the end of Gorgo's subplot in which it's revealed that a traitor was carrying evidence of his crimes on him for what we can assume was the entire movie, when there's no plausible reason as to why he'd be carrying the evidence. Given the precious little plot in the film, it's sad to say that any plot holes exist. The acting was pretty terrible, spare the less demanding guttural shouting of the Spartan warriors, but I can't really fault the actors given that the writing was so, so painfully bland. Even when there was a ""rallying, morale boosting"" speech, as is a staple for these films, it was so upsettingly clich√©' that I found it agitating to watch. What was most troubling was that the entire movie was seasoned in an all-to-blatant hyper-nationalism. It was hard to enjoy this film without examining it from a modern context because of the frequent use of the word ""freedom."" It was being thrown around like it was conservative talk radio. At one point one of the characters even said, ""freedom isn't free."" I have no problem if filmmakers wish to make patriotism a theme in their film (indeed, the historic events lend nicely to such a theme). However, they did it so straight-forwardly that it dumbed the movie down a great deal. And yes, the Spartans founded the term ""laconic"" but they were at least witty. Had it been more subtle or brought about in a more refined way (as opposed to the hero simply spouting about freedom and its virtues repeatedly throughout the film) then it probably would've contributed a great deal to the movie.<br/><br/>All in all, this has a lot to offer in terms of eye-candy. But, it has so little substance that it's aggravating to watch. Something didn't click, and it's apparent. It feels like they could've done more with it. That's why it's aggravating. That's why it's a disappointment."

","Oh dear god this is bad.<br/><br/>As far as I can tell the most significant characters in 300 are the deltoid, bicep, abdominals and the other great muscle groups. It is a testament to how awful this film is that this is somehow a relief. The human cast are entirely secondary to the main aim which is to show lots of people slaughtering lots of other people. The whole thing appears to be some sort of visual love poem to the human body.<br/><br/>*may contain spoilers* <br/><br/>The plot of 300 can be summed up thusly: ""300 Spartans die"". It's not much of a plot but there you go.<br/><br/>King Leonidas (lit. ""maker of chocolates"") is unhappy at the possibility of all the Spartan health-clubs being closed by Xerxes. Having been told that he isn't allowed to defend the Spartan calisthenics program by a bunch of lepers with their own lap-dancer he decided to lead 300 prime Spartan beefcake to the ""hot gates"" for a body building dance-off with the 9 foot tall Xerxes and his army of slaves. Both sides do some flexing before getting down to the fighting. The Persians roll out the most farcical military units they can think of and contrive to get themselves slaughtered very cinematically. A Rhinoceros for #*$@'s sake! A #*$@ing RHINO! Really. A giant, some elephants and a guy with blades for arms who looks as if he should be auditioning for the next Clive Barker movie (who we sadly never see fighting). I was really surprised that there weren't some orcs and maybe a cave troll or two.<br/><br/>Finally a hunchback, who looks as if he is a silicon sex toy for the advanced user, sells out the Spartans and shows Xerxes a way round Thermopylae. Then all the Spartans die.<br/><br/>Admittedly there seems to be some sort of side plot about some nasty Spartan chappie trying to get the queen into the sack but I assume that this is just a time filler because they couldn't afford to make an entire two hours of CGI fighting.<br/><br/>*end spoiler* <br/><br/>I would thoroughly recommend that everyone see this film. It's appalling. It's the best comedy this year. It's a homo-erotic masterpiece."
"eilidh-6","1","369","677","11 March 2007"," A terrible mess
","Seeing the enthusiastic comments here, I was almost wondering whether they were meant for the same film I saw. Unfortunately, there is no doubt it is the same.<br/><br/>Never mind the fact I am writing from Greece, and that I might be in any way biased: I didn't go to the cinema expecting to see a historically accurate film, and I never let this fact bother me in the very least. I knew it was based on a comic, and I thought I'd see a decent enough epic film. I am not hard to please when it comes to films, but honestly -- I don't think I've seen such bad directing before. Terrible overuse of slow-motion sequences, some of the most awkward posing and set-up regarding the actors, an absolutely pretentious use of colour and lightning, incredibly bad costume choices (uniform leather thongs -- give me a break) resulting in multiple layers of kitsch. There was undoubtedly some eye-candy: but it was stacked so sloppily together it ended up being unpleasant.<br/><br/>Add to this mess some of the cheesiest lines and concepts, and there you have it -- I would call it a complete waste of time, but in some sense it is so bad it is almost worth seeing. Flying severed limbs in the battle scenes may even bring in a good laugh -- just as most of the dialogue does."
"blacklove","1","444","823","28 March 2007"," What is the point?
","I saw this film last week, and I couldn't put into words what I saw. This film was so mortifyingly awful that I needed time to find words to really describe it. The words I came up with are insane, racist, homophobic, misogynistic, gratuitously violent, and not at all entertaining. I thought to myself that this will be the film viewed by a disturbed teenager who plans on doing the next Columbine type of murder. <br/><br/>Not only is the story bad, but I also hated the fact that I felt like I was looking at a Playstation video game for two hours. Every scene was filled with this flat, boring, dreary-looking copper-color. The music is so clich√© that I could have hummed it in my sleep. I rolled my eyes every moment the opera-like singing started. <br/><br/>The viewer is suppose to be rooting for the Spartans, but because they come across as blood-thirsty psychopaths who were only put on earth for battle, I found myself rooting against them. Yes, war and violence are apart of life, but the realistic human emotions that are a result of war makes movies about the subject matter fascinating (i.e. Braveheart and Gladiator, two great films). This film cares nothing about story and human emotions. All this film cares about is showing spears go inside and then back out of a human body with blood splattered about and clich√© dialogue in between. Even be-headings are played out as if the only result the filmmaker is going for are the three words ""that was cool!"" <br/><br/>I didn't understand why the leader of the Persian side, the mascara and piercing faced Xerxes, had to come off as a mix between Rupaul and Bam Bam Bigelow. The reverberated voice that they used for the character was distracting and unnecessary. Also, I kept wondering why Xerxes kept using the words ""kneel in front of me,"" to the leader of the Spartans, and in one scene Xerxes places his hands on the leader of the Spartans in a way that seemed sexual. It was just plain weird and unnecessary!<br/><br/>From the casting, the viewer thinks that the enemy Persians are nothing more than effeminate Asians and other dark people of the earth that are trying to bring down the tough and ripped bodied white male Spartans that are outnumbered.<br/><br/>The one woman in the film came across as a fool that is so easily deceived (and deceived into having sex!) that her only salvation is to stab her enemy with a sword. Of course, her enemy conveniently carried around Persian coins that fell all over the place when he was stabbed, this conveniently showed us in a spoon-fed way that this guy is a trader. No thinking allowed in this movie!! The only other use for the female character in this film is a ridiculous soft- core sex scene. <br/><br/>Instead of this movie just coming off as a fantasy, it takes itself way too seriously and as a result I kept shaking my head at the blatant stupidity. In Kill Bill, Quentin Tarantino plays out a scene with Uma Thurman defeating a bunch of ninjas in a way where the viewer is disconnected from reality but is in awe of the cinematic technique of the film. In 300, when the 300 Spartans are defeating a gazillion enemies, you could almost hear the director saying, ""These guys are so tough that this could REALLY happen.... until the end of the movie, that is.""<br/><br/>Actors are not necessary for this film. It is as if the casting director went to Gold's Gym for the casting. Pectoral muscles get the screen time that isn't taken by spears and blood. Even the stale jokes told by the Spartans seem like the brainless banter of a stereotypical gym rat. <br/><br/>300 is an experiment in digital pop-art cinema gone wrong! Unlike pop-art cinema like A Scanner Darkly that advances visual aesthetic by saying something about the human condition through its story, 300 is a let down via story and visually. The entire outcome of the film leaves the viewer asking in a confused tone, ""What was the point of that?"""
"barb1140","10","667","1252","23 February 2007"," 300 Worldpremiere Berlin
","I have been at the World Premiere of 300 in Berlin where I watched this fantastic movie ¬ñ a movie not only for MEN! I got sucked in from the very first moment! I don't want to say too much about the story itself¬ñI don't want to spoil anything for you. But let me explain that this kind of movie isn't usually my cup of tea. But when I saw the first trailer I knew I wanted to see it badly. And 300 didn't disappoint me¬ñit was even better than expected.<br/><br/>From the very first moment, you can see the fantastic colors and the amazing visuals. I got hooked. I loved the way how the film sped up and slowed down at some certain key moments. It was stunning!!! There were moments where the music set in and shivers and adrenaline were running thought my body. Moments where I held my breath. Sometimes I had to hold myself back not to scream out loud ""YEAH!"" You can see how much this movie sucked me in.<br/><br/>The battle scenes: I feared them, because I hate too much violence in a movie. But they were stunning. These scenes were incredibly beautifully choreographed. These scenes gave me the feeling of a choreographed dance of warriors. Beautiful to watch. Powerful, aesthetic and elegant. Yes, they were brutal (without a doubt¬ñsometimes I had to hold my hand before my eyes ¬ñ but only for a short moment because I didn't want to miss something) but they still were amazing. And all this slowing down and speeding up makes these scenes more tense more beautiful. And you can feel the adrenaline rush of the warriors.<br/><br/>And in between these scenes there were this modern phrases like ""we are in for a wild night."" Some could say they don't fit into this movie. I loved it. It's incredibly cool and they made me laugh sometimes. And that was great; it eased the tension. These sentences lightened the moment. The perfect pause before the action goes on again.<br/><br/>Gerard Butlers acting is absolutely powerful. It is full of passion, full of emotions (love, anger and so much more). You can see the fire burning inside of him, the sadness, the inner struggles, but also the dignity and the kindness of the King. (I guess these were the scenes I loved most¬ñwhere I saw his dignity, kindness and love). His way of showing you his emotions through his eyes, I guess is stronger than ever. I love this ¬ñ I love when actors are able to express so much only with their eyes without saying anything. And all these fantastic close-ups just made these scenes perfect! But it was not only Gerard Butlers acting, but the other actors also performed extremely well. A perfect team and I got the feeling that all the actors are chosen because of this ability to be a team. It would take too long to mention every single actor/actress. For me it was an incredible cast.<br/><br/>The sound was excellent, especially during the battle scenes. For example, when metal meets metal(it's hard to explain this for me ¬ñ but when you see the movie you might know what I'm talking about). Not to forget the soundtrack. It makes the whole impression of this movie complete. Again full of power and then very emotional. I loved it.<br/><br/>This movie is more than an action movie for me. It's about love, camaraderie, the defending of what they love, of what they believe in. It's about the power not to give up but follow their destiny and to do what they think is the right thing to do. And it's also about the big love between the King and the Queen.<br/><br/>For me personally this movie is unique. It's a masterpiece of visual effects, color, sounds, soundtrack and the absolutely stunning performance of the actors. That's my own personal opinion. The opinion of a woman who already loved the powerful trailer, but wasn't sure if she would like the movie as well. Maybe you get the feeling that I'm praising this movie too much. But I can't help myself. That's exactly what I'm feeling, what I'm thinking. And believe me, if I thought differently, I wouldn't bother to write anything about it. And I'm definitely longing to see this movie again.<br/><br/>Even now as I'm writing this, I can feel the same emotions as I felt during the watching of 300. It just blew me away. After the movie there were standing ovations !!! What a great evening! What an amazing movie!"

","that this movie will probably be remembered as...? no, unlike the real battle of Thermopylae, this ""film"" wont be remembered at all.<br/><br/>but no, you cant blame Zack Snyder for it. for me ""directing"" a movie means, to make actors balance on the thin red line called story and to guide them on their way. and sorry, from this viewpoint there's no directing at all in 300. take away the decent special effects and there's not a whole lot left. yes decent special effects, not groundbreaking at all. ""the terminator 2"" was ""groundbreaking"" in effects and so was ""jurassic park"" at its time. but 300 didn't show anything that hasn't been done at least a dozen times before... so does the music.<br/><br/>neither you can blame paramount for it. all they did was, what most of the big studios do these days. they jumped on the money-train without really taking care about, what this comic book is about.<br/><br/>also Gerard butler isn't responsible for that ""300"" is nothing more than a waste of money and time. actually he's the only character in this so called epics, who leaves the 1st dimension at least in a few scenes. he acts as good as it gets under this circumstances.<br/><br/>but yes, there's one person you can blame for this movie: frank miller. and if its now ""300"" or ""sin city"", his world obviously is only black or white, good or bad, day or night... no shades between. and yes, this comic IS full of racism, prejudices and whats worst, disrespect for history. and as stated by others, this film is pretty close to the original comic book. so what else to expect? certain comics tried to approach historic events or periods and as seen in aster ix and a few others this can be done, if the author of the story shows respect to the events that happened. and herein lies the problem. obviously miller has a lack of respect for those who fought and died those days. yes, exaggeration in comics is a valid way to tell a story, playing with racism and prejudices isn't.<br/><br/>bottom line, neither from the viewpoint of a comic book.based movie nor from the historical viewpoint this film is worth to be seen. the effects and visuals don't carry it at all. neither does the acting of the cast. and whats left from the original great story of the battle of Thermopylae is as deformed and unreal as the Persian warriors.<br/><br/>actually there's only 1 thing that could have made this waste of celluloid even more ridiculous...<br/><br/>Charlton Heston, with a NRA bumper sticker on his butt, jumping out of a burning bush shouting...<br/><br/>FROM MY COLD DEAD HANDS! while lightnings out of his hands kill Xerxes and company whilst hunchback, rhinos and elephants sail into the sun on Noah's ark and live happily ever after."
"bob the moo","Null","40","64","18 November 2007"," Visceral, violent and visually stunning to the point where the lack of much else doesn't really matter
","In the year 480 BC, King Xerxes of Persia set in motion his enormous slave empire to crush the small group of independent Greek states ¬ñ the only stronghold of freedom still remaining in the then known world. As the countless armies of Xerxes approaches, King Leonidas petitions the ruling council to meet the army with whatever men can be found. With the council unwilling to release soldiers until after the religious festival, Leonidas sets out with his 300 strong personal army to meet Xerxes' men at a narrow pass knowing they must hold off the approach for as long as they can until the army arrives¬ñ even if it means their deaths.<br/><br/>Although I am surprised to see this film so highly rated on IMDb, I can understand why it is so because it does deliver a powerful experience, almost powerful enough to carry it through its lack of real depth or substance. You can see the selling point on the DVD cover or the poster because it is in these places where any film visually has to sell itself. With 300 though this selling continues across the entire film because, holding close to the graphic novel roots, the visual design is the all here. The plot is simple and, although there is a little bit of politicing back home, the film is all about the stand of the 300 against countless others. In this regard it is visceral, violent and visually stunning. The mix of effects with live action brings the action to live and is as suitably overblown as the legend.<br/><br/>Snyder's direction matches the effects and he wallows in every macho swing of the sword, doing really well to capture the action in a way that is engaging and clear. The lack of substance was a bit of a problem but to be honest the film does sweep you along in the moment of the battle and mostly this is all you care about. The cast don't really have characters so much as presence and mostly they deliver in this area. Butler is strong in the lead and he convinces in the role of Leonidas. Headley and West have the harder job back home to provide some interest in the politics behind the battle ¬ñ they do well enough (particularly The Wire's West, but I'm biased) but the script does rather leave them to their own devices. The rest of the cast are appropriately muscular and heroic and fit in with what the script is trying to do.<br/><br/>Overall this is an effective but superficial film. The design and the look is the all but fortunately it delivers in this regard really well. The performances, the script and everything else falls into line in supporting the graphic novel feel of the film and, although I would like to say I favour substance over style, it is hard not to like when the style is this well done."

","I am puzzled by the praise for this bloated, repetitive, thin, overextended video game It has restored my cynicism about movies,or I should see the people who see them, which had been somewhat diluted by seeing Pans Labyrinth, the Lives of Others, the Departed and other excellent films during the last year I admit I am not a video game junkie nor a fan of graphic novels, of which this is apparently a good example I understand the majority of the film consists of computer graphics rather than actual acting. I think the ""dialog"" must also consist of digital bits because it is extremely repetitive I think they recorded a half dozen bits of dialog and then just plugged them in between impalements, be-headings, and lopping off of arms and legs. I would be willing to bet that the majority of this films fans could not find both Greece and Persia in an atlas, (hint: look for Iran) nor come within 1,000 years of guessing when the battle took place if they hadn't read about it in the reviews. In case it isn't apparent, I only saw this because someone else wanted to see it. I found myself wishing I had brought along a video game or something to keep me occupied during this film."
"harry_tk_yung","Null","33","52","17 March 2007"," Strong on style; weak on reason
","I have to get something out of the way first. From the two movies I watched back to back in two days, there is enough blood to fill Lake Ontario. Done! (Oh yes, the other one is ""Hannibal rising"").<br/><br/>Frank Miller fans who have been so pleased with how faithfully ""Sin City"" has replicated the graphic novel (some even calls it just the animation of the novel, with a few real actors thrown in) will note that for ""300"", the movie makers have taken considerably more liberty in adapting. But then, the original graphic novel is itself an adaptation from real history.<br/><br/>While the main attraction of this movie is its stunning visual style, I do wish to point out some ironies before we store our brains away and sit back to enjoy. The irony is that the same hero who claims to be defending civilization and reason kills an emissary on the mere pretext of the latter's discourteous words. You would be hard pressed to find an act more barbaric. But this is good: it serves as a timely reminder that this movie is so one-dimensional that whatever the ""heroes"" do is right. The audiences that have recently winced at a scene in ""Letters from Iwo Jima"" where an American Marine shoots a surrendered Japanese soldier are unlikely to have the same reaction in witnessing the Spartan heroes gleefully thrusting their spears, en mass, through the heart of wounded soldiers lying on the battlefield. This mean only that such audiences are taking ""300"" for what it is.<br/><br/>Let us therefore move along to the visuals, which should be your only reason for watching this movie. Never has slaughters in battle been made to look so stylishly beautiful. As appetizer comes the first encounter which reminds me of the line of scrimmage in an NFL game. By sheer brutal force, the line of Spartans and shield holds back the seemingly unstoppable momentum of the onslaught of the first wave of Persian attack. While the evil attackers fall under the mighty thrust of the spears, their wielders are entirely unscathed ¬ñ another thought association: ""a wicked thrust, it's dust to dust; from fore to aft, they feel a draft"" in Guenevere's witty lyrics in Camelot (1967) turns out to be an apt description of the scene. Next comes the Persian cavalry, which is disposed of with equal ease by the famous wedge formation. The third wave is a little more intimidating, the ghostly ""immortals"" plus a ghastly giant. That requires a little more work but at the same time provides King Leonidas an opportunity to shine. <br/><br/>After a brief time out, we are treated to huge beast with trunks that might have been on loan from ""The Return of the King"". By this time, the audience's thirst for blood should have been brought to a height. What follows is a sequence that I think is the highlight of the entire move. Through a skillful mix of slow and fast motion, we are shown how the ""300"" disposes of their opponents as if they were straw men, with limbs and heads flying around at will, and a rain of blood splashing on the screen in a glorious crimson. <br/><br/>But then the tide begins to turn as we see the first Spartan casualty. Standing in the midst of a sea of slaughtered enemies and bathing in glory, a young hero fails to notice the approach of a stealth and swift horse, carrying a deadly rider. Before we have a chance to blink, we witness the fall, in very slow motion, of his headless body. This is the son of the King's most loyal captain who, at the start of the march, told the King that his son ""can be replaced"" if lost in battle. <br/><br/>Some say that there is so much CGI that they may as well not have actors in this movie, but I don't agree. The fact that the real actors are acting almost entirely in front of a blue screen does not mean that they are not real. Gerard Butler, who did not impress me as The Phantom (but did quite well as The Stranger in ""Dear Frankie"" (2004)), is an impressive King Leonidas, with his raw power and determination. Also good, as the warrior queen, is Lena Headey who had a reasonably good role in ""The cave"" (2005) but was underused in ""The Brothers Grimm"" (2005). What I really love is the performance of David Wenham (a very memorable Faramir in LOTR) that gave me something to remember, in the last scene of this movie. Playing the sly traitor is Dominic West whom I have just seen yesterday in ""Hannibal rising"", as the French inspector. The acting in this movie is generally fine, on the one-dimension level."

","Your new movie called ÔøΩ300ÔøΩ opening on March 9th in theatres all over the United States and based on a graphic novel by Frank Miller portrays the battle of Thermopylae in which King Leonidas and 300 Spartans fight against Xerxes and his Persian army. Upon seeing the previews of this movie, it immediately becomes apparent that apart from the actual names used in it, the entire depiction of this battle is based upon fantasy. Nowhere among the historical data that remains of the time of Xerxes and ancient Persian empires, do we come across any reference that shows those kings and soldiers as monsters with body-piercing, armors, facial features and demonic behavior that seem to have sprung out from the dungeons of hell. The inaccurate and derogatory depiction of ancient Persians that according to all historical data conducted warfare with mastery and dignity, and looked nothing like science-fictional monsters, is a depiction of how movie studios and authors sacrifice historical accuracy for would-be profits.<br/><br/>The author Frank Miller and Warner Brothers Studios should understand that distorting historical data is unethical, and so is feeding ignorance to viewers and readers. Fantasy-like characters should not have names that are based on actual historical figures. Xerxes was one of the many revered and respected rulers of an ancient civilization the vestiges of which last to this day and are acknowledged by historians of all nations. He did not look like a creature out of a frightening bedtime story. Neither did his soldiers.<br/><br/>By all means depict important historical events, but take the trouble to visit a library and to do some research before you do so.<br/><br/>We, The Undersigned, consider the movie ÔøΩ300ÔøΩ an outrage and boycott it."

Obviously it is easier to define bravery as 300 Spartans warriors fighting against a million Persians. But guess what they were more like 10000 Spartans, Athenians, Thebans, Thespians and Phoceans against 200,000 Persians. Obviously it is easier to represent Xerx√®s the first as a giant homosexual, piercing adept. But guess what he was more like a sophisticated Persian and also a great military strategist. Obviously it is easier to make War and Killing the glorious thing a nation could ever accomplish. But guess what there is no Glory in War and Killing.

But guess what great movies are not easy to make, great movies are based upon a tangible scenario and everything else is aimed to support that scenario. <br/><br/>Some of us applaud the aesthetic of the film as I refuse to call it cinematography. But for me the glossy, saturated bronze color like background looked incredibly unrealistic. Some of us feel shiver down their spines when hearing talks of freedom"" and ""justice"" coming out of King Leonidas, Gerard Butler's mouth. But for me it sounded more like an unintentional satire of America misadventure in Iraq. Some of us cheer at the slick fighting scenes and rejoice when Zack Snyder's camera abuses slow motions in order for the audience to enjoy the slaughtering. But for me that was the paroxysm of emptiness and the moment I felt lectured by a mediocre director as to why violence, racism, sadism are surprisingly virtues to be cherished. Some of us raise their arms in the air and wave at the ripped muscled Spartan men. But for me those leather pants Greek Warriors fighting thousands of ninjas almost died of ridicule. Some of us enjoy metal music mixed with ""Gladiatoresque"" chants. But for me it was noise and a sign that the film triggers 15 year old disturbed American boys who think Leonidas is a brand of chocolate and Xerx√®s an upcoming video game. <br/><br/>It's fine to make movies out of comics. It's fine to make violent films. It's also fine to use CGI in order to display thing you could not without. Eventually it is fine to fantasy an historical period.

","The movie is a fantastic animation movie. I wonder why they bothered listing the actors in the credits. There is a few things missing from this movie; acting, and colors. Everything is probably shot in front of a green screen and later painted in oker, sienna and umber. The earthy colors are the only colors you'll see in the movie, plus red or carmine. The acting is terrible. Only the faces of the actors have been saved for most parts, but even the beards and eyes are painted on. When an actor smiles or show pain you'll notice how the animators have tried to move parts of the face but doesn't succeed very well.<br/><br/>The story is completely nonsense. This is not Sparta, its some twisted wannabe historical document from the mind of the creator. There is a lot of talk about how these warriors cannot go to war without having felt the bussums of a woman.. Hey, man they practiced pederasty. Having relations with a woman was not for a warrior. They were supposedly doing it the lacedaemonian way. When training they were supposed to be oiled in and nude. <br/><br/>As mentioned before, this is good animation, but the worst ever movie I have seen. Save your money and watch TV instead."

","300 goes out of its way to depict Sparta as a bastion of freedom and liberty--a characterization which anyone familiar with Greek history (including ancient Greek scholars themselves) knows to be untrue.<br/><br/>Sparta was a great place to be for Spartan citizens, but the vast majority of the city's population were non-citizens. Only those who could trace their lineage to the city's original inhabitants could claim themselves as ""Spartans"" and thus enjoy the full range of freedoms available. The remainder, who quickly came to outnumber the ""Spartans"" in Sparta, were forced to live as a perpetual underclass serving the whim of the Spartans until the city fell.<br/><br/>To the extent that the film portrays the Persian empire as wicked in its reliance on slaves, it is laughably hypocritical and, for some, outright offensive."

","After seeing a 99% complete 300 at a 24 hour film festival i was amazed by the accuracy and beauty before my eyes.This film is an adaptation of Frank Miller's (Sin City) graphic novel 300 and wow is it ever accurate.I am very glad to see two magnificent pieces of Frank Millers art Sin City, and 300 have successfully transferred over to the big screen without losing anything in between.Visually the film drops you off your feet and it's not even completed yet so when this eventually debuts in the theaters it will have double the impact on me as i plan on seeing this again.The mix of live action and CGI creates beautiful landscapes, gorgeous backrounds, and amazing dimension to the characters.The film's dialog is pretty much exactly the same as it is in the graphic novel much like how most of the dialog in Robert Rodriguez' Sin City was taken directly from Frank Millers graphic novel.Personally i think that 300 is the best film of it's kind.It's got a faster pace than Lord Of The Rings, is more accurate than Troy, more compelling than Tristan and Isolde, and more violent than Gladiator.This movie so far deserves the academy award for best picture and without a doubt deserves the academy award for best cinematography for the originality and sheer beauty put into it's visuals.The battles are well filmed and action packed so for those of you who want gore and violence you'll get it and you'll be satisfied.Overall this is a movie of epic proportions and deserves a lot of recognition for it's originality,visual beauty, and it's accurate portrayal of it's original source."

No mention of the famous Delphic prophesy warning Leonidas that either Sparta will die or one of its Kings will die. Completely screwing with the battle order at Thermopylae so that neither the Athenian navy (who guarded the seaside flank) nor the Thespians who died to the last man at the Spartan rear get their historical due.

You know what i'm talking about. Check out the quotes if you don't believe me - it's fantastic! The 3D effects are kind of well done. They are so over stylized that it looks and feels like a video game. Slow motion... blood splatters... you name it and it's all accompanied by guitar riffs straight from the Army's recruiting commercials. Classy.<br/><br/>On the same note - It's obvious that some of the characters are supposed to be really exaggerated to give a legendary feel to the narration. But it's ridiculous. You think about that when the Giant Elephants parade onto the screen, darlings.<br/><br/>You have to try really hard not to develop SOME characters in such a long movie - and they managed it. I felt no real sympathy for anyone outside of whichever characters were cheaply described - their feelings and motivations betrayed by stupid lines OR really out of place narration.<br/><br/>I know that this movie isn't supposed to be historically accurate, it's just telling a story.

","When one mentions Sparta and the Greek Cities, there are expectations regarding touch with history. If king Crucifirix from the city of Baluba met an army of million from the kingdom of Zara, I would have no problem but when a claim is made at historic data, I would like that link to be consistent. Well, in '300' this link holds only when it comes to names. Yes, there was a king Leonidas and a despot called Xerxes. Yes, Thermopyle was the place where their armies met. What is not true: the ephors were not priests, they were the only spartan body democratically elected (terms of one year, without the possibility of a second); there were two kings of Sparta; the Greek army was around 6 to 8 thousand of which 300 Spartans, the only reason Leonidas was there was because the other cities agreed to let him command; the Spartans took the field only first and last day; on last day they were not alone (in fact there were a little over a thousand Greeks, thebans and thespians); the immortals were not black ninjas, they were white clad archers with secondary weapons short spear and/or short sword; the immortals strategy was shoot and advance not charge blindly not to mention they didn't look like orcs; there were two spartan survivors of Thermopyle, not one; Leonidas died in the initial assault of Xerxes forces in the last day, not after meeting with the forces sent to encircle them in the rain of arrows ... and so on. The acting is extremely poor in the first part (which introduces us to Sparta, kind of) and absent in the rest where action flows. The visual effects are anything but original, you've seen them before. The dialog revolves around words like 'death' and 'honor' every other phrase and the few metaphors used alongside phrasal inversion make the script look like a medieval play, but definitely not ancient Greek. Why would anyone enjoy this, is beyond me."

"electrobird","1","206","383","10 March 2007"," Technically good and well cast, but overall disappointing
","The direction and editing on the battle scenes is great, the cast is superb, but in my opinion the screenplay and direction are lame.<br/><br/>It seems as the dialog is there just to frame the action and the movie is detached of any emotion. Even the part where the queen consents on being raped by Theron couldn't make me feel a thing. Lena Headey and Domic West try hard, but apparently there was such a hurry to cut back to the battle action that you don't have the chance to have any feelings about it. The scene where the Queen gives a speech to the council, is betrayed by Theron and finally kills him is saved by the good acting. The coins on the floor where a smart idea, but I wonder if that speech was written by Karl Rove.<br/><br/>As expected from a Hollywood movie, this one is extremely dualistic, with Spartans presented as civilized heroes, in contrast to the fanatic, promiscuous and abominable Persians.<br/><br/>Overall, the battle scenes are believable, the military strategies accurate and the figurine and makeup of the Spartans very truthful. Leonidas and his soldiers seem to have jumped directly from an ancient Greek vase.<br/><br/>However, they missed the target on the characterization of the Persians. Rodrigo Santoro is a good actor and does a nice Xerxes, but men from the Persian upper classes wore long crimped wigs and false beards. The Persians clothes and ornaments are also completely inaccurate. I've seen Persian artifacts in museums and I can say that they don't resemble to anything seen on this flick. With so many piercing and chains (not to mention the promiscuity), the Persians look more like revelers from a S&M party.<br/><br/>In addition, Black Persians are something new to me too. The Persian Empire never went beyond Turkey and the Caucasus was in fact in Persia. I didn't expect them to look like Brad Pitt, but I didn't think I would see so many blacks among them either.<br/><br/>Great cinematography and editing! The battle scenes are very well done. The sepia tone of the movie makes the blood look brown and it never spills as it would as a result of a real artery rupture. It looks more like fragments flying through the air and this makes the scenes a little less graphic and more artistic.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the special effects are inconsistent and although you can't really notice the CGI on the battle scenes, the Rhino and the Elephants are way too big and unrealistic. Who knows¬Ö perhaps they looked like that in 480 BC.<br/><br/>I don't discriminate hunchbacks, but that orgy was gross and looks like something you would find along with bestiality, child pornography and incest on a website for perverts. It wouldn't have made the final cut, if this movie had a director or a producer.<br/><br/>Was there a composer on this movie? <br/><br/>Overall, 300 is a pretentious action flick.

This epic story of a battle that was fought by 300 of the roughest, toughest cold hearted warriors has so many inconsistencies and is so pointless that I actually wished I was watching Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy again, Bleeehhh! As far as this review being a spoiler, if you couldn't tell from the trailers that blatantly pointed out that all 300 of these morons die, well, ALL 300 OF THESE MORONS DIE! There, ruined it for you and hopefully saved you the ten buck admission fee. These young Spartan boys are kicked out into the world to fend for themselves right about the time they hit puberty. Then after fighting off the tallest, skinniest looking mangy wolves, they get to come back and be Spartan warriors. They are so ruthless, the Spartan King kicks the Persian messenger into a huge hole in the middle of town (which was apparently finished off by expert masons) just for asking him to kneel in submission. Haven't they ever heard the phrase 'Don't kill the messenger'? Although he may have deserved it since he was standing right on the edge of aforementioned huge hole in the ground while divulging the bad news of having to ""Get on your knees (Texas Pete)!""<br/><br/>So now the ass-clown senators have to ask the gods if they should fight this huge Persian army made up of apparent computer programmers, stock brokers and (ha ha) kittens. These gods are 13 year old semi-nude girls who are the gods of Downy dryer sheets on acid-- yeah, go ask them for advice...makes sense, karate monkey. So Captain Jack Spartan convinces everybody that fighting is a bad idea. Everybody except the king and 299 easily led automatons. Meanwhile this Johnny Depp look-alike wannabe Captain Jack is being paid off in Cortes' gold by the king/god leader guy of the Persian army who will definitely go #1 in the first round in next year's NBA draft. Now the 300 are told not to go fight so the king dupes the senate by saying they aren't going to battle, they are just taking their swords and stuff to get their merit badges for the Spart Scouts. OK, we believe you. So off they go and on their way they meet up with Gollum's older hunchback brother who says he will help. Apparently 301 is a crowd so he is shunned, which, you would think he would be used to by now but I guess not, and hunch-boy doesn't take it too well. I had a hunch he would be a factor in the 300's downfall. He later in the movie rats out the fact that there is a 'secret passage' side road so the Persian army can flank the morons leading to their eventual doom. I don't know why they needed hunch-boy...you would think an army that size would carry a map.<br/><br/>Anyway, after fighting the first wave of programmers, then pushing attacking wooly-mammoths into the sea, then having a goal line stand against triceratops, the Spartans eventually have to go at it against teenage mutant ninja disappointed V for Vendetta guys. They were good but not good enough. Time for Navy Seals. Oh, wait, we're getting flanked. Well time to give up, especially after seeing your heartless ruthless warrior buddy CRYING over seeing his heartless ruthless killing machine warrior son's head chopped off during a timeout! Now the whole reason you went on this bogus merit badge trip was because there was no way you would ever get on your knees before some 9 foot 8 inch Stargate character god guy and submit to him. So why would you do it right before you die??? You get on your knees, you remember hearing one of your buddies blurt out ""God Speed"" (which god? Downy god? Other god? Some god from Apollo 13?) and it makes no sense and then you stand up and throw not a strike-- but a ball, high and away. It's way out of the strike zone and the only reason you hit Persian god/leader Stargate guy on the shoulder with your throwing knife is because he is 9'8"" tall (should have been called for a balk anyway, you can't kneel on the rubber). All that got you was a hundred billion arrows shot at you simultaneously bringing your demise, although only three arrows actually hit you. Meanwhile back at the ranch, Queen Spartan is dropping trow to service Cap'n Jack in return for letting the rest of the Spartan army help save her husband. Did you hear that?? The REST of the Spartan army? Oh, yeah there are hundreds of thousands of these heartless ruthless killing machines waiting in the wings. A little information that would have been helpful YESTERDAY! These guys don't show up until after the queen kills Cap'n Jack (who ironically bleeds Cortes' gold) for dissing her after she was ready to accept the business end of his...man-sword.

","This movie is awful and it had NOTHING to do with the violence like for many. I am a movie fanatic and I am most specifically a history fanatic. My fav. movies are time pieces. My fav. show on television is easily Rome. I can't tell you how excited I was about this movie. Unfortunately, it was utterly awful.<br/><br/>1. I DON'T CARE HOW VIOLENT IT WAS, that is not my gripe.<br/><br/>2. I DON'T care how historic it was. Most movies fall far short of what really happened...I get that. That is also not my gripe.<br/><br/>3. The dialogue was bar none pathetic. The worst i have seen in ages. People were laughing at the lines that many here have already made fun of. I rolled my eyes at least 10 times. ""tonight we dine in hell"" takes the cake.<br/><br/>4. How many times must we see the king shout to get his point across. It's supposed to be a Braveheart moment with the whole ""Freeeeeeeeeeedom"", but never once is it effective. It's not effective because he does it a dozen times and he does it in moments where it's not needed. We also don't care about him or his gang of suicidal warriors like we did William Wallace and his men. Why? Simple. the character development is terribly hollow. They force it on you that ""Spartans can't afford to be emotional"". Okay...and because of that, just realize every time you try to have your over the top powerhouse inspirational moments, they're not going to affe4ct us the same way as say in a Braveheart...because William Wallace WAS emotional...and we related to him...and cared about him, and we felt for him when he suffered loss...but in this movie...you don't allow us to gravitate to these characters. Bantering back and forth in play while they chop peoples heads off is simply not going to warm us to these people so that the ""inspirational"" moments have ANY affect. Like when the Captain's son is beheaded. In most movies your heart would be torn out in sorrow for the guy...but in this movie...it's just another head hitting the ground. They want to pull on your emotional strings, but they never pull it off anywhere and it's all in the setup and how much of a testosterone induced farce they set this up to be. It needed to have the dramatic pull of a Braveheart...a Gladiator...it had the storyline potential to give us that, but they butcher it from moment one and it's impossible to take ANYTHING serious.<br/><br/>5. The Persian king was pathetic. everything about him. he wasn't scary, he wasn't to be taken serious...he was a farce who liked to wear women's makeup. AWFUL. And how they did his voice so that he was to seem god-like...AWFUL. he seemed like a fruit-cake...nothing more. ""i am nice. I will show them I am nice"". that is when I said ""that's it...Im out of here"".<br/><br/>There was nothing to like about this movie...not a thing. I went in expecting it to be my fav. movie of the year bar none...and i actually walked out with 20 or so minutes to go. What a joke. I'll now go give it a 1/10 and the 1 is for the fact it was just under 2 hrs. if you're going to make an awful movie, make sure it is under 2 hrs please. They did, so they get 1 star instead of zero. Oh wait...there is no zero. My decision is even easier now."

All this movie was eye candy, and nothing more. The effects were good, but unfortunate, the movie went way to long showing us nothing. Most of which was battle scenes. The plot back at spartan was non explained properly, and didn't seem to enhance the storyline out on the battle field. i believe that it is not worth spending your money at all to see it, as it was clear that by half way through the movie, most of the audience was talking and making fun of the movie."

","Movies like these often make me wonder about the decision finding-process of an actor. For hypothesis' sake, let's take a journey into Gerard Butler's mind after reading the script: ""Hmm, okay, sounds pretty much like a gory battle film to me. There isn't much of a story, but the public these days really seems to be into epic war movies, probably with the war in Iraq and 9/11 and all. Now, some of the scenes, especially those at the beginning remind me of something I learned in history class, I think it had something to do with Hitler and survival of the fittest. I don't really endorse these values, but the film seems to. Well, I'm only a second rate actor and I haven't had my big success yet, so maybe, taking on the role of Leonidas might be a good idea and an excellent career move, since the film is provocative, to say the least, and even if it turns out to be a bad movie with fascist tendencies, people will still talk about me. And all these months at the gym will finally pay off, because I get to show my sexy body throughout the entire movie. I won't be wearing much, accept for some briefs made of leather and a red cape around my neck. The text isn't too hard either, I don't have to act much, all they want me to do is shout and shout in a belligerent way like the warmonger I see on TV all the time. Yeah, I think I'll give my agent a call. There's nothing good on TV, so what the heck, let's do this flick"". <br/><br/>To the film itself: After twenty minutes into the movie I got bored. A juxtaposition of battle scenes, monsters that looked like prototypes from the LORD OF THE RINGS and a more than stupid side story with King Leonidas wife and some gossamer thin malice spun by a third rate playwright. Whether this film endorses fascism or not doesn't really matter, because this film boils down to one simple adjective: stupid!"

","To: Warner Bros. Picture Company To: Warner Bros. Pictures Company Cc: Zack Snyder (director) Dear Warner Bros. Picture Company, We the undersigned, through this letter, protest your irresponsible, unethical and unscientific actions.<br/><br/>This letter is in concern of making the movie, 300 by your company, which, according to all historical documents, is fraudulent and distorted, and its broadcast guarantees the violation of undeniable international legal rights.<br/><br/>It is a proved scholarly fact that the Persian Empire in 480 B.C was the most magnificent and civilized empire. Established by the Cyrus the great, the writer of the first human right declaration, Persians ruled over significant portions of Greater Iran, the east modern Afghanistan and beyond into central Asia; in the north and west all of Asia Minor (modern Turkey), the upper Balkans peninsula (Thrace), and most of the Black Sea coastal regions; in the west and southwest the territories of modern Iraq, northern Saudi-Arabia, Jordan, Israel, Lebanon, Syria, all significant population centers of ancient Egypt and as far west as portions of Libya. Having twenty nations under control, encompassing approximately 7.5 million square kilometers, unquestionably the Achaemenid Empire was territorially the largest empire of classical antiquity.<br/><br/>Based on the Zoroastrian doctrine, it was the strong emphasis on honesty and integrity that gave the ancient Persians credibility to rule the world, even in the eyes of the people belonging to the conquered nations (Herodotus, mid 5th century B.C). Truth for the sake of truth, was the universal motto and the very core of the Persian culture that was followed not only by the great kings, but even the ordinary Persians made it a point to adhere to this code of conduct.<br/><br/>We did not expect Warner Bros. Picture company, as one of the world's largest producers of film and television entertainment to ignore the proved obvious historical facts, and damage its own reputation by showing the Persian army at the battle of Thermopylae as some monstrous savages, and thus create an atmosphere of public mistrust in its content, and hurt the national pride of the millions of Persians while doing so.<br/><br/>While announcing our disgust at such a heresy, we demand an immediate historical review and quick apology from the responsible people."
"Delmare","2","174","324","24 March 2007"," Racist, nationalistic crap
","Don't miss the latest attraction! For ten dollars apiece (or nine, or seven, or whatever else the nearest overpriced theater charges you) you can watch the enlightened West triumph over the savage and demonic East. You can rise from your seats and scream out your adulation while the divinely endowed white conquerors hold fast against the encroaching Asian tide, saving the world from a legacy of barbarism, preserving the common good, and upholding reason in the face of corruptive eastern mysticism. You can take part in a rare and wondrous opportunity, complete with popcorn and soda, while your hard-earned dollars serve the master propagandists of Hollywood whose ongoing efforts keep the creepy ethnic and racial Other back where it belongs ¬ñ in the dark, frightening universe that lurks on the far side of Greece. <br/><br/>That's right. I'm talking about ""300,"" the popularity of which is yet another testimony to the woeful lack of objectivity on the part of the modern moviegoer. The film not only oversimplifies, exploits, and capitalizes on a pivotal event in world history, an act of supreme disrespect both to the Greeks and the Persians who took part in it, but also manipulates history to glorify the Greeks at the expense of their enemy, simultaneously glorifying the contemporary West at the expense of Everything Else.<br/><br/>Historically speaking, the Spartans were successful largely because their knowledge of the terrain exceeded that of the Persians, and because they were able to work geography to their advantage and never give up ground. In the movie, they keep on winning because . . . well, they're Spartans! They can charge into a crowd that outnumbers them an ostensible million to one, sustain a nominal amount of casualties, and reward themselves with a towering colossus of enemy corpses that promptly becomes a bonfire. Because there's not even the slightest explanation offered for how they manage this feat, we're forced to assume they win only because they're divinely ordained to do so. Fate (and/or God) wants the Spartans to be the best of the best, so it endows them with invincibility and lays the Persians to waste.<br/><br/>This a disgusting approach to the subject, both thematically, and in terms of the narration. Narration-wise, it eliminates suspense and destroys our ability to get invested in the characters. After all, why should we fret over a hero when we know he's always going to win? The playwrights of King Leonidas' era would have laughed this farce right off the stage (assuming it made it to the stage in the first place.) <br/><br/>Thematically speaking, the tactic is even more offensive. It postulates that the West will triumph over the East ¬ñ indeed, that it is destined to do so ¬ñ and will triumph no matter the odds. An opportune time for this message, don't you think? Especially considering the so- called leader of the West is now in the midst of a showdown with . . . huh, that's funny: Iran. Formerly known as Persia. If I were a thinking organism, I might actually consider a connection. <br/><br/>And by the way, did anyone notice that the Persians are not just Persian but also African, Arabic, and East Asian? That nearly every racial group that isn't white, regardless of its historical affiliation with Persia, or lack thereof, is placed on the enemy side and made to fall like cattle? <br/><br/>And since we're on the subject of not-so-subtle subtext, did anyone notice the fact that Xerxes' private collection of monstrosities included a lesbian couple or two? Gee! I hope I wasn't dreaming that. Since Snyder already ran the gauntlet of racist ethnocentrism, I'd really hate it if he failed to make a stab at homosexuality, another evil the noble Spartans should readily eliminate from the Earth. <br/><br/>This is a horrible movie, horrible in every way. Even if you strip away the shockingly racist, prejudiced, and nationalistic undertones, the film remains, at best, abysmal to the point of nausea. The tone doesn't fluctuate once in any of those infinitely protracted 117 minutes, leaving us to flounder in an endless bloodbath that all starts feeling the same mid-way through the first act. The music is over the top and inconsistent, sometimes symphonic, sometimes rock-based, but always cheesy and frequently counter-productive. The voice- over narration is uncalled for and distracting. The CGI wolf at the beginning looks terrible. So do the elephants and rhinoceros, which are dispensed with far too quickly to be anything other than an anti-climactic and extraneous plot detail. The colors are ugly. The kinetics are ugly. Xerxes is ridiculous enough to be laughable.<br/><br/>My only hope is that our children will forgive us for this cinematic disaster, because it's clear that our ancestors won't."

Too many furrowed brows, pregnant pauses, meaningful looks and bad speeches, all badly acted on top of that. Queen Gorgo's speech in front of the council sounded like a bad valedictorian address. I kept looking at my watch and checking how much longer until the damn movie was over.<br/><br/>Very, very poor acting overall. King Leonidas was OK, but others just couldn't act their way out of a paper bag. I guess that's what happens when you hire a bunch of bodybuilders to act in a movie.

","Fantasy, especially the blood and sand epics, can be great entertainment, but ""300"" is fantasy posing as history. The true story of the 300 Spartans is easily one of the most incredible events in all of ancient history. If this had been an original story, I may have been more receptive. The script is so watered down and the characters so cardboard cutout, I heard titters in the audience at the dialog. On the other hand, I found many of the images so amazing and compelling that they deserve being called works of art. I found it silly, maybe it was just pandering to dim bulb adolescent boys, when the dialog dismissed the Athenians as boy loving philosophers, while totally ignoring the historical fact that the Spartan army depended on homosexual bonding between warriors, so that each man was fighting for his loved one at his side. Other distortions and omissions are that the oracle had predicted Greece would be saved by its wall of wood, which was the Athenian naval ships. The 300 Spartans great success was to buy time for the Athenians to build up its navy which ultimately defeated and drove back the Persians. Totally unclear was the reason behind the Spartan army not marching off immediately to attack Xerxes which was that Spartans would not violate their laws of religious observance which forbade warfare during those observances. If all of this is to be discounted as artistic license, I think their license ought to be revoked. This kind of virtual studio comic book movie making has real possibilities in store for us, but like any kind of great film-making there has to be a great script from which to start."

In fact, the Spartan abs were so defined that I thought they were part of the CGI until someone asked the director about it.<br/><br/>Snyder kept the movie adaptation close to the comic book but added a subplot of King Leonides wife trying to get political support to send more troops to aid the battle. Gerard Butler did a great job as the king and had the screen presence to make you believe that he could really rally 300 of his best soldiers to fight till death against an overwhelming Persian army. Queen Gorgo was depicted as a strong character and the King loved and respected her which the women audience will appreciate. And the pace of the movie is pretty fast.

Upon entering the movie, however, I was terrified with what I saw. First off, the colors were all wrong. Although there were no cameras in the time of Sparta, I highly doubt that life looked so saturated and bronze. Also, I don't think all of the men could have been so unbelievable ripped, in times before inventions like the Bowflex. The scene depicting the child fighting the wolf, also highly unbelievable. How could a 7 year old look so old?!? And survive in the snow for a long time in just a diaper. Plus, I don't think that wolves' eyes actually can glow...<br/><br/>My next beef was when Leonidas kicked the messenger into the whole. Holes, no matter how deep they may be, have an end. These messengers appeared to fall for an eternity...what must have been miles deep. BS. by now I was getting extremely heated at the inaccuracy of this movie, but this was only the beginning.<br/><br/>The combat was so unbelievable! The warriors moved in and out of slow motion, almost at will. They killed thousands of ninjas. Did Persia take over Japan? I Don't THINK SO! also, what the hell was the guy with the saws for arms. you cant do that.<br/><br/>Over all, I was severely disappointed. I've heard that this movie was based on a comic book, which was based on a movie from the 60s, which was based on a tale told for thousands of years by word of mouth, but that is no excuse for the details of the movie to arrive so...

","Men in black bikinis. Sweat pouring off their pumped up bodies.Did film auteur David DeCoteau (Voodoo Academy, The Brotherhood and Wolves of Wall Street) have a hand in this creation?<br/><br/>If American fan boys flock to this film, there may be other reasons why they spend all their time with their fan boy friends down in their parent's dark, deep basement. Maybe basement is the new word for closet! There must be some reason why girls their age are so interested in yaoi.<br/><br/>The homo erotic tension left me gasping from testosterone more than a few times.<br/><br/>What little story there is, Frankensteined from bipartisan history, could have easily been played out in a half-an-hour format on TV. For an epic film it lacks all that made Lawrence of Arabia, Ben-Hur and the like, epic films. Unless limb chopping has become elements of a good story and strutting/marching is now considered a sub-plot --- this film offers no frigging story line. There's a wicked queen, well, I guess he's supposed to the King of the Persians. Some pumped up gym rats who don't like the evil Queen. There's also a good wife and a bad politician. (Is there any other kind) <br/><br/>(BTW: Bad guys are deformed. Good guys are half-naked and look like underwear models. I guess that's the new twist on pointing out who's good and who's bad. It used to be that bad guys wore black and good guys wore white, now it's who's deformed and who isn't)<br/><br/>The cardboard characters spout off (I had such a hard time understanding Bulter's dialog, I gave up) cheesy lines and they all seem so disconnected from this ancient battle. The battle itself reminded me of the disco era when on any given night throngs of saps were clamoring, literally stepping over each other to gain entrance into some trendy nightclub. That is what the battle scenes looked like, only without the leg chopping, wild costumes, gayish grunts,sweat, muscles and the whole mano-a-mano atmosphere. Well now wait a minute, I do believe that's exactly what it looked like back then. Perhaps Miller lived in the village during the 70s. I don't know. <br/><br/>The lowdown: 300 men (in black bikinis and spa robes) hold off a prissy horde numbering in the hundreds of thousands. That's it. So I ask: Was there nothing more compelling from a historical perspective, well, I know there was and Miller must have known that too. Lot's more, in fact, portions of the real Spartan history would have been more interesting than the end result of this film. <br/><br/>Even if they didn't use ""what really happened"", why didn't they come up with something more than a soap-opera sub-plot, I mean, the double crossing politician is so 80s. <br/><br/>My final thought on this wreck of a film is, are we over Frank's Miller juvenile scripting yet. May we now move on to better story lines that are more than excuses to use ""gosh-gee-whiz"" technology and creative blood-letting?<br/><br/>No. I didn't like the CGI sets/backgrounds at all. When I choose to play a video game I accept cartoon graphics. When I plucking down 12 bucks to get in to a movie, I expect better."

","Before going to see this movie I came on here to see what everyone thought, I was surprised to see such a divide in peoples opinions... some loved it with a passion and others thought it was one of the worst films ever created. So I went into the cinema almost exited to see what I myself would think of it. Unfortunately out of the lovers and haters I found myself in the latter group. But why?<br/><br/>The film is based on Frank Millers graphic novel which I myself have never read but I doubt that's important, it's just something you should bare in mind when you're going to see this film. I say this because visually 300 is stellar, it looks beautiful, almost to a fault, some moments are so picturesque they're almost twee (yes I'm British). The costume department also came up trumps with the wonderful red capes of the Spartans and the bejewelled Persians.<br/><br/>The film falls short however on its story telling. The factual inaccuracies are meaningless plenty of films have come and gone which have been vastly incorrect in their telling of past events etc. So, no it's not that, it's just that the makers clearly spent so long making it look right they forgot that they were meant to be making a film and instead they made a 2 hour long trailer. Actually I can't fairly say there was 2 hours worth of footage in the film because half the film was played in slow-mo! This is a point I'll come to in a second though. <br/><br/>So save the fact that there was no story line, how was the acting? Frankly, quite awful, though I put this down to the terrible script, as it was clear that Butler and Headey were trying to give it their all. Sadly every other line muttered by Butler was not a line but a scream and every other line from Headey was during/about sex.<br/><br/>Like I say the factual inaccuracies didn't bother me instead what bothered me were HUGE contradictions in the script and morally dubious characters. For example, Leonidas refuses a disfigured man from fighting in the army because he would disrupt the phalanx fighting system they use¬Ö fair enough¬Ö but when they don't even use this system and just start to copy Lord Of The Rings then you ask yourself ""why?"" Also I found it frankly impossible to care whether the Spartans lived or died, they were presented as being equally if not more atrocious than the Persians. The Spartans were basically Nazis (I can think of no better word for a group of people who kill anyone who doesn't 'look right'). The Persians however seemed to be respectful at all times their only fault being that they had an ego charged ruler¬Ö<br/><br/>The icing on the cake however had to be the way over-used slow-mo effect. Fine in a battle scene they I understand, but when someone is just walking somewhere? It's just ridiculous. <br/><br/>This film tried so hard to be epic that it forgot that It was meant to be telling a story. Just don't go to see this film please, I beg of you, unless¬Ö. Actually I can think of no one who would enjoy this film.<br/><br/>Steer clear."

","I was very excited about seeing this movie. I like Frank Miller and I loved ""Sin City,"" but ""300"" was just bad. Beautiful, but bad. Acting was just average, story was horrible (the true historical account is actually more interesting), and all the monstrous soldiers were comical at best (a couple of times, the audience in the theater actually started laughing at the villains). An army of a million guys doesn't need to have monsters to look imposing. Random facial piercings are just silly, not scary. The hunchback was just lame. And why was Xerxes 10 feet tall? Even the fight scenes get tiresome after you see the same choreography in slow-motion over and over and over again. In ""Sin City"" the violence was put to good use. Here, it just got boring. I fully realize that they were trying to make a faithful adaptation of the comic book, but this was a story that didn't translate well once the drawings started moving (and talking in gruff, grumbly voices). Wait six months and rent it."

","I just returned from a preview of ""300"" and I'm glad I didn't have to pay for it. First the film clocks in under two hours and I find that to verge on the insulting. However even at under two hours the film is too long. Most of the scenes that are not the actual battle itself are too long, poorly written, trite, and pretty much pointless. They don't serve to advance the story or provide any benefit. The fighting was overly reliant on slow motion (why? It was a nice trick about 20 years ago, but it's been seen and it's been done.) There was nothing new in the fight choreography, in fact if you have seen a fair number of action movies you've seen all the fight choreography on display here. Here there be spoiler: Leonidas delivers a long speech (given the average length of dialog in this film) about fighting in the phalanx and protecting your fellow Spartan, but then you never see it used in the film the way he describes really robbing that scene of any poignancy and impact.<br/><br/>In the end I found this film to be an over-hyped mediocre production that does a disservice to the story of Thermopylae. I'd strongly recommend Steven Pressfields ""Gates of Fire""."

","The first few times I saw the trailers for 300, I thought I was watching an advertisement for a Playstation 3 game. Or maybe one for the X-Box 360.. or the Nintendo Pi or whatever that thing is called that gives everyone couch potato elbow. Anyway, it looked like some sort of video game cutscene, and that's basically what this movie is: Two hours of Blizzard's crack team of game designers crafting the heart of every top-selling video game - the cutscene.<br/><br/>As we know, the cutscene's purpose is to fill up the gaps between game missions, where a lot of fighting takes place, with lots of fake looking blood, very little plot advancement, set to a monotonous rock soundtrack in a carefully controlled environment designed to sanitize out those nasty historically correct elements such as, say, swastikas on German aircraft, or dangling genitals from spartan battle dress. You know, things the kiddies aren't really ready to see yet. The cutscene is the place where simplistic dialogue and juvenile storyline happens. Since 300 is a movie and not a video game, it spends a little more time on the cutscenes and a little less on the battle scenes.<br/><br/>Because this story is designed to look like a video game, it plays out as one also. Soldiers all look the same and everything else is exaggerated and made more ""extreme"". Wolves look like bulimic runway models but still have the tenacity of a shark, war elephants are so big they should have Orlando Bloom hanging from them, and every Spartan looks like he's on a part-time sojourn from his gig at Chippendales. All looking very caucasian, eyes getting bluer and abs getting oilier with bravado. Even the hunchback's hunch is muscular. Oh, and the Persians look like Moors for some reason. I guess Hollywood's Villain-O-Matic has rounded the dial, so to speak, and is back at 'black' again.<br/><br/>The canyon that most of the battle takes place in looks eerie and otherworldly, except for the wheat field that someone forgot to roll up after Gladiator finished shooting, and the spurting blood looks as if someone shot the contents of a lava lamp from a confetti cannon.<br/><br/>Actually, I rather enjoyed the exaggerated look of the whole endeavor, but couldn't they have at least made the characters a little more interesting?? This is based on a comic book for chrissakes! Aren't the characters supposed to be 'bigger-than-life'? While there were apparently three different Spartans (the shouting bearded one, the one missing the eye, and the multi-xeroxed one), the rest of the cast featured a hunchback, some lepers, and Rupaul after a night of heavy drinking and piercing. How do go wrong with that?? It's like the scriptwriters from Underworld found their way onto the set(Could you have imagined insurance seminar speakers led more exciting lives than werewolves and vampires?).<br/><br/>This is an R-rated feature, but it's pretty suitable for 11-15 year old boys. Yes, there's a few female breasts and a decapitation on par with something from an Itchy and Scratchy cartoon to make the young'uns feel like they're watching something for grown-ups, but I'd avoid letting your older ones see this. At least not without having drank enough to not wonder why a Spartan turncoat would bring a purse bursting with Persian payoff money to a city council meeting."

","Hearing that 300 is based upon a "" graphic novel "" which is a pseudo intellectual phrase used to describe a comic book I didn't go out of my way to watch this because the present Hollywood movie making factory spends too much time and money bringing these type of stories to the screen . Also I was very unimpressed with director Zack Snyder's previous film the remake of DAWN OF THE DEAD which is a pale imitation of a superior movie . Sometimes prejudice can get in the way of judging a film of its own merits because 300 is one of the more memorable movie moments from last year and one that seems unforgivably ignored at the more prestigious film award ceremonies <br/><br/>Being based upon a comic book you could say in all honesty that the visuals mirror those of a graphic novel , but I would claim it goes far , far beyond that and say it's like watching a painting come to life . The battle scenes are entirely different from those seen in LORD OF THE RINGS or KINGDOM OF HEAVEN but are no less impressive and some of the battle sequences , most notably the ones featuring the immortals are terrifying . Did I say this film is like a painting come to life ? In some sequences it looks like a nightmare come to life and this stylish formalist type of cinema will send a chill down your spine . This is cinema strictly for adults only<br/><br/>Fans of ancient history and classical studies will find a lot to criticise because it's not an accurate depiction of ancient Greece but you should always make the legend according to John Ford . Unfortunately by concentrating on the visuals there's other aspects lacking . The Spartans don't really come across as real characters from ancient times , more of a crowd of wise cracking macho cyphers and let's be honest here , with the exception of voice over the dialogue is rather poor . It often reminded me of something present day Scottish folk hero John Smeaton might say : "" Dinnae come tae Sparta , we'll set aboot ya up here "" <br/><br/>But despite these very noticeable flaws this is a truly memorable movie down to the jaw dropping visuals and it's the visuals the film will be rightly remembered for . It's a pity that the Oscar voters have ignored 300 because certainly make up , cinematography , editing and possibly best supporting actor for Andrew Tiernan as Ephialtes should have been nominated at least and this film will be highly regarded in years to come"

Don't expect the b/w colored style as in Sin City. The colors are soft / Grey / well antique. As a viewer you have the impression of being in the middle of the battles. Well it's maybe not a truthful interpretation of the historical facts, and the same applies to the interpretation of Frank Millers novel. But the story worked for me.

","Ugh. Where to begin with this pile-up? It occupies some truly weird place where homoerotic tough-guy worshiping meets up with right wing, pro-male, pro-war machismo. Here it is: someone's most delirious homo-erotic dream AND a hetero guys most brainless, macho fantasy. I'll let you tell me what that means for the culture. I'm baffled. This movie was offensive to me from the first few minutes. If you missed the offenses, you're pretty dumb.<br/><br/>Somehow, it takes a crowd of hetero guys to come up with a movie this gay (and this anti-gay!!!). Top Gun was the previous upper limit for heterosexual homoeroticism. A homosexual would have probably reached their fill before devising a half-naked villain in a speedo who wears eyeliner... probably way before our butch, half-naked hero throws a pole at him and hits him in the mouth (Mmmmm, very subtle...). And to turn the Spartan army which in reality was an ARMY OF LOVERS, into an army of homophobes. Uh yeah, OK, whatever.<br/><br/>I made it through very little of this junky, stupid movie. At about the 2 minute mark, the painfully dumb narration turns out to be issuing from the mouth of a drippy character who announces that Sparta has to go to war with the Persians because the Persians ""don't believe in reason!"" Uh huh... sure. You go to war to defend reason. Yeah. That sounds terrific. Oddly Sparta doesn't strike me as a place where anyone has ever picked up a book, or debated anything past their initial caveman grunts. 'Reason' never even makes a token appearance. How's that for perfunctory plot motivation?<br/><br/>By the 7 minute mark I was already thoroughly tired of the stupid script, the stupid delivery style (every line is shouted as a rallying cry) and the anti-gay provocation. Every line is a fresh piece of horsesh*t pseudo-poetry that gets shouted. Even the passing of gas would be announced by one of these hard-ons shouting: ""I JUST FAHRRT-TED!!!!"" If you shout every line, it must be profound and passionate right? ...or absolutely, profoundly stupid. Every frame is pretty, but it's as shallow as a movie can be, making it a worthy successor to the very vapid Sin City. The silly production design seems to cause all the remaining nonsense I could bear to fast-forward through. If you're going to war, would you only wear a speedo? If you go to Sparta to announce that Spartans are your new scapegoat, do you stand a foot away from the decorative hole to infinity at the center of town?<br/><br/>Frank Miller & Gerard Butler are on my boycott list after this homophobic crap. Would anyone make a movie today in which we root for an army that vilifies black people? Why do these schmoes get a pass on this deeply objectionable movie? Butler is a Neanderthal. Good luck pulling your career out of the hole it's in Gerard. You might consider whether the scripts you accept reflect current values or those of fifty years ago. How many anti-straight-boy movies could these fan-boys put up with? Let me tell you, when Hollywood eventually starts making them, they'll be long overdue.<br/><br/>The ideal audience for this may be heterosexuals mourning the lost ""culture of virility"" with man-boys pining for a time when they weren't towing the line of women cutting them off from sex to get their way."
"phenomynouss","1","27","45","1 July 2007"," ""That comic book movie like Sin City with Greeks""
","From a visual perspective, 300 is something of a masterpiece. But movies aren't supposed to be visual masterpieces---they're supposed to have decent dialogue, story, and substance to back it up. That is what separates good movies from bad ones that look good.<br/><br/>I've had my months leading up to the movie and afterwards of trashing this movie for not only its historical inaccuracies, but it's ridiculous treatment of basic logic. Nowhere else can you see 300 naked men bellow at two massive elephants and send them toppling off a cliff, or a single naked man kill a charging rhino with little more than a flimsy wooden spear.<br/><br/>Everything in 300 save for a scene with horses was filmed in a warehouse against green or bluescreen, and while it makes for some visual spectacles, it removes a certain grittiness from it that fails to capture the audience and thrust them right in the midst of the action.<br/><br/>Another major failing is the Spartans themselves. The key to any superhero comic movie (because these Spartans can't be human) is for the hero to be endearing to the audience. The director appears to have completely fumbled this, by making the main characters incredibly arrogant, intolerant, and smug, while giving them anachronistic ideals of freedom and liberty (like a Roman Emperor preaching equality for all men) which rather than preach, they bellow at one another.<br/><br/>Rarely does Leonidas say anything that isn't shrieked in the most bellicose manner possible. His lines range in depth and complexity from ""SPARTAAAAANS! PUSH!"" ""SPARTAAAAAANS!! PREPARE FOR GLOOOORY!!"" ""SPARTAAAANS! WE WILL STAND AND FIGHT!!!"" By failing to endear, and arrogance, I refer to several scenes, including when Leonidas first meets Ephialtes. In history, Ephialtes was a normal goat herder or farmer, who betrayed the Greeks by revealing to Xerxes a goat path leading around the pass out of greed. In the movie, he's a horribly deformed monster (akin to a mix of Gollum from LOTR and Joe Merrick, the Elephant Man), with a heart of gold, seeking to prove himself in battle. His effort to hoist a shield and thrust a spear is almost heartwarming in its attempts, yet Leonidas haughtily says that since he can't raise his shield high enough for long enough, he can't fight in a phalanx (which is particularly ironic, since the Spartans never fight in a phalanx in the entire movie save for the first battle---the director Zack Snyder even admitted doing away with the phalanx because it wasn't ""cool enough"" for his movie), thrusting Ephialtes into a grief-ridden rage which causes him to betray the Spartans rather than help them.<br/><br/>Leonidas also very arrogantly mocks his Phokian allies for not being born to kill like the Spartans are.<br/><br/>A lot of movie cross-over appears to happen, as Ephialtes very much resembles Gollum in Lord of the Rings, so too the Persian Immortals must have been dug up in Isengard, like the Uruk-hai in LOTR---they are not human, and look very much like Orcs. And the ""Uber Immortal"" as it was so brilliantly labeled, was little more than a thinner, more muscular cave troll.<br/><br/>Whatever humanity is left in the film is squandered for the more machismo audience. Queen Gorgo's role is little more than to look like a frumpy 50 year old housewife, muttering about some incomprehensible thing or other while another Spartan attempts to court her. Before Leonidas leaves, he treats the audience to a sex scene so dull and lifeless that it amounts to little more than a CG dry humping with Gorgo. The end of this subplot culminates in the Spartan who has been flirting with her getting stabbed in the public forum while gold coins fly in the air and everyone bellows ""TRAITOR TRAITOR TRAITOR TRAITOR!!!!!""<br/><br/>To the battle scenes: As mentioned above, Zack Snyder admitted to doing away with the phalanx because it wasn't ""cool"". So rather than attempt to give the audience something new, innovative, and unbelievably bloody and violent, he gives us the same old glorified one-man-army crap we've seen in a dozen action movies. CG or not, there's little innovation or anything to impress with the action scenes. Many times, you're left laughing or shaking your head in disbelief as the fighters go out of their way to look ""cool"" rather than deadly. One case in particular is when a Persian Immortal has a clear shot at a Spartan, and chooses rather than to stab his naked chest, to drop his weapon and DROPKICK him.<br/><br/>At some point, you get overwhelmed with the Spartans sticking Persians with their spears like hot knives through margarine, and giant waves of bodies keeling onto a wave of Immortals, and quite literally random slow-motion sequences showing off how close a hurled axe cuts Leonidas' helmet plume, or how many rope fibers are at the end of a Persian's whip, or how many beads of sweat drip down the bronzed and chiseled chest of a Spartan. Okay, we get it! You have a 100 million dollar budget to spend on CG and you don't know how to show it off! There's little else going for the movie other than nonstop and often senseless action violence which gets excessive, broken only by the lonely and useless subplot with Gorgo looking frumpy and Spartan #2 forcibly kissing her. Even if you were to look past the unbearably significant historical inaccuracies and the gaping holes in logic (like how 300 Spartans march off to battle without any supplies, no food or water or baggage train, with nothing but their capes, short-shorts, spears, helmets, and shields) it amounts to little more than an action yarn and a visual mess of action and sunset-colored landscape, little else from dialogue and script, acting, even sound, make it distinct in any sort of way. I doubt many people in years to come would remember this as any more than ""That comic book movie like Sin City with Greeks"""

","This movie was the biggest load of rubbish put to film. It is historically inaccurate, Leonidas did not start the Persian war, Xerxes invaded Greece because his father was humiliated by the Athenians at the Battle of Marathon. Hence the Olympic long distance race of the same name. Sparta had 2 Kings, not 1, 1 King went to war, the other remained home. The Persians did not land by sea at Thermopylae, but instead came over land, the sea route was blocked by the Athenian Navy under Spartan command. I would like to know where the Uber Immortal came from, and the hunchback? Also, Xerxes had Leonidas' head cut off after he defeated the Spartans and had it put on a pike, thus enraging the rest of the Spartans still at home, who would not go further North than the wall near Corinth.<br/><br/>The original 300 Spartans was a far better production, it actually relied on acting and not computerized imagery, so don't waste time with this load of crap, see the original and avoid disappointment."

There is unnecessary nudity (both male and female). A little less ugly characters would also have done.<br/><br/>The worst thing is, there is no line drawn between history and mythology. Greek priests and the Persians are shown as mythological demons. The movie 'Troy' is also set more than two-thousand years ago, but still it is clearly a historical movie and not a mythological one. You cannot make such distinction in 300.<br/><br/>I was particularly disgusted by the portrayal of Persians. They are shown as the ugliest creatures, straight out from Hell! And for Pete's sake!

","...Wonderful productions, I wonder how much I've been influenced by exposure to the various thumbs of armchair critics. However, there can be little influence from naysayers about this film because I am a true fan of the sword and sandal classics.<br/><br/>In retrospect, one wouldn't be surprised that the entire film was shot on green-screen sets, but it was so masterfully (or at least distractedly) done that you don't think about the dramatic skies and wheat fields as piped in. In fact, the entire cg aspect was transparent, which even the Matrix and the Lord of the Rings series had not managed to do completely.<br/><br/>The stylization of the effects, such as the radiant glow, deepened shadows, and slow motion sequences, seemed to emphasize the movie's illustrated roots, and though sometimes I found myself wishing I could see clearer, I always found deep satisfaction and immersion in the storyline. I think without the effects the plot would have required more elaboration, and turning a piece of art into another 'Gladiator' look-alike.<br/><br/>This movie is going on my keeper list, as I found it very comforting to watch, inspiring, and I will never tire of looking at (finally) scantily clad men, especially Gerard. The kingly figure of Leonidas, cloaked in red as is his Spartiate warriors, reminds me of the warrior class and king from George Nader's sci-fi book 'Chrome'. Romantically idealized, the simplistic portrayal of virtue and honor are purely portrayed by a directly stylized hero.<br/><br/>Of course, the villain was just as idealized, and therein is the complaint. Nobody likes a baddie without explanation, and perhaps the studio thought that being a Persian god was explanation enough. I would have enjoyed a much more developed Xerxes, but Ru Paul did a great job on the part. Just kidding. Rodrigo Santoro was superb, as big and evil as the comic portrays, and he does a good job overwhelming the much smaller king of Spartans.<br/><br/>The acting was good, and the script solid enough, all in all earning a rating of an 8, but as promised, tanned and bearded men with valor earns it a 10.

The fight scenes in particular are simply brilliant, full of adrenaline and beautifully filmed.<br/><br/>The cast, with a refreshing absence of Americans features not a single poor performance. Gerard Butler, the protagonist, has a particularly strong performance, belting out some quite fantastic one-liners, ""We're in for one wild night."" Some criticise the film for its portrayal of the Persians and the beasts used thereof, such as a Rhino and an Elephant, neither of which look anything like the real thing. What one has to remember is this film is seen through the eyes of the Spartans and not having seen these animals before, would have been incredibly frightening, the same with the representation of the Persians. Call it artistic license. And as for historical accuracy, this film does not even pretend to be so, this can be testified for by the lack of real information by the narrator. It is after all based on a comic-book.<br/><br/>Overall this film is easily one of the best fantasy epics of the last decade, if not THE best. It is difficult to fault to be honest, but I do feel that there is not enough background about some of the other more prominent of the 300, but that hardly detracts from the overall sheer brilliance of the film.<br/><br/>Absolute brilliance - 9/10"

","The Four FAILS of 300: <br/><br/>#4. LOOK MA! ""STUNNING VISUALS!"" No-one can say Zack Snyder doesn't know how to use a green-screen, but unfortunately he's also a fan-boy with no apparent concept of taste or restraint. We're assailed by slow-mo moments of ""Look! I'm cinematically rendering a page from a comic book!"" not every half an hour or every fifteen minutes, but every FIVE minutes. At least. It gets old really really fast.<br/><br/>#3. AND SLOW-MO ACTION! The same goes for the slow-mo action sequences, which are cool the first time and the second time, and okay the third time... and a snooze by the fifth time... and a joke by the ninth time... and just keep on coming. They're skillfully executed but ultimately dull, like an overlong Joe Satriani guitar solo.<br/><br/>#2. WORST. Voice-over. EVER. It's tolerable for a movie based on a comic book to have a bit of cheese factor. Those stupid loincloth outfits the Spartans are wearing? Okay, fine, I'll squint and bear it, it's a comic book. But that voice-over. Oh my God, that voice-over. It's so ridiculous, so painful, so unintentionally funny, that it would put 300 almost in ""so bad it's good"" territory if it wasn't for...<br/><br/>#1. FRANK MILLER'S NEED OF INTENSE PSYCHIATRIC CARE. The comic book 300 was written by Miller when he was embarking on what I like to call his ""I'm the god damned Batman"" phase or his Nutso Period: the part of his career where his work deteriorated into an insane cartoon of a cartoon. It's funny that defenders keep trying to talk it up as a fun, apolitical action flick, because it's as plain as day that Miller takes pains to slap the reader (and thus, Snyder slaps the viewer) square in the face with his politics at every opportunity. And that's not just bad... it's worse than bad.<br/><br/>If it were just that his Spartans talked in a mishmash of Objectivist drivel, movement-conservative cant and macho clich√© -- which they do -- it would be bad enough. But what makes it worse than bad is just how creepy, ugly and fascistic Nutso-Miller's politics really are. The whole story is structured around eugenics, with Persians and traitors and ""mystics"" representing deformed and subhuman evil and the Spartans representing the purity of selective breeding; there's a whole subplot about Congress, sorry, I mean the Spartan senate trying to stab Leonidas in the back by daring to restrict his absolute power; there's praise not just of courage, but of hatred, anti-intellectualism and intolerance.<br/><br/>That ugliness makes 300 disturbing and unpleasant, in addition to being boring and stupid. Not a good combination."

","""Fascist aesthetics endorse two seemingly opposite states, egomania and servitude. It is a dance between a leader and a growing mass of identical, devoted subjects, shifting between ceaseless motion and virile posing."" ‚Äì Susan Sontag<br/><br/>Released in time for the West's rebooted Middle Eastern Crusade, Zack Snyder's ""300"" serves up what Susan Sontag called ""pop fascism"". Based on a graphic novel by Frank Miller, the film watches as a group of manly men in leather underwear battle against incredible odds to defeat an invading Persian army. As the film progresses, we watch as our heroes kill their sexually deviant enemies, slaughtering them in a series of CGI laden encounters. None whom our heroes kill have faces, except for the enemy's Persian leader, a homosexual warrior whose jewelry studded face is left exposed. <br/><br/>The film's kill-a-Persian pop-fascism, in which brown people are lovingly decapitated, pierced, (sexually) penetrated and mauled in slow motion by cape wearing Spartan superheroes, is typical of the work of comic book auteur Frank Miller. One can argue that superheroes are an inherently ""fascist"" idea of might makes right, but Miller seems to always be pushing this further. All his most popular stories boil down to superheroes, because of their total devotion to the state, forming an elite militant group which works in collaboration with traditional elites to abandon democratic liberties/ideals. This group of ubermensch then openly commits crimes (murder, torture, vengeance, the usual ""cowboy"" or ""old west"" justice) and pursues a kind of redemptive violence - all without ethical or legal restraints - for the purposes of either internal cleansing or external expansion. Miller often presents this stuff uncritically, pausing only occasionally to leer at strippers, prostitutes, and blood thirsty uber men. <br/><br/>""300"", like the graphic novel upon which it is based, contains all the tropes of ""fascist art"", something shared by other well known films like ""Saving Private Ryan"", ""Zulu"" and ""Black Hawk Down"", all of which essentially tell the same story. <br/><br/>While it varies slightly from culture to culture, ""fascist art"" tends to contain the same general tropes. According to Professor/author Mark Wallace, these are as follows. One, such art offers a violent mythology and epic cartoon designed to blur and hide anything resembling actual history. Two, it believes in the moral corruption and physical/mental/sexual inferiority of the Other (be they German, Greek, Hindu, Dark Skinned, White, African etc). In this regard, ""fascist art"" uses the identification of Enemies/Scapegoats as a Unifying Cause, a perceived common threat or foe.<br/><br/>Three, ""fascist art"" believes that the only noble calling for a man is that of the warrior, and that there is no greater honour than to die for one's state/country/ideology, no matter how much pain or anxiety the warrior must suffer. Four, ""fascist art"" always promotes a violent form of conflict resolution, in which the military is deemed supreme and combat, masculinity and physique are glorified. Five, it sets up a false choice; between that of lawless, ""terrorist"" chaos, or violent, even vigilante, justice.<br/><br/>Six, ""fascist art"" believes that governments and democracy are corrupt, incompetent and/or hindrances to either the ""true state"" (often present as an invisible, unspoken ideology), or the great moral leaders who deserve the right to make decisions for all without the input of corrupt, morally and physically weak others. Seven, ""fascist art"" is an aesthetic of either cleanly lined architecture and images, whose goal is to emphasise physical strength, both of buildings and of the human physique, or clean lined demarcations, such as good/bad, friend/foe, soldier/enemy, straight/gay etc. <br/><br/>Eight, the fascist aesthetic obfuscates or actively corrupts notions of freedom, conformity, honour, sacrifice, nobility, democracy, glory, duty, morality, altruism, servitude etc. Nine, it stresses victim-hood, often pitting numerically disadvantaged heroes against a superior Other. In this regard, think the post 9/11 victimhood movies of the US, or the small number of American or British GI's trapped behind enemy lines in films like ""Ryan"", ""Dawn"" and ""Zulu"", all of which skewer historical truths. <br/><br/>Ten, ""fascist art"" often conveys a sense of being a small, embattled moral elite in a world of corruption and decadence. Eleven, it conveys a disdain for intellectualism, let alone anything other than violent recourse and emotional hysteria. Twelve, it offers a mythological, war torn landscape on which the fascist drama can be played out, one that describes even the environment of the world as a pure function of fascist values. No actual material messiness or complexities are allowed in the details.<br/><br/>Thirteen, ""fascist art"" makes heavy use of iconography (helmets, farms, Christ imagery etc), tapping into a mythological and idealised past specifically for the purpose of regenerating nationalism. Fourteen, it is often rampantly sexist with rigid gender roles (homophobic, whilst, ironically, being homo-erotic). Fifteen, ""fascist art"" makes heavy use of code words; euphemisms with political intent. Finally, there is always a clear ideological imperative to sacrifice the needs of the individual for those of the state/ideology, whilst at the same time celebrating the individual for having to ""take on the burden"" of ""debasing himself"" for the ""larger good"". ie - everyone from George Bush to Batman to Private Ryan is proud to ""do the horrible task of killing"" so as to ""prevent you from making this tough decision yourself"". <br/><br/>Of course not everything which adheres to this aesthetic is necessarily ""fascist art"". Films like ""Starshipp Troopers"", ""Star Wars"", ""Incredibles"" etc openly appropriate the fascist aesthetic for different purposes, often for critique, humour or parody. ""300"" is itself not consciously designed to make a fascist statement. Nationalism is inseparable from the desire for power, and most of these films simply trade in power as fantasy and violence as ego-porn, Snyder's superheroes allowing for a more heightened form of action movie gratification. <br/><br/>2/10 ‚Äì Most action movies are homo-erotic and express a male insecurity (fascism is itself intrinsically homo-erotic and masochistic), but ""300"" pushes these anxieties to unintentionally hilarious proportions."

Shall I keep on going? Supposedly based on true events, fictionalized for novel purpose, and blown over the top and out the old proverbial dumper for theaters, this film was a D.O.A. from the second the company logo played. It has all the intensity of a dog taking a bowel movement. Halfway through the film I was sitting in the theater asking myself, 'just what exactly is this about again?' and then it hit me how horrendous the filmmakers visions were.<br/><br/>It was just that which made this film so bad, clashing visions. And you can see it in the trailers and promotional material for this film. On one hand, you have actors working out their damned hardest to get into lean shape, and make their characters stand out, but of course falling into the age old Hollywood Blockbuster curse, they are eclipsed by the way they look and no one even cares about where they have been or where they are going. There is no depth, there is only look, and looks. Poor actors, such as Gerard Butler, Dominic West, and David Wenham, giving it their all, and for what? So people can take a look at their chests, muscles, and rear ends. They give the film nothing more. No spunk, no attitude. Nothing. And that's just the start. All the special effects that it took to make the film also fall futile. There is really nothing impressive about the ultra super imposed grainy look given to battle sequences, the MTV fast-slow quick camera movement that has become clich√© in the last few years of bad movies, and the horrible use of music throughout the film. All it does is show that too many people had one too many hands in this film, that they all crashed and this film burned because of it. What I'm getting at is that this film is a poor man's 'Gladiator' with sped up camera changes, blaring guitar music that is supposed to 'elevate' the tension of the fight scenes (it doesn't) and actors supposed to look mighty and tough, but only look like homo-erotic male strippers. All this drawn together, too much 'creativity'(if that's what one would call it, I wouldn't though) strung together on God knows what, and mashed into a digital garbage can, this is what you get. <br/><br/>There is nothing about 300 that is remotely moving. It has the depth of a bathtub, the feel of sand paper, the sound of grinding in your ears, the look of a comic book that was left outside in the rain for a few years, run over by a tow truck carrying the film crew to the studio to work on another film to redeem themselves from making this piece of stench, and then left on the shelf, you get the point.<br/><br/>I could go on, but why bother? If you haven't gotten the point by now, you won't. Watch it at your own risk, and try not to use(loose) too many brain cells.<br/><br/>This film is Hogwash."

","This movie is really amazing guys and do believe me. i am sure this would be in the top 250 list as no 1. In the Battle of Thermopylae of 480 BC an alliance of Greek city-states fought the invading Persian army in the mountain pass of Thermopylae. Vastly outnumbered, the Greeks held back the enemy in one of the most famous last stands of history. Persian King Xerxes lead a Army of well over 100,000 (Persian king Xerxes before war has about 170,000 army) men to Greece and was confronted by 300 Spartans, 700 Thespians and other Slave soldiers. Xerxes waited for 10 days for King Leonidas to surrender or withdraw left with no options he moved. The battle lasted for about 3 days and after which all 300 Spartans were killed. The Spartan defeat was not the one expected as a local shepherd named Ephialtes defected to the Persians and informed Xerxes of a separate path through Thermopylae, which the Persians could use to outflank the Greeks. This movie should rock out!! Can't I give it more than a 10? I was among the non-press people who got to see a pre-screening of this film in Los Angeles and it is unlike anything I've ever seen on film before. Stunning, awesome, amazing, incredible - the superlatives continue to flow as I think about the impact of this film. First, visually it is eye-popping and the kudos heaped on Zack Snyder are well-deserved. It is very artistic with a unique look but it is never cartoonish. This is a breakout film for Zack, and should also be for Gerard Butler as King Leonidas, catapulting him into the higher echelons of Hollywood royalty. Admittedly, I've been a fan of Butler's for more than a couple of years now, but when this film was first announced I wasn't so sure it was ""my cuppa tea"". Then I saw the footage at Comic Con last summer and became excited. But even that didn't prepare me to be so blown away as I was by the film in its entirety. Butler's Leonidas dominates, and gives us a very multi-dimensional king whose love for his country, his soldiers, his son, his Queen and his freedom is enormous and the driving force in all he does. Lena Heady's Queen Gorgo is one of the best kick-ass parts for an actress I've seen in a long time. She is a perfectly matched complement and full and equal partner to her king. More than once I found myself cheering out loud for her. She makes sacrifices on the home front, to gain support for her husband's battlefield pursuits, that are just as heart wrenching as those her King makes. The other Spartans, David Wenham's Dilios the storyteller, Vincent Regan's Captain, Michael Fassbender's Stelios, all contribute important dimensions in illustrating what makes these men such an elite fighting force. There are many battle scenes, but they never drag on endlessly. Each is compact and efficient, and there are even moments of humor scattered among the severed heads and limbs. The violence is very stylized, reminiscent of V for Vendetta, and didn't make me turn away. The soundtrack is fantastic, with loud, heavy metal during battle scenes and more in the background at other moments. There are some lines in this film that should become oft repeated classics - ""This...is...SPARTA!!"" is only one of those. March 9 cannot come soon enough for me, because I can't wait to see this on the IMAX screen. This is a NOT TO BE MISSED film for men, women, Frank Miller fans, Star Wars fans, LOTR fans (but not children - it definitely earned its R rating). To those who fault the historical inaccuracies, neither Zack Snyder nor Frank Miller ever intended this to be a documentary on Greek or Spartan history. It is a fantasy story based on an event that really happened, call it ""History Meets Middle Earth"" intended to entertain, not educate. I hope it can be viewed from that perspective by others, and maybe it will inspire some who see ""300"" to study the truth behind the fantasy."

","I love epic style movies. I loved Gladiator, Clash of the Titans (as a kid) and any movie that makes history come alive. I love sports movies that have to do with comebacks, overcoming tough odds, and the like. I also have a thing for violence.<br/><br/>Those three factors alone made me think 300 would be one of my favorite movies. Little did I know it was possible to make an epic historical movie about fighting impossible odds with extreme violence that I would hate.<br/><br/>Well done, Warner Brothers.<br/><br/>I'll make this easy for people who want a list pros and cons, starting with the latter because it outnumbers its more optimistic forbear so heavily: <br/><br/>Cons: <br/><br/>1) The dialog is agonizingly juvenile and clich√©. During a dramatic entering into the fray, the leader of the Spartans' reinforcements shouts ""Lets show the Spartans what we can do!"" Lines in perfect moments to drum up the drama of a scene fall flat like that over and over again until you're basically expecting it by halfway through. After the queen's impassioned speech to the senate, I found myself thinking ""you've gotta be sh!^^ing me."" It resonated with all the power of a fifth grader reading a George W. Bush speech off a blurry cue card. I understand that the five lines in the movie (the ones not stolen from an odd combination of recent movies and elementary school history assignments) were reported to have been spoken at the battle itself. If the entire rest of the movie weren't just as awkward and simplistic, they may have worked. <br/><br/>2) Points of the plot that didn't even require mention were either mentioned explicitly or repeated ad nausea. The narrator seemed very interested in reminding you that there were only 300 Spartans throughout the film. It was also made well known that the Spartans wouldn't surrender and would keep fighting, over and over again. It was as if the screenwriter were drunk and forgot he'd mentioned those points, and didn't bother to check the script before taking it to press.<br/><br/>3) Casting made some huge mistakes. Dilios, played by a then 40 year old David Wenham, had the faked voice of a grizzled chain smoker twice his age, seemingly to make him sound more imposing than he looked and to correspond with the narrator's voice after the fact. Considering that everybody else on the battlefield looked and sounded correct for the part, the fourth-billed actor in the film came off like Burgess Meredith with ripped abs. Needless to say, this was confusing and unnerving.<br/><br/>4) The sex scene when the king and queen say their intimate ""goodbye, I may never see you again"" should have lasted about ten seconds. Instead it was stretched to more than a minute of near pornographic detail, including the king lovingly banging his wife doggy style. I don't know what message that was trying to convey, but it was pretty out of place. For some viewers that may be seen as a plus, but my sexually adventurous girlfriend and I looked at each other and mouthed ""WTF?"" <br/><br/>5) Most of the fight scenes were so poorly explained beforehand that they seemed only to extend the runtime of the movie. I understand that there were supposedly three days of fighting, which corresponds with the alleged true story of the battle, but the plot glossed over this, instead just blindly flashing between scenes.<br/><br/>6) The ""effects"" were pathetic facsimiles of those from real movies. Every scene was filmed in a green screen sound stage. No scene had more than 20 real actors in it, when there appeared to be tens of thousands. Every ""giant"" in the movie was a CGI modified regular sized person. This was painfully obvious when the seemingly 8' tall King Xerxes puts his hand on Leonidus' shoulder and it just kind of floats there.<br/><br/>7) Plot elements were either rushed or non-existent. Without any real reason the Spartans are already going off to war within the first ten minutes of the movie. The deepest a character gets is the five seconds of doubt the king has before his freaky session with the queen, or when one character cries after his son gets decapitated. Everybody else is one dimensional.

This is not a good sign.<br/><br/>Also, when about 60% of your movie is narrated by a storyteller... it's almost always a sign of weak storytelling (with a few exceptions like Sin City, ironically). The narrator is constantly telling us what is going on, so the script either assumed it's audience have no more education than a third grader, are really high (a possibility with this movie), forgot that film is a visual medium (although this seems unlikely considering the beautiful shots), or simply had a poor script (I would go with the latter).<br/><br/>The score sounds like it was put together by Trent Reznor.

"rogerdarlington","Null","63","122","30 March 2007"," Thrilling blood-fest
","The 480 BC Battle of Thermopylae is the stuff of military legend when, in popular lore, a mere 300 Spartans commanded by King Leonidas held off a Persian force led by Xerxes the Great that Herodotus claimed as 2.6 million. In truth, the Spartans were backed by a mixed force of almost 7,000, while there are enormous variations in modern estimates of the multi-ethnic Persian army, but somewhere between 100,000-200,000 seems realistic. Whatever the actual figures, the odds against the Spartans were terrible, death was inevitable, and their honour secure.<br/><br/>The story was first told on film in 1962 when director Rudolph Mat√© went to Greece and shot a worthy, but conventional and surprisingly leaden, version entitled ""The 300 Spartans"", starring American Richard Egan as King Leonidas and the British David Farrar as Xerxes. ""300"" takes the same basic narrative and presents it in an utterly different style in a blood-fest when ""The Wild Bunch"" meets ""Kill Bill"" and the visuals are like nothing except ""Sin City"". This time the director is Zack Snyder, known for his music videos, and the location is a studio set in Montreal with green backgrounds later filled by superb computer-generated graphics and the whole storybook style is based on the graphic novel by co-producer Frank Miller. Both versions use the legendary exchange: ""When we attack today, our arrows will blot out the sun!"" ""Good; then we will fight in the shade."" But only ""300"" has such fun lines as: ""Spartans! Enjoy your breakfast, for tonight we dine in Hell!"" <br/><br/>Ever since its first public showing at the Berlin Film Festival, most critics have mauled ""300"" and it presents an easy target for those wanting something more cerebral: there is virtually no plot or characterisation, the script is sparse and bland, much of the acting is exaggerated and over-loud, when it is not homo-erotic it is oddly camp, and the whole thing is stereotypical when it is not outright xenophobic and politically incorrect. And yet, as entertainment, it has much to offer: the sepia-tinged visuals are absolutely stunning and the fight sequences viscerally exciting. I was fortunate enough to see it in IMAX and I regularly felt blood-splattered and exhausted and quite ready to leap into the action.<br/><br/>There are no big names in the cast list which helps the sense of history but does not raise the thespian talent quotient. Gerard Butler plays King Leonidas with a Scottish accent, while the Brazilian Rodrigo Santoro is a version of Xerxes bejewelled with ethnic metalwork. Most of the warriors are literally larger than life: the actors playing the Spartans reveal most of their bodies with digitally-enhanced muscles, while on Xerxes' side characters include a huge hunchback, a giant emissary and a claw-armed executioner as well the metal-masked Immortals. This is before we get on to an enormous raging rhino and bedecked elephants. Truly this is a battle with a circus-like cast. The love interest comes from the feisty wife of Leonidas, Queen Gorgo, portrayed by the alluring British actress Lena Headey. There is even a scene in a rippling corn field borrowed from ""Gladiator"".<br/><br/>At the end of the day, what makes the movie are the thrilling fight sequences with encounters in which the film is slowed down and then speeded up to give a video-game quality that is unlike anything you have previously seen on the big screen. Whem a sword slashes or a spear lungs or an arrow whistles, you really feel and hear it. At times, it is as if a picture by Hieronymus Bosch had come to life."

","This is without doubt, one of the worst films I have ever seen. Sure, I've seen dreadful TV movies with bad scripts and bad acting. I don't have to sit through them to know that anything starring Rob Schenider or made by the Wayans brothers is more than likely completely without merit, but let's put this in perspective. None of those wretched films cost as much as 300 did. They don't aspire to be as epic, and they aren't bloated with such self importance as 300.<br/><br/>I saw 300 when it was the Surprise Film at the Dublin International Film Festival, and while it was welcomed by applause from a substantial pocket of eager fans, to say it was a successful selection would be a gross overstatement. <br/><br/>Several people walked out, and while many people will attest to being impressed by it, or overhearing favourable comments afterwards, the only comments I heard from people shuffling incredulously out into the night were negative. If it wasn't for the fact that I was waiting for the credits to find out who played the queen - I recognised Lena Headey but just couldn't place her - I would have walked out myself. <br/><br/>Given that I saw the film completely unconditioned by trailers or pre-publicity material, I was able to judge it completely objectively. A dreadful, convoluted opening sequence that did nothing to engage me as an unprepared viewer, tells of young Leonidas and his rites of passage. By the time Leonidas grows to be king, I was already alienated, and an embarrassingly grave voice-over did nothing except attempt to level some sort of gravitas on a script that was already floundering in its' own self-importance, and failing to connect with the viewer. <br/><br/>300 is being hailed all across the internet as a triumph, as a masterpiece, as a giant leap for film-making. It's not. It's badly written and badly made. It's crippled with clich√©d elements that pander to the target audience of adolescent males: gratuitous female nudity, incessant violence and woefully anachronistic chugging Emo guitars on the soundtrack. Elsewhere, the relentless carnage is complemented by the now-obligatory cod choral accompaniment as epitomised by the scores for Gladiator or The Lord of the Rings trilogy. Tied to these overblown and now-overused musical themes, there are moments in this film that verge dangerously close to parody. <br/><br/>Leonidas and his army of 300 elite men go off to defend Sparta against a barrage of increasingly insurmountable odds, but since the film-makers seem more concerned with showing off how impressive their CGI goody bag is, they fail in the opening twenty or thirty minutes to give the audience anything to generate any empathy with Leonidas or his men. It's as if an entire reel is missing. As a result, you feel nothing for their plight. <br/><br/>To suggest, as others have, that 300 is a film that must be seen by any fan of Star Wars or Lord of the Rings is simply ludicrous. Yes, respect is due for the advancements in technology that have allowed 300 to be made in the manner in which it was done, but there is no substitute for narrative, or for decent dialogue. And the much-hyped Leonidas battle cries that are already so beloved of the internet community will soon become as hackneyed and as embarrassing as their predecessors, e.g. the cringeworthy ""Freedom!"" of Braveheart.<br/><br/>Excretia."

"Quinoa1984","7","24","43","14 March 2007"," one of the most elaborate, yet shallow exercises in 21st century epic style you'll see this year
","300 comes way of Frank Miller, the ultra-famed comic book artist and author (behind the neo-noir Sin City), and Zack Snyder, who brought us the remake of Dawn of the Dead (not a shame nor not a necessity from the original), and it's what movie audiences probably salivate for when it comes to action epics from a time period dozens of centuries ago. But because it's Frank Miller, and he's never one to skimp on being garish, gory and a tad shallow with his take on certain topics, be they 40s pulp-fiction clich√©s or Batman or a Spartan battle like here, it's the farthest thing from naturalism. Snyder knows this, and decides to go for broke, albeit extremely faithful to the source material (and I say this having not read this graphic novel but having read other Miller works), and it becomes another case of a comic-book getting pumped up like some kind of wild cinematic toy, in this case probably with steroids. But to say that it pretty much becomes style over substance would be too easy, because the problems that come up in the film are not just in the substance, but also in what starts to hit the viewer over the head. Not that there aren't a good many memorable, bloody and exciting images that could only come from the f***ed up mind of Miller, but there is still the all-too basic qualities to the substance too.<br/><br/>I know I shouldn't make too much of an issue with something like substance in a film that supposes right away what its audience is: men, more than women (although I wouldn't count them out as fans entirely) into seeing men be MEN, warriors out for the kind of glory that comes with legends. The basic legend for the battle of 300 is that there were about 300 Spartans, led by Leonidas (Gerald Butler), who was the ambitious king who decided to take on the king of Persia, who claimed to be a God, instead of submitting Sparta to the rule of the Persian empire, and with it going through extremely brawny moves to not stop till the last Spartan laid to rest. More or less that, anyway, as Miller throws in certain, or make that extreme, 'peculiarities' with both sides. The Spartans, for example, consult an oracle, who is some girl that contorts around like she's in an emo music video, and there's a deformed hunchback-outcast, who turns on the Spartans and tries to bandwagon with the mega-pierced, sexual-maniacal 'heathens' that are seen as the Persians. The Persians, by the way, may not have the greatest/most blood-thirsty of warriors, but they do have ninjas with masks, and a rhino, a deformed-barbaric homunculus, and a few ""clumsy"" elephants. Plus, that king/God, who's ultimate shame is that he's proved by his own people to not be a God, I guess, by Leonidas's last throw of a spear.<br/><br/>So, as one might gather, there is a lot of 'things' going on in 300, though as far as stuff with historical pertinence, not so much. There's a fairly predictable and straightforward sub-plot with Leonidas's wife (Lena Heady) back in Sparta having to put up with a traitor in her midsts, though one she succumbs to partially. But for the most part, we're submerged into characters who redefine what it means to be 'one-dimensional', and while the acting is never actually all that bad, even from the usually barking Butler, the words Miller gives them don't do much to make it sound anything more than, well, a comic-book. Which is OK in bits and pieces, until the feeling of being practically detached from reality wears thin, including getting inundated with narration, lifted by Snyder likely from all those narration boxes one sees all the time (and somehow seemed to work better in Sin City) and during some of the BIGGEST dramatic action sequences. It may sound like the substance is a bit too much to bear and that I, as part of the audience, took it all too seriously. This is not exactly the case, really, as the storytelling in and of itself is fairly strong and worthwhile to tell- it's just that not taking it seriously makes it enjoyable in the shallowest ways possible. <br/><br/>This is sort of amped up to 11 by how Snyder puts all of this together technically. It's another stepping stone for the world of combining CGI and live-action, where blood and body parts and heads roll off in a disgustingly enthralling way, and where environments are almost TOO dark &/or lush. There are actually very great images as well, unexpected ones, like when we see some of these walking abstractions of violence and mayhem from the Persians, or some kind of goat-man during the Persian's strange orgy scene. Even the battle scenes, sometimes, are worthy of the best parts of Braveheart and Gladiator. Yet sometimes there is too much, as with the narration, of pushing the boundaries with the style- slow-motion, for example, gets about 3/4 of the attention for all of the battle &/or anything remotely action related in the film, and Snyder's tactic with his DP and editor is to speed up for a moment, then slow down, speed up, slow down, over and over during a battle scene. It comes very close to completely abusing the usage of 32fps in action, for no good reason no less.<br/><br/>All this aside, I'm still glad I saw 300, at least the one time on a gigantic IMAX screen where the contorted camera angles, machismo-rousing moments, and the epic sweep of a production done in such a weird way made it a fun, gory trip. And yet, it doesn't inspire to go back to it more than once, and its pleasures, however in a guilty way (I couldn't help but getting a kick out of the dead-pan manner of some shots and exchanges between the characters), are brief and not very lasting."

This lends a significance to the movie that most other films can't claim. The dialogue is simple-often paraphrasing of actual comments made almost 2500 years ago, come on, do we really need or want English literature here? This movie is SPARTAN in its SIMPLICITY, like great minimalist art. All art forms evolve by incorporating or blending other mediums. Zach Snyder and Frank Miller have most successfully melded two of my favorite mediums, comic books/illustration and film.

Then again after about fifteen minutes of this eye candy overload you realize that there isn't much,if anything beyond it.

","The first thing I thought after watching this film was ""man I sure would have liked the 300 a lot more if I was 18 years old"". <br/><br/>A thought that pretty much sums up the core of the problems with the 300. The film was clearly written for a much younger audience. <br/><br/>The 300 while at times visually pleasing consistently lacked a certain depth in character development and dramatic air. Even the action sequences while being fast paced were glorified to the point of being clich√©. Thus making an aspect of the film that had the greatest potential, fall short of mind blowing. 300 failed to deliver the emotional punch the trailer so boldly promised. <br/><br/>Also this film suffered from ""Gladiator"" envy. If you pay attention you'll see how desperately the 300 tries to imitate that movie. Especially in regards to the soundtrack. It's like they just sampled bits from the Gladiator score. While in some cases paying homage to a film in this way can yield satisfying results, in the 300 it only serves to embarrass the more observant spectator. <br/><br/>The mainly CGI environments, while a fairly juicy source of eye candy also lacked in their own way, emotion and depth. While beautiful to look at, the scenery was so obviously CGI it was hard not to notice and became a nuisance after a short while.This was even more apparent if you paid attention to the lighting on the actors. On more than one occasion it was very hard not to notice they were being lit by studio lights rather than the sunrise. Also, at certain times when the actors voices were booming you could hear the echo of a sound-stage rather than the echo off a cliff face. I'm sure also that having little to work with in the way of grand scenery and visceral stimuli hurt the actor's performances somewhat. How much emotion can one stir up staring at a fake rock and green screens every day of shooting? <br/><br/>This is not to say the 300 was entirely unsatisfying. It delivers enough thrills to merit at least seeing once. There are several somewhat memorable moments, including a grim but beautiful overhead shot of fallen Spartans that looks like an exquisite mosaic. <br/><br/>You won't walk away from 300 wiser but some of you, especially younger audiences will walk away from a noble yet somewhat sophomoric attempt at epic film making."

Except it isn't a wolf, but rather some kind of mythical caricature with a weirdly shaped body, ridiculous teeth, and of course drool cascading from its mouth. Leonidas dispatches the beast with his lance.<br/><br/>Next big scene: A Persian emissary shows up to try to talk Sparta into surrendering to Xerxes. Leonidas and the Spartans push the emissary into monstrous vertical pit right in the center of town. Despite being in the very middle of town, it had no guard wall to keep people from toppling into it. Yeah, that's realistic. Is there a Balrog down there?<br/><br/>Next big scene: Leonidas scales a nearly vertical mountain in sandals to consult the oracle, who is tended by a bunch of deformed old men that apparently are Siths, for they look like The Emperor in Star Wars VI. The oracle is a hot chic in diaphanous garments that might as well not be there. That is the first gratuitous nudity scene, obligatory in movies nowadays but usually better done than this pointless display. The oracle tells Leonidas not to go to war.<br/><br/>Next big scene: Leonidas is in bed with his gorgeous wife, Gorgo, discussing whether to go to war. We get a totally gratuitous exhibition of Gorgo's breasts, followed by a semi-pornographic depiction of her and Leonidas making love. Totally pointless, adding nothing to the plot.<br/><br/>At this point, it starts to run together in my mind, but eventually we get to the battle scenes, which are grotesquely overdone. Every Greek is able to dispatch one after another after another of the incompetent Persian soldiers with a quick spear thrust or a sword slash. Every thrust and slash is accompanied by huge spurts of blood. Frequently the action is suddenly changed from normal photography to irritating and counter-effective stop-motion. The director apparently is in love with that technique, for he uses it over and over. Its main effect is annoyance. Oh, I forgot to mention that all the Spartans are dressed in breechclouts. Shows off the muscles but doesn't do a lot to protect against enemy blows.<br/><br/>The human combat scenes are bad enough, but then we get some Lord of the Rings stuff, transforming the battle scenes from merely insipid to downright idiotic. First, there is the Cave Troll. He is some giant creature who looks sort of like an overgrown human but with a mouth full of teeth and unable to speak any language. The Persians bring him up to the battle in chains and then turn him loose on the Spartans. Some Spartan does him in with an arrow or lance to the eye. Mines of Moria, anyone? Later, the Persians bring up a troop of Oliphants, er, elephants, which turn out to be ineffective in combat because they merely fall off the cliff at the edge of the trail. After that, the Persians bring up a gigantic rhinoceros, all fitted out with armor. This beast is bigger than any two real rhinos. It comes charging at the Spartans. Some cool Spartan casually does it in by throwing a lance at it. The lance hits the beast, the beast keeps coming, the cool Spartan just stands there, and then the beast expires, sliding forward and coming to rest at the very feet of the cool Spartan. How gripping! How dramatic! How stupid can you get?<br/><br/>The Spartans are undone by a creature who is supposed to be a deformed Spartan but who looks like a cross between an Orc, Gollum, and the Hunchback of Notre Dame. This creature shows the Persians a trail around to the Spartans' rear.<br/><br/>Back in Sparta, Leonidas's wife, Queen Gorgo, is trying to persuade the Spartan ruling council to send an army to help Leonidas. (The complete mangling of history necessary to permit this particular plot twist is not worth going into here.) She needs to persuade a Spartan politician to back her, but he is a bad guy who wants her bod. She lets him have it as a quid pro quo. However, the next day he betrays her in the council, not backing her plea and calling her a whore. She grabs the sword of one of the guards and does in the bad guy, delivering a short speech to him while sticking him with the sword. While she is delivering her little speech, and the bad guy is writhing in agony, all the guards in the immediate vicinity are just standing around, doing nothing to try to stop any of this. Really believable, right?<br/><br/>Back to Thermopylae. The Greeks get killed in an overdone scene.<br/><br/>Now to the fields of Plataea, a year later, where a Greek army is about to take on the Persian army. A Greek delivers a supposedly inspiring speech about how they are going to defeat the Persians and so save the world from mysticism and tyranny, as if the Spartans' worship of Zeus and all the rest wasn't mysticism and as if Sparta, with most of its population comprising unfree helots that the Spartan citizens could murder at will once a year during Krypteia, was a paragon of civility.<br/><br/>At this point, mercifully, the movie ends. Garbage, from beginning to end."

"tonispatman","10","73","151","22 March 2007"," Woh, mama mia what a movie!!!
","I have been waiting for a long time to see a good movie and this time has come at last because 300 isn't just a good move it is out breathing, outstanding and everything i can say is little. Firstly I believed that it was just an ordinary Hollywood movie and just like many others It would be good just to pass your time. But I was wrong, because this movie has everything, an excellent story based on the comic 300,fantastic images that travels you in an other world in ancient times, very good cast and a very good music full of emotions.<br/><br/>First of all I want to say that when you see the movie it is just like you read the comic, that means the director and the design art group tried to transfer every little detail of the comic to the big screen, and they did it successfully! Secondly I must say that the cast was very good chosen, for example Gerard Butler fits perfectly to the role of the ancient Greek Spartan king whose first priority in his life is to defend his country (Even though I believe Spartan's have perfect bodies I am not so sure if Leonidas had such good ventricular as Gerard Butler has :) ).His personality shows the elements which indeed Spartans have ,braveness patience and pride. On the other hand the whole image was fantastic , especially the scene with the ships which crash on the rocks made me feel that I was in reality in the specific environment. I really pull over my hat to the 3D graphics art team which did an very fascinating work.<br/><br/>Additionally I would like to say that this movie made me feel proud because I am Greek and shown the image of the Greek soldier, which puts his country above anything and would give the last drop of his blood to save it from the intruders. Of coarse this movie doesn't has a historical prescience but it is based in a true fact that 300 brave man fight against the most powerful army on the ancient world, the Persian. The thing which I admire to Frank Myler is that before he starts writing his comic he first has visited Sparta and Thermopyles (Hot Gate) to be inspired .<br/><br/>Also Myler was very well informed about the Greek history and he included many historical facts, for example the Spartans indeed they thrown or their children in specific hole in the mound if they had a genetic problem. Moreover I think Frank Miller inspired the story about the young Leonida who killed the beast and return to his home from a story of an ancient Sparta boy. This boy was thrown also in a hole in the mount because it was lame but also very clever and very lucky because survived from his fall on the rocks. After that he noticed a fox who was passing around and came into the hole, he followed her and he found a passage to get out of the hole. After he has return to his hometown he was accepted because of his courage to fight for survivor. I really admire Frank Myler because he combined the true facts with his imagination without making a comic with no sense and with historical imprecision. Not only he respected the ancient Greek spirit but also he made an art work which hymns our ancestor and we should make him a statue for that.<br/><br/>I have read somewhere that this film was made just to promote the war between east and west world! And at this point i totally disagree because if the most powerful nation of this planet wants to start a war it will do it without hesitating and without asking .Come on let's forget all about the conspiracy hidden behind the movie and just concern about the movie it's self.After all it is a combination of history and a myth but the result is marvelous.For example why should i criticize god of war (or god of war II) which is an excellent game and is inspired from the Greek mythology but it isn't based in true historical facts? <br/><br/>As an conclusion I would suggest you to go and watch that movie and you will have a great time and you will adore it as I did. Have a good time!"

","Upon seeing the previews of this movie, it immediately becomes apparent that apart from the actual names used in it, the entire depiction of this battle is based upon fantasy. Nowhere among the historical data that remains of the time of Xerxes and ancient Persian empires, do we come across any reference that shows those kings and soldiers as monsters with body-piercing, armors, facial features and demonic behavior that seem to have sprung out from the dungeons of hell. The inaccurate and derogatory depiction of ancient Persians that according to all historical data conducted warfare with mastery and dignity, and looked nothing like science-fictional monsters, is a depiction of how movie studios and authors sacrifice historical accuracy for would-be profits.<br/><br/>The author Frank Miller and Warner Brothers Studios should understand that distorting historical data is unethical, and so is feeding ignorance to viewers and readers. Fantasy-like characters should not have names that are based on actual historical figures. Xerxes was one of the many revered and respected rulers of an ancient civilization the vestiges of which last to this day and are acknowledged by historians of all nations. He did not look like a creature out of a frightening bedtime story. Neither did his soldiers."

","Well, this movie is based on a baseless history fact that have been amended many times by historians. Racism at its highest level, Spartans got the good side characters with good looking and civilized people and on the other hand Persians are shown as devils. I guess Frank Miller's attitude is still very kiddish and this movie is very much influenced from the cartoons he watched during his childhood. Nothing more is expected from Warner Bros. They did a good job at this political situation between U.S. and Iran to show the worst images of Persians for their people. But If a nation is that stupid that a movie can change their attitudes about other nation let them be that stupid. We have enough intelligent people in U.S. and throughout the world that can figure out truth from fiction."
"seihyunkwon","1","61","125","13 March 2007"," A movie about bad asses. That'really about it. I get that many are digging for this film.
","Alright, I watched '300' with a high medium expectation. This was not a great movie for sure. I don't know in which part other people are finding to praise about.<br/><br/>To begin with, I have a problem with a script. As many might know, the story is loosely based on a historical event that 300 Spartan soldiers fought against Persian armies till death. Sounds like an interesting story but I felt quite bored with the story telling in this film. There is no twist, no suspense, no tension between characters. This film has one and only goal which is to show audiences how Spartans fought their asses off against seemingly endless Persians.<br/><br/>Alright so I think the story sucks. Obviously, this is supposed to be an action movie. Then, does this film provide spectacular fighting scenes? Yeah, sort of but it's not that impressive. Haven't we seen all these in 'Gladiator' and 'Lord of the rings I II III'? I really got bored after watching some blood and every part of body flying around. Oh boy, I haven't seen that much blood in a film. If you are a gore movie fan, you might like this movie. ;)<br/><br/>Although there was not much room for acting in this full of fighting movie, the convincing performance of Spartan king was probably the only thing that I liked about this film.<br/><br/>I can see so much potential for this story to be successful but the director failed to put all the necessary ingredients together.<br/><br/>I can understand that a lot of guys will be sucking for '300' because this is quite a macho story. But please don't use big words like 'groundbreaking' or 'breathtaking' for this mediocre film. I mean. Seriously. If you like it, just say why you like it. Don't talk like you know something.<br/><br/>It's painful for me to see this film in TOP 250."
"mstomaso","6","47","94","1 May 2007"," Somewhat entertaining folkloric celebration of the ongoing war against tyranny featuring animated Greek statues
","The 300 is an entertaining CGI and live action bloodbath with a lot of good messages which are, unfortunately couched in an endless stream of clich√©s. The script is, however, its weakest point, and is actually somewhat superfluous.<br/><br/>What you will take away from this film is really up to you. If you choose to be offended by ancient Spartan morality because it runs against your contemporary concerns, that's your choice. If you choose to see this as patriotic or nationalistic glorification of the military and organized, sanctioned murder - well perhaps that says more about you than it does about this film. If you choose to see it as an example of the potential of people who believe in themselves and in the value of their own lives because of a sense of freedom or a delusion of freedom, is, again, your choice. If you believe that bringing up embarrassing moments in a culture's heritage or telling a story from only one side (i.e. the side we know about) is unfair, well, then you should avoid history and stick with fantasy.<br/><br/>Interpret as you wish - the basics of this story - including the motives of Leonides and others - are true to the history that has been passed down. It should be no surprise that racism, nationalism, homophobia and other unfortunate and irrational cultural notions have a deep lineage in human heritage. To argue that films should not attempt to depict these things would be to deny their existence - and would do nothing to fight against them. <br/><br/>The 300 recounts a piece of ancient Greek history, as retold (and greatly embellished) by thousands of generations of Europeans - most recently Frank Miller in a graphic novel. I do not wish to take anything away from this story. It really is a great one. Three hundred Spartans and Arcadians really did take on several hundred thousand Persians from Xerxes armies in 480 BC at Thermopylae. And they really did scare the hell out of the Persians. Of course, most of the details depicted in this version of the story (and there have been many films about this battle before),are made up.<br/><br/>The film succeeds in making visible the main points - both metaphorical and philosophical, that must be taken away from the mythic story of the defense of Thermopylae. The Spartan level of defiance, commitment to the value of their lives over and above their lives themselves, Greek views of Xerxes and the Persians (source of much folklore) and the tremendous debt Sparta accrued from the rest of Greece.<br/><br/>The excellent visuals - which include exaggerated deformities, African animals trussed up to appear as demonic monsters, and a variety of other bent truths - really bring home the mythic quality of the story (this is incidentally characteristic of Miller's art as well),and well suggest how many of the Greeks actually viewed the wonders of Xerxes vast host.<br/><br/>The acting is good for what it is - a simple, very violent and graphic tale. The directing is OK, but the detailed, beautifully choreographed fight scenes (which take up about half of the screen time) use the same mixture of greatly detailed slow motion cuts and fast-paced close-in chaos that has become a Hollywood war film clich√© in recent times. Although I have criticized the script as the worst element of this film, speaking is really only important in about 15 total minutes within the film. It is worth listening to every scene with Xerxes in it, the conversations between Leonides and Laerthes and Leonides and his captain, and Gorgo's speech in the senate chamber. Otherwise, the soundscape is mostly worthwhile only for the audio components of the battle. The musical component of the soundtrack is mostly good, but occasionally utilizes an inappropriate and frankly silly hard rock instrumentation.<br/><br/>Bottom line - if you enjoy action films featuring graphic violence and a lot of ripped guys dancing with swords, spears and shields, this is the film for you. If you want to get a general sense of the battle of Thermopylae, this is a good choice (however, don't think of it as a substitute for reading you textbook on ancient Greece). If you're looking for a great, realistic, war film this is pretty far off that mark and you might want to look into We Were Soldiers or The Great Escape instead.<br/><br/>This review was written by a professional archaeologist"

The battles are visually stunning, grandiose staged, well-choreographed and breath-taking. You can admire the fights in slow- and fast motion and with good background sounds. Gerard Butler's (Leonidas) performance was incredible, nobody fits better in the role of Leonidas! Of course there are not many dialogues in which he's involved but then, at last, when he screams ""THIS IS WHERE WE HOLD'EM. THIS IS WHERE WE FIGHT AND THIS IS WHERE THEY DIE!"" you will know why he's the perfect Leonidas. This movie is also full of symbols: The arrow's will blot out the sun, armies cause the earth to tremble, soldiers are moving like gazelles...In my opinion this is movie is pure entertainment and the new benchmark of bloody action movies.

","Sparta, 480 B.C. All is well in the Greek city-state with King Leonidas (Gerard Butler) and his happy family enjoying their freedom when word of the approaching Persian Emprie under King Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro) comes, offering submission for peace. The King is understandably angered by this, but with the Oracles advising him not to go to war, he organizes only a small force of Spartans - along with a small detachment of Greeks - to stop Xerxes' huge army at ""the Hot Gates"", Thermopalaye, ""a narrow pass where numbers do not matter"". While Queen Gorgo (Lena Headey), Leonidas's slutty wife, tries to convince the Spartans to send the whole of their army to fight Persia, her husband's small force makes a gallant, determined stand against the might of the Persian army. But ultimately, numbers do matter, and Leonidas's action becomes a last stand.<br/><br/>""300"" is a complete ""triumph"" of style over substance. It has about as much depth and characterization than can be expected from a comic book - er, wait, ""graphic novel"". It sacrifices usual devices like story, characterization, and empathy for ridiculously stylized imagery. It's a film that will and has no doubt appealed to legions of testosterone-soaked teen-aged boys, but anyone looking for something with a little brain or substance should go elsewhere.<br/><br/>The very fact that the film is faithful to its source is the very thing that makes it so off-putting. In an attempt to emulate the visual style of Frank Miller's comic book, the film is given a hideous yellow tint throughout. The film just looks ugly, and while the craft involved must have taken a lot of effort, it does not work. There is also ridiculously overused slow-motion, not only in the battle scenes where one might expect it, but in sex scenes as well. And let's not forget the ridiculous fantasy elements, like goat-headed Persians and giant gnarled-toothed Persians (some with nose rings and knife-blade hands!) who come across like rejects from ""Lord of the Rings"". There are a few nice images, like the scenes with millions of Persian arrows raining from the sky that works, but the film is overall so blatantly artificial that it is impossible to take it seriously.<br/><br/>This would be tolerable, perhaps, if the characters, story, and action were compelling, but they're not. All of the ""characters"" are about as deep as the ink sketches they represent. 90% of the film's dialog is Gerard Butler shouting ""SPARTANS!"" Thus, it is nigh impossible to become remotely interested in the fate of these characters. The acting is about as good as one can expect of a film like this, which is to say, little acting at all. Even the action scenes are lame, with the slow-motion and inclusion of aforementioned fantasy elements eliminating any tension or interest they might have.<br/><br/>Is there anything to recommend about this movie? Maybe a few things. There are a few nice images and it's easy to appreciate the craft used to bring the film to life. But overall ""300"" is a shallow waste of time, the kind of movie best suited for viewing by horny teenagers.<br/><br/>A generous 4/10."

Add to this that the ephors were depicted as dirty old men on a mountaintop. They weren't. They were elected magistrates with much power and respect. So the historical errors piled up quickly. The Gothic atmosphere didn't belong at all. The battle scenes were quite good mostly, except that Spartans didn't fight with the main aim being to display their abs and pecs. They wore breastplates and other protection. The Persian 'mad giant' was a stupid addition, as were the elephants and rhino. Xerxes was utterly ridiculous.

"Flagrant-Baronessa","7","55","113","21 March 2007"," The ultimate, raw fanboy-fodder
","The experience of watching ""300"" is much like unravelling a candy box of action goodies, glazed in pure testosterone. Certainly fanboys will hungrily lap it up ¬ñ and although it is neither a very nutritious nor lasting meal, it'll give you a high of cheap thrills and gore galore for a solid and surprisingly swift 2 hours of runtime. I got to see the film at a preview in Paris and the demographic make-up of the theatre was some 98% men, 1.9% their girlfriends ¬ñ and me.<br/><br/>Storywise, ""300"" does not throw the net wide: it narrowly zooms in on the Battle of Thermopylae in 480 B.C. as led by Spartan king Leonidas (Gerard Butler) and his 300 elite soldiers against 1 million Persians led by Persian God-King Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro). Much has been sacrificed to pursue this sliced-down-to-the-bare-essentials trajectory, but the story is diluted by the dutiful formula ingredients of father-son relations, talkative politics and amour. These are all pitiful story lines woven together by the core battle ¬ñ what we really wish to see. However, I will concede that they are highly necessary in the film in providing relief in between the epic attacks.<br/><br/>There is always a crux with primarily visual-driven films, and in ""300"" this problem is reality. Forget the actual events at Thermopylae ¬ñ this is trivial to the story the film wishes to tell ¬ñ the problem is that it lacks authenticity visually and dramatically. Owing to the narrow cleft by the beach in which all of the battle takes place, dramatic scenery is sparse by nature (unlike, for example, LOTR where landscape alone provided visual stimuli). To compensate for this, post-production has gone absolutely overboard with a throbbing CGI-overdose to fit Frank Miller's graphic novel format ¬ñ even the sky is so √ºber-stylized with sepia-tinted shades and shadowy contrasts that the cumulative effect is special effects gaping, swallowing and ultimately drowning ""300"". In the end, there is only a tiny shred of reality left, so distant that you need binoculars to make it out, and this is expected to ground the whole spectacle. Needless to say, this proves a wholly impossible task for director Zack Snyder.<br/><br/>When you couple this visual fantasy with antique, readily-molded speech dialogue, there is regrettably even less authenticity left. Everything feels unbelievably staged, from Lena Headley's impossibly rehearsed counsel to her husband to Gerard Butler's rallying tagline cries. It should however be noted that nearly all of the the cast perform well in their respective parts. Headley in fact finds a surprisingly firm footing in a character that is largely at the mercy of an underwritten nature. The damsel in distress? The tough-chick? The aloof queen? A concerned mother? A loving wife? She locates them all and merges them together in the character of Queen Gorgo. Gerard Butler manages to weave together good screams, nice abs, a fair authoritative presence and not much else into a performance. The most huh-eliciting actor's presence is by far David Wenham who may look amazingly good, but provides silly narration that is altogether incongruous to the steaming macho vibe of the rest of the film. Most of the time he sounds like a hobbled little magician, selling trinkets in the bazaar. The rest are something of one-dimensional goons, but the eerie, puzzling performance by Rodrigo Santoro deserves credit, resonating with Lawrence of Arabia undertones but blown so far out of proportion the whole affair becomes a theatric affair.<br/><br/>In spite of the aforementioned problems, ""300"" basically achieves what it set out to do. It is, in effect, an extended version of its adrenaline-pumping trailer, fit for fanboy worship and art-house cinema mockery. You have to admire the blatantly homo-erotic parade of well-oiled six packs, the dramatic symmetry in the epic battle visuals and the goose-bumps inducing scope of the spectacle. One of my favourite parts of The Lord of the Rings trilogy was the massive attack of the oliphants on Gondor, and ""300"" offers similar but even more OTT extracts with Persian invaders, who bear an eerie resemblance to the south Mordor recruits from the saga.<br/><br/>7.5 out of 10"

It is no mystery what happens to the Spartans. I liked this move very much. The style of filming is much different than I am used to seeing. The tone is dark and there is basically war scenes with little romance along the side.

Of all the epic movies I've seen 300 ranks at the top right with Braveheart and Kingdom of Heaven It's based on a graphic novel,but hey,its still awesome It's hard to imagine that this was made on a budget of only 64 million dollars . this is because production design is excellent As for the action, MINDBLOWING!!!! its quite gory but very satisfying to lovers of gore The performances are also good .The CGI is clearly seen in a couple of scenes though. That is probably the only negatie in this oherwise awesome piece of film. Looking forward to watchmen,Zack Snyder's next one. 10 on 10 for 300"

","After its raving reviews especially from the IMDb site, i was looking forward to seeing this movie. But for once, i'm gonna have to agree with the paper's about this film, many of which weren't overwhelmed.<br/><br/>I didn't quite see where the fuss was coming from. It was a good film, it was worth the admission, but it is not worthy of an 8/10 here. The film did escape to some extent, after a few battle sequences, i feared the film may become a computer game, where the army sent down different challenges with every level, however, the film wasn't that long so avoiding that wasn't too much of a challenge. Typical of recent films similar to it, it relied heavily upon blood and graphic battle scenes, but as expected, sex and a lot of flesh bearing men. To be honest, this doesn't appeal to me. For a film to receive 8/10 i'd expect more in the story, some scenes to remember, and something a little original. I can't remember one great scene.<br/><br/>It just never reached the heights for me, but i'm one of few, i wouldn't suggest against you going to see it, especially if you're female."

","I realize that grading this movie poorly will net my review a ""not useful"" rating by its' fans. It's sad that this will happen.<br/><br/>In 480 BCE, King Xerxes marched his massive Persian army through Asia Minor and into Europe. His highly mobile, wealthy, battle hardened force was a threat to all of Europe. In an effort to stave the Persian war machine long enough to rally full military support, King Leonidas took 300 of Sparta's finest warriors and several hundred other Greek soldiers, on a mission to defend the only viable pass through which King Xerxes' forces could adequately launch an attack on the Greek empire. While the Spartans were completely wiped out save for one messenger, their efforts were not in vain, as despite the overwhelming odds they managed to hold back the Persians for several days allowing precious time for their Greeks to properly strategize and mobilize. The result of their sacrifice allowed the Greeks to win a key naval victory, which pushed the Persian army back into Asia Minor and subsequently ended the Greco-Persian War. The most fascinating aspect of this story being that it actually happened. It is a tale of heroism and resolve to be handed down for as many more generations as it has been told, but the basics points of this inspiring story are all that this movie manages to capture. As is to be expected, especially since this screenplay was inspired by a comic that took many liberties in its re-telling of the story, the cultural and historical inaccuracies were abundant, but I won't bore you with a history lesson.<br/><br/>300 starts with the telling of King Leonidas' youth, his rite of passage into the Spartan Elite, and a few footnotes about the Spartan culture (some of which are historically accurate). All this is hurried through in a very hum-drum yet over-the-top way, and lacking all interesting details, in a way that an annoyed parent might reluctantly respond to a child's question that they would rather not answer. However beyond that, the movie spends little time developing character or story, and pretty much jumps into conflict as soon as possible by killing King Xerxes' herald and entourage, as if the Director knows that the audience is full of chest-thumping aggro males and their reluctant significant others. It is evident from the start that 300 tells the tale with a magnificent visual style that is bound to be copied in many movies to come. Though distinctly artificial and computer-enhanced, the unique use of lighting is both surreal and evocative, and is well at home in a movie as visually mesmerizing as this. However, the movie's redeeming values end there. As if attempting to buck the tired trend of Bullet-Time camera effects and start a new trend outright, the movie uses various film speeds in an attempt to add emphasis to its' scenes Example: A female oracle divines the future in a fluid dance punctuated by camera zooms, quick angle changes, and of course - close up shots of her bare breast (in a way that proves ""I'm a movie designed for 15-27yo straight males"")- that jump from normal to slow motion in an effort to winnow a certain depth that was never there to begin with. The use of this cinematography could have added artistic and visual value, however, the movie relies so heavily on this and the aforementioned lighting, and they are so frequently used, that they do little more than cheapen and dilute the movie overall. The action sequences are full of severed body parts, arterial spray, wince-inducing wounds, and of course, the previously mentioned camera work which, once again becomes tiresome after seeing it used for the entire movie. Despite the amount of gore in these combat sequences, and the movie has plenty of them, there was not a stain of blood on any piece of clothing, nor did it stick to surfaces, dot the ground, or even pool beneath the fallen. It simply vanished off screen or through the ground, as the CGI animator did not bother to apply those decals beyond their flight through the air, streaming from body parts, or on the tip of a weapon. Beyond that, any convincing blood was absent until the aftermath, when a mixture of corn syrup, glycerin, and red dye could conveniently be sprayed on the set. This only served to remind you that you are watching a comic book. The dialogue was exaggerated to the point where the characters seemed to realize that a camera was present, and thus they over-dramatized every syllable, in an attempt to make every line something to be quoted for posterity for centuries afterward. Most of the dialogue seemed to be either screamed or hushed in a poor attempt to pull emotion from the audience - every hard consonant in every scream was punctuated and emphasized in a way only a character in a bad action movie could speak, while every hushed verse was melodramatically spoken as if it were a eulogy. The dialogue was mundane, lacked creative grammar, and was designed to be easily digested and mindlessly regurgitated back by people as they exit the theatre, as opposed to being intelligent and demanding of any deep appreciation.<br/><br/>In essence, 300 is just another Braveheart/Troy/Gladiator/Black Hawk Down gore fest that caters to guys who can only associate anything resembling drama to violent macho bravado tripe that is associated through warfare and the dismemberment of a fallen comrade... except Braveheart was actually good. Like a Dean Devlin film (Independence Day, Godzilla [1998], The Patriot, Flyboys), 300 may be entertaining, but that's really it's only redeeming value, and people looking for something with substance, longevity, and artistic merit are better off looking somewhere else. Side note: It's truly a shame that (American) cinema has bizarrely simultaneously stagnated, and moved in a direction, where most (not all) action movies can no longer be taken seriously, or be produced with artistic endurance or any award-worthy value."
"ChineseRiverCrab","Null","9","14","17 April 2007"," Nice visuals and action, but that's about it.
","I'll name the good points first. The visuals were spectacular. Although certain scenes felt kind of fake and felt like Gladiator rip offs. The battles were brutal and well filmed. Nice action. The CGI was good. That's all the good stuff.<br/><br/>Now on to the bad. Firstly, on an intellectual level, did this movie offer any new ideas or explore any new areas that gives the viewer something to think about and prove itself to be somewhat intelligent? No. Did it offer any kind of message? Yes, that war is good for glory, patriotism etc. I'm sorry but in today's day and age it's hard to stomach any film that depicts war as this glorious thing that is worth killing and dying for. If it was made in the 30s it might be excused, today it just felt like damn propaganda. With all the violence and blood and brutal killings, the film still tried to justify it saying it's all for freedom, and glory, and country and all that crap. After all those Vietnam films you think people have learnt a lesson. <br/><br/>Secondly, did it have any depth? No. The ideas it presented seem to have been written by a 5 year old. The lack of moral ambiguity to the whole situation and the proud talks of war is revolting. It doesn't help that Sparta is not known as the nicest country back then. The movie seems to only scrape the surface regarding the whole situation of killing so many people when it could've ventured a little deeper to develop this idea of whether it was worth it and whether what they were doing really was justice. In 300 the enemy were presented as monsters and far lesser beings that should be slaughtered. Presenting the enemy as one dimensional demons have been used many times in the past in propaganda war films.<br/><br/>Thirdly, the unnecessary violence and nudity. The blood and guts got so repetitive and felt like a dumb action movie. The electric guitar music in a story set in the Spartan period REALLY made it feel cheap and dumb as well. And then there's the unnecessary nudity and sex scenes. When Leonidas and his Queen were about to make love and the screen faded to black I thought ""ok, good"". And then it faded in again and showed some explicit sex scene for 1 second and faded out again. Faded in again, sex scene, fade out again. Fade in, he takes her up the ass, fade out. The sequence borders on pornographic along with the unnecessarily revealing Oracle sequence, and the anal sex sequence. Was it necessary to the storyline in anyway? NO. It felt like it was merely there to satisfy shallow viewers who wanted to see some boobies. Pulls the integrity of the film RIGHT DOWN.<br/><br/>Forthly, no explanation were given for the various monsters in this film. Not to mention the huge elephants that fell rather comically to their deaths and the abomination from Warcraft III to chop off a Persian captains head in slow motion. And the Hunchback of Notre Dame also escaped here too, serving no purpose to the story and had no closure in the end. <br/><br/>Finally, the movie settles on a wheat field taken directly out of Gladiator with a wounded soldier who has learnt nothing about war but instead had been brainwashed into thinking it was actually something glorious and that Leonidas actually died honourably. The movie ended with a huge army charging for ""glory, for FREEDOM!!!"" and another bloody slaughter is to start once again. Without all the blood and brutal violence and nice visuals, was this movie good for anything? It doesn't purify the soul in any way. It doesn't make you THINK in anyway. It was at best mindless entertainment for those who wanted to relax their brains and watch some ultra violence. But how does that make this a good movie? No matter how good the action sequences were, no matter how impressive the CGI and visuals were a movie is nothing without ideas, characters and a fulfilling story with many themes to ponder. If it wasn't a movie that doesn't take itself too seriously, then I really could've done without the ultra violence and nudity. I really fail to see how this movie is any different (or should I say, superior) to other dumb action movies and have no idea why it's rated so high on IMDb. (I am glad however that the rating is dropping) That's about it folks. Notice I didn't mention how it was historically inaccurate and all that because I, unlike what most 300 fans presume, understand that a movie doesn't have to be historically accurate to be good. I judged this movie as a movie and the conclusion was it was a dumb action film for dumb action fans."

","Watching ""300"" felt like winning the lottery jackpot, then stumbling into an emo poetry slam. I just couldn't relate. And most of all -- while I'm a big fan of mindless on screen violence -- it was all far too mindless and shallow to me. There are Taliban propganda videos which have more depth, more suspense and better plot development. The good guys look like bodybuilders on too much anabolics (or, more to the point, gay porn stars), the bad guys either have a bad case of leprosy or wear more jewelry than Liberace (or both). The good guys fight are free guys fighting for freedom (read a history book about Sparta, please), the bad guys fight for oriental oppression. Yes, that's fascist, and it also bored the pants off of me. Leni Riefenstahl's Reichstag propaganda movies had more subtlety.<br/><br/>I give credit for the great SFX."
"hereontheoutside","6","11","18","19 July 2007"," visually elegant, but reads like a memo from the pentagon
","I, personally, love the story of the 300 Spartans, it's really hard not to, so I was biased from the start. On one hand I want to point out the historical discrepancies and reference books and other films, you know: what they could have done better, changed, where they didn't need to fudge on history. But its unreasonable to judge a film about comic book visuals and video game violence based upon its historical relevance. That said it's not a bad movie. You get what you're looking for, amazing visuals, great landscapes, endless battles, homoeroticism, cheesy one-liners in the tradition of Die Hard. (I thought maybe they used up all the one-liners in the trailer, but was I wrong, there is a whole cache of them lined up for the audience.)<br/><br/>If all you're searching for is an engaging, mind numbing, gore filled two hours, this will surely do the trick. But if you're a sucker for a good story or solid acting you find this film a bit disappointing. The story of the 300 Spartans is spruced up a bit to be slightly more relevant for the modern, post 9/11 American audience. There are lots of politically induced soliloquies about freedom not being free and dying for your country. (Not that I'm attempting to pan the basic ideal here, that's another discussion entirely, but I think I might have heard these lines somewhere before¬Ö) There is also an overwhelming sense of the propagation of the east/west binary. The east, obviously being the Persian army, is portrayed as enslaving barbarians, exotic, an object of observation and curiosity, to be pondered but not participated in. This is a point of historical departure that feels phony and deliberate. Truly at this point in time there is a sort of binary, but the Spartans are portrayed with American values and the Persians with no values but the hope of becoming gods in their own right. A concept that really has no place being perpetuated at any time. I'm not saying don't see this, or trying to condone censorship, but merely pointing out that this is a symptom of America's post 9/11 terror hysteria. The film is fun, and incredibly well shot. But the plot is problematic, at best, and is the kind fake ""independent"" film that Hollywood is beginning to churn out at a rapid pace to consume the growing video game/comic book demographic of film-goers that Tarantino has bred to believe that good films contain breasts and unrealistic amounts of blood. (not that it's always bad, I still love Oldboy and there is nothing there but senseless, gratuitous violence, it's just poorly done in 300)"
"magrant2","3","35","70","15 March 2007"," it's tragic this movie was made at all
","This movie was garbage. It overdoes everything. Everyone overacts and there's way too much slow-mo.<br/><br/>First of all, every scene in the movie, whether a simple conversation or an epic battle scene, ends in shouting. There is one emotion in the movie: anger. The protagonist, King Leonidas, shouts at his wife, a messenger, the Oracle, and every other character he has a conversation with. Next time try to create some 3-dimensional characters that experience more than one emotion.<br/><br/>When I first saw the preview I noticed that the whole thing was in slow motion, but I just figured that they only took those scenes to use for it. But halfway through the movie I realized that about two-thirds of the movie up to that point was in slow-mo (the ratio remained fairly constant up to the end of the film). Every swing of a sword, thrust of a spear, and block of a shield was slowed to a fraction of real time. At first it was kind of entertaining, but it got pretty old pretty fast.<br/><br/>Finally, there was absolutely no script in this movie. I understand that the dialog is supposed to be some sort of an old-school type lingo or whatever, but it still has to be interesting. Basically, there was no substance to the script. It completely relied on the slow-mo dance-o-gore performed by the ""actors"" in front of a green screen. Don't get me wrong, I usually love a good gore-fest with a sprinkling of unnecessary female frontal nudity, my favorite movie is Starship Troopers, but those are the only redeeming qualities the film possesses. However, there's still got to be some sort of a script, whether the acting is there or not.<br/><br/>Oh yeah, and the whole movie is narrated."

","Maybe this says more about me than it does the movie, but I left the ""300"" wanting to fight somebody. Preferably after having grown a beard, stripped to the waist, found some funky head gear, a six pack and a sword. I imagined myself rampaging down Broad Street, giving forth my best battle cry to the Saturday afternoon shoppers and Birmingham City Football Club fans.<br/><br/>They should show ""300"" to the England Football team before every game. We would be World Champions, no problem.<br/><br/>I loved ""300"". Of course the script is utter nonsense (it's all fascist Gung-Ho, Fight-To-The-Death, Never-Retreat-Never-Surrender, Fight-Them-On-The-Beaches-For-God-And-Country portentousness), but the action is thrilling and the cinematography is just beautiful. Absolutely stunning. ""300"" uses the same techniques of live actors against hyper-realistic backgrounds that was used so successfully in ""Sin City"", and it works just as well.<br/><br/>Wonderful film."
"bofarr","6","34","68","16 April 2007"," Beautifully crafted film but just too ""hollywood""...
","Yes, I know the fan boys (which I consider myself a member) will howl but I thought this film fell far short of what it could have been.<br/><br/>What I loved: Cinematography, fx, camera direction was incredible. This film was lovingly crafted and shot. I felt like I was not watching the actual battle but living someone's dream they had while listening to the narrator tell of these exploits. What I thought was very average: The dialog was groaningly bad at times but since it was comic book (excuuuuuuse me, graphic novel, ahem) dialog I could get around it. The ninja-like Persian Immortals were cheesy but I could understand since they were supposed to be from the east and this is a soldier's point of view we are hearing. What I thought was awful: David Wenham as Dilios (the narrator) was awful when on screen although not so bad when narrating, he used the ""I'm a tough guy raspy voice"" and just sounded like a skinny Australian using a tough guy raspy voice.<br/><br/>The historic inaccuracies are legion; Leonides tells his son the strength of the Spartans was the phalanx and then they spent all of 10 minutes actually using the tactic. The one edged swords were a Hollywood contrivance and the Spartans going into battle without their bronze cuirass' would just not have happened (and if a soldier was telling the story to an army he would have expounded on how the superior armor and technology made the Spartan's invincible but for being outnumbered 1000s to 1) Also the roughness of the workmanship of the helms and shields would not have been accepted in the militant society that Sparta was. <br/><br/>But by far the craziest and most grievous error was Leonides expounding on a ""free Greece"" and how all men should be free. The Spartans were some of the most vicious slavers in the history of man; they literally kept thousands of slaves! They used their slaves as assassination practice targets for their young soldiers among other practices. This is like making a movie about the American Civil War, having no black people in the plantation scenes and then Robert E Lee standing up and giving an abolitionist speech at Appomattox. This glossing over of history was just a terrible disservice to the thousands of innocent human beings who were killed and oppressed by the Spartans."
"Smells_Like_Cheese","10","20","37","10 March 2007"," Brutal and Spectacular!
","I have to say that this for me has so far been the biggest shock movie of the year, after seeing the trailer to 300, it looked like such a pathetic excuse for computer animation. But my friends wanted to see it tonite and I figured why not? I couldn't believe my eyes and how excellent this movie was, I mean, visually it was actually stunning as well as the battle sequences were beyond crazy! So far, I would say that 300 is the best movie I have seen in the theater so far this year. It was so exciting to watch, every scene had one shock after the other and the battle sequences were so amazing to see, how the Spartans defended themselves, they were absolutely awesome! <br/><br/>It's based on the Spartans, their lives and how they came to be what the legend that they are to this day. When they are threatened by the Persians that they will be turned into slaves, the Spartans decide to defend themselves along side with their king. Going against incredible odds of only 300 Spartans to thousands and thousands of Persians and horrible monsters, they pull together and become the strongest team of all! But the Persian ""lord"" will not give up until he claims victory over the team that is beating them down like they're nothing.<br/><br/>It had great dark drama around a light humor that would give you a breathe of fresh air. The scene with the king looking up to see all the arrows coming towards him is one of the most amazing and unique scenes I have ever seen in cinema. I would Definitely recommend this movie for anyone to see, it is an incredible movie with intense battle sequences, terrific acting, beautiful settings, and a great story.

"Agamemnon-T-H-McBastard","3","37","75","26 March 2007"," Severely disappointed; flabby an unnecessary; weird obsession with mutants. Also a goat headed person whose existence has yet to be explained
","It could have been great, but alas it was not so.<br/><br/>So, first the good news: the visuals.<br/><br/>Gerard Butler was perfect as Leonidas, the visuals were stunning and the fight scenes breathtaking. The look and feel of the movie was straight out of the graphic novel, assisted no end by Frank Miller's input. The crushed bronzes and crimson, the subdued lighting and the Gothic shadowplay all come together to add real depth to the action, which when it works is nothing short of jaw dropping. Admittedly, Snyder, overuses the 'slow motion' button, keeping one finger hovering over it, stopping and starting in a quest for every cooler visuals, which is a bit much - but all this aside, the man really knows how to make a fight look pretty. The soundtrack, too, is effective, with a raucous, serious theme throughout (thankfully avoiding the annoying 'wobbly voiced singing' of Troy/Gladiator/Kingdom of Heaven/whatever), keeping things ticking over nicely.<br/><br/>Now, of course, the bad: everything else.<br/><br/>For starters, the plight of Queen Gorgo of Sparta really doesn't interest, and the Token English Bad Guy thrown in there for her to overcome For The Greater Good is so ham-fisted that he may as well have 'bad news, honey' tattooed on his forehead. It feels tacked on, an obvious and shallow attempt to add depth to a movie which really doesn't need it, and I defy anyone to really say they cared when her conflict was resolved. Spartan high politics? Get back to the fight!<br/><br/>Next, is the portrayal of the Persians. I'm normally quite bothered by films where they purport to display even handedness and historical accuracy but end up with an abomination, but I was willing to give this a wide berth. 300 isn't that kind of movie - it's about the essence of a story, told through a simple, moralistic viewpoint, and so despite being highly familiar with the period I wasn't about to start shouting about how wrong they got it. What I do care about is the undercurrent of racism that pervades this movie, much more so than that of the graphic novel. The Persians are portrayed as overly decadent, fawning cowards led by an androgynous, nine foot tall creature, all of whom are tellingly black or Asian. As if to heighten this weird display of Xenophobia, for some unknown reason, every anonymous footsoldier is horribly deformed - at one point the mask of a Persian Immortal is pulled back to see Freddy Kreuger's hotter brother: the untutored would think this were standard procedure, as the king's harem is also packed with scarred freaks and weirdos. Why this choice was made I do not know - it certainly does nothing to highlight the differences between Greek and alien, nor does it serve to illustrate what they stand to lose. Surely the fight that the Spartans fought for freedom was a weighty enough choice?<br/><br/>This obsession with deformity continues through to Ephialtes the traitor - given a far less sympathetic look-in than in the original graphic novel. Whereas previously he was brave, strong and tragically cursed, here he is viewed as a whipped cur, a snivelling coward who in the end cannot meet Leonidas' eye. Stripped of his misplaced nobility, the depths of his fall from grace (such as it was), he now stands as a comedy character, an 'igor' from frankenstein.<br/><br/>Lastly, and this is more significant than all of the other points, is David 'Faramir' Wenham's boring, weedy narration, which, I'm sorry, did nothing for himself or the movie. His voice lacked passion, pitched somewhere between 'learned scholar' and 'hardcore warrior' and missing both. This seriously prevented me from suspending my disbelief, and ultimately ruined the movie.<br/><br/>A common theme of everyone I've spoken to who's seen this shambolic hulk of a movie is 'it looks spectacular but there's not much to it'. The consensus is that the film's flaws are compensated for by the film's looks: the question for most is whether the good points, of which there are many, can outweigh the bad, of which I believe there are many more. It didn't work for me - perhaps I was too familiar with the source, and the event itself. But if that's the best that can be said about a movie, any movie, then something seriously wrong has happened, and that the notion of style over substance is an all too damaging trend in modern cinema.<br/><br/>Surely that's not a good sign?"
"hadjar","1","37","75","7 March 2007"," Totally Unethical movie picture
","According to all historical documents, this movie is fraudulent and distorted, and its broadcast guarantees the violation of undeniable international legal rights.<br/><br/>It is a proved scholarly fact that the Persian Empire in 480 B.C was the most magnificent and civilized empire. Established by the Cyrus the great, the writer of the first human right declaration, Persians ruled over significant portions of Greater Iran, the east modern Afghanistan and beyond into central Asia; in the north and west all of Asia Minor (modern Turkey), the upper Balkans peninsula (Thrace), and most of the Black Sea coastal regions; in the west and southwest the territories of modern Iraq, northern Saudi-Arabia, Jordan, Israel, Lebanon, Syria, all significant population centers of ancient Egypt and as far west as portions of Libya. Having twenty nations under control, encompassing approximately 7.5 million square kilometers, unquestionably the Achaemenid Empire was territorially the largest empire of classical antiquity.<br/><br/>Based on the Zoroastrian doctrine, it was the strong emphasis on honesty and integrity that gave the ancient Persians credibility to rule the world, even in the eyes of the people belonging to the conquered nations (Herodotus, mid 5th century B.C). Truth for the sake of truth, was the universal motto and the very core of the Persian culture that was followed not only by the great kings, but even the ordinary Persians made it a point to adhere to this code of conduct.<br/><br/>I must add that the simple most obvious details that they could take care of in the movie, the clothing and their appearance of ancient Persians are totally counterfeit. Persians did not pierce their bodies. They were the first nation to introduce clothes that fit the body, invention of sleeves and trousers. They had very fare skin, long dark hair and green or light brown eyes as is still seen on the walls of Persepolis and paintings from that time. These are neglected because they knew that this appearance would give them a very warm, kind and humanitarian look."

","The title refers to ""the good friend"" character who gives a memorial speech at the end, presenting the legacy that grows to fantastic proportions on its way to us as narrator whose words are from another planet. Presumably you as a viewer will make the association I did the with the demigods of Olympus, so artificial and childlike are the notions this narrator presents. They are so simple and extreme, these notions of how the world is abstracted through one eye..<br/><br/>It allows us to take a very few indicators and suppose a world. Deliberate deprivation of young boys is supposed to somehow instill valor. Flying blood droplets is supposed to somehow validate combat expertise. Tactical stubbornness leading to defeat is somehow celebrated, I suppose, coming very close to the 72 virgins bit. Yes, indeed, sometimes this slipped for me into the opposite of what it was intended to purify. The elixir of admiration for the west snapped to Zoroastrian soma more often than not.<br/><br/>That's because the history is that the Persians (the Achaemenids were actually Medes, more like Afghans are today) were the great world-builders of the era, creating less a totalitarian state than a federation of free states that flourished by trade not terror. And the Spartans were the thugs, the warlords who oppressed and terrorized their neighbors, building a state based on pillaged wealth. Even the Nazi association is reversed, the Medes were the Aryans, the Spartans essentially African, and no longer extant in today's Greece.<br/><br/>(Later, the Alexandran Macedonians, the Greeks of today, destroyed the by then corrupt and fragile Persian empire and all its great libraries and histories, torturing the collected scientists to death, in what has to have been the greatest and most brutal setbacks of civilization ever.) <br/><br/>So the resonances with today keep oscillating in a strange and stimulating dance between the intended admiration of these thugs we are meant to feel as the west, and those of Islam. But that ""struggle"" is over issues as remote from this as swimsuits are from locomotives. Let's even say vinyl padded speedos.<br/><br/>As a movie, the thing is oddly uneven. It's tied together by a consistent score, mixed of heavy metal and aeolian voices. And it does have a story, actually two; though simple, they span the thing and stitch pieces together. But there are distinct visual styles here, too many to integrate. I felt actually as if I were defending myself from some of them as they came at me just as the different components of the Persian army attacked the 300 hooting bodybuilders. <br/><br/>Its inevitable I suppose, when the computer work is so massive it has to be parsed out to creative teams distributed all over the world, and they have nothing better to go on than a comic book. I will admit that some of the these teams gave me great satisfaction, some of them in the actual battle scenes where the speed-shifts worked to emphasize the mapping of comic panels into reality. This, if you follow such things, was developed by Peter Weir in ""Gallipoli,"" starring a then new Mel Gibson. Mel then sorta borrowed them for his own battle epic, including the early scene where he lops off a head. Here we emphasize the flying bodies, body parts and blood which quite literally become architectural. In fact there are three distinct architectural structures here made of bodies, and many others large and small made of living men.<br/><br/>For me the center of the thing is the early scene where the oracle is consulted. Three bits of background. <br/><br/>¬ó when I see this plot device early in a movie, someone with a vision (or dream or hallucination) I tend to see the rest of the movie as what's in that vision. In other words here, when this girl reports what she sees in the future, the report is the movie that follows, and that we see through her eyes. It works for me because then I can ascribe the limits of the vision I see to the character I know shaped it.<br/><br/>¬ó one of my most valued movie experiences is a very early short film. Shucks I see my comment on it here at IMDb is deleted. (If anyone saved it, please send it to me.) Its a dancer with flowing garments that sail with her in space. Over this has been hand painted color that overlaps the boundaries of the fabric, the first spatial artificial effect in film. Its transporting, this century-old image. Its copied in many ways here with the oracle's appearance. She's a drugged young beauty, and they use this as an excuse to have her dance, with smoke, hair, skin and fabric tendrils weaving space, sex, sense, vision. The designers of this scene were used nowhere else that I could tell. Its an extraordinary bit of art.<br/><br/>¬ó There's something inherently cinematic about redheads. All filmmakers know this. Its in many how-to shortcut books. But like other fundamentals, no matter how hackneyed it gets, it can still be effective. In a film of actors whose hair has been blacked to seem Greek (and elsewhere skin darkened to seem ""Persian""), they find an Irish girl to play the oracle. I guess she's pretty; it's hard to tell because she's less a person than the provider of hair and a nipple in a complex assembly, but there you have the redhead, first seen doing a Gilda hair introduction.<br/><br/>I saw this in a theater with a friend and despite dangerous political twinges we got swept up in it, together with the people in the auditorium. I think there's an analogy between the brotherhood of the men we see, and the implied brotherhood of the people in the audience. It brought us closer through vision. Film can do a lot worse.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements."

The story was non-existent, the characters had no dimension and I couldn't care less if the wanna-be heroic Spartans would be slaughtered by the bad bad weird looking bad guys that should have portrayed the Persians.<br/><br/>The only good thing about this movie was the huge mass of well-toned, half-naked male bodies.

I'm not a person that enjoys seeing monsters or fantasy with my period pieces, but I am a big fan of period movies so, without knowing anything about it except that it was based on Thermopyle, I went to see it with my friend. Probably one of the worst mistakes I've made since going to see 'Bewitched' First off, I thought the Greeks won Thermopyle? And that Sparta helped Athens, which led to Athens becoming powerful, which led to the wars between Sparta and Athens (I won't attempt to spell Peloponnesian). Now I know that this is based off a novel, one that I probably won't read after seeing that fantasy comes into play. The dialogue was dry and cheesy at most, and (to me) there was needless sex scenes (well, not real sex scenes, but what else would you call them). It's like the people making this said, 'hey, mostly guys will like to see it, so here's there's blood and guts, but let's give them some cheap porn with that!<br/><br/>Because of the visual stuff it earns a 3, if the visual effects sucked, it wouldn't have gotten anything.<br/><br/>And that's my two cents."

It also loses points for including lines like ""freedom isn't free"" and having too many comparisons to the war on terror (with a pro war message).<br/><br/>The characters show one-dimensionality that is usually reserved for romantic comedies.

","Those were the words my brother and I simultaneously blurted out when this film at long last drew to a close. I can't recall another instance in my movie-watching career where, lurking outside the theater afterward, I heard at least ten other people talk about what a horrible film they had just seen. So many elements of this film are just terrible, it's hard to know where to begin. The pompous, bombastic speechifying that plagues every scene? The silly, rock-infused Hans Zimmer-ripoff soundtrack? The profusion of Scottish accents in pre-Christian Greece? How about the one dimensional plot, which essentially comes to a grinding halt about 15 minutes in, never to progress again for the rest of its sad, tortured life. But I suppose the most frustrating thing about 300 is the fact that's it's not quite so bad that it's good again, a la Catwoman or Battlefield Earth. It's definitely in the ballpark, but ends up taking itself so seriously that you've nothing left to feel but hostility tempered by boredom. Let's say three stars: one for actually making a feature film (I mean, that must be hard, right?), one for the comic-book cinematography (not my personal fave, but they achieve what they set out to), and one bonus star for at least keeping it mercifully short: at under two hours, it will only ruin a small portion of your overall day."
"fariceislands","6","34","69","25 March 2007"," Stunning visuals let down by pointless fantasy......
","I neither saw 'Sin City' nor any of the hype surrounding this film, but as one who spent a whole summer holiday when they were twelve copying the Greek Myths section out of a borrowed Larousse Mythology by hand, I came to this movie as a fan of Ancient Greece, art and culture. However, knowing that 300 was based on the graphic novel rather than the history, I viewed the film as such. <br/><br/>I many ways, I was not disappointed. The opening was entirely accurate in its depiction of Spartan Culture. The graphic style of the piece, which has bothered some, was a definite asset for me. The style, not only held true to the spirit of the novel, but also gave a nod to Greek art, and subtly drew on others. The beautiful Oracle sequence lent heavily on fantasy art, while the background vistas and the use of snow, wind and wave, owed not a little to the woodcuts of Hokusai. Indeed, many of the visuals made this an astounding and exciting experience. The battles were at times stunningly realised, the phalanx was well depicted, hails of arrows and a real sense of the eyeball to eyeball, brutality of hand to hand fighting gave the piece a reality which belied the stylisation. Yes, there was plenty of digitised blood, but often the violence was implied by shadow, sound or close up of a bloodied weapon, thus managing to wrest itself from possible accusations of 'slasher gratuitousness'. If that were not enough, there were many shots of the body beautiful (both male and female) to keep any mind from wandering. The casting throughout was good, and not too starry for anyone to hog the screen. Lena Headley made a striking Queen, David Wenham was a sympathetic character- narrator, and Gerard Murphy made a strong and effective King Leonidas. Murphy even managed to make several rousing speeches a la Braveheart sound more convincing than Mel - no doubt helped by the fact that this time his accent was genuine.......<br/><br/>That said, my problems with the film came when it lurched entirely into fantasy, in scenes that seem to have come from an entirely different film - several films in fact.... Though scattered like chaff through the wheat of better sequences, when they occurred, my principle enjoyment came from playing spot-the-reference, rather than the action. Why for example, did the Oracle's attendants appear to be medieval cowled monks who seemed to have a bad case of leprosy? (Braveheart/Name of the Rose - anyone?) Why a Spartan Quasimodo? Why Immortals who seemed to be a combination of Ninja and dark hordes of Mordor? Why the mutant fighting for the Persians which was lifted straight from Lord of the Rings...? As spectacular as the creature was, I don't think the Persians had attack-rhino...... But most and worst of all, why was Xerxes portrayed as a camp dancer from a burlesque, swathed in gold 'bondage' chains, shimmer body gel and sparkly gold eye-shadow? Good grief - the guy was nice to look at - but why?? The Persian culture had more than enough to recommended it to be depicted with as much reality as the Spartan heroes. Yes, fantasy might be part of the genre, but for me in this case, its inclusion seemed shoehorned into the plot and utterly pointless, making what could have been a very good film indeed into a fairly good one. It's certainly worth a look - but it's not the must see I think it might have been."

","This film, initially, wasn't touted as much...then it won a couple of awards and all of a sudden, it was the ""sleeper of the year"". I thought it was decent, but overly hyped. The film was, apparently, an blend of live action with a computer-generated background. It's the background, I believe that really left me cold. There's plenty of violence, blood and death, even a little sex and toplessness. The major problem is that the background (excepting the precious few indoor shots, which, I guess were shot in a studio) doesn't look real at all. I'm talking completely UNREAL looking. I didn't realize how important a realistic looking background is until this film. The vast majority of the story takes place outdoors and it hurt what could have been a very good film. The actors are, for the most part, relative unknowns, yet they all did a very good job. I had hoped for something a bit better."

","Well, first of all, great acting on the men and women's parts who played the Spartans. The fight scenes with the 300 were wonderful. Then some idiotic person who obviously knows nothing about the history of the 300 Spartans and their war against Xerxes made up a pornographic horror story for all you young people of this generation, this movie has the most ridiculous portrayal of the Persians I have ever seen. Half of the people will watch this movie and never know that King Leonidas and the 300 Spartans as well as the Great Persian King Xerxes and his soldiers the Imortals were real, not made up monsters. Perhaps the people who know nothing, should watch the original 300 Spartans, with Richard Egan, you might actually learn something instead of dreaming over something that isn't real and you can't have. For all you bozos that thought this movie should have a wonderful rating, thats including the director of this movie, are in your own perverted fantasy world. You need to grow-up and look into history instead of someone else's idea of a good movie, just because there was blood, guts, and sex in it. As I said GROW-UP!!"
"jimmyh90","4","35","72","11 March 2007"," Let Down
","I was very disappointed when I walked out of the theater. Very little was done to develop the character of Leonidas or any of the other Spartan soldiers. The best acting and character development came from the role of the queen. If the whole movie had been about her it would have been more engrossing.<br/><br/>The 300 Spartans are just given to the audience. They are not introduced nor is their history explained. Why are these fighters chosen? What personal reason do they have for fighting? Everyone knows they fight for Sparta but if the audience is supposed to care about these characters then the audience has to get to know some of them. The only character that reveals a range of emotions and thoughts is the queen. Hence, when her plot line reached its climax, everyone in our theater cheered. When the Spartans fought, everyone enjoyed the cinematography of the action but there was no emotional investment.<br/><br/>The pace of the movie was also poorly developed. The battle should be the climax of the movie so that the audience views it as the culmination of an intense story. Instead, the movie bogs down in the battle and one is left to wonder, how long can this last? Thats not to say that the battle is completely dull. There are excellently filmed action scenes and exciting fights. However, they never feel like they are the apex of the movie.<br/><br/>What worries me most is that Snyder is slated to direct Watchmen, a much more intricate story that will require great skill to translate into a movie. If he couldn't execute the storyline of 300 then what will he do with a much more difficult project?"

","The monstrous, evil and disgusting Persian soldiers, as depicted in the movie, is a direct insult and disgrace to the written and well known history of the remarkably civilized Persian Empire. It is a proved scholarly fact that the Persian Empire in 480 B.C was the most magnificent and civilized empire. Established by the Cyrus the great, the writer of the first human right declaration, Persians ruled over significant portions of Greater Iran, the east modern Afghanistan and beyond into central Asia; in the north and west all of Asia Minor (modern Turkey), the upper Balkans peninsula (Thrace), and most of the Black Sea coastal regions; in the west and southwest the territories of modern Iraq, northern Saudi-Arabia, Jordan, Israel, Lebanon, Syria, all significant population centers of ancient Egypt and as far west as portions of Libya. Having twenty nations under control, encompassing approximately 7.5 million square kilometers, unquestionably the Achaemenid Empire was territorially the largest empire of classical antiquity.<br/><br/>Although I find this heresy nothing short of a reaction to the denial of Holocaust by Iran's president (which is indeed, disgusting as well), twisting the history and insulting the glorious and remarkably civilized past times of an ancient civilization is a far worse disgracing and disgusting action. Let the politicians bark at each other, and let the art stay genuine."
"monque","3","31","64","9 March 2007"," Incredible potential, but ultimately disappointing
","Wrote this elsewhere but I'm pasting it here for those interested.<br/><br/>It was a disappointment. And not because of any supposed political symbolism, homophobic inclusions, ""video game"" aspirations, racism, and on and on and on... (amazing how we manage to find these items in all sorts of places)... <br/><br/>As a stand-alone film, the surroundings and action were stylish and visually arresting, but its characters and contrived drama were mediocre. They never elevated the fight or world to a level beyond technological and artistic flourishes -- although the fervor of Butler's role came close at times. The action sequences try hard to make up for this, but the awe-inspiring force of cinematic battle by itself does not make for a meaningful film. It can make for an entertaining one, though, and that will be this film's chief draw and quality.<br/><br/>As an adaptation (and this is where it counts in my mind), it tried vehemently to mirror its source, but only managed to capture the barest essence of Miller's original watercolored Spartans --> In its copycat style (an approach handled much more exquisitely by Sin City, which adapted itself extremely well to the different live-action form), it provides only a *visible* facsimile. It copied over scenes, dialog, gestures, and a degree of Spartan power, but it left the spark of its chief characters behind. There is no hesitation or distraction in the comic Leonidas, no hastened or undercooked back story in the comic Ephialtes, there is no individual or paired scuffle with the comic Spartans but rather an unconquerable mass of human determination, and there is also a sense of raw, wide-eyed terror in the Persian ranks which doesn't appear on screen. <br/><br/>What goes beyond this, however, is that it allows itself a ""Meanwhile, back in Sparta..."" subplot which clutters and, for me, diminishes the critical situation in the Hot Gates. Miller took care of business back home very early in the work and afterward pays exclusive attention to the 300 in the narrow pass. He also crafted the entire relationship between Leonidas and his wife in just a few panels with more simple, brute emotion than anything newly created for the film. The comic is Leonidas' story only. The film is Leonidas' subtle wavering, the Spartan Council, filial relationships in the Spartan ranks, political espionage, and the wife's own home court adventure (which lacked inspiration and ultimately reduced the image of Spartan women rather than improve it). Put it this way: if you're making this film and you *purposely* set out to emulate the comic's look, sequences, emotional heart and intensity as much as possible, would you create from scratch twenty, thirty, or however many interspersed minutes of brand new side story and increase the likelihood of undermining your purpose? Layering an ""orc-ish"" flair to the enemy legions is fine and fitting, but to invent a wholly new story to staple on drama and/or tension is a poor move (and needless, since the quality is already there and waiting to be delivered from the page to the theater). It adds length rather than substance to this film.<br/><br/>I came into this as a fan of the comic and of Frank Miller. I actively searched for its good qualities. And many will enjoy its visceral, stylized violence (which is well done), and find humor in the terse quotes and the opulent Persians. The film had incredible potential to convey the artistic and emotional mastery of the comic to the big screen. Ultimately I was left with another flashy blockbuster."

The battle sequences are extremely impressive, and the way the film show us the utilization of the famous Greek phalanx in war is brilliant. Unfortunately, the script is very dull. By using a voice off, you can observe that they try to keep in the dark the problems in the script. There are also several problems due to the intention of making a pure visual film in some scenes. And in one case in particular you can observe more than one sun, only to achieve several counter sun shots in the same scene, of course,..... All the acting is quite good but sometimes the voices of some characters are overacted. I must say that there are many sequences of the film that are taken literally from other movies. The way Leonidas is killed is exactly the same we can see in Jet Lee's Hero. And of course there are many moments of Ridley Scot's Gladiator in the film.

Firstly, this is the most morally dubious movie I've ever watched, and I've watched Nazi propaganda. The Persians are portrayed as a soulless, evil mass of black people, monsters etc. What Zack Schneider forgot to take into account was that the Persians were, and are, a real people. You can do that sort of thing in LOTR because the Orcs can't make a protest committee complaining about their representation by Peter Jackson. The Iranian people have taken great offence at this film, and my sympathies are thoroughly with them. Many of them even believe that the film is a piece of Hollywood, anti-Iranian propaganda. One can understand why they would think this. The film is unashamedly jingoistic in its portrayal of war, showing it more as an extreme sport in which everyone (who wins) has a thoroughly enjoyable time. As said before, the Persians are portrayed as being thoroughly evil, even murdering the Persian ambassador is shown as being a good, moral and 'cool' thing. There's even a moment at the end when the narrator starts talking to the audience, a technique straight from the World War II propaganda films. The only reason why I don't think this is anti-Iranian propaganda is because the book was written in 1998, which was before all this West-East tension started up. I think that all it was is that Zack Schneider is unobservant, tactless and has a very bad sense of timing (the film actually came out after the UK hostage situation, involving the UK marines). <br/><br/>The film's climax (there are spoilers of a fashion in this upcoming part, but I don't think I'm spoiling anything): In the climax of Miller's book, the vanquished and depleted Spartan forces are approached by King Xerces himself in one final attempt to save Sparta and Greece. King Leonidas throws his spear at Xerces' head trying to kill him. As Leonidas is 'gunned' down by Persian archers he sees that his spear has missed Xerces by the tiniest fraction imaginable, cutting his cheek open but not hurting or alarming Xerces in any way. A powerful climax. In the sixties film as well, King Leonidas dies trying to kill Xerces but Zack Schneider doesn't seem to like sad endings. Although in motions the film's climax is the same as the novel's, the meaning is changed. In this version, King Leonidas apparently intended only to cut open Xerces' cheek to prove that he's not a God (which he thinks he is). But if he had killed Xerces, wouldn't that also have proved that he was not a God? I mean if you look at the Greek and Norse myths, the Gods are forever suffering unimaginable injuries. It would seem to me, that while Zack wants to be as faithful to the book as he can, he can't bear the thought that a hero might fail in his quest. If Leonidas did what he intended in the film, it might explain why for a further five minutes he staggers round the screen yelling in a despairing voice 'my queen, my queen'. I just wanted him to die and get it over with. Added to THAT, we get an epilogue scene where the narrator tells us, to our face, 'Xerces was held off for three days', although the film extends it to about three weeks, by a mere 300 Spartans, now we're going to totally kick his arse with 10,000 Spartans. I'm like 'please, let it end!' All the books and films about the battle of Thermopylae do this, tell us about how afterwards a bigger Spartan army arrived with the other Greeks, kicked Persian butt and lived happily ever after. Can't they just let it end with the death of the 300? When did we become so averse to sad endings? <br/><br/>Another thing I dislike about the film (is there any end?) is that it cuts out the part played by the other Greek armies. The entire Greek force at Thermopylae numbered 4000 (which is still pretty small compared to the Persian force). The 300 Spartans were the elected leaders of this army and they were the ones who stayed behind after the Greek betrayal in a seemingly fruitless gesture. But the other Greeks fought just as hard as the Spartans. Many accounts tell how the 700 Thespians actually fought harder than the Spartans and stayed behind to die with them after the betrayal (maybe one day they'll make a film called 700?!) But this film pretends that the Spartans were the only ones fighting at Thermopylae. When in the film the Arcadians come to offer their help, Leonidas basically tells them to p*ss off (and people call this guy noble). While in the book the Spartans are unashamedly rude to the Arcadians and the Thespians, they accept their help; after all, it's only being smart. Coming back to an earlier point, a lot of people who like the film refer to Gerard Butler's Leonidas as noble and heroic. I suggest we lock these people up in a mental asylum before they start acting heroic! <br/><br/>300 has changed my life forever. I have been able to get some good out of it though. I have become a big fan of the 300 trailer remixes on YouTube which take images from films and shows, e.g. the Simpsons, Transformers, and out them on top of the trailers for 300 (the 300 trailer is actually very good...is it not pathetic when a trailer for a film is better than the actual film?) And I have gotten out of it, the better versions of Thermopylae, the 1962 film, Frank Miller's graphic novel and the novel Gates of Fire. But my advice, only watch 300 if you want to make fun of it."

No character development is needed, just give this guy some lobster claws for hands and call it good.<br/><br/>The tale of the 300 Spartans is classic and some of the magic of that story makes it through here.

If this movie cost a lot to make, they were spending way too much on lunch for the actors. I would describe this movie as an adult film that forgot to include the porn. And by the way; Spartans are supposed to be TOUGH. not kinda tough...TOUGH. They aren't supposed to make jokes. They aren't supposed to get tired from running up a hill. They are supposed to kill without giving it a second thought and move on to the next guy. They tried to add humor (and failed) and then there are times when it just seemed like the director forgot the image he was trying to create. If you have ever read the Halo books, you'd know what Spartans are actually supposed to be like. and in the books, they are captures perfectly.

","To: Warner Brothers Studios, 4000 Warner Blvd, Burbank, CA 91522 Your new movie called ""300"" opening on March 9th in theatres all over the United States and based on a graphic novel by Frank Miller portrays the battle of Thermopylae in which King Leonidas and 300 Spartans fight against Xerxes and his Persian army. Upon seeing the previews of this movie, it immediately becomes apparent that apart from the actual names used in it, the entire depiction of this battle is based upon fantasy. Nowhere among the historical data that remains of the time of Xerxes and ancient Persian empires, do we come across any reference that shows those kings and soldiers as monsters with body-piercing, armors, facial features and demonic behavior that seem to have sprung out from the dungeons of hell. The inaccurate and derogatory depiction of ancient Persians that according to all historical data conducted warfare with mastery and dignity, and looked nothing like science-fictional monsters, is a depiction of how movie studios and authors sacrifice historical accuracy for would-be profits. <br/><br/>The author Frank Miller and Warner Brothers Studios should understand that distorting historical data is unethical, and so is feeding ignorance to viewers and readers. Fantasy-like characters should not have names that are based on actual historical figures. Xerxes was one of the many revered and respected rulers of an ancient civilization the vestiges of which last to this day and are acknowledged by historians of all nations. He did not look like a creature out of a frightening bedtime story. Neither did his soldiers. <br/><br/>By all means depict important historical events, but take the trouble to visit a library and to do some research before you do so. <br/><br/>We, The Undersigned, consider the movie ""300"" an outrage and boycott it. <br/><br/>Sincerely,"

","Some beautiful graphical work. The performances by the main actors were pretty good (though the accents were inconsistent and often unconvincingly modern-sounding). That's the best I can say about it.<br/><br/>The story is stupid and simplistic. ""Enemy comes along. A few good men take on the evil dudes in their large numbers. Let's admire the good men forever for their bravery and courage. Let's rally to their support...yada yada yada""<br/><br/>Characters are predictable and obvious - either plain good or bad. At least with Sin City, it felt like some interesting ideas and new ground was being covered.<br/><br/>Anyone who is an enemy is perverted and licentious in some way, particularly the opposing race (yeah, b/c we're all that simple). It portrays war and genocide as cool. It dresses most of the baddies up in non-western costumes.<br/><br/>The annoying thing is that the majority of the audience I was sitting with were impressionable, young boys. Yep, exactly the kind of minds that we want exposed to this stupid, racist crap. (And, not surprisingly, the highest ratings for this movie come from kids under 18.)<br/><br/>Many people claim 300 is only a movie. If it's only a movie, I would love to see another similar movie made, but with the characterisation reversed for the races. Let's have a huge number of caucasians portrayed as pathetic, bad, immoral, disloyal, licentious, weak and stupid. Let's have a small number of Persians/Asians/Arabs portrayed as strong, heroic, courageous, loyal, self-sacrificing, intelligent and honourable. And let's have this small clan easily massacre the pathetic white people, piling their bodies in a way that's reminiscent of the holocaust.<br/><br/>Then see the reaction of the same large group of (mostly caucasian) movie-goers who claim 300 is fantastic, and just a movie, and shouldn't be taken so seriously. Whether they admit it or not, many caucasians would despise and be upset by seeing the way the characters that ""represent"" them are portrayed and they would feel the simplistic, hateful racism that is inherent in such portrayals.<br/><br/>This is not a movie for those who respect different cultures or value intelligent ideas."

","Well, what to say that hasn't been said elsewhere? I would like to think I went into the movie with expectation rather than prejudice and I think I ended up feeling somewhat let down. Okay, well, what did I like about it? I enjoyed the fact it was very noisy, and occasionally it looked very pretty indeed, and it wasn't very taxing, but, alas, it was rather overwhelmed by a lot of other bits that just bored me. I had had the good sense to realise that it wasn't going to pay much attention to likely history (which is fine, because neither did most of the classics), but even with all of that, a great deal of the bits in between the fighting scenes I found to be utterly unengaging, probably because of the completely expectable nature of it all. It didn't help that the script and the acting were both incredibly flat (I've not read the comic book, so if it has been lifted directly, then I can only imagine it worked much better on the page), and whilst I wouldn't want for a labyrinthine plot in this kind of eye fodder, something other than absolutely predictable linearity would have been nice (I mean, even the crappiest Bond movie can do that.) I did enjoy the occasional blasts of irony which I am pretty certain were deliberate, and some of the especially stupid bits made myself, and a number of other viewers in the cinema I was in, laugh out loud (mostly involving monsters or animals), but overall, the biggest failing I felt this picture had is that after about twenty minutes I realised I didn't really care for any of these characters because none of them had been given a character (there was less of this here than in ""Soldier"", for goodness sake), and after about thirty minutes I realised I wasn't going to be given any reason to care,either, and so after that, I was mostly waiting for it to end. Which it did eventually, and that was lovely."

The movie was obviously made for idiots, gay men, liberated house wives, and the heterosexual man-b***hes who mindlessly serve them. Wow.

It can't be expecting anybody with half a brain to take this premise as seriously as it seems to take itself.<br/><br/>Are we supposed to be sympathizing with, relating to or finding these Spartan characters interesting in any way? The only thing they're fighting for is their already corrupt nation which seems rife with hypocrisy, stupidity, hatred and social turmoil to begin with which the military characters, the king and his 300 soldiers, that dominate the story seem either oblivious or indifferent to. So what exactly are they defending? A nation of baby killers who worship deformed leprous pedophiles while pretending to be a proud and noble culture? Ha! Don't make me laugh! Actually too late!<br/><br/>And don't tell me about the battle scenes. <br/><br/>I don't care what the history books say (history is filled with lies told by authoritative liars endorsed by weak-minded people dumb enough to accept it as truth) but there is no way 300 soldiers could withstand an oncoming crowd made up of thousands upon thousands of people, in this case full grown men armed and hostile, no matter what battle strategy was used. It's just physically impossible. If 3 people were standing in front of an entrance to an alley and 10 people rushed them there is no way they could prevent at least some of them from getting through. You'd have to be a f***ing idiot to believe otherwise.<br/><br/>Of course the filmmakers would have you believe that the Persians weren't smart enough to rush the 300 Spartans all at once (I think the modern term for it is a ""stampede"" and is usually the result of mindlessly panicking cattle) with their tens of thousands of soldiers so instead of realistic battle scenes we get an hour and a half of endless shots of the Spartans hacking away at Persian soldiers who for some reason are all mysteriously separated by dozens of feet of space as if relentlessly swarming the Spartans and thus crushing and overcoming them with the sheer size and weight of their numbers never occurred to them.<br/><br/>Wow. Talk about stupid and unrealistic. And supposedly using a battle strategy attributed to the mindless panicking of cattle was not obvious enough for the Persians, an insurmountable army that was already sweeping through the land conquering everything it came across.<br/><br/>If you want to know how dangerously gullible, stupid and pathetic people have become in the Microsoft age then the success of this moronic feat of CGI overkill made by one of the most glorified film-making hacks out there, Zack Snyder, possibly Uwe Boll's illegitimate brother, is overwhelming proof that if you make something shiny, polished and pretty enough it doesn't have to work at all in any other way to get sold on the open market to the idiot masses."

It was many movie highs of stylish destruction wrought by wise cracking tough guys. I worshipped at this neon altar once upon a time; Schwarzenneger, Stallone, Van Damne- patron saints, their monosyllabic sermons preaching ultra-violence without irony to spoil the arias of bodily desecration, of wide- scale property levelling. Come all ye faithful, its time to kick ass & chew bubblegum. <br/><br/>300 lets me to really see what had me in thrall years ago, the same tropes blown up to IMAX proportions, every step & heave of chiseled chests like nuclear explosions on screen, super-size big gulp generation EPIC, highway to the danger-zone! Fascist homo-eroticism doesn't begin to describe this numb skull opera, retroactively making me recognize all those other youthful movies for their peaCOCKing cartoon masculinity....its soooo GAY!<br/><br/>Beyond that, reactionary Frankie Miller's tale of spartan strongmen fighting girly god-king Xerxe's brown skinned hordes is as cartoon gorgeous as it's retarded, hyper-real & video game perfect. Its pure spectacle, sound & fury yadda yadda, glorious while espousing the most backward iron age exploits. Its a diseased piece of work but it tickles the lizard brain something fierce with its strongman chic. SIN CITY had the same frighteningly empty, sterile charm. Both are illuminating in the worst ways. <br/><br/>Its a treat to see movies completely lay it out like 300 does, to stop pussy footing around & admit they're down with the sickness. It doesn't matter if its not intended as a political primer or a history lesson, that kind of defence betrays profound ignorance of how completely this communal dream-time called the movies subconsciously shapes us. More discernment helps separate meaningful self expression from superficially attractive power fantasies. Films don't just show up without connection to the wider world, even sword & sandal peplum.<br/><br/>Sick yes but it's hilarious lack of shame really lets the makers go all out in their fantastic exaggerations- cavorting slave girls, inbred mystics, freak berserker's that are like end level bosses, high artifice carnage- its overblown & straight faced like a camp movie, lurid & grotesque. The movie delights in xbox warfare lovingly rendered for all those CALL OF DUTY addicts out there, a manly mythic tone of gods & heroes past that even got me pumped. There's great pleasure taken in abstracted set pieces, hight-lighting chiseled Spartan ubermenschs delivering fatalities (FINISH HIM) to eastern cannon fodder; if there was a movie to make war look like porn this has to be it. These orgasmic moments are very disconnected, like pieces of framed blood art; you can practically hear the director going 'that's sick!' & 'wicked!' for every money shot. I'd really like to know what he thought he was making.<br/><br/>The Iranians-*ahem* PERSIANS are so clearly other, Xerxes like an 8 foot Brazilian tranny on steroids- degenerate effeminacy that the hunky Spartan manly men must put down like a rabid dog.... yeah movies like this don't really help even though they ARE a guilty blast (first you have to KNOW its a guilty blast, though). Its another sealed hermetic CGI universe, a copy of a copy. Exquisite soma. I've see enough of fan boy director Zack Snyder I think- nice depth-less imagery but nothing more (*how* did he end up with WATCHMEN?). A Tarantino media junkie, he's Hollyweird perfect.

If you remember this is based on a graphic novel and not history, you can get by the monsters, lack of body armor etc. <br/><br/>As a movie this really doesn't produce. The characters are one-dimensional. They aren't real enough to care about. This feels more like a feature length cartoon than major motion picture. I also had to laugh at Leonidas talking about freedom and standing against tyrants. The Spartans had whole tribes under their thumbs as slaves (Helots) and Leonidas' title can be interpreted as tyrant. As a history buff I have major problems with the story but that's why I say to remember it's based on a graphic novel. <br/><br/>The movie is stunning to look at. Snyder's movies all look great but most (excepting The Watchmen) have little in the way of character development or a full-fledged story.<br/><br/>As to why the Spartans don't wear armor, I guess it's so Snyder can give the ladies a little beefcake to watch and forget about the story."

I remember I collected the comics in Strasbourg (1999) and was absolutely speechless with the art and colors: it really looks like Hellenic art with brown, yellow tones.<br/><br/>Now, comes the movie and I was sure it kicks ass as well because the director had delivered a perfect adaptation with ""Watchmen"". This guy really understand what is an adaptation: this isn't about retelling a story, nor adding personal comments about it. As he said in the making-of, there's no place for filter and Miller has been every day on the set because they kept opening and browsing the comics to analyze every frame of it.<br/><br/>Fom the opening credits, it's a pleasure to see that Miller's work has been moved 100% on the screen: the colors, the pencils, the wardrobe, everything thing you saw on a panel is alive! Amazing! The cast was unknown so far for me but they are great: Leana Headey is impressive: her formidable charisma helps a strong willed queen and comforting wife. Gerald Butler is terrific as he reminds me of Pacino! <br/><br/>Now, we can talk about the story: I remember that there was a huge debate with some readers complaining about Miller's depicting Athenians as boy lovers. This sentence has been kept in the movie and don't make such a fuss. On the opposite, the movie is now seen as a clash of civilization: the west, holder of liberty against the east, decadent and pervert. Well, I got Greek friends who didn't find accurate the Xerces army portrayal. Personally, this story is about courage and bravery and the price to keep liberty, whatever or whoever the threat comes from.

"TheUnknown837-1","7","5","7","15 September 2009"," the most enjoyable unintentionally funny movie I've seen in a long time
","Of all the ways to film the story of the three hundred Spartans who faced off against thousands of Persians at Thermopylae in 480 B.C., I guess the only way it should be told is in an exaggerated, bloody, thunderous battle epic style with severed limbs flying through the air and rivers of blood pouring over a battlefield. Another, much better medieval epic that took this approach was Mel Gibson's Oscar-winner ""Braveheart"" in 1994. But whereas ""Braveheart"" did this in an artistic style, ""300"" does it to the point where even the high-intensity bloody battle sequences do not become harrowing or heart-pounding, but rather a little silly.<br/><br/>This is one of the most outlandishly over-exaggerated movies I've seen in a long time. It's so pompous and over the top, perhaps because it was based too much on the Frank Miller graphic novel that merely used the true story of Leonidas the 300 Spartans as inspiration. In the end, I did enjoy the movie, but not in the way that I believe the filmmakers wanted me to. I found the movie to be unintentionally funny because of the way it exacerbates with the clich√©s of his genre, but it is truly one of the most entertaining unintentionally funny movies that I've seen in a long time.<br/><br/>Visually, ""300"" is a real treat. It's hilariously over-pumped lighting and CGI effects give it a real video-gamey appearance. The movie also puts this together with dialogue is that is absurdly corny such as Gerard Butler screaming ""This is Sparta!"" before kicking a Persian messenger, who falls in super-slow motion down into a pit. That's another thing I might as well poke fun at. Looking at ""300"", I oftentimes wonder if perhaps the director, Zack Snyder had made the movie and then realized that it was an hour too short and the only way to make it reach the intended length was to convert half the movie not only into slow motion, but *really slow motion. There's a scene where the Persians are riding toward Sparta and it takes about ten seconds for a horse to complete his stride. This scene, coupled with the corny narration, really stirs a generous chuckle from the audience.<br/><br/>Also exaggerated are the battle sequences and the way the Spartans not only fight against Persians, but giants, men with giant blades for arms, and mutant men who look and sound more like the Urak-hai from the Lord of the Rings trilogy. The Persian king, Xerxes is comically portrayed by Rodrigo Santoro, who is graphically enlarged to the point where disbelief cannot be suspended and he is clad in so much glitter makeup and his voice run through a base amplifier so much that one cannot help but laugh at him instead of fearing or condemning him like they would have the real Xerxes.<br/><br/>One might assume from the way I've been poking fun at ""300"" in my review that it was too cornball for my taste. But no, again, I had fun with the movie. I enjoyed it and there were some truly powerful moments, but the movie was just so exacerbated and over the top, maybe too much for its own good, that one cannot help but laugh and make jokes at it. And besides, maybe this movie will inspire good soldiers, for the Spartans were brilliant and powerful warriors and from what I saw in ""300"", all you need to be a Spartan, is have a six-pack, wear lots of baby oil on your skin, and be able to scream at the top of your lungs. Potentially, according to this film, half the people I know could be Spartans. Isn't that something?"

However, I was never bored, if nothing else the film is stunning to look at and you find yourself staring at the screen open-mouthed because you can't quite believe the special effects can look so perfect.

The 300 hold off an immense Persian army commanded by king Xerxes(Rodrigo Santoro), over 100.000, though the famous historian Heredoto, possibly excessive, wrote they were 1.700.000. Meantime in Sparta are happening intrigues surrounding the Greek council whose protagonists are the Queen, Theron(Dominic West) and a loyalist(Stephen McHatti). A hunchbacked wanna-be warrior, actually a local shepherd, named Ephialtes(Andrew Tiernan) informed Persians of a hidden way that could utilize to besiege the Spartans. The impact of the battle was enormous , as the Hellens lost their fright for the Persians and led by Themistocles created their proper defense and allowing the Greek city states organize their own army and retain the fearful enemy. Ultimately the Persians are vanquished in the battles of Salamina, Platea and Mycala.<br/><br/>Violent movie blends historic events, drama and breathtaking fights .Every little scene has been given maximum detail, as gowns, environment and set design, adding too much computer generator backgrounds and lush frames. Colorist and glimmer cinematography by Larry Fong. Vibrating and shaking musical score by Tyler Bates. This excellent picture is stunningly directed by Zack Snyder who after made a similar experiment with Watchmen. Another adaptation about this historic tale are : the classic version ,the Lion of Sparta, by Rudolph Mate with Richard Egan as Leonidas and Ralph Richardson as Themistocles; and a phenomenal documentary, The Last stand of the 300, produced by History Channel which is totally necessary seeing it along with 300. The film will like to epic deeds enthusiastic and history lovers. Rating : Extraordinary and above average."
"albert-wayne","1","22","44","1 April 2007"," One of the Worst movies Ever Made.
","If the epic genre had a downfall with films like Troy and King Arthur, 300 managed to sink it all the way to the bottom. This has got to be one of the worst attempts of epic movie making of all time. I feel sad that most likely, more and more films will resemble 300.<br/><br/>However, I don't know what depresses me even more, that movies like this get made, or that audiences flock in huge numbers to see them, and claim that they are the best films ever made.<br/><br/>This film is clearly a film for the generation of the 90s, dumb, numbed out idiot kids who what simple, packaged movie, where image and action are more important elements, rather than story, emotion, character and drama.<br/><br/>I think now I should clarify something, I'm 21 years old, and I'm a film student, so no, the argument that ""I didn't understood the film cause I'm old"" does not apply. And for the record, I enjoyed Sin City, but more on that later.<br/><br/>Now, regarding the film. If you've seen the trailer, you've seen the movie. Because plot wise, you get everything from the trailer, 300 Spartan soldiers take on gargantuan invasion force from Persia. That's pretty much all that happens.<br/><br/>The characters fall under every superficial clich√© character from the epic genre, a character is introduced and remains the same all the way through the movie. Such reflects incredibly poor writing. There's just no drama between any character, no conflict, either interior or exterior. Basically a bunch of grunts fighting over other ""grunts"".<br/><br/>I say ""grunts"" because, one of the things it did not expect was Spartans fighting Persian Orcs lead by a Street Fighter like Dhalsim with homosexual tendencies. Which is the big flaw of the movie as well, the Production Design. The movie sets up a somewhat realistic, if historically inaccurate but realistic world nonetheless. But then we have a Gollum creature, Persian Orcs as the enemy. It's not consistent with what the story sets up.<br/><br/>Another flaw in the writing is the fact that the whole movie relies on a boring, simple minded voice over that seems more like Spartan propaganda. The same voice over repeating either what you see in the image, or simple stating ""We are Spartans, we are bad, what you gonna do when we come for you?"". Moreover, the voice over makes an incredible mistake, being a witness voice over like in Million Dollar Baby, but narrating events that the witness never actually witnesses, like the final confrontation.<br/><br/>The movie also fall into a huge suspension of disbelief. You don't buy into anything that you are shown, you start to believe that even the actors are fake. And the battle sequences are so over done with the now clich√© slow motion, that you just don't buy into the action. This affects the film because, the audience gets so detached that you don't care for any character, or for the outcome of the scene.<br/><br/>The film makes the terrible mistake of trying too much to impress with it's visuals, but they become so over done, that you don't feel like you are watching a movie, or getting a story, you feel like seeing a video game, and a bad one play out in front of you.<br/><br/>It has been argued that the filmmakers wanted to make a faithful adaptation of the graphic novel. But that is no excuse, this is not the first time movies have adapted a story from another medium, and in the past, filmmakers have understood that film has it's own way of telling a story, and things have to be altered, changed and re invented in order to work on film. This is a perfect example on how not to adapt something from another medium into film. The excuse of ""it's faithful to the comic"" simple does not work at the end.<br/><br/>The film remains just as a display of expensive CGI, and glorified battle gore. You cannot care less for the outcome of the battle. It's also funny that despite being a force of 300, you only see a couple of guys do all the work. And at the end, the movie takes itself so incredible serious, that the over done violence becomes hilarious, but there's a catch, unlike Kill Bill, here the violence is not supposed to make you laugh. Hence, it's a failure, I don't know what is funnier, Gerard Butler killing Persian Orcs and Trolls in slow motion, or the slow motion flying of an Eddie Murphy look alike with a smile on his face.<br/><br/>I know that I'm gonna be accused of dumb and ignorant, that I failed to see the greatness of this masterpiece, and let them say what they want. You must face the fact that the people who like this movie don't describe it as good, but as cool, ""cool"" is a phenomenon that existed in school, but this wave of ""cool"" movies, started primarily by the Matrix has reached new level of mediocre movie making with 300. Face it, this movie appeals to the low brow culture of ""cool, I want cool movies"".<br/><br/>Lets hope that the massive deploy of publicity for 300 dies out soon, and that people quickly forget about it. Because, there's really nothing important to remember from it."

","This film is kind of mix of the films: ""Brave heart"" , ""Gladiator"" and The ""Lord of the ring"". The drama features are similar to Gladiator. Continuing the fight after a dramatic lose is look like brave heart. And the Persian army are look like ORKs in ""The Lord of The Ring"". The producers knew that they are speaking about a historical war that Spartans were the loser of that, but they tried to bring back hope to the audiences by ending it like ""brave heart"" (against the history),although, the most advantage of that 300 Spartans was their strategic situation and by losing that position ... .<br/><br/>Besides, some fights were very funny especially the scenes that they fight with Persian heavy army for example elephants lead to valley with out any problem and another monster was killed just by one hit.<br/><br/>It was clear that the director tried to zoom in dramatic and heroic features in order to attract more audiences and in this way (attracting more) he changed many historical matters in this war for example Persians in that time hadn't any slaves but in a scene a Persians guy said that we will get your wives and children as slaves!!!<br/><br/>The director even changed the style of Persian king like Egyptian style and the Persian commanders like Arabians.And by the whole of these changes I don't know why they use the name of Persian for such army and king which were in opposite of history, at least I think we should reject it's genre:""history""."
"exeter86","2","35","75","15 March 2007"," Prepare for stupidity
","Now I have to admit this is not my kind of movie. At all. I went to see it with an open mind. But what can I tell you? The dialogue is totally absurd and laughable. The visuals are very flat and monotonous. I have no real problem with violence but I do not find it endlessly fascinating either. How much art-directed CGI blood do I have to see? It got quite boring. But the biggest problem is that the movie has no soul, no beating heart, no characters to care about, none really to hate. I was watching the never-ending battle thinking, ""Is there any way they can both lose?"" The plot, and I use the term lightly, didn't even make sense. All in all, 300 was one of the most intensely stupid movies I have ever seen and a total waste of time."
"murlat","4","18","35","29 March 2007"," No standing ovations at all
","I also was among those people who were allowed to see the world premiere at the Berlin Film Festival. I had a press accreditation, so I could see the movie at the press screening in the afternoon, a few hours before the actual premiere at Berlinale Palast in the evening.<br/><br/>My experience was quite different: we didn't need to have the presentation interrupted since instead of standing ovations there was laughter and many people already left the scene during the screening. At the end, some of the remaining people booed it out, only some others applauded. The main part of the audience might have felt like I did: big expectations, a big movie on a big screen, galleons of blood, but inside the whole thing there isn't enough meaning to fill a bottle of beer. It's a great show for those who loved the graphic novel, I guess, but for the rest of mankind the movie will be one of those you will not miss in case you do."

I love these kind of movies, brains on zero and just enjoy the spectacle. i go to the movies to be entertained, not to cry or think. this was a great entertaining movie, the action scenes were great, the heroism was great. it reminded me somewhat (not in terms of story) of The Matrix and Gladiator, unrealistic heroism with spectacular fights and special effects. It was also amazing how time flies when your in the theater watching this movie, i thought it was going for about an hour but when i looked at my phone it was almost 1 hour and 45 minutes going.

"m-ozfirat","1","6","9","1 March 2014"," Mien Kampf meets Classicism
","First of all i am not just pointing out the historical errors of this film as everyone even those who do not know history knows it happened and its been exaggerated. However it will influence the unconscious audience point of view on the Greco-Persian wars in to a political outlook rather then historical understanding making it seem the film is propagandist with imperialist intentions that reflect today America's 19th century style foreign policy. The film is based upon a comic which is the ultimate insult to injury for any intelligent person or a modern Persian. Just in case you can't find Persia look at Modern Iran. <br/><br/>Hollywood has a tradition of mocking all things middle eastern for a political objective to morally idealise and make themselves seem more superior to the of the Middle East - at least Asia e.g China gets some basic respect but non to the former. A film was made in 1962 about this battle of the same name but at least that was a good costume drama despite its oriental message this one is absolutely vile but they both have the same objective as Greece is seen as the forbearer to the modern West <br/><br/>The Persians were the first globalist empire in history that had regional autonomy, multi- cultural, Humanitarianism as shown on the Cyrus cylinder and no slavery or racism. Ancient Greece despite their greatness was built upon slavery and had customs we would be outraged by such as infanticide and other social and sexual costumes to outrage. Plus they were not fighting for liberty but to protect their own interests. Sparta was the North Korea of it's day and although Athens had democracy it was not ideological freedom but political practicality. in short this is jingoistic propaganda, supremacist, imperialistic and a corruption of history but thats historical ""epics""."
"Chrysanthepop","Null","6","9","13 November 2011"," Fake Spartans and Fake Persians Fight In CGI
","Zack Snyder's '300' seems to have received mixed opposing responses. There are those that praise it to the point of calling it one of the greatest epics and those that have labelled it as trash. Anyway, let's start with the good point. Most noticeable would be the dazzling visuals. The emphasis on the colour contrast is a tad overdone but the editing and execution of the battle sequences are amazing. However, the use of slow motion is overdone and needs to be toned down. The art direction and makeup department deserve special mention. The cinematography is excellent. The use of CGI is very apparent especially when in motion. Storywise, the writing is pretty simple. It's pretty much the typical epic war story, nothing outstanding. Of course there are historical inaccuracies. Of the cast, Dominic West and Lena Headey are terrific. Gerard Butler and David Wenham are passable.<br/><br/>While it is 'pretty' to look at, there isn't much that the viewer takes away from '300' long after the closing credits have rolled because it doesn't have anything new to offer or anything that makes it especially stand out."

","I found this to be such a horrible movie. Even some would be redeeming aspects were spoiled by what I can only view as a brainless macho dumbness that might be cool as seen by a deeply troubled and hopelessly confused teenager.<br/><br/>I will grant that I cannot appreciate the good parts of this movie (that would be the action parts) because I cannot let go of its dumb side. I like lots of brainless action movies. They are fun, and provide rest for my poor tried brains when they need it. But this one I could not swallow.<br/><br/>I also like comics. This is a movie about a comic book, and many have been done before and since that I could live with or even thought were great. Maybe a comic book (and a movie based on a comic book) should exaggerate heroism and that sort of thing, but this is taken so so sooo far out that it's just plain silly, in my opinion.<br/><br/>I just can't swallow it. It is so bad and seemingly pretentious it's ridiculous. This was a flop!"
"Soujiro","5","6","9","31 August 2007"," One of the Best So-Stupid-It's-Funny Movies of the Year!!!
","Watched as a comedy, 300 is not bad, but they should have put in more funny scenes. I won't spoil the magic, but we were all cracking up when the mutant ninjas appeared. It's as if the film makers were so scared that all the half-naked men might give the audience the wrong idea about the Spartans, that they turned the Hetero up to 11. At first I was offended, but the homo/xenophobia is so over-the-top, it becomes absurdly funny.<br/><br/>Twelve Things I learned from the movie: <br/><br/>1) Spartans are kind of like Scottish football players except that they all shave their chests and don't wear shirts... wait, I guess they're exactly like Scottish football players.<br/><br/>2) If anyone is effeminate, nonwhite, a lesbian, or physically unattractive, they are an enemy of freedom or a slave.<br/><br/>3) Wearing underwear is only for evil people like hunchbacks and God-kings. The army of freedom goes commando.<br/><br/>4) Throwing your only weapon is a good battle strategy, as is slowing time and teleporting from one location to another. (I knew this from other funny action movies though) <br/><br/>5) The aesthetic style of car commercials from the early 90's is the new cutting edge of action cinematography unless there are women in the shot, then you should shoot it like a perfume commercial from the early 90's.<br/><br/>6) Rhinos and elephants are easy to ship, easy to train, and very easy to kill.<br/><br/>7) Spartan cloaks never get dirty unless you are returning from a son-avenging murderous rampage. <br/><br/>8) Spartan cloaks have the power to summon wind if the wearer utters a corny line. Protip: Louder and cornier lines produce a stronger wind.<br/><br/>9) The sight of a toppling decapitated body can be surprisingly funny if the body belongs to a character you know nothing about and the entire scene happens in sloooooow moooootion.<br/><br/>10) Ru Paul blew most of his Godking evil henchmen budget on fancy masks for his elite army of mutant ninjas and forgot to check their resumes for evidence of any actual fighting skill.<br/><br/>11) People who kill innocent women and children are savage enemies of reason and justice, but people who kill innocent babies are reasonable and just champions of freedom. <br/><br/>12) ""Well-written action movie script"" (or video game or comic book) still means laugh-out-loud cheesiness during every dramatic scene.<br/><br/>So, while it doesn't quite top The Mummy Returns for unintentionally hilarious nonsensical action, it's a close second. I predict that this movie will score well with male gamers, adolescent boys, and ultra conservative patriarchs. I know it was based on a comic, but really now, it's like an allegory for the War on Terror written by a confused twelve year old. If you're looking for quality even on par with the mediocre Gladiator, keep looking. 5/10 <br/><br/>P.S. Make sure you watch the credit roll for the multiple evil transsexual Asian roles (I thought transsexual Asian #3 did an excellent job)."

","If going to the movies in 2007 has taught us anything so far - besides that Nicolas Cage should send his agent to one of Eli Roth's hostels, that Tarantino still refuses to make anything other than glorified B-movies, and that numbers still aren't scary no matter how much a wild-eyed Jim Carrey tries to convince us of it - it's that ""Spartan"" must be Greek for ""Speedo"". Seriously, was anyone in this movie wearing a shirt? I haven't seen so many half-naked men since I went to that topless bar in Thailand a while ago. Still, being the endlessly tolerant and open-minded person that I am, I had no problem with the raging homoerotic nature of the film - I did sit through Batman and Robin without problems. What did bug me was how boring the whole bloated thing was. Two hours of comic book dialogue spliced with ridiculously brief action scenes and a Gerard Butler who looks and sounds like he just stumbled in from a System of a Down concert, just after a brief visit to ZZ Top's hairdresser. In a Speedo.<br/><br/>The one thing this dullsterpiece has going for it is obviously its visual style, which is often striking. However, call me a hopeless ADD case if you wish, but I need a movie to be more than just pretty to look at if I'm going to follow it for almost two hours. For a movie with no plot besides one gigantic battle, there is a suspiciously small amount of battling! It's like being trapped in a video game for an hour and a half before you find the ""attack"" button. Not that there's anything terribly wrong with movies imitating video games, but I prefer when it's the other way around. Interestingly, the dialogue and character development of 300 is somewhat on par with that of Super Mario World, minus the charisma of Yoshi. I was wondering when Xerxes would reveal his secret collection of mushrooms (how else do you think he got so abnormally tall?).<br/><br/>Anyway, despite being hyped as an all-out action-fest so violent it would give Michael Bay epileptic seizures, 300 is so dull you'll be squirming in your seat. It's a Greek tragedy in the sense that it's tragic that a stylized, cheesy action flick for repressed geeks can be classified as a masterpiece these days. Are we really this starved for entertainment? <br/><br/>Well, at least I learned a new word. I would earnestly suggest that you do not watch this film, unless you want to have some laughs at how ridiculously overblown and convinced of its own greatness it is. The average score I gave it is only because of the visuals and the half-naked ladies."

","Before, during and after watching this movie I realize this movie was made with just one purpose - to entertain. No social messages, no character study. Just plain fun. Well, maybe not so plain, but sure as hell lots of fun.<br/><br/>I have not read the book; hence I am not in a position to judge how true the movie stays to the book - in look or in feel. Watching the movie in itself is such a wonderfully visceral and testosterone¬ñfuelled experience that it stands for itself apart from the book.<br/><br/>In essence, Snyder has taken the elemental attraction from what was Blade's Blood-Bath or Matrix' Security Shoot-out and made an entire movie out of it. Over-done? Heck no. Exhausting? Heck Yeah!<br/><br/>The movie depicts the Battle of Thermopylae in 480 B.C of 300 Spartans that held the Persian Army of thousands for three days (giving Greece enough time to raise their own army for defense) before falling, but told in Frank Miller's heavily-exaggerated and violently Politically Incorrect style. Gerard Butler plays the bearded, screaming Spartan King.<br/><br/>The exaggerations of Spartans into Herculean warriors and of Persians (and their army) into grotesque mutant abominations are as much a part of fictionalized and stylized story-telling as are the fantastic beauty-enhanced visuals. From the expansive use of Slow-motion (most of the movie was shot at high-speeds between 50-150fps vs a norm of 24fps) and painting the movie in shades of only three colors (Black to White, Yellow to Brown, Red) to the extensively choreographed battle moves and formations ¬ñ this movie does not have a single frame that does not look like an art-still. And as a story-teller, Snyder (or Miller?) spins his tales large but roots it firmly within the world realized in the movie with a dramatic voice-over by David Wenham (much like his Faramir of the LOTR trilogy). And the movie has some amazing dialogues - as dramatic and exaggerated as everything else within the movie. (Xerxes: Cruel Leonidas demanded that you stand. I require only that you kneel.) Snyder has set a new bench-mark for stylized visuals with this movie ¬ñ something that tends to be set too often now-a-days. But upping the ante can only bring better things to us as viewers. 300 is exactly what it set out to be. Looking for historical facts, trying to tie it down to current events or expecting deeper meaning within this fun-fest is being fool-hardy."

Because this looks to me as a personal opinion, not one taken by a critic. You don't like war movies? You saw Alexander or Troy and you have the impression that all movies are like that? Good for you, but you're wrong. This movie is, by far, a masterpiece. As somebody said, ""a couple of comments ago"", this movie, along side Lord of the Rings, is the bridge to the new world. The bridge to a whole new level of special effects, a whole new level of movies. The fact that it presents a part of history which hasn't been seen in movies too often doesn't make it a bad movie. The fact that people have their own opinions about what happened at Thermopylae doesn't make it a bad movie. And i must say that it has been a while since i have seen a movie this beautiful.<br/><br/>And i'm not talking about the special effects. I'm talking about the actors. Gerald Butler made the role of his life. I saw many of his films, i saw him in ""Phantom of the Opera"" as well. But here his acting is beautiful. You can see in his eyes the anger, the rage, or the sadness. The whole movie is built around him. And the expectations were big, because in a movie as big as ""300"", you can't make any mistakes because the critics will eat you alive. And i must say that he played amazing.<br/><br/>The fight scenes. I must admit it, i'm a huge fan of fight scenes. But not exactly the blood, the carnage. I'm a huge fan of the moments before a fight scene. The pump-up speech, the preparations and the beginning of the battle (that's why i LOVED the moment when the Rohan riders attacked the Orcs in ""Lord of the Rings: Return of the King"")...And this movie was perfect from this point of view. The battle scenes were, like barb1140 said, like a dance. It was like a choreography. Beautiful, absolutely beautiful. And the slowing down made it even more interesting.<br/><br/>This movie is by far, a masterpiece. It has a 8.6 user rating, when Godfather, the highest movie has a 9.1. This is a one of a kind movie. It has everything, it isn't just a war movie, it is a movie about friendship, about something that bonds men in the army, that makes them stand ground even in front of thousands of enemies.

When they did have it, unlike a lot of other films, the carnage didn't go on and on.

","I saw the open-captioned film ""300"" with the numerous deaf and hard of hearing audience patrons Friday night. I remember snatching a glance at the deaf man with his acquaintance sitting on the left row to my right center. He imitated the on-screen roar of Spartan war cry ""AROOOOO!"" with a specialized sign a few times throughout the film.<br/><br/>I was bemused by this behavior. Not that audience patrons' silly impression matter. What matter is the effect 300 the movie have on the receptive audience's attitude in the current situation. The timing couldn't be more fortuitous than the release of 300 as the new Western war approach upon Iran/Syria's sovereignty.<br/><br/>I separate art from politics regardless. I saw Apocalypto and came away amazed. I saw The Pianist and felt its haunting surreal effect. I saw 300 and came away disappointed and a little disturbed by its bellicose message alternating with the reason for the need to preserve freedom while expounding ultra-nationalist fervor.<br/><br/>What's good about 300 is that the film apparently very faithful to the source material, even taking dialogue verbatim from the comic pages. But whereas the film's panel-to-film adaptation is commendable, it's quite a tedious experience with barely sustainable character development that consist of few raw emotions and bizarre directorial choices in making the battles and dramatic moments emulate the look and feel of flashy music videos.<br/><br/>I know Zack was a music video director, as are the handful of established movie directors of similar background. At least David Fincher wasn't stupid in being tacky to pull the hyper-actively frenzied crank up, crank down & slo-mo editing gimmick. 300 movie is all style and less substance because of this. And there are way too many slow motion scenes that's incredibly annoying and induced me to let out barely stifled yawns.<br/><br/>I enjoyed Frank Miller's graphic novel years ago, but the movie adaptation (the filmmakers insist it is an exact interpretation of the originating material) feel underwhelming and strangely languid.<br/><br/>Worth mentioning is the unvarnished truth this movie represent the following credo -- unapologetically racist in fostering xenophobia with the jingoistic zeal, virulent condemnation of the ""weak & disabled"" by forced ostracizing with justified termination utilized according to the Nurture/Nature way of Darwin law and fascistic-ally militaristic that would make Hitler, Mussolini, General Patton (whom I greatly admire, in spite of his unorthodox view) & Air Force General & demented Cold Warrior (an advocate of nuclear war, I kid you not) Curtis LeMay proud.<br/><br/>I don't blame Frank Miller, the author of the graphic novel, even if he happens to be a misanthrope as alleged. The comic is separate from the film as Mr. Miller creates the work of *art* for the readers to evaluate. The movie as well as graphic novel are merely re-telling of the true event of the Spartans' last stand at the Battle of Thermopylae that exemplify patriotic duty, ferocious loyalty and unsurpassable towering valor.<br/><br/>I object to the movie vision of 300 because it is in effect an endorsement of unrealistic high-octane, stone-cold emotionless (except anger & rage, if that's all there is) machismo to place the impossible test on the definition of manhood (the culprit behind bullying & hazing in school & life) and ultra-nationalistic militarism with less logic in foresight and diplomatic reason before the last option.<br/><br/>Zack Synder, Mark Canton and co-screenwriters Kurt Johnstad & Michael Gorden have no shame for producing what may be the most pervasive propaganda since Triumph of the Will, the infamous documentary. There are certain analogies between 300 the movie and the vintage 1935 b&w film. Their claim (Zack, especially) that the film is not intended to be a geopolitical allegory is bunk.<br/><br/>The analogy is so unmistakable that I wonder whether the filmmakers took notes during a video viewing.<br/><br/>I believe in rational patriotism and humanitarian reason as the wise philosophers of the ancient and romantic periods decree. Nationalistic pride is healthy whereas ultra-nationalism only blind that cause ill-considered choices which will change the course of human civilizations in affected continent/regions as well as mankind's destiny.<br/><br/>Because of how I perceive the message of the movie from a historical (though 300 is essentially a work of fiction based on real events and figures) and political standpoint -- trying hard as I can to be impartial -- the movie is an utterly distasteful type of propaganda that cater to the brutish instinct of the enthusiastically receptive audience patrons as some positive reviews below demonstrate.<br/><br/>This could be one of the reasons that help sell the new, more expensive American war on the present Islamic Republic of Iran as a ""psyop"". Real history matter so we learn from it to apply the lessons for the security and welfare of the Republic; historical fiction that strive to make the Spartans resemble gods while the other side look ugly and monstrous is indisputable propaganda.<br/><br/>The fact that the association of neo-conservative university professor of classics & Greek military history (passionate defender of Bush/Cheney's ""war on terror"") Victor Davis Hanson's extreme right-wing agenda with the book re-print ""300"" in foreword lead me to believe the filmmakers endorse fundamental militaristic way of life as the end-all answer to existing crises. <br/><br/>Denying that this film isn't political at all is plain lying. Frank Miller is spared, but the rage-filled jingo filmmakers are to be admonished for pursuing the subconscious agenda to top the cream whip with the cherries of bellowing melodramatic theatrics, stylized violence and flashy cinematic gimmicks to produce the most peculiar and magnificent propaganda film in recent times.<br/><br/>A nauseating (not gore but shrill tone) and weirdly disturbing experience for the politically astute, indeed.<br/><br/>One star out of **** <br/><br/>Zack, Mark & co, you need to wake up from your hatefully caustic stupor."

","300 was gorgeous to look at and if you're going to see it, see it on the big screen. The star of this movie was the post-production work, in probably Final Cut and After Effects, and that was amazing and made me drool. Acting was perfectly fine and unobjectionable.<br/><br/>The screenplay was CRAP and its writers should be beaten with bamboo poles and never allowed to write anything without supervision again. Characters give huge, stupid speeches telling you exactly what you should feel, as though it weren't obvious enough, and could have easily shortened it by having them say directly to the camera, ""Insert very long John Wayne-ish diatribe here,"" and not made any difference in the effect it had at all, except to save time. A couple of characters did extremely irritating things that were COMPLETELY out of their character which did nothing for the story or the movie, not in the comic and not in history and I couldn't think of why they put that in. I really can't complain about the crappy writing strongly enough, it really is VERY bad. This is the worst writing I've seen since ""The Black Dahlia,"" maybe worse.<br/><br/>Plus for heterosexual women and homosexual men, the best beefcake movie I've ever seen. Faramir, rockin' abs. :o <br/><br/>All in all, very disappointing. I have to dig out the comic as I don't remember it being this bad."

","Perhaps this is the history major in me talking, but when I go to see any war film, especially a movie on one of the most epic battles of all time, I expect a little more than men running around in underwear stabbing ogres with what appears to be an attempt to make lord of the rings believable. Zack Snyder has essentially taken Braveheart, replaced Mel Gibson with an English Arnold Swarchenneger, and taken out the real world the viewer relates to and replaced it with a surrealistic CG world that looks like they are in the middle of a video game. I give the movie 4 stars instead of none because granted, the numerous fight scenes were certainly gory and enjoyable, and as a teenage boy I cant help but like blood, gore and sex in a war movie, especially when appropriate, like in the story of Thermopylae. But the idea of making the entire movie CG was completely ridiculous and added to my main complaint with the movie: Zack Snyder and Frank Miller were handed a story that in itself is incredible, that 300 men (800 with Arcadians) could stop a huge force of Persians for three days, only to be betrayed by a Greek. Make that film, and you have a great action film. But to make that story surreal by utilizing monsters and demons from the east not only detracts from the credibility of a true event, but in effect cheapens the story of Thermopylae forever. The CG graphics of Sin City worked very well for Sin City and fictional action films. But keep that garbage out of my war movies that have potential to be historically accurate. I am not saying that a director should have no freedom to be inaccurate in war movies, I am simply pointing out that the amount Zack Snyder was historically inaccurate in this movie likened him to a bull in a china shop, wrecking an already lovely plot. Maybe if I were drunk at the movie I would have enjoyed it more."

","From the call of the battle horns to the thousands of soldiers armed with weapons backed up by a heavy but effective soundtrack in the background to the scintillating special effects, ""300"" may look like another long-winded endless sagas of barbaric battles, endless bodies piling up and lots of red oozy blood for visual splendor. From observing the trailer those scenes that remained attached in your memory will manipulate you into driving out to see the movie or renting the DVD, but the best part is that the trailer is just glance of things to come. <br/><br/>Unlike other movies that only feature the good scenes or edit out scenes and scary moments leaving you bored to death with too much talk and not enough action, ""300"" gives you more than what you've bargained for. The battle scenes are complimented with an equally compelling plot with some great acting by the cast. It goes beyond any mindless blood-laden movies from the past and present. Sure there's blood, but it exceeds many obstacles many Hollywood films fail to achieve.<br/><br/>For those historical gurus who have complained that the movie sparked no significant accuracy,should just keep their noses in the books instead of dissecting every little inaccuracy there is. And besides how much accuracy is there in history books? After all we're not immortal so facts may have changed overtime. Not to put anyone down, but if you want accuracy, I watched a documentary on the Discovery Civilization channel that reveals actual scriptures that indicate Gods, Oracles and millions of people crossing the seas to take part in the battles. To me this movie goes way beyond a costume drama, even some of their sayings in Spartan times were dictated the way the could have spoken at that time.<br/><br/>The visual effects is pure eye-candy and the background music is quite creepy and compliments itself through every scene featured. What more can you want? If this movie doesn't satisfy the average viewer than what does? This one movie you should enjoy and leave your historical analysis in the classrooms."
"cinephex","2","11","20","9 August 2016"," A Great Film for Stupid People... Not for Anyone Else
","If you actually like this movie, perhaps it's time to reevaluate your life.<br/><br/>Within a couple of minutes, it's apparent that 300 has nothing to offer but a slick new (for the time) aesthetic and some almost hilariously bad blood and violence. The writing is abysmal. The acting is absolutely horrendous. There is no historical accuracy, whatsoever. There is no realism, and there is nothing about the lack of realism that redeems its absence. The shallow themes running through the movie are juvenile. The direction is terrible. The cinematography is, well, OK. <br/><br/>Really, every single thing that could be screwed up in a movie is screwed up in this movie - minus the aforementioned aesthetics. 300 is over the top, and while that is not necessarily a reason to dismiss it, everything else about it is. Anyone with two brain cells to rub together should completely dismiss this steaming pile of excrement as a cinematographic failure. It should have been aborted before it hit the screen. Instead, what should have been aborted was let loose on the public, and we all know the sort of teenage frat-boy wannabes who wound up liking this. They are the sort that latch onto anything with blood and violence as a some kind of great justification for their insecurities, fragile masculinity, and moronic nationalistic tendencies. The only way this could be a more obvious ploy to appeal to bible-thumping brain-dead middle Americans would be if they'd gotten Mel Gibson to star in it and he'd wrapped himself in an American flag for two thirds of the movie. It gets one additional star for pushing Hollywood visuals in a new direction, but everything else about it is ridiculous, pathetic, immature, utterly pointless, and deserving of the lowest rating possible. The fight scenes (that make up the majority of this film) are so absurd that they might as well have been dreamed up by an 8 year old... and I think that's pretty much the greatest maturity level this film could even aspire to. Do yourself a favor and don't watch it."
"timdalton007","2","24","51","28 March 2007"," A Visually Stunning Yet Hollow Film
","Don't believe all the hype. 300 is not the great film that it has been made out to be by many viewers. While it does have some of the most stunning visuals yet done in CGI, the film is hollow in terms of its acting, writing, direction, and practically everything else.<br/><br/>The film's main draw is its amazing CGI effects. Here at least the film doesn't fail to live up to expectations. The battle sequences are incredible if one looks at them only if taken at face value. They are what kept my attention during the film and the fact that the entire film is practically nothing more then CGI is a good thing because otherwise this film would have been a complete waste. The CGI effects might be great, but they certainly can not make up for the lack of other elements in the film.<br/><br/>Everything else in the film is effectively a hollow shell. The acting is among the worst you will see in a major release though I will Gerad Butler credit for trying to make the best of the truly terrible script he was handed. What makes actors of his caliber do these types of mindless films is beyond reason. Outisde of him the entire cast should have been fired and replaced by someone a little more capable of acting. <br/><br/>The writing is horrendous. The historical battle was thrown out of the window entirely. The dialouge is every clich√© we have come to expect from any ancient epic movie Hollywood has ever produced. There is not a single memorable piece of dialouge I came out of this film with and I certainly don't plan on wasting my money to go see this again. I understand the want to bring the Frank Miller graphic novel tot the screen but do we have to throw out everything real about the battle out do it? I mean, when you are stripping warriors almost entirely out of their armor and changing battle formations just so they, in the words of director Zack Snyder, ""look cool"" then what is the point of a film? <br/><br/>The answer: none at all. <br/><br/>In short, if you are looking for some mindless action film then go see this. If you re looking for something more intelligent then avoid this film like the plague. Might I recommend waiting for this to come out on DVD and then renting it instead of wasting money by seeing it in a theater. You won't regret it."

","I was unlucky enough to have caught a screening of this as the ""Surprise Movie"" at the Dublin International Film Festival. To say that I, and the majority of the audience I spoke to (those who didn't walk out half way through) were disappointed would be an overwhelming understatement. This film just doesn't know what it is - caught between a tongue-in-cheek parody of Gladiator-type sandals & swords epics and having aspirations of being an appropriate examination of the bravery and heroics of the three hundred Spartan warriors that defeated 300,000 Persian soldiers at the Battle of Thermopylae. But, apparently this film judges its audience incapable of understanding this oh-so-complex title and merely refers to it as the ""Battle of the Hot Gate""..nice. The story itself is amazing, which makes it so disappointing that it was dealt with in this hammy-handed CGI-heavy, atrociously scripted mess. The jokes are few and far between, the violence was done ten times better in other Frank Miller-inspired creations such as Sin City and the acting (with the exception perhaps of Lena Headey who impresses as the tough Spartan Queen Gorgo) is cringe inducing. Exhibit A: ""This is where we fight. This is where they die""...shrudder. Frank Miller's continued obsession with disfiguration and amputees is an equally disturbing and unappealing factor that perpetuates the feeling of queasiness the acting and dodgy effects bring about.

"shirin124","2","19","39","8 March 2007"," Distorted facts about Iran presented.
","I dislike the 300 movie because of the following reasons: It is a proved scholarly fact that the Persian Empire in 480 B.C was the most magnificent and civilized empire. Established by the Cyrus the great, the writer of the first human right declaration, Persians ruled over significant portions of Greater Iran, the east modern Afghanistan and beyond into central Asia; in the north and west all of Asia Minor (modern Turkey), the upper Balkans peninsula (Thrace), and most of the Black Sea coastal regions; in the west and southwest the territories of modern Iraq, Syria, all significant population centers of ancient Egypt and as far west as portions of Libya. Having twenty nations under control, encompassing approximately 7.5 million square kilometers, unquestionably the Achaemenid Empire was territorially the largest empire of classical antiquity Another evidence to the contrary of the brutal portrait of Persians depicted in this movie is the historical conquer of Persians over Babylon by Cyrus. On October 4th, 539 BC, the Persian Army entered the city of Babylon, which was then the capital of the Babylonian state (in central Iraq). This was a bloodless campaign and no prisoners were taken. Later, on November 9th, King Cyrus of Persia visited the city. Babylonian history tells us that Cyrus was greeted by the people, who spread a pathway of green twigs before him as a sign of honor and peace (sulmu). Cyrus greeted all Babylonians in peace and brought peace to their city. On this great event, Cyrus issued a declaration, inscribed on a clay barrel known as Cyrus's inscription cylinder. It was discovered in 1879 by Hormoz Rassam in Babylon and today is kept in the British Museum. Many historians have reviewed it as the first declaration of human rights. On this historical turning point, by order of Cyrus, all the captive nationalities held as slaves for generations in Babylon were freed and the return to their homeland was financed. Among the liberated captives were 50,000 Jews held in Babylon for three generations whose return toward the rebuilding of their temple in Palestine, a policy that was followed by Darius and his successors. Some of the liberated Jews were invited to and did settle in Persia. Because of such a generous act, Cyrus has been anointed in the Bible. He is the only gentile in the Bible, who has been titled Messiah, an is mentioned explicitly as the Lord's shepherd and his anointed (Messiah). Other references to Cyrus are attested in Isaiah 45:4 where Cyrus is called by name and given a title of honor; he is also called to rebuild the God's city and free His people (Is. 45:13) and is chosen, called and brought successful by God (Is. 48:14-15). What took place after the victory in Babylon was contrary to the standard of the time. Based on the inscriptions of the neighboring countries (Assyrians, Babylonians), it was customary to destroy the vanquished cities, level houses and temples, massacre the people or enslave the population, replace them with snakes, wolves and even carry away the soil to make the land barren. But here, peace and liberty replaced the massacre and slavery, and construction substituted for destruction. After Cyrus, his son Cambyses ruled for eight years (530BC to 522 BC) and captured Egypt, and as a sign of respect toward their culture and religion, he prostrated himself before the goddess, Meith and paid homage to Apis, the Egyptian totem (Bull). After Cambyses, Darius took over the throne and ruled form 522BC to 486BC. From 518BC to 515BC he established peace and tranquility in Egypt and also paid homage to their totem, Apis. Darius, in his inscriptions, expresses faith in the commands of Ahuramazda. He declares ""Whoever worships Ahuramazda, shall receive happiness in life and after death."" He calls Elamites faithless, and because they did not worship Ahuramazda, yet he does not pressure them to change faith. Darius exhorts his successors ""thou shalt be king thereafter, protect yourself from the lies and punish the liar and deceitful."" He entreats God's grace for the protection of Persia against rancor, enemy, famine and the lie. At times he alludes to other gods that may either indicate the old Aryan gods who still had strong followings or the gods of other nations under his rule, for the display of reverence toward their religions. <br/><br/>Furthermore, based on the Zoroastrian doctrine, it was the strong emphasis on honesty and integrity that gave the ancient Persians credibility to rule the world, even in the eyes of the people belonging to the conquered nations (Herodotus, mid 5th century B.C). Truth for the sake of truth, was the universal motto and the very core of the Persian culture that was followed not only by the great kings, but even the ordinary Persians made it a point to adhere to this code of conduct. Therefore, the movie portraits distorted and fraudulent historical facts about the Persians and the nation of Iran. REFERENCES: A.

","300 was basically Gladiator for dumb people. I watched it for free online and I still feel ripped off. The first ten minutes are okay, but then it all falls apart. Instead of sharp, emotional dialog, there's a bunch of screaming mixed in between shallow discussions of freedom which sound like they came from bumper stickers or t-shirts. And while we're on the subject of freedom, are we really to expect that a society where babies are thrown to their deaths if they are imperfect, young boys are abducted into military service at the age of 7, and girls are taken to do awkward, jerky, drugged-up dances in front of decrepit old pagan priests is a pinnacle of liberty and reason? On top of that the plot is paper thin, there is no character development to speak of, and it felt so hollow and shallow, and worst of all it takes itself too seriously. But hey, as long as it's entertaining I should be able to look past all those right? Well sadly the movie's long-touted visual effects consist of giving everything a copper tint, and slowing down every single fight. It looks like a video game, and the gimmick wears off fast. There's only so many times you can look at a guy being speared in slow-mo and still be impressed. I was just bored, and the blood and gore was so fake and gratuitous that all I cold do was laugh. Like Sin City, it was all style, no substance. Far from being the deep, powerful, original film it was marked as, the whole thing was clich√©, hollow, and silly. Though to it's credit, it did have a cool soundtrack and the actors did a nice enough job with what they had to work with. But if you want to see a good guy movie, rent ""Where Eagles Dare"" or ""The Dirty Dozen"".<br/><br/>I blame Zack Snyder for sticking too close to the source material.

The makers of this movie never made up their mind: Is this an animated comic book or a history film? Is it an war-epic movie or a fantasy-story? Shall the movie be ironic or serious? I bow to the marketing section of 300 - you guys rule!! I fell for the preview praises and the awesome trailer (where was the great music by the way?)... and now you have my money. My advice to all who haven't seen this film yet: If you love soldier dramas: Watch Black Hawk Down, you get a lot of the dialog 300 recycled and will be able to enjoy it much more. If you like fantasy: Have a Lord of the Rings-Weekend. If you love historical action: Watch Gladiator. And if you are just fond of people who are dying for their beliefs: Give Braveheart a try. 300 tried to be a little like of each of them and became an ugly homunculus. My bottom line: Don't believe the hype."

But yet I could not sit through Tomb Raider, in which he also stars, so I would say well done to a movie that kept my interest.Very action packed with a little bit of a love story mixed in. My oldest loved it because of the creatures they battled, and he absolutely won't watch anything with Gerard. So another point to it. I even was able to get my husband to watch it.

"liud2005","4","13","25","24 March 2007"," Extremely flawed but stylishly appealing
","300 was never meant to be a factual historical epic about Thermopylae but a fantasy vision of the battle as told in legend and myths. It is based on Frank Miller's artistically visionary graphic novel of the same title. The style of the graphic novel is closely mirrored by the film adaptation but unfortunately some of the more important themes seem to have have been ignored. There is a strong fascist bent to the entire film which wasn't what the graphic novel was about. Spartans were born and bred warriors no doubt but the principles and ideals they protected were just as much part of their own society as the larger Greek nations. The greater values of Greek society such as logic, philosophy, and the beginnings of free democratic republics were largely ignored or paid vague lip service in favor of mindless warfare, eugenics, and nationalism. The message it carries is flawed and it's a shame because the movie essentially rewrites its own source material in favor of mainstream American appeal. Spartans as shown to be almost invincible supersoldiers and the Persian army are hordes of mindless deformed minions of a crossdressing god-king.<br/><br/>As a fantasy epic 300 is entertaining but it doesn't address the deeper meaning in the graphic novel or even acknowledge its historical roots. The homophobic attitude of the Spartans is amusing because any historian would tell you that part of their esprit de corps involved close male bonding amongst Spartans which could be described in modern day terms as homosexuality. This is all addressed in the graphic novel but conveniently ignored here to appease the judeo-Christian white mainstream audience. As a piece of stylish art it's worth seeing but the message in the film is extremely biased."
"wytbyt-1","4","13","25","11 March 2007"," Mediocre Masquerading As Epic
","First off, I will say, this movie has potential to be great. It falls far short.<br/><br/>Lets consider the characters. They are clumsily developed and the viewer is expected to just let them slide by and to feel for their own personal plot twists. Granted, many characters in many movies develop in a similar fashion (Blondie from the Good, The Bad, and the Ugly). However, these characters are allowed to still interject with extremely awkward dialog that is often laughable and feels out of place. An example, when the traitor to Sparta is wanting to fight alongside Leonidas, Leonidas lectures on how the traitor is unable to stand in a phalanx (which the Spartans did not fight in most of the time). The traitor then throws his shield and shouts ""MOTHER! FATHER! YOU ARE WRONG."" The camera zooms in on his face ""No..Leonidas...YOU ARE WRONG!"" In the theater that I was at, half the people burst out laughing. Later, the same traitor has defected to Xerxes. Lots of nudity that, for the content of the story, was completely unnecessary. I can understand that an ugly person like the traitor would be desiring women, but it seems unnecessary for the plot. Why would he enter Xerxes encampment if he did not mean to defect? More awkward dialog follows when Xerxes speaks..""Leonidas asked you to stand...all I ask you is to KNEEEEL."" The traitor is zoomed in on and all the naked women are dancing with him. It pauses with this for a second. The traitor (who obviously was planning on defecting anyway) stipulates that he gets a command and then kneels.<br/><br/>Many, seemingly stupid, plot ""twists"" such as this, are ridiculous. The acting is mediocre and mostly unbelievable at the emotional high points. When the Spartan stands there, gaze locked with his father, he is decapitated. A clich√© father-son plot twist is occurring, seemingly without reason. It is one that is not developed at all, one is simply to assume that there have been a lack of affection because they are Spartans. In which case, the plot twist contradicts most of the patriotism and Spartan pride prominent throughout much of the movie. Back to the point: the father pulls the clich√© berserk mode, kills a few Persians, and disappears. He appears later that evening, covered in blood in dirt, speaking of how he had no regrets except telling his son he loved him (another clich√©). The tears look fake, the expression looks fake, the the dialog coming after is stupid and unimportant. This scene was another where many in the theater burst out laughing.<br/><br/>The movie contained many, many, clich√©s. I have not read the graphic novel, but I believe it probably developed the plot lines and dialog much more thoroughly. The movie, in my opinion, steals many of its plots, speeches, and artistic expressions from other movies. Braveheart, Gladiator, Lord of the Rings, and Troy all seem to be captured in this movie, albeit, condensed into a form where it is stupidly laughable. The speech Leonidas gives about their immortality feels as if it is word for word taken from Troy.<br/><br/>The nudity in this movie is another thorn in my side. A two minute dance at the oracle. A two minute sex scene after the oracle. Lots of naked women in Xerxes' tent. Xerxes tent is the only excusable nude scene, as it sets an air as Persians being immoral gluttons. The sex scene between Leonidas and his queen is, I'm assuming, attempting to illustrate a love between the two. However, two minutes of moaning while Queen Gorgo and Leonidas are in different positions fails to make one feel the romantic plot.<br/><br/>As a lover of Greek history, the inaccuracy of the movie frustrated me. Speeches by the Spartans, or any Greeks for that matter, speaking of freedom for all would have been laughable. Spartans in particular were humorous, as the Spartans were able to have every man be a warrior because slaves tended to all other profession which limited other nation's ability to prepare for war. ""Freedom isn't free""--a thought express literally and in other forms several times throughout the movie felt like a horrible political statement on modern politics.<br/><br/>As a piece of art, this movie was beautiful. It is rare, outside of children's movies, to have right and wrong illustrated so simply. The entire world was dark, implying dark times. Evil was black or looked funny. Good had six-packs or was beautiful. Watching the Persian messenger ride into Sparta, with cape flowing, and golden fields, was spine-tingling.<br/><br/>As for the battles, I imagine future movies will copy some of the techniques put forth in this movie. It was enthralling to feel the battle freeze so that you could focus on the amazing kill about to occur. Video games have been doing this for awhile, it is nice that an action movie has finally followed suit.<br/><br/>On the whole, I give the movie a three out of ten for what *I* would like to see. It has a lot of potential, but fails to deliver without key moments being awkward. Mayhap if more than sixty days were given, this might have been fixed. For the general population, a 5 or 6."

The graphics...don't even get me started. The whole thing is eye candy. Incredible fight scenes that truly top ANYTHING (and I mean ANYTHING) you've ever seen before. Incredible sets, CGi...it's just spectacular to imagine that it's ALL graphics! One of the best parts was the ""sky of arrows"", and if you haven't seen it, you'll know what I'm talking about.<br/><br/>The music is powerful and definitely helps out in fight scenes.

The audience was definitely engaged, and when<br/><br/>SPOILER SPOILER theron SPOILER SPOILER<br/><br/>dies...the audience clapped. It was awesome!! The characters are just so real and so well thought out, it's impossible to feel for their fight.<br/><br/>Gerard Butler is incredible. The work (he worked 8 hours a day for 1 year to get in shape) he put into this movie is just phenomenal. I will say there are points that he goes over the top, but in perspective, he's a war hero. He's ALLOWED to go over the top. He has true acting chops to pull off this role, and in my mind, deserves a Oscar nom for this role, then again, it's WAAAAAAAAY to early to say. Lena Headey and Dominic West also give powerful performances. <br/><br/>Overall, this is a film to watch for Oscar season next year, if for nothing else, it's incredible special effects."

","The Battle of Thermopylae is probably one of the most famous battles in ancient history, as it is often used as a prime example that the size of an army does not decide a battle. The reason for this lays in the fact that in Thermopylae, a small army of roughly 7000 Greek soldiers managed to defend themselves against the biggest army of its time, the Persians, which counted in its ranks more than 2,500,000 soldiers. While this is the main reason behind its importance, the battle has reached mythical status because it was also an example of courage, as when the battle seemed lost, most of the Greek soldiers retreated with the exception of 300 Spartans, who decided to put a tremendous last stand against their enemy. Their courage not only inspired 700 Thespians to join them, but also has inspired many notable works of art, most recently the 1962 movie ""The 300 Spartans"" and Frank Miller's 1998 comic book ""300"". Now, Miller's graphic novel is the basis of a new movie about Thermopylae: Zack Snyder's ""300"".<br/><br/>""300"" can be summarized as the tale of the Battle of Thermopylae, as narrated by a Spartan soldier named Dilios (David Wenham) to his fellow Spartans. The story begins with a brief recounting of King Leonidas' (Gerard Butler) youth, and the events that made him the courageous leader he was. Years later, as a Spartan King, he receives the news that King Xerxes of Persia (Rodrigo Santoro) is on his way to Europe, and gives the chance to Sparta to join him in his quest for conquering the world. Prefering to keep his people free instead of paying tribute to Xerxes, Leonidas refuses, and prepares himself to defend his people. However, the Spartan council has been bought by Xerxes, and refuses to allow Leonidas to go to battle with the full Spartan army. Knowing that this will be his people's doom, Leonidas decides to take with him only 300 of his best soldiers and goes to battle the enormous Asian army alone.<br/><br/>Adapted by Kurt Johnstad, Michael Gordon and Snyder himself, the movie is almost a word for word translation of Frank Miller's graphic novel, which as well was mainly based on Herodotus' writings on the subject. However, this doesn't mean that Miller's work (and the movie) is an accurate history lesson, as Miller's art takes enormous artistic liberties with the story, making the Battle of Thermopylae more mythic than realistic. While this of course may bother purists, it truly works in the context of the story (being after all the narration of a soldier), as an exaltation of the achievements of a country's army that of course demonizes its enemies. More an action film than a drama about war, the movie delivers good entertainment as the simple plot unfolds nicely despite some severe lack of character development.<br/><br/>The film's highlight is definitely the visual look that director Zack Snyder uses for his movie. Using the same digital technique than Robert Rodriguez used for ""Sin City"" (another of Frank Miller's comic books), Snyder brings Miller's graphic art to life with an extremely faithful care for details, almost putting every frame of the comic book to screen. This highly stylized visual look not only extends to digital backgrounds and special effects, Snyder's movie uses slow motion, great choreographs and a superb art direction to create an operatic narration that, just like in Miller's comic book, accentuates the mythic traits of the story, showing Spartans as super-soldiers and the Persian army as a hellish array of monsters. While completely inaccurate historically, it fits the story Snyder is trying to tell, although this extreme care for the style often makes him forget to care for the substance.<br/><br/>Now, ""300"" is without a doubt a great technical achievement and visually, a wonderful film to watch, but it has some major problems deep inside, with the performances by the cast being the top of the iceberg. While Gerard Butler has received a lot of criticism as King Leonidas, he is truly one of the best in the film, and does a really good job with what he has to work. The best in the film is David Wenham, who truly adds a lot of mood and atmosphere to the movie with his narration. Sadly, not everyone in the cast was up to the challenge, and one wonders if they were chosen for the part thanks to their physical looks instead of acting talent. Lena Headey, Michael Fassbender and Tom Wisdom are really the main offenders, who make some of the worse parts of the script look even worst with their poor delivery.<br/><br/>Personally, I think that the movie's most serious problem is the lack of characterization in the story, as Miller's simplification of the Battle made most of the characters look two dimensional at best. While it is true that Miller remained true to Herodotus and that some lines came straight from his work, it's hard to stop noticing how silly some dialogs are. True, it's an action film, but a little more of care while developing the script would had been enormously beneficial. Another problem of the film is definitely Snyder's complete focus on the visual aspect of his movie. Don't get me wrong, I know that a movie like ""300"" isn't supposed to be a powerful drama, however, Snyder's visuals tend to get pretty overwhelming, with an excessive use of slow motion that while effective at first, soon becomes a tiring gimmick.<br/><br/>While I do consider ""300"" to be a flawed film, I must say that it's pointless to judge it in terms of historical accuracy because it never attempts to be accurate and dwells more in the realms of myth. Many have criticized this aspect (as well as Miller's obvious political subtexts) without noticing that ""300"" is not here to illustrate, but to provide good entertainment, and despite all its problems, it achieves that purpose against all odds. 7/10"
"aube_de_la_douleur","5","15","30","9 March 2007"," It could have been better
","The heart of this movie is in the Spartan battle sequences. The acting was terrible, I felt no passion from any of the performances during their ""moments"", and I was especially bored when they'd ""take a breath"" from the great Spartan battle. The script of dialogue was OK at best containing mostly one-liners & unambitious speeches delivered by semi-decent actors, and the narration got pretty annoying in parts. However, I reserve most of this blame not for the actors, but for the director & screenwriter Zack Snyder who obviously has no clue on how to direct actors or write an excellent adaptation with good dialogue instead of yelling one-liners after screaming Spartans! <br/><br/>Now for the little bit of praise I have reserved for this film. All of the above aside, the battle sequences were fantastic. The stop motion is a little dizzying, but effective in enhancing the brutality of the battle. There were some scenes that were very tense & showed much promise from this production team. The cinematography in the film was way above average & the CGI special effects were used in an appropriate & awe-inspiring manner. The problem with the visual effects & the cinematography/CGI being way above par, in my opinion, exaggerated the lack of great performances from everyone with the exception of Gerard Butler, who played the role of Leonidas fabulously, but given the bad dialogue this also seemed upsetting.<br/><br/>I was very excited to see this film due to IMDb's glorious upheaval, but I'm sorry folks, but this one has definitely been highly overrated by fans & only slightly underrated by critics. This film could have been much better if the performances & the script/direction was a lot more focused instead of all the focus on the visual effects & the battle sequence, for essentially that's all this film is.

One way you can distinguish gourmet food from overripe garbage is by the smell, and I think Warner Bros reinvented AromaRama with the creation of ""300."" The story of how 300 Spartains stood against thousands of Persian troops at Thermopalye is one of the greatest stories in history. Not since the creation of Adam had there ever been such a story. Untold even in the original (and excellent) film is the degree to which the bravery of the Spartains set in motion the defeat of Persia. You see, of the thousands who invaded Greece, less than a dozen ever returned to Persia --- delivering the news of their overwhelming defeat.<br/><br/>""300"" has reduced this glorious moment to a comic book mess, with stupid looking computer generated monsters fighting the battle rather than real men, with real blood, real fears, real consequence. Hence the filmmakers have carved the heart out of the story just as Buffy cut the heart out of her beloved vampire lover Angel.<br/><br/>The 300 Spartains deserve better.

","Hi I watched this film, it was a great film but i think it is a fiction movie, because in that film the Iranian army are like barbarian and this is a big mistake. please refer to historical books to see the past of Iranian people. the entire depiction of this battle is based on fantasy. Xerxes and his army are shown as monster-like men, with attire and attitudes that can only be seen among demons. It is obvious that no research has been conducted on behalf of the studio or the writer of this supposedly epic story, and sometimes it even seems as if attempts have been made to purposefully insult ancient Persians. khashayar, son of Darius the Great and Atossa, the daughter of Cyrus the Great, was appointed King of Persia by his father because his elder half-brothers, who were born before Darius had become king, died. After his accession in October 485 BC he suppressed the revolts in Egypt and Babylon that had broken out in 486 BC and appointed his brother Achaemenes as governor or satrap over Egypt (Old Persian: khshathrapavan), bringing Egypt under very strict rule. His predecessors, especially Darius, had not been successful in their attempts to conciliate the ancient civilizations. Darius left to his son the task of punishing the Athenians, Naxians, and Eretrians for their interference in the Ionian revolt and the victory of Marathon. From 483 Xerxes prepared his expedition with great care: a channel was dug through the isthmus of the peninsula of Mount Athos, provisions were stored in the stations on the road through Thrace, two bridges were thrown across the Hellespont. Xerxes concluded an alliance with Carthage, and thus deprived Greece of the support of the powerful monarchs of Syracuse and Agrigentum. Many smaller Greek states, moreover, took the side of the Persians, especially Thessaly, Thebes, and Argos. Xerxes, with a large fleet and army (Herodotus the Greek historian claimed that there were over 5,000,000 soldiers), set out in the spring of 480 from Sardis. At first Xerxes was victorious everywhere. The Greeks were defeated at Thermopylae (Battle of Thermopylae), although at a great cost to the Persians, and a moral victory to the Greeks. Athens conquered, the Athenians and Spartans were driven back to their last line of defense at the Isthmus of Corinth and in the Saronic Gulf. At Artemisium the battle was indecisive as large storms destroyed ships from both sides. The battle was also stopped prematurely as the Greeks caught news of the defeat at Thermopylae and retreated. But Xerxes was induced by the astute message of Themistocles (against the advice of Artemisia of Halicarnassus) to attack the Greek fleet under unfavorable conditions, instead of sending a part of his ships to the Peloponnesus and awaiting the dissolution of the Greek armament. The Battle of Salamis (September 29, 480) was won by the Athenians. Having lost his communication by sea with Asia, Xerxes was forced to retire to Sardis; the army he left in Greece under Mardonius was beaten in 479 at Plataea. The defeat of the Persians at Mycale roused the Greek cities of Asia."

","It is a proved scholarly fact that the Persian Empire in 480 B.C was the most magnificent and civilized empire. Established by the Cyrus the great, the writer of the first human right declaration, Persians ruled over significant portions of Greater Iran, the east modern Afghanistan and beyond into central Asia; in the north and west all of Asia Minor (modern Turkey), the upper Balkans peninsula (Thrace), and most of the Black Sea coastal regions; in the west and southwest the territories of modern Iraq, northern Saudi-Arabia, Jordan, Israel, Lebanon, Syria, all significant population centers of ancient Egypt and as far west as portions of Libya. Having twenty nations under control, encompassing approximately 7.5 million square kilometers, unquestionably the Achaemenid Empire was territorially the largest empire of classical antiquity. Based on the Zoroastrian doctrine, it was the strong emphasis on honesty and integrity that gave the ancient Persians credibility to rule the world, even in the eyes of the people belonging to the conquered nations (Herodotus, mid 5th century B.C). Truth for the sake of truth, was the universal motto and the very core of the Persian culture that was followed not only by the great kings, but even the ordinary Persians made it a point to adhere to this code of conduct. I did not expect Warner Bros. Picture company, as one of the world's largest producers of film and television entertainment to ignore the proved obvious historical facts, and damage its own reputation by showing the Persian army at the battle of Thermopylae as some monstrous savages, and thus create an atmosphere of public mistrust in its content, and hurt the national pride of the millions of Persians while doing so.

The army is (surprise!) outnumbered, but they are (surprise!) better strategists. There are some shifty-eyed traitors (surprise!), and certain key characters will (surprise!) give their lives, driving the ones who cared about them to (surprise!) frenzied madness.<br/><br/>There are rousing speeches that an army of ten thousand can all supposedly hear, long fights that put the plot on hold for ten minutes or more, excited young warriors and crusty old ones, a leader repeatedly yelling ""Spartans!"" in an English accent (the universal ""foreign language""), and even a wheat field for a warrior to walk through. Where's Russell Crowe when you need him?<br/><br/>It's not that any of this is done carelessly or less ably. It's just that it's all been done before. Many times. Somewhere in a Hollywood library there's a book titled ""The Epic War Movie Formula"", I'm sure of it.<br/><br/>Knowing they had nothing new on their hands, Hollywood fell back on its usual methods for creating novelty out of nothing. I can hear the producers now: ""More slow-motion! More blood! More sex!"" And that's what we get. Apparently it worked: ""300"" topped the box office during its first weekend out. The showing I attended was populated with about eight people, all of us male, half of us below 35, and two of them right in front of me going ""Oooo!"" at each new death.<br/><br/>When Quentin Tarantino created ""Pulp Fiction"", he said he hoped its success would legitimize violence as an art form. His dream has come true: The fight choreography in ""300"" borders on a gruesome and ultra-bloody ballet, if ballet were set to electric guitars. This is the first film I've seen based on a Frank Miller graphic novel (highbrow term for ""comic book""), and its veneration of gore does not inspire me to rent ""Sin City"".<br/><br/>Thanks to the wonders of computer imagery we are treated to two decapitations. No need to slyly edit around the part where an actor is replaced by a headless mannequin. Now computer artists can simulate the blade going through the skin tissue and spine, leaving the slightest layer of epidermis to hold the head in place until it tears and the head tumbles to the ground while the neck compulsively spurts out the body's pressurized blood and the corpse collapses, all in glorious slow motion. If that description sounds cool to you and has you licking your lips like Joaquin Phoenix in ""Gladiator"", fine, go see ""300"". Just don't come near me or my family.<br/><br/>And certainly don't go expecting to learn any real history. Among other issues: While ""The Patriot"" consulted the Smithsonian on accurate costuming, ""300"" apparently consulted Playgirl Magazine. I had no idea ancient Sparta was so chock-full of sexy brainless men who would rather show off their pecs than wear life-saving armor!<br/><br/>While it's never a point of discussion, ""300"" would also have us believe that the heroic Spartans are the happily married heterosexuals, while any homosexuals and transsexuals are all members of the enemy Persian camp. Interesting that a movie with this unspoken prejudice would be slipping under today's Radar of Tolerance so easily.<br/><br/>So this is what modern movie making has come to. With the way the guys in the audience around me were eliciting grunts of approval over each ""awesome"" beheading or dismemberment, I figure it won't be long before we're charging admission to let people watch political dissidents and Christians get thrown to lions. I'm glad our culture has become so civilized."
"Lenz-El","10","14","28","16 March 2007"," Frank Miller should be proud!!!
","Every few years, a movie comes along and changes the way we see films!!! Star Wars, The Matrix, The LOTR Trilogy, Sin City etc. And 300 is one of those movies!! Never has a film been so visually stunning that sometimes you can't help but stop watching the actors just to examine the incredible backgrounds that seem to come to life!! One of my favorite scenes would have to be the oracle scene where a Spartan woman dances to see the future for Sparta!! It's an erotic and beautiful scene with amazing lighting and effects that are top notch!!! The plot for 300 is simple and straight forward, The Persian leader Xerxes plans to control the nation of Sparta, but Sparta being the brave and cocky nation, the King of Sparta wages war with only 300 Spartans to defend his nation. Of course, after being told the odd are against him by his own people, the King still leads his men to what he believes is a battle of freedom. The performances in this film are strong, the best being Gerald Butler as King Leonidas, every line he delivers with just right amount of passion and leadership that is needed for a king!! Also Lena Headey is great as the Queen of Sparta as is Dominic West as Theron and David Wenham as Dilios!!! Not to mention, Vincent Regan as the Captain who gives a heart-breaking performance at the tragic event of his son's death!! The action in this film is also major highlight!!! This is where the movie score really sets the tone for the movie as it never stops feeling epic!! You can tell that every fight was well choreographed and the slow-mo effects really help by showing the brutality of the violence, which is pretty gory!!! Heads fly off left and right, and limps are cut off like butter, but hey, THIS IS A WAR MOVIE!!! So to all the squeamish, this isn't the movie for you. But the best part of this film for me were the finally 20 minutes of the film, it's intense and emotional that you will changed by the end of the film!! But it also gives the audience the moral of never to stop fighting, no matter how impossible your odds may seem!!! 300 is an inspirational, action-packed, well-acted, and visually ground-breaking film!!! Like Frank Miller's other comic book adaption, Sin City, 300 sets the bare for how films should look and feel!! After the mediocrity that was Ghost Rider, 300 is the first great film I've seen so far this year, and hopefully not the last!! It's a film all can enjoy, even women, who will probably enjoy all the half naked men running around. My advice is to go see 300, if the acting and action aren't up to your standards, then just watch this amazing setting and effects, which alone will leave you breathless!!! My only little problem with the movie is the appearance of Xerxes, The Persian King!!! I don't know, but it seemed he looked more like a drag queen than a ruler!!!"

","I admit that I do not comment on movies that I have seen but do not like and this one is the exception that proves the rule. Diane and I watched this thing yesterday at a commercial megaplex and I am writing this comment because what I saw should not have been seen. As a general rule I love sword and sandal movies and do not even need to have seen nor read anything about the film to draw me in.<br/><br/>My dabbling in ancient history is usually secure enough for me to judge a film's basic truth and this film , at least by my minimal standards, passed that minor test. However, it is not the historical fundamentals that put me off while I watched but the terrible Americanizm that blanketed the film in enough places to put me off entirely. I have not the slightest idea how Spartan soldiers acted before going into battle but I will wage my last dollar that they didn't give out simultaneous howls like a bunch of testosterone fueled Jarheads before laying waste to Mosul.<br/><br/>Hollywood's take on ancient history always leaves room for humorous reflection. Remember Caesar's guard in Gladiator; remember how we knew they were the bad guys because they were dressed in black iodized armor--like a Roman version of the Nazi SS?<br/><br/>I can put up with historical inaccuracy as long as it is not bathed in ridiculous 21st century Californian smell-nice.<br/><br/>The whole thing was too goofy for me to remember and like Baz Loman's fin-de-siecle stinker Moulin Rouge, I feel that I must write , for my own peace of mind, a negative comment about 300."
"BillThierfelder","4","8","14","27 April 2007"," All show, no characters
","I REALLY wanted to love this film. I'm familiar with the graphic novel and thought it would translate well onto the ""big screen."" Visually, it does crossover terrifically. This is a gorgeous film to behold--everything from the washed out colors to the remarkable panoramic images are top notch. Everything, despite the often vast scale of events, helps to paint the ultimately claustrophobic atmosphere of war.<br/><br/>UNFORTUNATELY, when time is taken to focus on a character, all we get is cardboard cut-out clich√©s. Perhaps that was the intent--that in a war everyone thinks mindlessly as one. But it would have been great to get to know more about each of the individual characters. And when we do get a glimpse, there's nothing beyond pat, soap opera duologue. Clearly the bulk of the audience seeing this film is NOT going for penetrating psychological insights. (They'll tell me to see an indie like LITTLE CHILDREN.) But compare this film to something like BAND OF BROTHERS or SAVING PRIVATE RYAN--or a war classic like PATHS OF GLORY--and one can immediately see how far this film falls short of giving us the real story behind this remarkable brotherhood of men who dared the largest army in the world to protect their homeland.<br/><br/>(By the way, there's an intriguing historical error in the film that was made, I'm sure, to make sure all the ""guys"" in the audience didn't barf: A comment is made by one of the Spartan soldiers that makes clear that Spartan men don't have sex with other men like those people in the other City States. WAY WRONG: The Spartan boys, taken from their homes around 7 years old, were often ENCOURAGED (as they grew older) to develop both emotional and physical relations with the other men in their company--two men were often paired up as ""special friends"". This didn't mean they were ""gay"" in our modern sense (which was a message the film makers wanted to avoid)--most had wives and children back in the City. The reason for NOT discouraging such relations was to ensure loyalty and devotion. The thought was that you'd be even MORE willing to lay down your life for a fellow soldier if you had been intimate with him. Once again, this historical gaff in the film says a lot about our heterosexist society. But again, most of the people seeing a film like this are seeing it for the visuals and the ""fun"" of the action--they're not seeing it for deep psychological insights or historical accuracies.)<br/><br/>So if you want a popcorn-crunching diversion that you can pop in your DVD player, go for it. If you want a real film about the individuals who fight in a war (often for a cause) try FULL METAL JACKET or THE THIN RED LINE."
"vandad-alvandipour","1","20","43","9 March 2007"," Distorting History for Political Purposes!
","we must consider 300 from two points of views: first, cinematic techniques and artistic values. second, historical authenticity which deals with screenplay and the original story on which the movie has been based. From cinematic point of view, the film is a success.Its cinematography is great and Zack Synder's direction is not so bad.The action is exciting and... But the story of the movie is a BIG LIE. It's about Persian and Greek war.I studied history for a long time and i was interested in the history of the east, especially Persia(which today is called Iran).Persia was one of the oldest civilizations of the world. One of their greatest kings, Cyrus the Great, had established the Human Rights Principle 2500 years ego which is known as the first human right document.He abolished slavery and declared that every one has the right to practice their own religion and legislated many other humanistic law. In concise, Persians were civilized people, much more civilized than European people in that era. But, what we see in this movie is quite different. We see Persians as wild and brutal animals while we see the Greek soldiers as nice,kind and humanistic figures. I'm afraid to say that this is a distortion and misinterpretation of the history.What we see as persians in this movie is not authentic. I believe Cinema is there to make people of the world closer and let them develop more humanistic mutual understanding and relationship, not to help them be more hostile and revengeful to each other. Unfortunately, 300 is helping the second one. The theme of this movie is relevant to today's crazy warfare between west and east and this bothers me. so I cant like these kinds of movies at all. The producers and director of this film must read the history again."

The story is not even close to the actual event. In all Persian wars history they have never use a single elephant or rhinoceros and I would like to know how could they even ship these giant animals over the sea? Also it has never been seen a African race Persian till now. In this movie the Persian king, all the women and most of the soldiers were black!!! The actual war happened in a narrow mountain pass, there was not any cliff so they can though Persians in to the water. In conclusion, as far as the graphics were concerned, I would rather The Lord of the Rings which first came out SEVEN years before this movie and it was way better than 300."

Really think about what this film is based after and maybe that's what Frank Miller was trying to portray. Just a thought, just my opinion.

"SidewinderSMR","1","32","75","18 March 2007"," Pretty pictures, action is okay, but pure propaganda.
","Note: If you enjoyed Sin City, then this comment isn't for you -- its for people who don't read Frank Miller.<br/><br/>Who knew that the often overreacting Iranians were actually right for once? After all, they threw a tantrum over Alexander portraying the defeat of the Persians ""too easily"". (See http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/6446183.stm for their fit) Since Iran's reputation is pretty much nil, and the trailer was nicely done, and I was invited to go there with some beautiful women -- I figured, ""Hey, what the hell. It can't be that bad, and who knows, it looks like a completely different style from Sin City!"" To sum up the movie: 1) Tons of gore != good action -- it's independent. Just watch a few good Hong Kong films to see what I'm talking about. In fact, you might even go so far as to say that if gore isn't overused in a film, it has a more powerful effect when it IS used.<br/><br/>2) Pretty imagery != good movie -- it's just icing in the cake.<br/><br/>3) The whole movie was a pure propaganda piece. Even the Republicans agree (Possible spoilers at link: http://mypetjawa.mu.nu/archives/186928.php) and that says something. Basically, all the dialog could be ripped from a government press release or Fox news, where words like 'Persia' get replaced by a word from the set {Afganistan, Iraq, Syria, Iran, North Korea, Iran, Iran, Iran, Iran, North Korea, Iran} -- and it's pretty lame.<br/><br/>4) While it has a few cool scenes (e.g. where someone stabs the someone else at an appropriate time, or the introduction of the Japanese Ninja Warriors) -- that only accounts for a few minutes out of 117 minutes of footage.<br/><br/>5) Action is okay -- not spectacular. This would be fine if it wasn't a pure action movie, and spent time developing the plot, the historical background, and so on --- but the movie is just action. Thus we have a problem. Overuse of slow-motion and flying limbs and flying blood. If that gets you hot, more power to you. It doesn't do anything for me.<br/><br/>6) No historical basis at all. Except that there were 300 Spartans out of a force of ~7,000 Greeks that held Thermopylae. The swords are not Spartan Xiphos, the Spartans had dual-kingship and were a dictatorship, and you could go on and on. The worst part was simply that the Persians looked like a bunch of S&M freaks out of Sin City and some goth flicks.<br/><br/>I won't address the fact that the movie is really for people who like seeing near naked men and a few hard nipples of attractive women. (But mostly near naked men, all the time.) That's for you and Freud to think over.<br/><br/>And if you disagree with any of the conclusions of those points, that's fine -- this is just a warning to those who would draw similar conclusions."

","The movie itself is OK... lots of effects etc. Though anyone looking for another Sin City will be disappointed. Where the movie gets interesting is in it's propaganda value; I have no doubt that it will be cited in history papers in years to come. The storyline has the ""democratic"" Spartans standing against the tyrannical Persians... which easily provides an anti Moslem vehicle. This of course neatly side steps the truth which is that the Spartans were a fairly autocratic bunch with no interest whatsoever in ""freedom"". So even if as a movie it comes no where close to Sin City - does it work as propaganda? Well its expensive propaganda.. and arty propaganda.. but at the end of the day I was left feeling that the Spartans were the Imperial Guard and the Persians the coalition forces."

","This is classical American movie,with hi-tech special effects but with no sens at all for history and meaning of this historical event.It is shame that someone could make movie about some event in history and make so much mistakes.Mistakes are obvious,for example:Sparta had two kings,in movie only Leonidas(in movie he is about 30 or 40,but in real life hi was close to 60),Efori was elderly council not some monsters of oracle,spartan education was famous for their Laconic speech(short with no emotions),not some long heart-breaking sentences full with freedom speak nonsense so charatcteristic for American view of war and love;Spartans wear famous because of their combat tactic as phalanx,joint group force,not as movie shows,soldiers who run and slaughter on their own like Rambo or other American hero,Xserx who is 3 m high,bold,with million earringes in his body,monsters in the battle,immortals who are monsters too,savages in Persian army,and etc. This is too much for me to swallow. If we set a side historical mistakes,movie is nothing more then some B production action movie on steroids,which was meant to show how good guys come from the west and bad from the east.So typically for Hollywood war movies,and very alarming if we consider current American politics towards eastern countries(Iraq,Iran,Lebanon-former Persia).Is this movie a war propaganda for next U.S. intervention?Probably not,but it is suitable for average American view of freedom,love,politics and history. Acting is poor,scene is artificial and maybe the only good thing in the movie,directing average.Scene of combat catastrophic,with accent o blood thirsting soldiers,so false and ridiculous.

"Polaris_DiB","6","17","36","19 March 2007"," From legend to myth
","Fact: At one point, Spartans faced an army of Persians during the Battle of Thermopylae. History: A dispute exists over whether it was 300 or 30000, whether they were aided by other Greek city-states or not, or even if the intentions were to hold off the Persians or merely partake in glory. Legend: Sparta, a warrior state, was full of amazingly tough and blood-thirsty men who could hold off hordes of people despite their small numbers because they are so awesome like that.<br/><br/>And then we arrive to this movie, Myth: 300 chiseled men go head-to-head with billions of Persians, Lord-of-the-Rings-style orcs, giants, beasts, monsters, and about anything the imagination can hold (including men with swords for arms and enormous rhinoceri). It's awesome, it's entertaining, and it's absolutely wonderfully gratuitous! Of course the thing about myth is that it's also a mediated value system. Whereas I can be assured that neither Frank Miller nor Zack Snyder intended any direct theme beyond the glory of being warrior men dying in battle, some of the more Western hegemonic characteristics of this movie go from absurd to downright disturbing.<br/><br/>I have talked to a lot of people about this movie since I saw it and have learned that no matter which way I present this idea, it's an unpopular one, but I'm sorry: whether the filmmakers intended it, or not, this movie is jingoistic patriotism wrapped in testosterone-addled bigotry. The dialog is right out of contemporary fallacy and there's only a few uncanny parallels that keep returning a sense of contemporary urgency to the mix... Those ""Athenian"" (read, French) ""boy lovers and philosophers"", the corrupt oracles (the UN), fighting ""as free men for freedom"" (even within the historically inaccurate--and let me stress that it's not supposed to be historically accurate--but even within the historically inaccurate imagery the Spartans still show no sign in their culture of being ""a free state""), the ""surge"" at the end, and even the general focus on war as glory do nothing but bog down the action with strikingly propagandistic appeal. I mean, it certainly wasn't character development! The thing is, though, the movie is still fun, still worth it, despite that daunting theme. The imagery is, in fact, beautiful, the action is tight and interesting, and the long battles maintain their interest despite the fact that it would seem they would become repetitive. Indeed, I think this movie's only problem was adding to, rather than subtracting from, the dialog from the graphic novel. The entire side story of the Queen? Unnecessary. The longer dialog between the Persian messenger and the King? Unnecessary. Funnily enough, this movie could have used LESS plot than it already had! The sex scene? Worst sex scene in the history of cinema.<br/><br/>Something that's interesting about this film though is how well it succeeds in being Greek. Instead of carving men out of marble, it carves marble out of men, but the actual imagery of them (in profile, in close-up like a bust, etc.) really does match with Greek Classic and Hellenistic sculpture. Everybody who comments on this movie has something to say about the visuals in terms of how the action and the atmosphere play out, but I would imagine the Ancient Greeks themselves would be very proud of the imagery described.<br/><br/>This is an event film... it should and shall be watched in the theatre. Seeing it on any smaller screen will vastly reduce it's imagery and unfortunately will also make the yelling-command-pseudo-dialog seem even MORE absurd. I'm also pretty sure as time goes on this movie will lose its novelty and people will begin to hear what it's actually saying.<br/><br/>--PolarisDiB"

","I am a comic collector, and I'm not really a big Frank Miller fan. I love his Daredevil from the early '80s, but I haven't really liked anything of his since then. I read '300' when I was visiting a friend a couple of years ago, but I didn't think it was much good. I'm no fan of Miller's ideas about violence and manhood; it all seems a bit sadistic and, well, black and white. Miller acknowledges this; he has said that he is an artist (i.e. a ""drawer"") at heart, so he draws what he likes to draw, and then just makes up some story to go with it. Fair enough - that's his business. He can do as he likes. And apparently a lot of people like it. I'm just not one of them.<br/><br/>I did go to see the movie, however - as a comic collector, going to see comics-based movies kind of comes with the territory. I expected something pretty entertaining, at least visually, since the trailers looked amazing. The adaptation had translated the special comic book style into a special, but different, motion picture style, and I was interested in seeing how well this was done. Again, the trailers were extremely promising.<br/><br/>The movie was fairly entertaining, but I must say I am disappointed. The story just didn't grab me very much; there wasn't much character development (every Spartan except Leonidas and his captain were practically completely faceless and anonymous) or interesting elements to identify with or engage oneself in. The pacing suffered a lot from the constant slow-motion scenes which I felt comprised a much too great desire on the part of the director to mimic the exact comic-book panels, even to the degree of punctuating the action and the narrative flow of the movie's story. So I would call this a too faithful adaptation of the comic.<br/><br/>I also thought the story had more general problems. The style and the basic concept were enormously promising, but I didn't feel they lived up to that promise at all. The movie could have been so much more effective in terms of action, excitement, intensity, human spirit and climax. Sure, there were a few cool things, and Gerard Butler himself (incl. his cool Scottish accent) was very good. But both the substance of the story and the overall pacing and storytelling were just not good enough to draw me into the story and make me feel anything for it. Stylistically, as a first effort and an experiment, it was OK. It was fairly entertaining and visually interesting. But it could have been so much more.<br/><br/>Oh well, we can't have everything.<br/><br/>7 out of 10."

In my country, those whose reading of history leads them to question the official narrative are characterized as ""latte drinking/chardonnay sipping, Volvo driving elites, out of touch with the ordinary person."" I imagine that the situation elsewhere in the ""Anglosphere"" is little different.<br/><br/>""Hollywood"" is not about truth (otherwise Leonidas would be killing a slave, not a wolf, as a rite of passage). Hollywood exists to wrap the ideology of the US ruling classes in a glitzy package called ""Entertainment"" and present the status quo as the best of all possible worlds. When it comes to History, Hollywood depicts reality not as it was, nor even as we remember it, but as we would like to remember it.<br/><br/>Given that the Spiderman movie, to name just one, was held back because it showed the World Trade Centre, the really interesting question is why ""300"" was released precisely at this point in time, given the likelihood of another ""Coalition of the Willing"" smashing its way into Iran."
"Oans","1","22","49","1 April 2007"," Shame on the producer for butchering culture/history
","Let me begin by quoting this:<br/><br/>quote.<br/><br/>A historical film or a film about history must follow ethical principles. Art must be in service of culture and humanity. Somebody may say ""come on, it is not a historical film, it is just for amusement"". If one wants to produce a mythic film (unreal) just for amusement or fun, he (she) should not name the real persons and countries for his (her) unreal characters. For example, The Lord of Rings had a correct way. But,300 is a huge distortion of history. A glorious history was distorted to barbarian behaviors. Also, a historical film must be decorated according to historical books and monuments. Not only for the pictures of persons, but also for the dresses of soldiers, equipment, etc. I have seen a picture from Xerxes in a Persian translation of The Histories (by Herodotus) refers to the book published in Athens in 1976, page 620. I don't know it is real or it is an artist picture. However, there are numerous relieves of Achaemenid kings on the walls of Persepolis palace and in other monuments.<br/><br/>But why did I mention a glorious history?<br/><br/>*Xerxes was son of Darius the great and Atossa, the daughter of Cyrus the Great. Cyrus the great unified smaller kingdoms from the Greece borders in the west to the Indus River in the east with justice. ""I freed the citizens of Babylon from the yoke of servitude"". Cyrus declared the first human rights charter at 500 BC, e.g., freedom of religions, etc. He allowed the people to continue worshiping their gods and have their temples, despite his own monotheist believes.<br/><br/>*Old Testament explain good about Cyrus the Great (see Book of Ezra).<br/><br/>*Cyrus freed Israelites who were slaves in Babylon. Some of them went back to Jerusalam and the others stayed in Iran freely.<br/><br/>*Derius the Great ordered to dig the Suez Canal for shipping and it was operational at that time.<br/><br/>""...I ordered to dig this canal from the river that is called Nile and flows in Egypt, to the sea that begins in Persia... (from a stele that was discovered in 1866, by Charles de Lesseps)""<br/><br/>*Persepolis was built by wage, not by slaves.<br/><br/>*The first brain surgery in Iran dates back to 2800 BC, discovered in an excavation in Burned City near Zabol in the east of Iran.<br/><br/>quote end.<br/><br/>Im disturbed by the freedom, arrogance and carelessness the ""usa-entertainment industry "" has. Like Troy, this movie its just a shame. If you don't have a that deep and big history you should back off in using other country/region history and butcher it for the love (entertainment) of the uneducated people.<br/><br/>Yes you make big money with it, but in my eyes there should not be possible to use the heroes and the history of a nation like that. Ofc you don't care and don't give a s***, but then don't wonder that you are not liked. Offending the religion, history and legacy of a culture/ country doesn't make you any friends.<br/><br/>Don't use names historically related if you are not going to follow and pay respect to the little legacy other cultures have from their ancestors. As I said, back off ignorants and stop using other culture and butcher it just because you can and you have the money. Shame on you.<br/><br/>No, Im not from Iran or one of the country/culture, never been there and actually oppose strongly what happens there nowadays (Im Christian btw). Im just someone who's considering history to important to be slaughtered by the American movie industry. Your arrogance and ignorance will be lately your doom, which Im sad about as a big fan of the originally American freedom and way of life.<br/><br/>regards"

","I am a big fan of Frank Millers job, and of course i think that ""300"" is one of his best books ever. The movie is based in the fact that 300 Spartan Soldiers with 600 Soldiers of Thespia (todays Fthiotida)were stood in a small passage, against the mightiest (in numbers) army of ancient times. In the movie (and the comic book) the 600 thespians are not included nobody knows why... I think that who ever want to watch the movie, knowing and feeling, what is really the story about, should definitely read the great best seller book ""Gates of Fire"" by Steven Pressfield. At last Hollywood discovered that the Ancient Greeks not only were the mightiest and most trained soldiers ever, but they kept Europe safe from Dynasty and slavery. It is the first movie that really shows how the ancient Greeks fought, killing with tactics and with no mercy. A critical detail about the man to man sword fights, between Persians and Greeks, is that the Spartan soldiers were ""dressed"" with an armory full of copper and the Persians were dressed with armories of wood or leathers, so they were easily splattered by the well trained swordsmen of Sparta... Anyhow we should give our congratulations to the makers and actors of ""300"" for ""teleporting"" us to the bravest and most crucial battle of all times!"
"rockmyworldkoc","10","22","49","11 February 2007"," Based off of the Graphic Novelist's Frank Miller's adaption of the Battle of Thermopylae in 480 BC, where few stood against many.
","I am very appreciative of the Director's involvement. The age of the Director matters because it directs the biggest number of movie-goers, the 30 and under category. And the perspective of Snyder really gives the good kick in this film. An excellent soundtrack, the graphics are simply amazing, and the scenes an sequences couldn't be better. The film the 300 is about one of the greatest examples of heroism. This battle was literally a loss for the Persians, from casualty ratio. but of the 300, they die, but of the million Persians the Spartans take 20,000. This adaption of the action packed Frank Miller elaborates on the battle skill and strength of the Spartans, though vastly out numbered. Its the Greatest warriors the world ever new versus the many basic soldiers. Talent versus population.<br/><br/>Frank Miller's influence has made it so much fantasy is added into the film. The monstrouscharacters of the Persians, or mutants add a very detailed and imaginative scenes throughout the film.<br/><br/>Facing insurmountable odds, their valor and sacrifice inspire all of Greece to unite against their Persian enemy, drawing a line in the sand for democracy. The film brings Miller's acclaimed graphic novel to life by combining live action with virtual backgrounds that capture his distinct vision of this ancient historic tale."
"ecua_guz","6","25","57","10 March 2007"," A pleasure for the eye, but not for the heart
","As I entered the theater, I was expecting a film that would definitely have a unique and innovating idea to the usual films that are related to this genre. But by innovating, I meant in an aspect of a filmmakers holistic perspective: from the way the screenplay is written, to the way the idea is shown in a new graphic model. 300 did a marvelous job with the second, but it failed with the first (which is undeniably the most important step on any film-making). As you see the story unfold, you are taken into a world that somewhat wants to express an idea of honor, courage and glory, but you don't sense that within the characters. Yes, a certain passion is seen and greatly heard, but the connection and attachment of the actors with the audience is just not at the level of the artistic work that was put behind this film. In other words, what you see is more of a collage of beautiful scenarios and effects, but you just can't get a hold of the transcendental emotion of a human struggle and journey for a purpose. By the time you reach the end of the film, it seems to get stronger, but then, it is just too late to gain a true meaning of the plot.<br/><br/>It's not an evolution of film-making, but it is definitely, a first step to something greater. Do see it, but don't expect to come out of the theater with a story that would keep you talking, cause it won't."
"gotham-63139","Null","10","19","24 May 2016"," Pretentious Claptrap
","I downloaded this film to my DVR recently knowing nothing about it except that it was claimed to be an adventure movie centering on the Greek's defeat at the hands of the Persians at the battle of Thermopylae. Or so I thought. <br/><br/>Having grown up on the sword and sandal movies of the 1950s and 1960s I figured it could be an enjoyable 120 minutes or so of entertaining adventure. <br/><br/>As the film unrolled it seemed awfully familiar. Baby born, stands around in snow, fights someone in a courtyard, defeats a beast up in the mountains. Why did I think I had seen this before? Penny drops, so to speak. ""Meet the Spartans."" <br/><br/>I honestly had no idea at all that ""Meet the Spartans"" was a send-up, tribute (mockery?) of ""300."" I had never heard of ""300"" in any form, movie or comic book, before watching it, though I can see now that it provides ample material for lampooning. <br/><br/>Having seen them both I can now recommend that one stick with ""Meet the Spartans."" Its humor may be sophomoric, and even that's giving it the benefit of the doubt, but at least it is entertaining and provides some good belly laughs along the way. ""300"" on the other hand is one of the most pretentious, god-awful pieces of claptrap that I've seen in many years. <br/><br/>The actors look like a combination of escapees from a gay porn video combined with Brooklyn hipsters. The whole slow motion thing gets old very quickly. Some reviews I scanned mentioned people being upset at the ""politics"" of the film. Unless you're a reincarnated Spartan upset at how your city is portrayed I can't see how ""politics"" even enters into it. It would be like complaining about the ""politics"" in an Ed Wood opus (speaking of something else that's more entertaining). <br/><br/>Do yourself a favor and give this a wide berth."
"Chris Knipp","6","10","19","9 April 2007"," Speedos, pustules, and buckets of blood. It's called a Graphic Novel. We used to call them Comic Books
","Initially Zack Snyder's 300, based like Rodriguez's violent, ugly, macho Sin City on a Frank Miller graphic novel, certainly has a distinctively derivative look. That is to say, it captures perhaps better than anyone before (despite so many movies made from comic books) the Frank Frazetta comic illustrator style. It's a kind of adolescent boy's dream world, austere, romantic, angular (like all comic book images (but doesn't that come from Forties Hollywood?), in dread of the ultimate teenage ugliness, acne (evidenced in gross skin eruptions) and full of perfect, acne-free super males dressed in Speedos and capes to show off their excessively defined abs and pecs. Miller's and Snyder's Spartans go into battle against the Persians at Thermopolae wearing almost nothing but their buffed-up muscles, which are the one thing the movie is ultimately about. This is a bit ironic, since they are very into using their round shields effectively. You'd think they'd consider some armor, but that would cut off our view of the abs and pecs. They wear helmets, but those are mainly an S/M style statement.<br/><br/>The Persians, in stark contrast this season, are very wrapped up, sort of like desert Arabs, and their leaders are very into elaborate, peculiar, one-of-a-kind piercings (quite the rage among exotic movie bad guys these days). They also seem a perverse outgrowth of the Spartan's rejection of all abnormalities, which the Persian's use of legendary horned beasts and elephants and deformed human giants, are a contrasting embrace of. Notably, a grotesque hunchback on the Spartan side isn't allowed to fight and goes over to the Persians, where he's welcomed by the giant metro-sexual Persian leader Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro), who wears not only piercings and chains but lipstick, fingernail polish, and painted-on eyebrows. But the Spartans too have a crew of elders they go to for advice, whose faces and bodies are covered with pustules. (They're a teenager's nightmare of old age.) The imagination here oscillates between idealized male (and very rarely female) perfection and disgust at everything and everyone else.<br/><br/>The thinking behind this movie doesn't seem consistent. If the Persians are gay, how come it's the Spartans who go around in bulging Speedos? Whether you're gay or straight, you wouldn't really want to be on either side. And after a while despite or perhaps because of the highly stylized way the battle sequences are cranked out with slow-mo starts and stops and pauses for spurting blood, the color-drained images of the uniformly buff male bodies and Frazetta landscapes, which seem made of brush-strokes rather than dirt and stone, start to seen monotonous and repetitive. Surely any viewer who's seen Kurosawa's samurai battles, or more recently Clint Eastwood's realistic Iwo Jima footage, is likely to find this movie lacking in real action interest. It would be interesting to see an attempt to recreate the battle from history books instead of a picture book for adolescent grownups. As an antidote to this glorification of fake heroism, go and see Bruno Dumont's Flanders when it comes out in the US."

Dialog is melodramatic, acting is nonexistent and relies, like the action scenes, on lots of cheap camera tricks.<br/><br/>Worste of all is the fact that this movie could easily be viewed as conservative propaganda. the idea of ""Freedom"" is seared into the flesh of this movie and is constantly mentioned in dialog. furthermore the Persians, which were really one of the most advanced ancient civilizations ever, are portrayed as ignorant barbarians that are inferior, evil, and apparently enslaved(all of which relate in no way to the Persian empire).<br/><br/>The best reason i have heard for someone liking this film is that they liked seeing all the ""ripped"" guys."
"wmlord","2","10","19","19 March 2007"," Another Dark Age?
","Have we entered an age where the knowledge of antiquity is largely lost or has a dumbed down educational system merely decided that even a cursory knowledge of the past is irrelevant? Has the standard of taste sunk so low that continuous images of beheading and butchery by legions of artificially enhanced muscle boys are sufficient to pass as top quality entertainment? Granted that one can expect some liberties with factual events by the Hollywood studios seeking to appeal to public taste how does one reconcile expenditures of millions of dollars to produce a piece with a script so trite and banal as this production? <br/><br/>If there has ever been a block buster epic with a script worse than this I have a hard time recalling it. Even without an extensive knowledge of ancient history and military expertise does anyone but myself find it slightly ridiculous that the Spartans are sent into battle without their body armor? Surely King Leonidas must have been an extremely incompetent commander. It is true that the bare torsos when combined with the gore are probably more titillating to the type of audience which is attracted to this film. Unfortunately, this seemed to be about the only purpose of the script; to provide an excuse for snuff film level images in panorama. <br/><br/>Other than the erotic imagery much is made of the special effects. From my seating they appeared somewhat dull and washed out but assuming that was a seating problem I must confess that even during the prolonged violence I became bored with the mindless repetition. There was some redemption with some of the Persian costumes which were at least passable kitsch, as were the erotic scenes in Xerxes tent which could have been extended. If you want titillation can we at least be spared some of the mindless violence and have our sex with some gentility? There is of course, the supposed political lessons from the movie which if they were actually intended are as simple minded and silly as the rest of this dreadful piece. While many people see Xerxes as the villain and some Iranians are offended by his portrayal, I found that he was at least campy as opposed to the dullard Leonidas. Our current middle east problems should remind us of the consequences of simple minded chauvinism as political action.<br/><br/>To be fair, if you can be satisfied with a series of special effects, gore and steroid case bodies flailing about and body parts separating then this is an appropriate movie for you. Send Hollywood the message that they are right on the mark when they gear their productions to a juvenile mentality. If you require much beyond empty ugly spectacle however, then I think you will be disappointed. So far, most of you don't seem to want much more as revealed by the comments posted. My apologies to Herodotus (who it is said liked a good story) and someone please tell us how to restore some civility to our society."
"brad-662","6","10","19","11 March 2007"," Not the greatest movie but not the worst either
","First off, I've never thought 300 was one of Frank Miller's better comics. I've always been a bigger fan of Sin City, Dark Knight Returns and Batman: Year one. Not to say I didn't enjoy the comic, I just didn't like it as much as a lot of his other work.<br/><br/>In regards to the film, Zach Snyder has attempted to give the same treatment that Robert Rodriguez did with his take on Sin City, that is cinematically represent the artwork and story as celluloid. There is quite a bit of that, in fact it was shot on blue screen much the same way that Sin City was filmed.<br/><br/>What Rodriguez did not do though was add scenes to the existing material, in fact Rodriguez had to cut a few things from Sin City most likely for time. There's not much to the graphic novel of 300 and there's not much to the film either to be honest with you. It's basically Spartans tick off bad guys and fight them for days and are eventually betrayed by one ugly hunchback.<br/><br/>That's your story. The additional scenes of the Queen of Sparta were written for the film and do not appear in the original graphic novel. These are the weakest elements of the film. It's fascinating how much the movie dragged between battle sequences. The movie ultimately is visual masturbation: All style/no substance. Never has there been so many ramp speed shots in a single film. While Snyder may have been using this technique to give the film an overall feel and aesthetic, it becomes a one trick pony after a while.<br/><br/>Not to say the film isn't a visual treat for the eyes, it is that indeed. What it lacks is really any heart to the characters. They're fine actors and I was only groaning at a few of the performances (""You cut off my hand"" gotta laugh) but they had nothing to really work with. Honor, glory, valor: all these things that are lost in our current society because our wars are fought on false pretenses and manipulated intelligence. I just didn't feel the film was very timely and it will make huge bucks at the box office but ultimately, it came off as one big video game, it even looks like one for that matter.<br/><br/>I didn't hate the film, but I need a little more than style to wow me. I need to be emotionally moved by a film. That's ultimately how I judge films, did it make me laugh, did it scare me, did it make me tear up or did it make me think? This film did none of that. I watched Zodiac the week before and it did three of those and yet this film will be far more successful because of the amount of mindless entertainment that is presented here. Mindless being the optimal word."
"safeguide","1","20","44","17 March 2007"," Worst, ahistorical film I've ever seen
","I saw the movie Saturday to a packed crowd. Our group went from the recommendation of some critics who claimed the film was one of the ""spectacular"" must-sees of the year. How wrong we were to rely on that promise. To encapsulate: 1. The acting was one of the worst you'll see in film 2. The film lacks a compelling story. It does what ""cry freedom"" and hero movies try to copy from the success of Braveheart for the last 5 years without the story, passion, and virtues that we can really cheer for. 3. Most of the movie is slow motion slaughter and bloodshed in CGI. Head's and limbs cut off, lots of spearing, and piles of dead bodies... 4. The film plays out like an allegory of the West vs Middle East politics of today. The Spartans hoot like dumb football players with each unreal success, while the East is made to look venal, monstrous, and the epitome of everyone's nightmares. 5. Story? None to speak of... If you've seen Gladiator, you've seen 300. The weirdness of stringent Spartan culture undermines the concept of family but the producers expect us to root for them nonetheless. 6. Imagination? Plot Twists? None.. I've heard and read about critics having to sit through the most excruciating 2 hours of their careers; for me, this was one of those moments. I kept expecting some exceptional to happen.. something redeeming, but there was none. 7. Xerxes and his gang comes off like a flamboyant, bodybuilding effeminate; his crew are either faceless and menacing, or lustful and saturated in orgies. Hard to imagine how someone like this can conquer nations. Leonitus and the Spartans come off like football playing jocks up against impossible odds. If you know history, this film will make you curse Hollywood for dumbing America and world with such banality. 8. If you must see it, wait for the video. It's not worth your money and the special effects are nothing noteworthy. You've seen it all before in the ""rings"" series.<br/><br/>Don't let the high stars scores on this film fool you, this film is a waste of time. I seriously want my money back."

You can see a lot of historical wrong in it even in Iranian cloth and skin color. I am worry and think it is an introduction for starting new war in middle east and against Iran. Film tried to say Persians are very bad people and they like killing others but western are good etc. We never forgot the Alexandar, he killed a lot of people and destroyed a lot of cities in middle east but the Alexandra movie tried to say he was one of the best!

","I had some high hopes for this movie. To be blunt, my hopes crashed into the dirt and splattered into evenly sized chunks. This movie is very misleading. By misleading, I mean the trailers show off just about every good shot or sequence within the entire film. The hype and fanbase for this film reminds me a lot of that of Snakes On A Plane's. A one-liner is pretty much what the fans were looking forward to (""This is SPARTA!!!"") and, lo and behold, it was received with applause in the Imax theater I payed $15 admission to.<br/><br/>That said, the acting in the film is pretty horrid. Not even the one-liners were done with grace; there's really just a bunch of screaming, nothing more, nothing less. That's what I'm having trouble with: both the writing and acting were bad (a deadly combination), which makes it difficult to reason with either one. Shabby writing can offset good acting, and vice versa.<br/><br/>The effects were good and bad throughout the film. The visual look was a little too monochromatic and became boring after a while. The blood splatter didn't quite fit the look of the film, either; it was nothing more than groups of tiny, little drops that flew into the air and even vanished when it hit the ground. The costume design was pretty and there were a few shots that worked wonders for the imagination, but certain things didn't quite fit. Such as the fat thing with cleavers for hands, I have no idea where that came from. Though, that's a fault of the graphic novel itself, taking history/legend and turning it into a laser light show for the ADD public. That's why I'm lenient towards the dull plot in this film, having been taken from a medium that's visually aesthetic above anything else.<br/><br/>I mentioned there were a few shots in the film that were great. That's true. But, I failed to mention that there are only a few of them. The film tries desperately to be dramatic in certain parts, mainly battle scenes, but the end result is more over-exaggerated. After about the 30th slow-mo shot, I started to become a little aggravated. Practically every swing, every jump, every release of a bow string is done in slow motion. I consider that more of a crutch, rather than a creative quality. There are also some shots that could have been done on location. Why they had to film 99.9% of the film on a green screen is beyond me.<br/><br/>I'm still not quite sure what to call this film. It's epic, yes, but anyone can throw a bunch of colors onto a canvas and call it ""epic."" In the end, whatever you've produced is pointless if it's without any real meaning, thought, or reason.<br/><br/>This film is meant to be visual, pure and simple, and it doesn't even achieve THAT very admirably. All I can say, and this will sound mean, is that people who enjoy watching booth- bought fireworks during July 4th will definitely love this movie. Anyone else would best spend their milk money on another film.<br/><br/>And yes, the title should have been 50 instead of 300. Why? Because that's basically the number of Spartans you see fighting throughout the film."
"metatronica","2","37","90","11 March 2007"," Apparently, it is possible to O.D. on testosterone.
","First, let me say that I did have a relatively enjoyable time viewing this film. However, that doesn't mean this film was actually any good outside from visually appealing. In fact, I was more than disappointed since I was very much looking forward to this film.<br/><br/>The biggest thing that bothered me about 300 was the blatant racism and homophobia. On one side, we have the Spartans, who were men's men, the picture of masculinity and classical beauty. They were upstanding, honourable, disciplined and righteous. On the other side, we have the Persians, who represented practically every other culture and ethnicity from the rest of the world. They were cruel, decadent, androgynous, sexually and morally deviant, misshapen, inter-sexed, and everything considered outside of mainstream western culture. Can we paint a more obviously racist image? <br/><br/>The second thing that bothered me was the glorification of Sparta's war-like society and enjoyment of violence. In ancient Sparta, young boys who did not ""live up to"" the society's standards were left to die, only allowing those with certain physical conditions to survive and propagate. This was a form of phenotypic control on the population, basically eugenics, which in modern times is seen as a violation of basic human rights and indefinitely cruel. In this film, violence and gore is shown in a very romantic light. The 300 Spartans cut down countless dehumanised foes in a shower of blood and slow motion choreography. Yes, it was visually stunning, but it was also morally and intellectually sickening.<br/><br/>And last, but not least, throughout the movie, the Spartans repeatedly referred to themselves as ""free men"" who were protecting themselves from slavery. I found this rather ironic considering the Greeks, including Spartans, owned slaves of their own. I guess they were saving every Spartan, sans the already enslaved, from slavery.<br/><br/>I really wanted to like this movie, but these pesky things called ""morals"" keep preventing me from doing so. Perhaps it's ""just a movie"", but most white, Chistrian, straight people I've encountered don't seem to understand how minorities, of Europe and North America, feel when we've often been portrayed in negative ways in the media. This is another example. Sure, it's all fun and games, but it's still a product of our times and it sure as hell doesn't make things better. Maybe they weren't trying to be racist. No one tries to be a product of their time. It's just easy to be a tool when you don't try to think harder about your actions."

Well it looked o.k. the story was very thin. I still don't understand why it took them 90% of the time to tell the story. 85% action 15% story was what I had hoped for and what is should have been.<br/><br/>I also thought that the camera-work outside the action scenes was rather old fashioned and static.

As if there aren't good enough locations in Greece were it actually happened so that they could film it there. and i didn't even get weather it was a history or fantasy film.<br/><br/>let me just tell you that this poor excuse for a film was nothing but trash!"

"JWJanneck","5","12","24","19 March 2007"," Good visuals, simple story---rather boring, actually.
","I won't criticize the movie for being historically inaccurate. There probably is no ""accurate"" account of these events anyway, the graphic novel it is based on took license with previous material without pretensions to historical accuracy, and so does the movie. I have no problem with that. Incidentally, I think that the ways in which the movie (following the novel) most obviously deviates from what is likely historical fact (such as the depiction of the Persians and Xerxes, for instance) are very original, and they make this a better movie.<br/><br/>On the flip side, I also do not give the movie any particular credit for being an accurate representation of its source material. For one thing, I do not know the novel, but even if I did, I think the movie should stand on its own. If it can only be properly appreciated in reference to the graphic novel, it is a failure in my eyes.<br/><br/>That said, I find the movie lukewarm, and certainly not deserving of the hype and the incredible IMDb rating it has received as of this writing (rank 186 in the Top 250). The visuals are excellent, there is a lot of gore and action, and it's executed brilliantly, with some stunning photography.<br/><br/>However, the plot had me looking at my watch. There hardly isn't any. Basically your brain goes into screen saver mode while your eyes indulge in the graphic atrocities that audiences these days seem to enjoy feasting on. There really isn't much happening in this movie, other than a bunch of skilled brutes (skilled in being brutes, mind you) fighting against a much larger bunch of less skilled (and generally less attractive and less well-spoken---all the catchy one-liners are for the Spartans) brutes. If you know about the Battle of Thermopylae (how come we only ever get to hear the English translation of that name in the movie??), you even know how it all turns out, so it's not even a question of who is winning.<br/><br/>Then what is it, apart from dismembered pieces of Greeks and Persians flying through the field of vision, that is supposed to keep your interest? Maybe it's the heroism. Chest-thumping machos in skimpy attire fighting for all kinds of things, including the continuation of Western civilization. If you like that sort of thing, I guess that would do it for you---there is certainly enough of it going around in this movie. I just could not care for the cartoonish (and that's no reference to the nature of the source, but to the quality of the characterization) characters and the boring and stereotypical views, speeches, and actions.<br/><br/>Of course, the movie is not entirely without merit---the action is well done, the acting is not great but adequate for the purpose of providing the basic simplistic motivations for the massacre, photography/special effects are excellent. I'd say it's okay for what it is, i.e. a sword-and-sandal battle epic, but it's way over-hyped for what a lot a people make it out to be. It's certainly not #186 of all time."

","I didn't expect much, but this movie delivered even less than that.<br/><br/>The movie is about 1800 abs who have a skirmish with some CGI zombies. It was directed by a faulty PlayStation, the screenplay was written by a computer virus which attacked the screenplay of the 300 comic book, the music was chosen by a broken iPod shuffle.<br/><br/>The story makes no sense, the actors have the charisma of Ewoks, the dialogues sound like that pirate from SpongeBob Squarepants, and the whole atmosphere of the movie is about as gritty as Britney Spears' early videos.<br/><br/>Too bad this poorly executed cartoon means we won't get to see a really good movie about ancient Greeks for a few decades."
"brooz","2","14","29","31 March 2007"," Dead bore
","What a dead bore!<br/><br/>I just saw this movie and was really disappointed. I just don't understand the hype on this movie. OK, the plastic is perfect, but the movie is only plastic: slow motions, soundtrack, fights... But. The fights are highly unrealistic. For example: the first m√™l√©e is a charge. Persians attack and Spartans block with their shields. Instead of being hack and slash, it is a push game. I just cant get it. The overall thrill factor of the fights hardly reaches a level of 1 on a scale of 10.<br/><br/>This movie is based on the Thermopyles battle where an alliance of 7000 Greeks coming from 31 independent cities including 1000 (not 300) Spartans and led by Leonidas the 1st fought more than 200.000 Persians. No oracle forbid this battle. The number of 300 really was the number of Spartan warriors remaining while they knew the battle was lost. The historic value of this movie is worth 3 because of the betrayal of Elephant-man which is true.<br/><br/>What are the values shown in this movie? To my opinion, it has to be understood as a ""support GIs in Irak"" underlying message: The Persians are the evil barbaric Muslims. Spart represents the democracy that stand but does not surrender. The evil oracle receiving gold to betray Leonidas represents the anti patriotic media asking for the end of the war. I could continue this parallel for long, but I wont. I will only add that I see ( Yeah, it is my opinion and you are allowed not to agree) a major difference between Thermopyles and Irak: Spartans and generally Greeks defended their land against Persia, while GIs are invading Iraki land. The subtlety of the political message is worth 2.<br/><br/>Hence the global note I gave this movie: 2. <br/><br/>Watch out... For something else."

","300 ‚Äì CATCH IT (A) 300 is a trend setter which not only introduced a new technology but took the gore and violence to next level. I saw 300 when it was released in bits and pieces but now finally got the chance to watch the complete movie from start to finish. Well I've to say I was blown away it was indeed something spectacular and even after 6 years still no one has done anything like it. Even though Spartacus TV show does have managed to capture the essence in its budget. Gerard butler, Michael Fassbender, Lena Heady, Tom Wisdom, Dominic West and Rodrigo Santoro did a fantastic job. The main hero of the movie was defiantly Zack Zynder & graphic designers. They created a new world for us just like Star Wars, Jurassic Park or Avatar. Now I simply cannot wait for 300: Battle of Artemisia with Sullivan Stapleton, Evan Green and Rodrigo Santoro reprising as Xerxes."
"poolandrews","7","6","10","8 July 2010"," Stylish comic book film.
","300 is set in Greece during 480 B.C. where a Persian messenger arrives at the Kingdom of Sparta where King Leonidas (Gerard Butler) is told to submit & surrender to the self proclaimed God King of Persia named Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro) who wants to rule the entire world, Leonidas refuses & kills the messenger which is considered an act of war by Xerxes. King Leonidas seeks help from the diseased Oracle's the Ephor's who refuse the going to war against Xerxes & his Persian army. Leonidas selects 300 of his best fighting Spartans to fight Xerxes & his army of one million soldiers, Leonidas sets up position in a narrow pass named The Hot Gates where Leonidas hops the great number of Xerxes army will count for nothing. Wave after wave of Persion onslaught only makes Leonidas & his men more determined & thousands of Persians are slaughtered...<br/><br/>Co-written & directed by Zack Snyder this fantasy film was based on the graphic novel by Frank Miller & his then wife Lynn Varley first published back in 1998, 300 is actually based on the real historical event of the Battle of Thermopylae although there's little historic accuracy here & I would call 300 more of a fictional fantasy epic such as The Lord of the Rings rather than an historically accurate piece like Gladiator (2000). As a purely fantastical action adventure then 300 is fine entertainment in it's own right, it hits all the right notes if your looking for a lads film from muscular heroes to sword fights to standing up to overwhelming odds to lots of bloody battles & monsters & special effects with a fairly simple plot to tie everything together. Again the politics of the time is presented all wrong, it's accepted that Persian society was more free than the Greek equivalent & of course everyone speaks in English & go bare chested rather than wear armour but as I said just think of 300 as pure fantasy & you will be OK. At just under two hours the pace is good, there's plenty of battle scenes & some very striking imagery, the plot is alright & the basic theme of self sacrifice runs through the film although I must admit I didn't really care for any of the character's when certain ones died I felt nothing. The dialogue is simple yet effective with large portions of the story narrated which cuts down on exposition I suppose, I would say that 300 is a film you will remember for the fights & it's visual style rather than it's strong character's & plot though.<br/><br/>Almost every shot of 300 was filmed against a blue or green screen & things like backgrounds, lighting, effects & other actor's were digitally created later, the only actually shot not filmed this was was when the Persian messenger rides over the hill but even then the shot was dramatically altered. All the colour levels have been significantly altered & while it looks stylish some of the time I found it looked a bit drab & boring at other's, there's plenty of nice visuals on show from flowing capes to exotic dances to huge armoured Elephants to a wall of human bodies to form a barricade to the Sun being blocked out by thousands of arrows shot into the air & it's a shame the colour scheme is unappealing. The fighting style is basically what looks cool on film rather than being historically accurate, the battles are cool & there's plenty of them from slow-motion to long sweeping shots that follow Leonidas & thankfully there's no machine gun editing or shaky camcorder crap going on. The gore is restrained, there's various blood spurts, a couple of cool slow motion decapitation's & a few severed limbs but I expected a little more I have to be honest.<br/><br/>With a supposed budget of about $65,000,000 it looks it with plenty of action & effects. Filmed at the Icestorm Studios in Qu√©bec, Canada. The acting is solid although there's no household names apart from Gerard Butler.<br/><br/>300 is really just a lads film with big blokes fighting each other in hand to hand combat, there's action, monsters & a decent enough story to hang it all on. I liked it & would watch it again & recommend it but I didn't like the bleached look at all & don't go into 300 expecting any historical accuracy as you won't find any."

"parmetd","1","6","10","8 March 2008"," Terrible
","One of the worst movies ever, certainly the cgi effects make it worth viewing once but you are best going to see this movie with the lowest expectations possible otherwise you WILL be disappointed.<br/><br/>For those of you interested in history this movie will not deliver but it will still thrill.<br/><br/>However, several of the problems with this movie was it almost represented more Alexander history than Spartan. The elephants come from Alexander's fight with Porus where he sends elephants to break their ranks. The entire characterization of Xerxes is entirely wrong and actually represents Porus as well both through the coins they showed (which survive today) and from the size different, they tried to show between Leonidas and Xerxes. Porus was reported to be a foot taller than Alexander.<br/><br/>Sparta was famous for gender equality and advancement. They have mixed in general Greek (Theban and Athenian) archetypes and called them Spartans. Women were warriors and were taken at age 7 as well. Women warriors were actually among the 300 that died as well. Women could own property, run the household and be on the council. The Queen would not have to 'request' an audience when she would just demand it as Queen. <br/><br/>Another major issue is that no child was cast out from Sparta for any reason, if there was a reason they couldn't be a soldier then they were be looked down upon but not outcast. Part of the reason Sparta went out of prosperity was because their birth rate was enormously low hence why they would not cast out a single child. It took about six live births for one to survive to adulthood. Finally, their slave to citizen ratio was terrible because no one could become a citizen and only be born one.<br/><br/>They did not state which Oracle that Leonidas went to in the movie just that it had been bribed and it was Spartan law. The only oracles whose opinions are honored for something as major as war would be Delphi, Naxos and Delos: the major oracles of the ancient world. There was a story that in this time period Delphi oracle started giving out weird prophecy and allegedly had been bought by the Persians.<br/><br/>The Persian Tactics in this movie are very poorly betrayed. The Immortals were not seen as ancient gods but were the King's personal bodyguard of about 15,000 swordsmen. They were called the immortals because of their numbers the King could never be reached and were allegedly all hand selected by the king. The first line of Persian offensive would have been what today is known as pike men, which would use a weapon called a Sarissa, which is a 10-15 foot like pike with a bronze pointed head. Cavalry would not have been used in such a narrow area since cavalry is only used for flanking which could not be done here.<br/><br/>Another piece stolen from Alexander history was the ax you see that twirls and misses King Leonidas. This is actually where Cleitus the black saves Alexander the Great's life by pushing him out of the way of a twirling ax, which still manages to nick his plume.<br/><br/>Another outrageous scene was the beginning one (arguable as well stolen from the Alexander tradition) where they reversed Persian and Spartan policy. It was absolutely forbidden as custom to all Greek polis to kill a messenger/diplomat or emissary of any ruler or town. Persians on the other hand have no such policy and often times killed Alexander's messengers (sending back a horse with skulls or killing them in front of his eyes) but Greeks would never commit such a war atrocity as killing messengers.<br/><br/>Probably my biggest complaint of the whole movie is NO ONE looks Persia at all. They cast blacks and want us to think they are Persians? They could have at least cast Xerxes as a Persian rather than getting some dude that represents Porus more than Xerxes. The only person that looks even remotely Persian is like extra person #2375 who gets a 3-second clip where Spartans get to chop him up.<br/><br/>Minor issues, all Spartans shaved their heads to so hair could not be a problem in battle this portrayal seems to have been overlooked because it is effect that is much more rugged. Obviously the whole 'Spartan traitor' thing both with the priest and the cripple was made up for effect but it was true that Greek which were exiled led Xerxes army. Finally, they did not choose their words carefully at all often referring to jailing someone when the ancients rarely ever made jails (the rare exception being Socrates' jail). Someone was either put under house arrest, exiled or killed on the spot.<br/><br/>Correct stuff/applause was it a great soundtrack, the CGI was very well done having been to Greece and all the places mentioned. I love Frank Miller's voice over so the movie actually ends at the victory of the Greeks with Platea. The men trained to look like the real Spartans, which well fit. And then hands down the best part of the whole movie was the people had clearly read Herodotus and modified some of his famous one line quips to include them in the movie such as the ""we will fight in the shade if they shower us with arrows"" and ""Enjoy your meal boys cause the next one will be served in Hades."" Overall, not a bad movie, it delivers some good action and accurate Spartan fighting tactics at the cost of a little history. It is not Spartacus or Gladiator but its not as bad as Troy either."
"qormi","1","6","10","10 January 2008"," Ancient Spearchuckers With Killer Abs
","First of all, was this a cartoon or what? It's way too stylized, like illustrations in a science fiction magazine. They should have played it straight, like in ""Braveheart"", for example. The dialogue was unintentionally funny. Everyone tried to one-up each other in the ""profound statement"" department. The part where the future king fought the wolf in the bitter snowstorm was laughable - he was wearing only a diaper and didn't succumb to hypothermia. Why was Xerxes portrayed as an eight foot tall gay dude? Maybe a 5'5"" gay dude would have been more plausible. And why did he travel on top of a float? And the palace - I didn't know they had ""palaces to go "" back then. Those Spartans had to have been a pretty vain bunch what with the perfect abs. What - you couldn't be a Spartan without perfect abs? And what about those Persians? They had all the fighting skills of zombies (see ""Night of the Living Dead""). Save your money."
"samhill5215","1","6","10","5 October 2007"," I don't get it
","Here's my beef with this film: it is just a fantasy movie superimposed on historical events. I don't want to belabor the inaccuracies or the portrayals of real humans as monstrosities but I just don't get it. If the filmmakers wanted to make a fantasy battle epic then do so. They could even loosely base it on real events but at least locate it in some fantastical land. That's why LOTR works and 300 doesn't. No one bothers with whether elves and trolls exist in the former because it is understood to be a fantasy film. The same can't be said about 300 because regardless of the quality of the CGI effects its corruptions of real people and historical shortcomings are ever present. That's also why Sin City works: everything about it is fictional and the viewer expects fiction and fantasy.<br/><br/>Here's a final point - the events surrounding the Battle of Thermopylai were dramatic enough. There's no need to introduce monsters and giants. This was a pivotal point in the development of our political system and had it not been for the suicidal stand taken by some 4,000 hoplites led by the 300 Spartans the rest of the Greeks opposing the Persians would have been unable to prepare themselves and inflict the final defeat at Plataia. The story has already been filmed twice that I know of. It can surely bear retelling making full use of newer techniques."

Imagine showing intense political arguments, debates on responsibility for other people's lives, on possibility of alliances. This has been basically reduced to endless butchery, filmed in strange colors and varied film speed (which is supposed to make the slaughter look ""artistic"") and accompanied by annoying drum ""music"". A number of stupid clich√©s have been thrown in, like the villain traitor who of course wants to have sex with the good king's wife, and who carries his treason reward money with him so it can spill when he's being killed and demonstrate clearly his treason. There is a beloved son whom his father patriotically chooses not to protect from going to war, and who of course dies in front of the father. And this son, this highly trained Spartan warrior is being attacked from behind from a huge distance, and despite everybody shouting at him he cannot realize that he is being attacked, and defend himself. Villains are of course ugly, and good men are beautiful. The movie suffers from visual exaggeration like many before (Troy, LOTR): there is too many soldiers, too many ships, rocks are too tall, the well is too huge and elephants are too big. But this time it is even more annoying because there is little beyond in this movie. A lot stupidities, like Spartan warriors going to war without a single bag (forget a cart) of supplies. Like this huge unprotected well in Sparta - they would lose half of population of kids and drunken people there. Like heads cut off without any bleeding from carotid arteries. So I can recommend this only to those who find delight in watching numerous impressive and barely clothed male bodies. There is also a little of half-naked female bodies, some of them quite good (the oracle and the queen), but probably too little to justify spending two hours in a movie theatre."

","To Sum this movie up, it was indeed an excellent film.<br/><br/>The visual features of this film were landmark and astounding. The acting was overall convincing, especially from those actors portraying Persians.<br/><br/>The Fight Scenes were the most artistically choreographed battle scenes I have ever seen. The were astounding to say the least.<br/><br/>The story itself has been told over and over again. Few stood against many for what they believed in and died as all people should, for something greater than themselves.<br/><br/>However, due to that story, the movie was handicapped. That story could not provide a wide enough scope for this film. The scope of this film is only on that story, and some other minor and insignificant and under-developed sub-plots.<br/><br/>Because of that handicap, this movie will never be quite as good as Braveheart, Gangs of New York, Saving Private Ryan, and other epics like those films.<br/><br/>Still...extremely well done film by all involved. I highly recommend anyone to see it."

It is clear that the story is very far from reality that has been recorded at most histories. I don't want to discuss about history and reality. But in my idea, this kind of movies which has a great proportion of audiences, have also a great effect on people's mind and they can change their mind against a culture or even a country. I want to clarify that how much two director can be different in their ideas and movies. The director of this movie has used technology and his ideas against one community and the other one (I mean the director of Lord of the ring) used the same technology without arising any cultural sensibility and his movie is still in the list of the best movies. The art of making movies is not only using the technology but is to use good ideas besides using technology. This movie does not posses any reality and idea.

"mgoldhamer","5","11","22","7 March 2007"," 300:comic book characters in codpieces
","If slashing, gashing, and stabbing, and blood flying everywhere is the film genre you enjoy then Frank Miller's latest graphic novel brought to the silver screen is a must see for you. 90 minuets of the entire 117 minuets are devoted to the art of maiming, gouging, and inflicting as much pain as possible to your opponent in each battle scene. The film is very loosely based on the historical battle of 300 Spartans verses the Persians. Almost entirely shot on green screen, the film is a piece of art in itself. More like a giant comic book laid out before the audience, each frame escapes it's own borders into the next. Mr. Miller has far surpassed his work in SIN CITY. 300 has depth, perspective, and almost a 3D quality. I viewed this film in a regular theater, I can only imagine what the effect would be on an IMAX screen. Unfortunately, the film caves in on itself. I did not know that Spartan's spoke with a heavy Scottish accent. There are so many inside jokes told by the Spartans that because of their accent and the excellent FX sound quality, the audience misses most of the one-liners. The film moves very slowly and after the third volley of Persian arrows which blacken the sky, it seemed as though 300 was running out of plot. Viewing this film as a 'screener' meant that I did not have to dip into my wallet at all. Hopefully Mr. Miller's next film will have more plot instead of spectacle and gore."
"Horst_In_Translation","4","5","8","25 November 2015"," Good moments, but not enough for 2 hours
","""300"" is one of the most talked-about and most-honored films of 2006, even if it was not appreciated by the really big awards ceremonies, a bit of a curse that happened many times during director and writer Zack Snyder's career. His movie here tells us the story of Sparta and King Leonidas, who worked as a role model in terms of bravery for many later conquerors. The cast includes many big names, you can check these in the list, but today, almost 10 years later, Michael Fassbender appears probably as the most prominent name. My favorite character, however, was certainly Rodrigo Santoro's Xerxes, who is pretty memorable here thanks to his size and wickedness.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, in terms of the story, I was not convinced particularly. There were some scenes I liked, such as the beginning, everything with Xerxes, the disfigured Gollum look-alike and also Headey's speech and final scene. I may be a bit biased as historic films (except 20th century) are not exactly my preferred choice, especially if they include mostly action and battle scenes like this one. Visually, it's a fine film, but there were several occasions during which it dragged in terms of the story. I may have been more generous with my rating if Snyder had kept it more essential, maybe at 85 minutes. Yes it would have been pretty short, but that's a price I am willing to pay if it turns into a much better film. At almost 2 hours, it lacks focus several times and I cannot recommend it."

","If i remember right, 300 brought to screen a comic book inspired by a Hollywood movie Frank Miller saw in his youth. Given this telephone game of sorts, we can only imagine the level of historical accuracy in 300.<br/><br/>Therefore, 300 should be viewed simply as an action movie, which it is. There is little pausing between adrenaline-pumping sequences and if this is what you're looking for, then you've chosen your movie right.<br/><br/>Otherwise, 300 offers one-dimensional characters and a lot of half-witted lines that incited heroic deeds in countless Hollywood action movies. The good guys are righteous beautiful demigods. The bad guys are despicable creatures, strong in numbers, but no match for the skillful Spartans.<br/><br/>Visually, 300 is great, especially if you're into comics, which is its strongest quality..."

","this movie is a pain, it is fast-packed like a music video, or even worse like a console video game intro, the battle scenes could be graphically interesting, but what's the point to make a movie around them?. Im not criticizing the history stuff, cause it is not important for a movie to be historical accurate, and this movie don't claim for historical accuracy, so it's not this the problem, judging this movie for this is completely missing the point. It is made from a graphic novel, so no problem, you know you are not going to see a movie about ancient history. The problem with the film is that if it was a 5 minutes video for a pop-singer idol, could have been OK for its audience. But watching it like it is, it's like watching a long and quickly boring, computer graphic demo. The characters have no soul, they seem as many Heros from an action game. The few scenes when they try to develop a bit the characters seem to be put there just to say: ""look, it is still a movie, we are trying to make it appear like a movie"". Cant say more, there's not too much to say about this movie, could have been good as a commercial spot, it doesn't inspire you much talking about, boring like hell, good for console addicted kids (or even adults).<br/><br/>I remember Pasolini saying something about the market eating and digesting everything, also the sh.t, so this is the prove Hollywood has found another market to assimilate and digest, the market of the computer games generation... how sad."

"Sheldonshells","1","14","30","21 March 2007"," Has the most misleading commercial reviews for a film to date
","Looking at this film from a purely objective standpoint, the visuals do give the film some brownie points, and there is some good use of fast to slow motion in the battle scenes‚Äìwhich themselves are often exciting. However....<br/><br/>There is very little thought or heart behind the visuals, that is, what is happening just on the surface. Maybe this is deliberately so (after all it is based on a comic); but regardless of the filmmakers' intentions, all kinds of other messages can be communicated to the viewer. Something that was communicated to me was that there seemed to be an attempt to, unsuccessfully, recapture some kind of moribund, ultramacho attitude where films years ago could do that effortlessly--ya know, in a past where those attitudes might have been more functional in some way but are now better left shed. The movie reeks of irrelevancy (and no, I don't count regressive movements and attitudes as relevant even if they do currently partially exist). There's seriously something bugging out in today's young men: looking up to a bunch of belligerent Spartan Greek military cogs for idols of manhood? If many young men are going for this kind of thing, it only reveals just how lost they are. Think of it: boys and men are flocking to see a movie that features well built, chiseled, and hard muscular bodies (used for sexual titillation probably more for hard up female viewers but also for the latent homosexual fantasies of many men), and combines that with all kinds of violence inflicted upon the male body in a war milieu being directed to an audience sitting in (or sleeping through?)a time when such large scale warfare can lead to the extinction of the human species among many other species. Wake up!You're seeing a film where male bodies are being used not only as meat bags to be cut and broken in so many ways, but also as sex objects. So do you see the type of conflicts that are pertinent to the here and now? Any negative depictions of women in the film (for instance, the girl used in the oracle process on the mountain) are meant to be criticized or seen in a negative light (except maybe the cheap thrill of brief female nudity). And the queen in the film, predictably, stabs and kills the traitor who raped her, so she is able to take back power by taking law into her own hands (though it can be argued that the queen consented to having sex, hence making her ""revenge"" a tricky moral quandary). <br/><br/>Another message many docile minds could receive is that racism is just fine. Again, even if the comic creator/filmmakers didn't intend this, it can still be communicated as such. A possible marketing ""war cry"" to this film could read: ""watch a bunch of people who are slightly whiter (or should I say pinker?) slaughter the early ""towelheads"", some of which, as an added bonus, are black!"" Not a very nice thing to say is it? Well that's just what I'm perceiving in this movie's possible racist undertones. I was actually quite relieved when I saw all the less tanned ones finally die at the end. A feeling I did not enjoy having, I should concede. Homophobia is also present in the film (even as the buff male bodies present seem to nourish gay impulses), adding to its ""greatness"" I suppose. Btw, those ""boy lovers from Athens"" had far far far more contributions to culture and history than the Spartan war mongers. <br/><br/>I suppose I wouldn't have even bothered analysing this film in any depth in the first place if I hadn't heard some of the ""reviews"" it received. Calling it ""groundbreaking"" and a ""landmark"" and ""a film of a generation"" kind of gave the impression that there was something more at work than just visceral stimulation and candied entertainment, didn't they? These reviews would be laughable if such dead ringing endorsements were not indicative of cultural malaise and intellectual bankruptcy. Obviously sheeple no longer know, among many other things they don't know in this information age, what groundbreaking means (and exactly what generation does that refer to? The one that's been dead for hundreds of years..or the current dead one?). The production company likely just paid off certain critic drones to give the movie such reviews, as often happens now. Those who make these kinds of films are primarily out for your money; secondarily, they might be using thrilling visuals to fool a lot of, well, fools into calling it, say, groundbreaking, to give themselves false psychological feelings that they have done something worthwhile‚Äìbut by far they are just out for the money. Anyway, all the most base self-interest and nothing more in sight here. In fact, in this film there is no sight at all--just spectacle--and certainly not a lot worthwhile. Hey, maybe that's precisely why it's the film for ""a {de}generation""."
"view_and_review","1","20","46","9 April 2007"," ""300"" insulting on so many levels
","300 was the first movie of 2007 for me. 2007 was/is going to be the year of quality over quantity. I'm tired of running out to see seemingly good movies based upon good trailers, just to find out that the movie was not worth the money spent. I was going to wait until this summer before going to the theater, but Saturday night rolled around and I had nothing to do, so against my better judgment, I went to see 300.<br/><br/>I looked up the start time online to find out that ""300"" started at 10:05. I went to the theater and saw ""300"" on the marquee. I purchased a ticket for ""300"", and it read clearly on the ticket, ""300"". I went to the screen which also had a marquee that read, ""300"". I sat down through 30 minutes of commercials and previews before the movie started, and the title read, ""300"". So, I'm sure I did watch the movie ""300"", but by the end of the movie all I was sure of is that I got ripped off.<br/><br/>As highly touted as this movie was, as much money as it raked in, this movie was a bomb. I felt like I sat through two hours of Greek propaganda. I wanted to see the movie because I figured it would be similar to ""Troy"", ""Lord of the Rings"", or ""Kingdom of Heaven"" with the fighting. In other words, two very good and well equipped armies battling it out until one is overcome by the other. Umm, how wrong I was. It was more like a bad martial arts film with spears and swords. You know the kung fu movie where the hero is surrounded by his dozens of opponents, and they all attack one at a time, until the hero kicks or punches them all out without much effort. You know that type of movie? Yeah, well ""300"" was like that.<br/><br/>I don't think I've ever seen a more inept army, or were we to believe that the Spartan band was just that good? The Spartans were not just heros, they were superheros. With little more than a cape and a pair of leather Speedos, they were able to fend off the biggest army they ever faced. I don't even think they wore a cup. They didn't have one wasted motion. Every strike was fatal, every block was well timed, and they never suffered one loss until late into the movie. When I say they didn't suffer one loss, I mean not a loss of blood, not a loss of sweat, not a loss of nerves, not a loss of a weapon. As many spears that were chucked, they somehow regenerated them. Heck, they didn't even lose breath in this movie. Even if the Persian army was the biggest waste of flesh to hold a sword, the shear numbers would have caused exhaustion in any humans, but the Spartans fought droves of Persians without getting tired. Battle after battle, the Spartans came out with glossier skin than the fight before. To have so much exposed skin, I would think that they may suffer an abrasion or two on the rocks... they didn't even get that.<br/><br/>Eventually you come to realize that the Persian army consisted of the armies of every conquered nation in the known world with the exception of Sparta, in other words Greece, or in other words Europe. Amongst the Persian army you saw Black faces, Asian faces, Indian faces, Persian faces, and even monsters from origins unknown. Sparta was the first nation of Europe to be attacked, and Sparta/Europe was the only nation to withstand the onslaught of Persia. The Persian army, with the skills, talent, strength, and minds of so many other nations-- fought so pathetically, that they may as well not have been wielding swords. The Spartans were so graceful, skilled, strong, and every other admirable characteristic you can think of, that you got the idea that they could have done just as well with a rubberband and paper clips. Translation: white = strength, honor, grace, etc.; non-white = weak, stupid, shameful, etc. I can see why the Iranians were upset with this movie.<br/><br/>""300"" was a gross exaggeration of a real event. The battle in ""Lord of the Rings"" was much more realistic. At least there was some give in ""Lord of the Rings"", there were some losses, and there were even some signs of peril. ""300"" leads you to believe that a bunch of 3/4 naked Ambercrombie & Fitch models with capes on were able to take on untold thousands of Persian soldiers to protect their beloved Sparta. Yeah, that's even less believable than the U.S. having won the Vietnam War.<br/><br/>If you are looking for blood, violence, sex, and nudity, then this movie is perfect for you. If you are looking for content, depth, or even just historical accuracy, then stay far away from this movie. This movie was empty, it didn't provoke the mind or the heart. The characters are all one dimensional and it looks like the entire movie was done in front of a blue screen. This movie is not only an insult to one's intelligence, it is an insult to all non-whites."
"Bortman","2","17","38","11 March 2007"," Self-indulgent, shallow drivel. And I STILL didn't like it!
","I'm writing this review from the perspective of someone who *likes* over-the-top, cheesy action movies that have more visual flare than dramatic integrity. This movie is terrible. The over-stylized, muddy visuals give the film a sort of hazy, dreamlike quality, which is the only thing appropriate about ""300"" because watching this movie feels a bit like peeking in on the dreams of a sexually repressed, seventeen-year-old sociopath with enough bottled homo-eroticism cursing through his desires to make even a homo like me want to wretch.<br/><br/>Every single aspect of this movie is over-emphasized and under-whelming. There's far too much talking, the dialogue is absurd, and nearly every line is shouted, even when it's totally inappropriate. ""WOULDST THOU LIKE SOME SUPPER, SIR?"" ""NO, GOOD SIRE, I WOULDST BUT NOT SUP 'TILL I'VE ASSURED THE PROTECTITUTE OF ALL THE COMELY LASSES IN GREASE."" The Spartans are made out to be such hardened warring-machines that it eliminates any possible feeling of suspense. It's like playing a video game after punching in a cheat code for invincibility¬óthere's no sense of dread, so it sucks out all the fun. The battle sequences in ""300"" are high on pomp, low on grandeur, using C-G effects to add blood splatter and a few beheadings when that effort would have been much better spent increasing the number of soldiers on screen at a time. The violence is less convincing than even much older, physical-effects-driven movies, and the frequent, blurted-out bits of exaggerated chivalry are far more cringe-inducing than any of the gore.<br/><br/>From me, ""300"" gets a D for plot, an F for dialogue, and an ""Incomplete"" for visuals. The actual event in history that this film was based on, the battle of Thermopylae, is ripe with opportunity for suspense¬óthree hundred Spartans taking on an army of tens of thousands of Persians should be a scary, bloody thrill-ride¬óbut this movie is so up it's own butt about how grand it is that it misses the point entirely. It's not thrilling, only halfway sexy, and more often than not just a bore."

","This movie is about how the Spartan National Socialist Party was able to defend their Reich from outside degenerates, mainly through strict population control and gene purification programmes.<br/><br/>Spartans subscribed to theories of racial hierarchy and social Darwinism. Their peoples were depicted as true ""Spartans"", and the ""master race"". Opposed to both capitalism and Marxism, it aimed to overcome social divisions, with all parts of a homogeneous society seeking national unity, and what it viewed as historically Spartan territory as well as additional lands for expansion.<br/><br/>Around 630 B.C., with the support of more conservative elites, Leonidas became Chancellor of Sparta and they gradually established a one-party state, under which Persians, political opponents and other ""undesirable"" elements were marginalised, with several millions eventually imprisoned and killed.<br/><br/>Leonidas purged the party's more socially and economically radical factions in the mid-630 Night of the Long Knives and political power was concentrated in his hands, as F√ºhrer or ""King"".<br/><br/>Watch this movie if you really hate Persians."

The graphic equivalent of purple prose? Xerxes looks like the Big Bad in a ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" arc. I kept expecting fangs.<br/><br/>What really got me was the scene where the Persian emissary meets with King Leonidas and demands, ""Surrender your weapons"". This is a rightly famous moment in Western history, although, given the Spartans' warrior ethos, Leonidas' reply was a foregone conclusion. (""Spartan"" is Greek for ""Klingon"".) All Leonidas said was two words: ""Come take"". A phrase so laconic it has ever since frightened translators who usually insist on adding words to what he said. What ""300"" does is worse than add words, however; it adds images, narrative. It stretches out the scene unnecessarily. Cinematically, Leonidas basically says, I will answer your question, but first I must have a flashback. Then I must overdramatize my reply instead of making it understated, which is all that is needed.<br/><br/>This movie lost me right there."

Also - and I'm no expert on ancient battle techniques - I can't help but wonder if true warriors actually make sure their toes are pointed properly, like an Olympic diver, when they fly at the enemy. Similarly, I wonder about the sense in going into battle in nothing but a jockstrap. OK, maybe they did. I don't know.

Persian empire was the greatest civilization on earth.Despite Islam and mullahs ,Iran still preserves her great cultural heritage.West always omits her Persian origins.Most of western languages have Persian roots.Even the name of Ireland comes from Iran."

","I think this was the first interpretation of Frank Miller's work that I ever enjoyed translated onto the big screen. I wasn't a fan of The Spirit, nor Sin City and so on. Zack Snyder absolutely nailed this. The visual landscapes and imagery were outlandishly awesome and tantalizing, especially on the big screen. <br/><br/>The only disappointment with this movie has been the follow up decisions from both Snyder and Butler. Watchmen was a disappointment, not because it was bad, but I just think Snyder should have lent his talents elsewhere as there was no crossover appeal no matter how hard they tried to push otherwise. Butler, on the other hand is playing completely demoralizing roles. I know he wants to be an actor but why is he choosing rom coms?<br/><br/>Anyways, back to my original point, the smartest thing to do is to pair Snyder and Butler together again, with Miller's work. It's a shame this is supposed to be based on historical events as it leaves little to no room for a prequel (a sequel is obviously impossible)."

","300 which keeps me glued even for the thousandth time I see it (thats paraphrase). Though I feel Violence as the most immature way of dealing with conflict in the present day, I wonder how Zack Snyder created wholesome testosterone cum adrenaline gush through the male audience. It is a miraculous cinematography which is never seen before nor foreseen. Firstly, looking at the directorial aspect of the film, the first thing is to look at the dressing attire of the actors. Though sparsely dressed, it is very eye-catchy. The introduction showing the boy to warrior transformation where the boy takes a stride on the wolf, which is overtly shown as a big beast rather than an animal; the boy being beaten and trained to show no mercy puts adequate conditioning to the viewer's brain on how to perceive the mindset of the Greek warriors seen in the battlefield. The intricate thinking of the director revels throughout the film. There is a shot where the ground trembles while the king and the General were speaking. The general says: ""Earthquake"", the king replies,"" No Captain Battle formations"" tells the audience of the huge count of opponents the Greek warriors are going to face. Creating expectation is what the audience expect. Talking about the cinematography, one scene needs special mention. Right after the start of battle, the king cruises through the enemies in a single stroke killing them as he passes through. The whole shot is a single recording where the time slows down just before each kill to escalate the intensity of the king's skill in the war. It's a combined magic created by camera as well as editing. The portrayal of the king Leonidus as a pillar of strength is perfected. Though he's a king and a great warrior, he never loses his composure even when there is a heated argument.In conclusion, I'd say that film-making is all about provoking emotions and making the audience forget time and space.."

"gigan-92","9","3","4","9 April 2009"," Epic To Say The Least!
","Grade: A<br/><br/>This film by Zack Snyder, who is slowly starting to become one of my favorite directors, tells truly epic tale. When I first saw this film all I watched were the fight scenes (thanks to the miracle of TiVo), but upon buying the DVD, I've come to fully experience the film the way I was meant to.<br/><br/>Based on a graphic novel by Frank Miller, this is also based on an actual historical event. But with a twist obviously. So be it, the story flows nicely and the fantasy aspect of it keeps viewers interested. In fact, one will find it in contrast to the 'original' film ""300 Spartans"". With Snyder behind it, this is just a whole nother caliber. How the director has the movie filmed it reminds us it's based on a 'comic' book, but it hardly distracts.<br/><br/>The action scenes are epic and The Battle of Thermopylae will live on forever now. Watching the Spartans hack down the Persian Army never gets old, does it? The pride and honor of those 300 is what makes it a great story and also what makes the story so moving. Gerard Butler is perfect as King Leonidas, who has a final climatic showdown with King Xerxes himself, played by Rodrigo Santoro. Despite the epic battles and fantastic thrills, my favorite scene definitely is the final one as Dilios, played by David Weinham, gives the final speech. The music composed by Tyler Bates is so emotional and empowering it really up raises the film even further. Gotta love the sound track!<br/><br/>""Today we rescue a world from mysticism and tyranny, and usher in a future brighter than any can imagine. Give thanks men, to Leonidas, and the brave 300!

","I think a few people who reviewed this movie badly as racist, silly or inaccurate have got it wrong. It is not intended to be an actual account of what happened in the past, it has been told from the point of view of a survivor. He was creating a mythical account of a battle for his king to inspire others. A bit of a Shakespearean storyline was thrown in to fill the gaps between battle scenes. I do not think this movie set out to achieve anything more than portray a wicked mythical battle with men and some 'mythical' super creatures.<br/><br/>If they added realistic blood effects it would have been even better, but xxx I suppose."

","I thought the film looked pretty. Real pretty. It had the look of a video game. The look of the film is what makes it good in my book. However, other than that, there isn't much else. The film has pretty good acting and a pretty cool story based on the legend of the 300 Spartans versus the Persians. However, the cheesiness of the whole thing got in the way and the film just doesn't really recover from it. The crazy images and the over the top logic just made me almost pee my pants in the theater. It is a hilarious movie. I couldn't stop laughing. It was great. There were closeups of people grunting and growling in some of the weirdest ways. A lot of the characters acted so goofy that it was impossible for me to take them seriously. All of the warriors had six packs and eight packs, even the wicked thin dudes. The two parts that made me laugh the hardest were when the guy is pushed down the conveniently located endless pit, and when Xerxes appeared for the first time or as i like to call him, The Human Chandelier. He had so many ridiculous looking rings in his face that i could barely look at him without cracking up! And his voice!!! He sounded like a robot!!! He was weird looking. And then when that guy appeared with the buzz saws for arms, i just couldn't take it anymore. It was too ridiculous to be good. If you want to see a film that ensures nonstop laughter, I highly recommend 300."
"Sisiutil","5","3","4","2 October 2007"," Visually stunning, but ultimately disappointing
","Any period piece runs the risk of historical inaccuracy, and if it's done in the interest of story and entertainment, it's largely forgivable. But when the movie makes its own mistakes glaring, well, that's harder to forgive.<br/><br/>There's no denying 300 is a remarkable achievement in many respects. It's a feast for the eyes, and its use of virtual environments to create a distinct look will no doubt influence filmmakers in the near future and beyond. It's also part of a trend of successful movies that lack a huge ""brand name"" star, which I think is positive; Hollywood has become over-reliant on its star system, to the point where the stars' private lives matter more than the films. That being said, Gerard Butler's performance is nuanced and charismatic; he deserves to be a star, and maybe 300 will be his breakout vehicle.<br/><br/>But for me, 300 eventually fell flat, and unfortunately, it undermined itself. My problem with the film boiled down to a key scene, the one depicting the initial meeting between Leonidas and Ephialtes.<br/><br/>*SPOILERS FOLLOW* <br/><br/>Leonidas explains why he can't use Ephialtes in the phalanx formation: the crippled shepherd cannot properly hold his shield to protect the man beside him, a vital requirement for a phalanx to work. Later, during the initial Persian attack, we see the Phalanx in action, and see Leonidas' words ring true.<br/><br/>And then everything falls apart.<br/><br/>Phalanx fighting was essentially a big shoving match that could often last hours, and that certainly wouldn't have provided Zack Snyder with the ""cool"" fight scenes he wanted and that the fans of the movie adore. Then the Spartans suddenly, with no clear reason other than to look cool, break out of their Phalanx formation and start fighting individually. And the Persians, who were so numerous and bunched so tight only a moment before, are suddenly spread out to provide the Spartans with easily disposed-of targets.<br/><br/>I could even have lived with that; I mean I've watched and enjoyed plenty of kung fu movies where the bad guys conveniently attack Bruce Lee one at a time. But here's the crux of the matter: the battle scenes undermine what Leonidas told Ephialtes. Leonidas himself admits the shepherd has skill with a spear. So he could have been behind the phalanx's front line, then set free to fight when everyone else abandoned formation. So suddenly the Spartan king's rejection of Ephialtes is reduced from a logical decision to a mere plot device, motivating the shepherd to betray his fellow Greeks to Xerxes.<br/><br/>This free-form fighting goes on to further undermine the film's emotional impact. The loss of the Captain's son should have been a huge emotional moment; the loss of the youth symbolizes a loss of hope and presages the Spartans' ultimate defeat. But the moment is emotionally empty. Dilios describes the Captain's reaction as ""breaking formation"" and going ""blood-mad"". But visually, he's only doing what all the other Spartans have already been doing, just with a little more passion. Breaking formation from the phalanx should indeed have been a big deal, but instead it's just another opportunity for cool moves and spurting blood.<br/><br/>I had other problems with the film as well, such as the depiction of the Persians as unrelentingly evil, corrupt, and even monstrous. Not for politically correct reasons, but for aesthetic ones. In the best war films there is some form of recognition that in the enemy is a reflection of ourselves. That's not possible here, though I'll grant that the source material has the same problem. The sub-plot with Queen Gorgo is a distraction from the main action and seems like an attempt by the filmmakers to do the politically correct thing and show a strong woman character in the film.<br/><br/>In the end, though, 300 undermines its own potential. It's great eye candy but not much more than that. I've heard that Steven Pressfield's novel of the Battle of Thermopylae, Gates of Fire, was under development as a feature film and that 300 preempted it. That's too bad; the novel is a much more accurate, and more importantly, emotionally-rich depiction of the story, and I would have much preferred to see it brought to the screen. Unfortunately, that's unlikely now for a long time to come."

","I read the story of King Leonidas and the 300 Spartans many years ago when I was a very young girl. The decades since have given me a broader perspective, a new appreciation for the story and the nobility of the sacrifice these brave men made to protect what they held dear. That story struck a chord with me then and that chord resonates even deeper today. <br/><br/>Gerard Butler made this mythical hero a living, breathing flesh and blood man. And while the the event occurred in 480 BC, the principles and the ideals that were the spirit of King Leonidas and his brave 300 are ageless and timeless. Gerard Butler, as King Leonidas, made me feel his devotion to those ideals and his frustration as his efforts to save Sparta were thwarted and corruption threatened his beloved Sparta. He made me feel his love for his wife, his son, his men and all his people. He made me feel his courage. He simply IS Leonidas.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast, particularly Lena Headey and David Wenham, brought their characters to vibrant life for me as well and they all transported me back in time. They made me feel what it was like to be a Spartan in that ancient time on the brink of disaster, of enslavement. They made me feel their love and loyalty for Sparta and for their leader. <br/><br/>Aside from the fact that I feel 300 is simply great storytelling, there are many things about this film that are memorable to me. Especially King Leonidas final order, beautiful in its simplicity. <br/><br/>""Remember us, remember why we died."" <br/><br/>If nothing else, this film has brought King Leonidas and the 300 to life again, it has released them from the dust of old books and museums. This movie gave them a face and a voice and made me see them as men who loved, who felt and who were no strangers to hardship and death. As ordered by the King, I remember them. Now with this incredible film, I will never forget them. <br/><br/>Some things I will remember more than others, <br/><br/>I remember Leonidas instructions to Dilios and when asked if there is a message for the Queen he says 'None that need be spoken'. I have never seen a more poignant moment.<br/><br/>I remember him standing alone in front of his brave 300 knowing death was imminent.<br/><br/>I remember the heartbreaking moment his shoulders sagged and he removed his helmet and dropped his shield.<br/><br/>I remember his quiet but deadly curse for Ephialtes.<br/><br/>I remember the impact of seeing this great spirit, the bravest of the brave, sink to his knees and put his fists in the sand. <br/><br/>I remember his vision of his love.<br/><br/>I remember the explosion when he called to Stelios.<br/><br/>I remember the determination and fire in his whole being when he heaved that spear at Xerses and how he watched it sail through the air as the arrows pierced him until he saw Xerses bleed.<br/><br/>I remember his roar that screamed his death was not his defeat.<br/><br/>I remember his grasping Stelios hand as they shared their dying.<br/><br/>I remember his standing to say good bye to his Queen, his wife, his love<br/><br/>And finally I remember, majestic to the end, his opening his arms to embrace death.<br/><br/>I remember the mass of valiant, arrow riddled warriors with their torn and bloodstained crimson capes.<br/><br/>In their midst, with his eyes wide open, was their King. Their leader. <br/><br/>'Go tell the Spartans, thou who passeth by, that here, obedient to her laws, we lie.'<br/><br/>It was a moment in time. A moment of nobility, of sacrifice, of love. <br/><br/>Although in reality we know little of the actual details, we do know that King Leonidas and a brave band of Spartans fought a massive Persian army at Thermopylae. This movie makes it live again in a vibrant, mythological way. <br/><br/>So, his command is obeyed. King Leonidas and his brave 300 are being remembered by multitudes all over the world."

","If your looking for a documentary or for all questions to be answered, don't bother watching 300. The film is based on Frank Miller's stylized graphic novel. The graphic novel itself is based on the Battle of Thermopylae, with much artistic license taken. The Battle of Thermopylae is, without a doubt, one of the most famous battles in history, purportedly, still mentioned at military schools/colleges, even today, as a great example of a small force holding its ground against a much larger force, using terrain to its advantage. The exact details of this great battle are disputed among historians to this day. The movie does, however, stay pretty faithful to the novel. In my opinion, other than the unnecessary sexual elements, the movie was highly entertaining, and a must-see for action fans, with great over arching themes of doing the right thing, even in the face of death. If your looking for all loose ends to be tied up or a perfect history - go read some books."

","I have just seen this movie that has opened in my native Greece and I found it a strange cinematic experience. Although the graphics were superb the absolute emphasis of the movie on violence and to lesser degree to sex does not match my taste. I liked the concept of narration and the voice of the narration as I liked very much the presentation of the socialization of a Spartan warrior which created great hopes for the rest of the movie that were not fulfilled. What I did not especially like was the presentation of the Ephors- the ruling gerontocratic oligarchic body of Sparta- whose existence is testified by historical record- as a closed club of terribly disfigured old and greedy perverts whith a eye for gold and young virgins. It is true that the Ephors as all ruling elites were prone to corruption but to be presented as a form of old monsters with Saddean tendencies-a sort of perverted equivalent to the Sith Lords of Star Wars goes to far. The same extravagant treatment is received by the court of Xerxes which resembles the circle of Jabba the Hutt, the galactic gangster of Star wars. Why should the the king of Persia be presented as a megalomaniac gay with the look of habitu√© of sadomasochistic clubs? As for Ephialtes were did they find that he was an ancient equivalent of Quasimodo. Herodotus may not have been the most reliable of historians by modern standards but were did he mention that the Persians had monsters with them? People said that that we must not find political propaganda in what is merely an art form but I can not but observe that the Easterners get a very bad press in this movie and I can not escape the equation that Spartans and Greece are equated with the West and the Persians with Arab fundamentalists, Persian Islamists and all of the rest bad people. The orgy of violence of this movie is something that reminds one of kill bill. The world-view is also simplistic, war is the honourable path while politicians are liers, greedy and occasionally rapists. The way the Spartan lifestyle was presented in the movie-which is correct on the harshness and self-sacrifice- I do not find it so enviable a life-style to die for and certainly not preferable to that of the peaderastic and philosophizing Athenians( although I can not discover why people inclined to philosophizing are more prone to pederasty than warriors- is there any statistical proof?).I find that a lot of platitudinous stereotypes and clich√©s were reproduced by this movie which has a low level of political sophistication. The movie may have pathbreaking technology but my overall impression is negative."

","Firstly, The Iranian race is quite a mixed race, their ancestors include the Turkish, the Kurdish, the Baloch, Arabs, and the Persian.<br/><br/>Secondly, the Persians were descendants of Aryans, they used to talk a different kind of Farsi (very different actually, different from the Farsi that is currently spoken in Iran), their empire was invaded by Alexander the Great and their line of king was broken. A long time after that, the Parthians made the Greeks go away and took the empire back. The Parthians were also Aryans but had also different race from Persians. If we look at the population of Achaemenidians at that time (not the population of the whole country, Wikipedia notes 50 million which is because of the population of the conquered areas by the Persians at that time) we find out that the Achaemenidians are some kinda extinct.<br/><br/>So what I'm saying is if they hate the ""Iranians"" (Because of the political status going on currently), Why do they make this nonsenses about ""Persians""? It's so horrible that when you search Persia in Wikipedia it redirects you to Iran, Persia is the name of the area back in 2500 years ago! <br/><br/>And by the way, even knocking out a million hobos, or a million seventy year old drug addicts in the street takes more than 300 soldiers.

","The storyline is simple, but the visual is a revolutionary breakthrough. It's very rare to find a movie that could deliver such a new acceptable method. Last time, we were amazed by ""Matrix"" (1999). Apparently, it seems that thiz style of movie-making will be followed by other movies in the future. ""300"" is based on noir comic which is written by Frank Miller. Miller's creations are always filled by dark aspect, blood and beautiful battle. Miller is also known as the mastermind of ""Sin City"" (2005) and Batman's ""The Dark Knight"" (2008). The movie is directed by Zack Snyder. Snyder is success to combine his imagination with the latest Special Effects. The result is amazing. The movie looks like one painted portrayal by professional painter. The lighting and shadowing are mesmerizing. The movie is starred by mediocre performers such as Gerard Butler, Lena Headey, Dominic West, David Wenham and Michael Fassbender. I think the plot is based on recent issue. It's about Rome Spartans defends from Persian's aggression. Indirectly, it reflects on 9/11 incident but it is told in reverse. Anyway, thiz could be just a coincidence. The ending (Spoiler Alert!), King Leonidas and his 300 warriors died in the battle. But I very much understand the essence. The essence is about the struggling which is more divine than the victory itself. The movie like thiz always has a similar end, for example ""Braveheart"" (1995), ""The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc"" (1999), ""Gladiator"" (2000) and other similar movies.

I'm a big movie fan and i've seen all kinds of movies and of course all kinds ""huge budget for special effects"" movies. But this is something new. You wont find a historical or mythological war related movie that can compare. The visual effects are simply mind blowing, to me this Zack Snyder is ahead of his time, visually speaking. It's new, fresh and based on real facts that you can look up. Leonidas and his men actually did exist, they weren't exactly 300, more likely 1000 and killed over 20000 Persians. See this movie for the visual effects, not for the scenario or historical facts. Gerard Butler is truly amazing, great charisma, truly embodies Leonidas and gives the movie and additional epic touch.<br/><br/>This movie is a must for all the movie fan who are disappointed by the big budget blockbusters they've seen these past 10 years."
"pfgpowell-1","7","4","6","24 July 2009"," Quite a laugh really. Take it with a pinch of salt, relax and enjoy
","Whether you like, enjoy, rate or simply hate 300 depends almost entirely on what you expect. Don't expect history. Apart from the fact that the hero is the Spartan king Leonidas, fetchingly portrayed by a muscle-bound Scotsman in skimpy shorts and a cape, and the film portrays - very loosely - the historical battle of Thermopylae when a tiny Grecian force held a far larger Persian force at bay, this is more fiction than fact. For example, and quite crucially: a lot is made of 'freedom' in 300, that no Spartans will bow to the Persians etc blah, blah. 21st century demotic thought at its finest, paper-thin and millimetre deep. And fair enough: banging the drum about 'freedom' and 'liberty' always goes down well in the freedom and liberty-loving West which values freedom and liberty so much, it is prepared to sacrifice whole nations in the quest to introduce democracy to the world. The speech given by Leonidas's queen to the senate could have been written in the White House four years ago when it desperately tried to justify it invasion of Iraq. More pertinently for Hollywood, of course, a liberal use of the word freedom lends a spurious philosophical glamour to any dross they care to churn out. But inconveniently, Sparta had nothing to do with freedom: only one in five of the inhabitants of Sparta were free men. The rest, or most of them, were Helots, slaves who at a certain time of the year could be killed by any Spartan with impunity. So much for 'freedom'. But as I say, if you are looking for fact, don't bother with 300. If you expect a literary script, again the only sensible advice is to avoid 300. It you are averse to the graphic portrayal of gore, although gore redeemed by being so highly stylised that it is largely unreal, don't bother. If, on the other hand, you are quite entertained by slasher movies, sword and sorcery and all things Tolkienian (does the word exist?), give 300 whirl. Oddly enough I don't like slasher movies, sword and sorcery or all things Tolkienian at all, but as a piece of superior bubblgegum movie-making and movie-watching 300 somehow hits the spot. It is, it has to be said, complete and utter cobblers (and that is not an obscene word, dear American friends). But what I like is that it has no pretensions whatsoever. None at all. It follows in the tradition of Sin City, another film based on a graphic novel by Frank Miller, and its scenes (I read) follow the graphic panels of the novel virtually seamlessly. And that is the key to it. 300, like Sin City, is the graphic novel in movie form. Naturally, simply because it is a 'comic' doesn't mean it need not have literary quality but nor does it mean that it should have one either. The dialogue is almost of the 'Me Tarzan, you Jane' school of writing with one or two lines of cod philosophy. But neither is there a necessity that it should have a great script, and to criticise 300 because it doesn't have one misses the point entirely as does taking the film seriously on any intellectual level whatsoever. This is film-making, for goodness sake, money-making, entertainment. Viewed with that in mind and 300 can be forgiven quite a lot. So if it is way, way, way over the top, from the CGI-enhanced muscles of the Spartans and Xerxes, all metal piercing, eyeshadow and chains who is surely a gay icon somewhere to the quite impossible battle scenes, all of whom were so obviously generated on the latest Apple Macs, who cares. Was it a failing of P T Barnum's extravangazas that the elephants couldn't recite Shelley? 300 is way, way, way over the top and unashamedly proudly over the top, almost like the best drag act you have ever seen. As a piece of film-making 300 is not original - Sin City was merely because it got in there first - but in an odd sort of way it is still satisfying. So it doesn't matter that Leonidas sounds as though he is from Paisley in Scotland, or that Xerxes seems to have just arrived from a rich man's fetish party, or that The Immortals, the Persian king's fearsome bodyguard are superbly ridiculous. Who cares. 300 is an outright romp and none the worse for that. Elsewhere you will read, as always that this is either the best film ever made or so bad the director should have been jailed. It's neither. If you agree to it on its own terms, it is rather good. Shakespeare it ain't, but then anyone who has seen Titus Andronicus will know that sometimes Shakespeare wasn't, either."
"davideo-2","4","4","6","20 December 2007"," Comparable to Sin City and Gladiator, but is a shallow patch on both those far superior films
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br/><br/>Once upon a time, there were these nice people called the Spartans, who lived by respect and honour, and were raised from a young age to defend their people and their country at all costs. But then these nasty little meanies called the Persians came along and tried to overtake their land. But the brave spartans were having none of it, and lead by their brave leader Leonidas (Gerad Butler) stood up to them, had lots of big bloody battles and fought right to the end. Did they win? You'll have to find out...<br/><br/>Following the success of the brilliant Sin City, another Frank Miller 'graphic novel' has been adapted to the big screen, with identical style and visual flair. While SC was set on rainswept, dinghy backstreets featuring characters who shot at each other with guns and knives, 300 is set on wide-open battlefields featuring armies of opposing characters, who clash with swords and shields and fire at each other with hundreds of arrows. The style is just as cool, with slo-mo/sped up shots and flashy, realistic battle violence, and it's a style of filming I'm still getting used to. But somehow, it's never as thrilling as in SC.<br/><br/>Butler is clearly aiming to ape Russell Crowe's 'what we do in life...echoes in eternity' speech with his character Leonidas's 'tonight we dine in hell' battle cry but he's a poor man's Maximus Aurilius. The film has a surprising and sometimes effective use of humour in some scenes, but while this is a welcome addition, it doesn't distract from the slow, uninvolving story, the bland script and poor dialogue (as witnessed above.) <br/><br/>This is okay at best, really, some nice battle scenes and neat touches here and there, but never the sum of it's parts. Apparently it's historically inaccurate, too. This will only really bother those who study the history the film is based on, of course, but there's plenty more to bother everyone else. **"
"blowfly13","3","4","6","25 August 2007"," silly, and ease up on the abs
","As a fan of Gerard Butler, it pains me to say this movie was pretty silly. And derivative! Where do I start. The various weird creatures came from Lord of the Rings (and brought Faramir along with them). Gladiator - the lighting, the stop action, some of the music, and the scene in the wheat field at the end. I WAS happy to see Achilles' right hand man with the cool eyes from Troy repeat his role here as Leonidas' right hand man, but there's no missing that the scene where he gets killed is almost exactly like the scene in Excalibur where Arthur and Mordred kill each other.<br/><br/>As a chick, I thought I would love the amazing male bodies, but all those identical six packs and perfect legs marching along actually made me feel more like laughing. I guess the weird creatures and the political scenes were necessary to provide relief from what could have been a monotonous three days of killing, but the former were silly and the latter were boring. I was appalled when Leonidas' feisty wife instantly prostituted herself to get an army for her husband! Surely she would have known that would be the last thing he would want? Can we ever have a woman in a movie without lowering her to stripping or prostitution? I did love that thing Xerxes rode around in, and I liked his combination of feminine face with huge male body and amplified voice. But even the riding thing made me think of the god in Ghost Busters.<br/><br/>Other irritations: The too-long St. Crispin's Day speech at the end. The politician's slow clap, which made me want to kill myself. Somebody pass a law against the more-than-clich√©d slow clap! Leonidas' wife actually saying ""freedom isn't free"" - modern speech is so joltingly anachronistic in movies based on history. And removing the whole context of the battle so that it became a hopeless fight against tyranny rather than the actual highly successful resistance that enabled the Greeks to actually defeat the Persians - why???! The success of the battle against overwhelmingly odds was the most awesome part of it, and the reason it has never been forgotten.<br/><br/>In the end, the only good thing was Gerard Butler, his sexiness and intensity, and his Scottish accent that reminds me of my lifelong crush, Sean Connery. I think I'd watch Butler in anything. Even this."
"ebossert","5","4","6","4 August 2007"," Not Nearly As Good, Or As Bad, As People Are Saying
","I've been wanting to see 300 since it came out in theaters months ago, but my experience with Hollywood films prevents me from spending my hard-earned cash on something that will most likely turn out to be underwhelming. Let's just say that I'm glad I never saw this in the theater and instead used a ""free rental"" coupon.<br/><br/>Understand this. I don't care about historical accuracy. I don't care about the political undertones. I just wanted a cool action flick with entertainment value. What I got was something that is not nearly as good, or as bad, as people are saying.<br/><br/>I read a lot of reviews before seeing this, so I expected really bad acting. Fortunately, the acting was actually pretty good, and the storyline was not nearly as deficient as some critics were making it out to be. On the other hand, the most highly acclaimed aspect of this movie ¬ñ the fighting ¬ñ is the biggest disappointment. Let me explain why.<br/><br/>The first action scene starts at the 45-minute mark. The battle strategy is pretty good but the choreography is average. The true strength though is the fact that some segments consist of long, uncut sequences where the soldiers will kill numerous foes. This technique is admirable in an age of quick cuts that hide more than they show. The slow-mo to fast-forward camera speed is nicely applied as well. I'd say that the first battle is a success in terms of film-making.<br/><br/>The second action scene takes place at night against some ""immortals"", but for some unknown reason the Spartans completely abandon the ""shield-to-shield"" strategy that was so effective during the first fight. The huge zombie-like dude looked cool, but the duel between he and Leonidas was nothing memorable. The battle continues, but at this point the repetitive and unimaginative action choreography begins to expose itself, despite the presence of another long, uncut sequence. Every thrust and move has been seen only a few minutes earlier. It's almost like watching a replay. In addition, the decision of the Spartans to show off their 6-pack abs to the sacrifice of body armor plays out in quintessential stupidity.<br/><br/>The third action scene is at dawn against barbarians. A giant rhinoceros is taken out with a single spear strike ¬ñ not good. Some random general dude from Persia gets decapitated. Things start getting stupid, with lots of random stuff coming from everywhere (giant elephants, magicians, fat dudes with saws for arms, etc.), but none of them are on screen for more than a minute. It all feels so generic. Why not throw in some acrobats and circus clowns while you're at it? This is the cardinal sin of action, getting a bunch of generic dudes fighting, thus keeping the viewer completely detached and indifferent to what's happening or who's dying. Not good. Again, the battle strategy gets stupid, with two Spartans venturing out hundreds of yards away from their comrades to fight dozens of baddies on their own. When someone dies, I actually laughed instead of caring about them.<br/><br/>The finale is not only anticlimactic, but annoying. Leonidas dropped the ball with letting ""hundreds leave"" and ""a handful stay."" This is another cardinal sin of action film-making. You simply cannot have the final battle end so quickly and disappointingly. To summarize the action element of 300, I'll say that it was okay, but I've seen much better elsewhere. Just check out my user profile for examples.<br/><br/>With regards to cinematography, I'll be brief. Overall it was quite good, creating a fantasy-like feel throughout. However, I personally prefer the cinematography of recent Chinese wuxia pan films ¬ñ i.e., Hero (2002), House of Flying Daggers (2004), etc.<br/><br/>There are a few other aspects of 300 that drop it's overall enjoyability. The ""play-by-play"" commentary was superfluous and unnecessary. I can tell that ""the wolf begins to circle the boy"" or that the barbarians say ""forward"" without a narrator saying as such. Man, American audiences are getting more stupid by the day. Some other undesirable factors are as follows. The sinister laugh of the dude with the glowing eyes was stupid, and the boat disaster seemed totally random. A instrument-playing goat? Lots of hotties hovering around a horny hunchback mutant dude? The cheese flows, my friend. The cheese flows.<br/><br/>The flaws in logic are also underwhelming. Leonidas proves his infinite stupidity to turn down the hunchback's desire to fight, even though the hunchback told him he knew of the back passage to the Spartan's flank. Immediately following that very conversation (where the hunchback screams in anger at him), Leonidas tells his comrade that he prays the enemy doesn't find out about it. It would seem that a leader with an even marginal amount of common sense would have considered the betrayal of the hunchback, and would have let him tag along (or simply stuck a spear through his head) to prevent the possible exposure of their flank position. Leonidas instead insulted him, then let him go. Moronic, to say the least.<br/><br/>Let's talk about another idiot ¬ñ the dude who double-crosses the queen. He was bribed by Xerxes with gold coins. So what does he do? He takes a big bag of these gold coins ¬ñ with Xerxes' face on each and every one ¬ñ to a council meeting! After being stabbed the coins fall out and the jig is up. Nice job dumbass.<br/><br/>In the end I give 300 a rating of 5, since it has a few decent action sequences and good cinematography. It's nothing to write home about, though. And if you choose not to rent it, you won't be missing much. In fact, do yourself a favor and check out some of the action films listed on my user profile. Time better spent indeed."

"veronicabuffoni","1","33","84","26 February 2007"," Bloody awful!!
","I saw this movie as part of the Dublin film festival and it was one huge disappointment!! In fact it was so bad it made me feel really angry that it could be so trite. I like Frank Miller novels and I really enjoyed the exciting pace, the innovative style and cartoon-like gore of Sin city, which I thought was great; and I am a big fan of big visually stunning movies, old and new, and action flicks (Ben Hur, star wars, LOTR etc). But 300 I found really, really bad.<br/><br/>First of all, it is full of clich√©s with lines like ""I never told him how much I loved him"", which the Captain says after his son dies in battle (predictable!), or ""enjoy your breakfast for tonight we dine in hell"" (Arnie would be proud!). Even Gladiator has better lines than this, and that was a pretty poor movie. Similarly the love story between the Leonidas and the Queen was plain Hollywood drivel and pointless to the film's plot - clearly it was only there so that the filmmakers could include the obligatory sex scene.<br/><br/>There is no character development whatsoever, because the action moves so fast, so actually you don't care about who dies. A lot of scenes are lifted straight from other movies (the arrow scene from Hero; most of the battle scenes, and especially the overview of the battlefield and the rhino charging from LOTR; even the ships scene from Troy).<br/><br/>Xerses is one big camp villain in the best ""Carry-On"" style who just looks so ridiculous, it amazes me how the Spartans did not break down laughing at his Darth-Vader impersonation, though Leonidas does his best to live up to the comedy factor with his cheeky-chappie lines (e.g. when asked by Xerses to kneel, Leonidas responds that he can't because he has a pain in his leg, from killing too many Persians. I mean COME ON).<br/><br/>This film is one big video game, from the flying limbs and fighting scenes down to the hard rock guitar riffs on the soundtrack, and maybe that was the point of it, but if that's the case then why not make it into a game in the first place??<br/><br/>I have only one positive comment to make and that is that the actors all really seem to put their hearts in it (and their bodies, given that they must have trained pretty hard to get to such required physical condition, which was impressive), but to me that is small consolation in an altogether incredibly bad movie."

I had read mostly good reviews of it and I went to the cinema with high expectations, so I was really surprised to notice how childish it actually is. Most of the discussions here focus on the historical accuracy of the film. Well, it's based on a comic book, that's not the point. If i think it was bad it's plain and simply because the script and the storyline seem to be written by a five year-old boy a bit obsessed with violence. It's full of clich√©s, empty words repeated a million times before (braveheart, for instance) pretending to sound epic, one-dimensional characters, absolutely predictable situations and ending and so on. Yeah, I know it primarily intends to entertain and it is not supposed to be profound, but all reasons explained above make it laughable, not entertaining. And well, about if it is fascist and racist, yeah, it is, absolutely. I just couldn't believe all the nazi admiration for the superior spartan race and how amazingly the movie fitted with the situation of America in the war in middle east (america=spartan=freedom, asians=persians=vicious, gay, bomb terrorists,enemies of freedom).

"ikaros-3","6","11","23","20 March 2007"," Nice try.
","First, let me say that 300 was a good movie.<br/><br/>However, it wasn't a *great* movie.<br/><br/>Our print was grainy (I'm told a hazard of shooting Super 35), and the line between the set and the green-screen effects was painfully obvious. Periodically switching between ancient-inspired music and loud thrash guitar was annoying and distracting.<br/><br/>Flaws in the green-screening aside, the visual design was stunning, there are no two ways about it. Several scenes were not merely inspired by Miller's work, they clearly took extra pains to *duplicate* Miller's art in a moving medium--a daunting task under any circumstances and several times pulled off with staggering precision. The violence--and there's a lot of that, too--is softened a bit by its game-like rendering. The performances were good, and Gerard Butler was magnificently intense as Leonidas.<br/><br/>But.<br/><br/>And let's be absolutely clear about this.<br/><br/>The very last thing that Sparta would have gone to war for was 'freedom'. If you know the slightest history of that era, you know that. And when Snyder and Johnstad and Gordon decided to replace the graphic novel's central theme of 'duty' with 'freedom', they took a movie that I could've easily given an 8 or 9 to, to one that I can in good conscience give no more than a 6.<br/><br/>Dispensing with heavy Spartan armor to emulate the classical Hellenic 'heroic nude' style is one thing: it's stylistic, and is in keeping with the look of the era as passed down by the great sculptor Phidias (a young contemporary of the actual events at Thermopylae, though certainly not there himself) and his even greater successor, Praxiteles.<br/><br/>Dispensing with the entire reason the original 300 (and allies) died is another matter entirely: it's revisionism, nothing more. Sparta was emphatically not a state built on freedom, and had even less interest in preserving their great rival Athens' democracy (with whom Sparta promptly went to war once Persia's invasion was finally repulsed and the Greek peninsula was safe).<br/><br/>Worse, it's the sort of revisionism that weakens the whole story from beginning to end, and reduces what could've been a great movie to a merely good movie.<br/><br/>6/10, and I think it'll look better on your TV than it did on the big screen.

"diac228","8","11","23","9 March 2007"," 300 is all guts, all glory, and mercilessly violent. Yea, that sounds exactly like the battle it was portraying
","Shooting an entire movie using a green screen had been done before, but was perfected by Robert Rodriguez and his crew with Sin City, one of the most stylish films in cinema history. Same strategy for bringing a Frank Miller comic into the big screen was brought into shooting 300. Shooting virtually the entire film using the latest in green screen technology, audiences around the world are able to see yet another one of Miller's highly acclaimed works on the big screen. But, unlike Sin City, 300 seems to be inconsistent in its slick, raw style. Yet underneath the few moments of questionable imagery lie plenty of substance, great acting, fantastic directing, and a really powerful and nicely woven story. Boldly being able to go where previous epic movies just weren't able to go, 300 is another successful Frank Miller comic book adaptation that is sure to please fans and bring in some new ones as well.<br/><br/>We have a very straightforward story here: in 480 B.C. Sparta is in grave danger, and their king, King Leonidas (Gerard Butler), isn't about to give up the kingdom without a fight. Defying all odds, he and his really small army of just 300 men take on the most vicious army human history at the time had ever witnessed. To be even more specific, 300 is basically a glorified look at the Battle of Thermopylae. While they all knew how it was going to end, their impact on the impending conflict amassed into a level that not even they could predict. Written by Frank Miller (and painted by his ex-wife Lynn Varley, who also provides the colors in this movie), 300 is not an adaptation but more like a translation (Something Rodruiguez claimed he was doing with Sin City), since it pretty much takes everything from the comic book and transforms it to film.<br/><br/>Frank Miller time and time again has proved that he can make a good story, but it is up to others to be able to display this quality storytelling to others in another format. For the most part it succeeds, but then at other times, it doesn't. Zack Snyder deserves the most credit in making this an entertaining film. He plays with the speed of the story and hands it to us in a very stylish manner. The movie goes slow-motion, Matrix-slow even, and then on another instance goes insanely fast. Even better is that he does not hide the fights by zooming in on everyone, there is plenty of room on the screen to see all the carnage, and the well-choreographed fights. There were some epic battles in the graphic novel, and Snyder perfectly transcends it to the screen.<br/><br/>The acting is superb as well. Gerard Butler, the main actor, resembles a scarier, more fearful-looking Russel Crowe from Gladiator. The standout star in 300 though is not him but instead his wife, played magnificently by Lena Headey. She proves to be more than just a pretty face involved in a sex scene as her acting stands out amongst the men, just like the queen's personality standing out amongst a nation of males. There is no instance of overacting or under acting, everyone else did a respectable job.<br/><br/>300 is gritty, raw, and isn't afraid to throw body parts and limbs at you. It is not as violent or sadistic as Sin City, but it still can make you look away from the screen in disgust. The blood and guts however is not Sin City-style, but resembling more like Kill Bill Vol. 1's final epic showdown. Most of 300's humor comes from the mere disposing and treatment of bodies that lie all over the place, while the rest of the little bit of comic relief in 300 derives from quick and witty one-liners that occur from time to time. It is indeed action-packed, but does have its hint of sentimentality, especially involving the relationship between the king and queen.<br/><br/>Where 300 fails is not the writing, the pacing, the acting, or the content. Instead, it's the green screen usage. It is extremely hard to live up to what Sin City pulled off, but 300 still could have been better visually. The fights were great, but when the action slows down it then becomes rather obvious that a green screen was involved. With Sin City, it was like looking into a living, breathing comic book, and you were totally swept in it. 300 on the other hand has its moments in which the green screen usage overwhelms the scene, best examples includes the characters looking into the background, the scenery. With a green screen, you can only use so much of it before it starts looking a bit fake and/or out of place. Snyder's one flaw comes here, when the viewer is forced to look into the surroundings. Rodriguez had a perfect balance between the subjects and the scenery; Snyder did not. The only other flaw, and it's a minor one, is the treatment of Xerxes; supposed to be menacing, instead comes off as laughable with the make-up and the voice that obviously does not match the actor.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: 300 is a good film, and is indeed epic, but do not expect it to sweep you away and change cinema for years to come. Sin City set the bar much too high with green screen usage, and even though 300 is action-packed and is heavy with content; its visual imagery just wasn't consistent enough to really awe anyone. Instead, the awes come from the queen, the fights, and well, the fights. While it is nowhere near as bloody and mind-numbingly violent as Sin City, it still is a film that will attract more men than women, even if there are hundreds of buff men revealing almost all their assets. Flawed, but violently fun."

","It was another try of the west to look itself good by creating the ""Other"". In the past couple of centuries the west has been trying to link itself to ancient Greece to claim an ancient heritage. (not to mention that this linking is not historically accurate and modern Western civilization is NOT a heir of ancient Greece). Meanwhile, the Persians have been used as the ""Other"" to stand for whatever the west is ""not"" about.<br/><br/>This movie is another try of the West to make itself look desirable by trashing ""other"" people's cultures and civilization.<br/><br/>They must have some nerves to draw such false images of Persians (nude, hairless, brown) while there are hundreds of bas relief in historical sites showing Persian kings and soldiers in their fancy robes and well groomed beards hair.<br/><br/>That's the actual portrait of Xerxes: http://concise.britannica.com/ebc/art-15300.

","I heard nothing but praise for 300. Having seen it, I must say I was sorely disappointed.<br/><br/>The main praise came from the film's unique look. Unique? Yeah, it looks like an XBOX game turned movie. And the dialogue makes it look even more like that (""Let's go for a walk¬Ö"" Meanwhile, I'm thinking: ""New Level! Kill the Persian Sentries!""). As for the performances, the only actor who was really good was Gerald Butler. His character was the only interesting one! Everyone else was really dull and boring. <br/><br/>The beginning of the movie? Completely messed up. Irrelevant sex, killing a wolf in the wintertime to become king (?), etc. The movie was constantly slowing down then speeding up (I grew completely sick of this by the end- just about everything seemed to be in slo-mo), the blood spatters were overemphasized, over-exaggerated, and quickly became ""same old, same old"", people jumped ten feet away when they were stabbed (?), legs and hands were chopped off with no difficulty whatsoever, demons and deformed monsters fight for the Persians, and there's also the ""tank"" (whose main role is to provide the king with an opponent that lasts more than 35 seconds)¬Ö. Why all the praise for Snyder's direction style? I don't know. I hated it! And when we get to the historical inaccuracies, this movie takes the prize. I understand a movie can and should take artistic license, but rewriting history to this extent is unbearable!<br/><br/>The only part of the film worth watching is from the final battle onwards (although even then, there are a few ""uhm¬Ö."" moments). So, to conclude, 300 is completely unjustified in all the praise it's gotten. Appealing to the superficial teen audience after gore, perhaps, but not a deep film in the least. A much better ""Greece"" movie is ""Troy"". It took plenty of liberties with Homer's Iliad, but at least it turned out as a good-to-watch movie, and not the year's annual gore-fest."

","Before you start criticizing me for giving this film such a low score, there are a few things that perhaps you should pay attention to. As a professor of ancient history at a medium sized U.S. university, I am absolutely stunned at how can someone spend so much time and energy to create a film based on a real event without any regards for picking up a history book. I teach freshman class classical history of ancient Greece. I don't like to make myself sound like I am know-it-all when it comes to ancient history of Greco-Persian wars, but i have studied it for eight years, with some professors that are nationally respected. This film is not serious in displaying one of the greatest moments in history, as it happened, but it attempts to show it through the eyes of Frank Miller and Lynn Varley (comic book writers). First of all, nothing against Miller and Varley, as comic book artist. They bring a new taste of comic book art to film. The problem with this film is that it takes something that is considered sacred by many historians and butchers it to the end degree. Hollywood, as we all know, is after money, nothing else. But have some courtesy when you present history, especially the events that have been studied by every nation in the world and agreed upon, not to make a joke out of it. 95% of the film is falsely representing the Greeks, ancient warfare, culture, lifestyle, and lets not forget the Persians, who are apparently not even humans. If you want to know anything about the battle of Thermopile, read a book, a great one is ""The Greek and Persian Wars 499-386 BC"" by Philip de Souza."

Those were real human beings who deserve to be represented with some degree of fidelity. 300 is an advanced ""Triumph of the Will"" with special effects to dazzle the audience into a frenzy of hatred. I think that if any ethnic group in the United States were misrepresented as the Persians are in this movie it would be grounds for defamation if not labeled a hate crime.

","Poor history and suss politics aside, I can't remember the last film I saw that I was so uninvolved with? For a film about a great battle it was strangely bloodless. There was no real sense of violence I thought, all that blood that seemed to explode from people just seemed to vanish into thin air.<br/><br/>And the cinematography seemed oddly detached from any sense of place. You just knew that the whole thing was filmed on a set, and as for Sparta, I have seen more convincing cities in 1970/80s vintage Dr Who! This could have made a great silent movie. I have't had to endure such atrocious dialogue since... hmmm.... the last Star Wars film perhaps (and perhaps not even then - maybe Gladiator)? Some of the visuals were compelling (the tree of corpses) but nothing I hadn't seen before. The child/wife/wheat field scenes were lifted straight out of Gladiator as was the faux Lisa Gerrard vocalizations. In fact I find it hard to think of a single original idea contained within the film. Even the end titles (which were possibly the best thing in the entire film - not least cos it meant it was the end of the film) seemed to be a bit of a rip off from Casino Royale.<br/><br/>Not the worst film I have ever seen, but a pretty pointless one none the less."

How this movie was possibly made and gone into no.1 in the box office? Patriotism gone so dumb that could forgive this political suicide?

What was the justice they were fighting for when their people never agreed in war, isn't that what dictator only could do? Also what a portrait to describe queen as somehow mindless whore, and what was the necessary of sex scene with politician? Is there a necessity? I have wondered if this movie is some kind of gay porn with head-chopping very unfunny humor embedded. Also what on earth David Wenman's accent came from? Did he tried to speak Greek in English? This is shocking from Warner Bros, provoking and selling the message of war, justifying violence, is so unflattering. Justice has been served, in the end.

This is a very weak and uniformed perspective on history of ancient Greece and Persia. I don't know what to recommend as good things in this movie so I don't. I've seen it and felt nothing, when it was over I was in the same state as in the beginning. The lines are so dumb even those that contain the word ""freedom"" and this is a hard thing to do. I admit that Gerard Butler can howl but this is not enough to convince."
"leumas3765","4","9","18","26 March 2007"," Another live-action cartoon
","Plenty of people will argue that 300 is SUPPOSED to be the way it is (preposterous and ultra-violent) because it is a faithful adaptation of Frank Miller's graphic novel. I'm not one to argue with that point of view. I am not familiar with the novels, but I am willing to believe the multitudes who write that the movie is dead-on in that respect.<br/><br/>Whether that makes for an enjoying cinematic experience is another story. There's no doubt that it is an interesting movie to look at. At least for a little while. ""300"" offers up slayings by the boatload and some wicked looking (if perplexing) creatures. There are plenty of people out there (and you may be one of them) who are completely satisfied by multiple angles and variable camera speeds of slashing and thrusting. If you thought the LOTR battles were great but all the talking slowed things down, this may be just the movie for you.<br/><br/>If you require that movies you enjoy have things like ""engaging dialog"" and ""characters you care about"" you may feel disappointed. Don't make the mistake I did and think liking ""Sin City"" means that you will like ""300."" A lot of the dialog in this movie sounds like it was borrowed from commercials for the Army and the Marines, (at least before it was An Army of One) and most of it is yelled. Unfortunately, the dialog from the non-warrior characters is even worse.<br/><br/>There are many other angles to this movie that other reviewers have explored, such as elephant abuse and good guys = light skin and bad guys = dark skinned perverts. While I found those topics fascinating the things I really wondered about after watching 300 were <br/><br/>1) Was there ANYTHING in this movie that would appeal to women? If you were going to make an R-rated movie that only guys would like, I'm pretty sure this is how it would look.<br/><br/>2) Has there ever been a movie about professional warriors where at least SOME of the people had chipped or missing teeth? There were a lot of gruesome scars on just about every character, but only the freaks (lepers, guys in chains, etc.) had bad teeth. Maybe part of the Spartan warrior training includes visits to an orthodontist. Bad teeth seems to be a huge Hollywood taboo. <br/><br/>3) How and when did British accents become the all-purpose foreign accent? Just like bad teeth, would Greek accents and Persian accents be too off-putting for American audiences? This isn't a call for more realism, especially in a movie like ""300."" Movies do this ALL THE TIME, especially when the movie is ""historical,"" whether or not the characters spoke English.<br/><br/>To conclude this rambling review, I want to go on record stating that for all 300's faults, bad acting was NOT one of them. Gerard Butler (King Leonidas) played The Stranger in an obscure movie from Scotland called ""Dear Frankie,"" and that role was maybe 175 degrees away from King Leonidas."

For these reasons, I was really disappointed when I found myself checking to see how long I had been in the theater, and hoping that it was long enough.<br/><br/>It's not the constant fighting, which is quite visually impressive. It's not the lack of historical accuracy, which I wasn't expecting. It's not even the dialog, which could admittedly use some work. It's really just the delivery of the dialog.<br/><br/>I'm okay with overly dramatic movies, but in this movie everything is exactly the same. There are really only two ways anybody says any of the lines; quietly intense and angrily defiant.

Fantastic use of lighting and an excellent job of cinematography.<br/><br/>The story however was extremely weak. You'd think that a great epic battle that has survived more than 2500 years would be portrayed more fully and attractively, but I'm saddened to say that many aspects of the original plot was ignored to make room for an almost completely fighting movie. In addition, I found the entire dialog to be non-original as if it was copy pasted from a bunch of other movies. <br/><br/>I thought the first half an hour of the movie was very decent, it was thereafter that the dialog became extremely repetitive and corny. For instance, Leonidas giving the same speech over and over again in front of his army. Some things didn't even make any sense, as at one point he says something and an hour later he retracts it. <br/><br/>Battle scenes take almost 90% of the movie. I love the battle scenes but after seeing an hour of that I grew tired, to be honest I was bored. I want to see 2 hours of fighting I order a UFC pay per view, when I watch a movie I want a decent plot and turn of events.<br/><br/>Loud and deafening, my friends and I all came out of the movie with headaches, and I'm used to loud sounds and noises. Leonidas especially grows louder and louder by the end, to the point you just don't want to hear him again.<br/><br/>I have no idea what's the purpose of all the ugly faces and lepers in the movie, or the Hunchback of NotreDamme for that matter.<br/><br/>I must say I was disappointed greatly, and do not recommend this movie at all unless you're a guy under 18.<br/><br/>In the end, I must say I can't believe anyone can get offended by this movie, I have read reviews of people from both Greek and Persian backgrounds, and this movie is so ridiculous that can only offend a child. 5 out of 10."
"kelgbarbarian","10","9","18","13 March 2007"," I Loved, but I understand
","This has to be one of my favorite movies. I am a historical nerd and I know (probably better than most) the inaccuracies of this movie. The phalanx was wrong, the Spartan's wore armor, the Persian Immortals were not zombie-oid. It is highly unlikely that there were elephants, and impossible for there to be rhinos. Xerses didn't believe he was a god, however he was the semi-divine servant of God, etc. etc. However this movie as a whole blew me away. I understood when I saw this movie that it was not meant to be die hard historical accurate (though I am happy they didn't put big S on their shields as I saw some moron do), it was not meant to be fascist racism (though I can understand sort of how you got that idea from). This movie was above all a movie of glory and self sacrifice. It also gave a very good detail about everyday life in Lakonia (except for the Ephors bit). People have given arguments that there are some over macho lines in this movie. And I say, ya but that's how they talked. The Spartan's invented the form of speech referred to as laconic, meaning to give short pointed, often aggressive, responses. The fight in the shade, birth to real men, Persians come and get them, those were all really said by the Spartans. For inaccuracies yes I can understand how it may annoy some people, but this was not about making a documentary on the battle. This movie was about making a legend. It is told in Dilios view to embellish. It was trying to make 300 a version of Greek Mythology, as powerful as the exploits of Herakles. Calling this movie racist is the equivalent of calling The Ten Commandments anti-Egyptian, they just happen to be the enemy of the story, as the Persians are now. Should this movie have come out during a war in Iraq, I will admit probably not. However I'm not here to grade the movie on the politics of the time, but the quality of the movie."

","A historical film or a film about history must follow ethical principles. Art must be in service of culture and humanity. Somebody may say ""come on, it is not a historical film, it is just for amusement"". If one wants to produce a mythic film (unreal) just for amusement or fun, he (she) should not name the real persons and countries for his (her) unreal characters. For example, The Lord of Rings had a correct way. But,300 is a huge distortion of history. A glorious history was distorted to barbarian behaviors. Also, a historical film must be decorated according to historical books and monuments. Not only for the pictures of persons, but also for the dresses of soldiers, equipment, etc. I have seen a picture from Xerxes in a Persian translation of The Histories (by Herodotus) refers to the book published in Athens in 1976, page 620. I don't know it is real or it is an artist picture. However, there are numerous relieves of Achaemenid kings on the walls of Persepolis palace and in other monuments.<br/><br/>But why did I mention a glorious history? <br/><br/>*Xerxes was son of Darius the great and Atossa, the daughter of Cyrus the Great. Cyrus the great unified smaller kingdoms from the Greece borders in the west to the Indus River in the east with justice. ""I freed the citizens of Babylon from the yoke of servitude"". Cyrus declared the first human rights charter at 500 BC, e.g., freedom of religions, etc. He allowed the people to continue worshiping their gods and have their temples, despite his own monotheist believes.<br/><br/>*Old Testament explain good about Cyrus the Great (see Book of Ezra).<br/><br/>*Cyrus freed Israelites who were slaves in Babylon.

","Wow I really can't believe how lopsided all these reviews are, either people hate it or people love it. There seems to be almost no one who is in the middle on this one. It's a shame however, that most of the negative reviews all focus on the same few things. Yes it's true that there were some ugly representations of Persian soldiers in this movie, but if you're going to make a movie that is about a comic book, you're going to have to stay true to that book. Also to just clear some things up a lot of the monsters and the freaky looking beast were not actually from Persia...*whisper* they were just part of the Persian army. You know, from countries conquered by Persia. I thought Xerxes looked pretty normal...tall too, and he was actually Persian. Haha come to think of it, I read a review that said it was OK that the Persians looked like monster in the comic but they should have been more sensitive in the movie. According to that review he wouldn't mind racism in comic books...but his movies he will not stand for it. Really quite funny actually.<br/><br/>Also a lot of people are complaining about there being to much post production. Is that actually a bad thing? I thought the movie looked beautiful, that scene where the Spartans are looking at the tree with all the bodies covering it, that was a stunning display of the beauty that is post production(and it was a tree with dead bodies nailed to it lol). Actually I thought the whole movie had this very beautiful stylized look.<br/><br/>As well why are people complaining about how the Spartans looked? I read a review where a guy said they looked like chip'n'dales dancers. I can't seem to find out why people think there is something wrong with the Spartans actually looking like well defined warriors. If you would stop being so mesmerized by their abs, you would realize that ""Hey they all look the same...same size same shape, and you can't really see any veins...why do they all look like this?"". Well young Skywalker, that would be due to the insane work out routine the actors were put on. Everyone trained to be smooth and defined. They were all molded to look identical, like what a real warrior would look like. They were suppose to look like soldiers that could get together in a group of say, oh I dunno 300, and go fight a massive invading army all on their own. So you know *whisper* they might need too look like they were in pretty good shape.<br/><br/>About the story line and the minimal character development. The thing about the minimal character development is that all of the Spartans were essentially the same. They were trained to be the ultimate warriors. They were told to go into a battle which would probably mean their death, and that was cool with them. There was nothing else to think about but their glorious death in battle. Only one character really matter: Leonidas. Leo was the man who had to make all the decisions, and the decisions were pretty simple: go into battle, fight, and maybe die. End of story.<br/><br/>Bottom line this movie looks great, it sounds great, it has great action sequences, and some really powerful moments. Plus Gerard B as Leonidas was perfect. When that man was yelling at his troops, you actually believe he wants them to do something. (I mean I almost jumped out of my seat it was so powerful). Don't be fooled by the haters of CG animation. Don't be swayed by the sensitive people who want you to think that because the bad guys look scary that you shouldn't see this movie. It was great, even my girlfriend liked it which was definitely weird cause I thought girls might be turned off by all the fighting and blood and dead bodies and what not. So yea go see it...now...NOW! Why are you still here reading reviews about a movie that you should be watching? Go...hurry before its too late...oh great now you missed it. Way ta go."

As to impressions throughout the film, it wasn't something one should expect historical accuracy as it's largely visual effect and setting with a lot of over the top comic rendering of characters. The good guys (assuming you side with the spartans) all look like they stepped out of Charles Atlas ads, have too much adrenaline and speak like they could bark out 'Sunday! Sunday!

Sort of unnecessary 'Meanwhile back at the ranch...' goings on. What was going on was pretty farcical at best and distracting if you mostly just wanted to see more battle. The plot, that there was didn't gain much from whatever antics.<br/><br/>Battle scenes, well, gosh, I mean if we're going over the top, why isn't there more blood? When a limb or head gets lopped off, did the heart stop beating already? When there was any it looked like it came out of a squirt gun. Fighting with swords and spears is extremely bloody business and with all this testosterone running amok, why so little blood? It had a World Wrestling Ensemble sort of look and feel -- fighting but no serious injuries sustained -- like some were actually just rubber suits or sommat.<br/><br/>All in all, it may be comic fare, but I didn't think an epic historical battle of such significance was treated respectfully. So, is this back to comics being for juvenile minds or can we expect artistic representations of more world history to come?"

","i am so sorry for my wasted time. this movie is really awful. And full of plagiarism. You can smell the atmosphere of Gladiator, Troy and The Lord of the Rings. I can say that its a nice mixture of them. These kind of hero tales are old now. Big Brother's Hollywood must find out the new subjects. there is no details or perspective of characters. Who are Spartans? Who are Persians? Why do they fight? Just 300 people against thousands... This is so funny.. besides the effects are not efficient. If you use computer effects, you have to use it sufficiently. If you use blue-box which means you have incredible possibilities, you have to use it sufficiently. The score is good but not enough to make us feel higher... No longer i can write my feelings, just i am so sorry for my valuable two hours"

","The reason I decided to watch this movie is because it was getting rave reviews on IMDb among other places and it was also recommended to me by a friend. SO anyways I sat through 300 and noticed a couple things. First, I became extremely bored half way through the movie. I noticed myself spacing out as I realized that beyond the flashy visuals there was really nothing to 300. It had all the makings of an average movie. The battle scenes were not only clich√© but they became repetitive as the same thing seemed to happen in each one. The CGI characters seemed straight out of Lord of the Rings and there were a couple boob shots as well as the persistent shots of ripped male abs to keep the audiences attention. After all was said and done I realized this movie was just a money machine ready to be advertised and marketed towards testosterone driven men and maybe even some women who might appreciate the ripped abs which were exposed. These exposed abs did not seem like a good battle uniform. Not to say I don't appreciate cool visuals as I loved Sin City but this movie just seems less like a film and more like a flashy product being advertised on MTV."

By the halfway point, I couldn't wait for the Spartans to die.<br/><br/>The bad parts: <br/><br/>*There are far too many scenes of billowing fabric.<br/><br/>*The Spartans don't have a scratch on their bodies until the very end. *The Persians are either Monsters or don't look like Persians.<br/><br/>*There is no explanation for why King Xerxes is 7 feet tall and dressed like a belly dancing transvestite.<br/><br/>*The gratuitous nude breasted oracle scene - so obviously filmed underwater.<br/><br/>*The bellowing *King Leondias weird beard -- the weirdness really obvious in profile<br/><br/>*The glorification of a militaristic culture that gladly committed infanticide<br/><br/>*The battle scenes had no suspense--here come the Persians, watch the outnumbered Spartans kill them all. Here comes another wave, watch the Spartans kill them all.

","It is a proved scholarly fact that the Persian Empire in 480 B.C was the most magnificent and civilized empire. Established by the Cyrus the great, the writer of the first human right declaration, Persians ruled over significant portions of Greater Iran, the east modern Afghanistan and beyond into central Asia; in the north and west all of Asia Minor (modern Turkey), the upper Balkans peninsula (Thrace), and most of the Black Sea coastal regions; in the west and southwest the territories of modern Iraq, northern Saudi-Arabia, Jordan, Israel, Lebanon, Syria, all significant population centers of ancient Egypt and as far west as portions of Libya. Having twenty nations under control, encompassing approximately 7.5 million square kilometers, unquestionably the Achaemenid Empire was territorially the largest empire of classical antiquity.<br/><br/>Based on the Zoroastrian doctrine, it was the strong emphasis on honesty and integrity that gave the ancient Persians credibility to rule the world, even in the eyes of the people belonging to the conquered nations (Herodotus, mid 5th century B.C). Truth for the sake of truth, was the universal motto and the very core of the Persian culture that was followed not only by the great kings, but even the ordinary Persians made it a point to adhere to this code of conduct.<br/><br/>I did not expect Warner Bros. Picture company, as one of the world's largest producers of film and television entertainment to ignore the proved obvious historical facts, and damage its own reputation by showing the Persian army at the battle of Thermopylae as some monstrous savages, and thus create an atmosphere of public mistrust in its content, and hurt the national pride of the millions of Persians while doing so. WHEN IN ANCIENT Iran MEN AND WOMEN ARE EGUAL,IN Greek WOMEN HAVE SECOND DEGREE,UNFORTUNATELY DIRECTOR'S 300 DIDN'T HAS ANY INFORMATION ABOUT PERSIA AND IRANIAN CULTURE AND PEOPLE.HE ONLY WANTED TO MAKE A FILM FOR DESTROYED MIND ABOUT Iran,THIS IS KIND OF POLITICS THAT WILL BE DESTROY WORLD'S MIND ABOUT IRAN'S EMPIRE BUT YOU MUST KNOW PERSIAN ARE VERY KIND,CLEAN AND CLEVER NOT WILD PEOPLE.THATS A BIG LIE OF STORY.THATS A BIG LIE OF PERSIAN HISTORY.WHEN PERSIA HAD CIVILIZATION America AND EUROPE WERE WILD.PLEASE READ THE ORIGINAL NAD REALLY HISTORY TOO UNDERSTAND PERSIAN PEOPLE WERE CIVILIZED WHEN Americans PEOPLE DON'T HAVE ANY CULTURE.THEY WERE ONLY SOME IMMIGRATORS AND WILD!

The film becomes so boring despite of trying to make it fascinating by a huge amount of bloody fighting. The conversations are awful and senseless. There is no feeling of glory or sympathy. Women in the movie are divided into two groups. One group are lesbians and whores and the other which are pure. Unfortunately the second group is empty in the movie. Women are just shown to be misused. The movie is so slowly advanced which is fatal for a war movie. you see no amazing strategy or something that reasonably shows how can the spartan kill such a huge amount of Persian worriers. The film is more like an animation movie, I think there would be more fascinating for all if they producers had made a animation.

","I have been waiting for an Epic from ancient history that was true to form for the longest time. The Movie ""Troy"" changed the story of the Iliad and made it useless for teaching (eg., Agamemnon has to get home to his wife to be murdered and set up the cycles for many tragedies). How could Wolfgang Peterson change a text that was the chief piece of Western literature for 1000 years? ""Alexander"" was just a mess, and showed a tortured confused soul, rather than a person the ancient world admired.<br/><br/>The 300 at least gave me a story that I recognized. It is in line with Herodotus and with Stephen Pressfield's recent wonderful book, ""Gates of Fire."" <br/><br/>The people who are hung up on the politics are making at least a partial error in transposing todays values on the past.

For them the state of freedom was not being a slave, which would have been their condition under Xerxes.<br/><br/>Moen Laube (Come get them)."

","It is apparent that Frank Miller's work, finally got the credit it deserves, now in the 2000s, instead of the poor translations to the screen , in the past decades. So after ""Sin City"", here come ""300"", to blow your mind away.<br/><br/>Never mind, ""Troy"", that chick flick, that took the savagest epic poem ever written, to transform it into a Pitt/Bana/Bloom gawk. If you ask my opinion, ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"", had more in common with ""The Odyssey"", than ""Troy"" had with ""The Iliad""...<br/><br/>Never mind, ""Alexander"", that took the story of one of the greatest strategists of all time and his journey, to transform it into a quite perverse parallel to G.W.'s ""fight to civilize""... <br/><br/>Here, is a movie, based on a graphic novel, that teaches history lessons, better than anyone else ever did.<br/><br/>Thanks to the pen of Frank Miller, the artistry of Zack Snyder, and the vision of them both, this here is a lesson as to how to treat an epic tale. The work that was done here, is amazing. Production design, flawless. The CGI, near perfection and speaking of which, I don't know if the film was shot on location, it would have the same impact as it did now. As, for the actors? Butler IS Leonidas. He simply IS. He exists. You believe him. Everyone else, played their part in perfection and stood by their character, as best as they could.<br/><br/>The music of the film, is a mixture of heavy guitars, orchestra and vocals and although it reminds of some other scores, (the rejected score of ""Troy"", work of Basil Poledouris, and perhaps ""Gladiator"") it stands as great as the 300 Spartans themselves.<br/><br/>Being Greek, this is the only film in recent memory that makes me being proud of my ancestors and our history. It's an ode to freedom and valor. Values that are forgotten in most of the world today although western civilization keeps referring to them constantly. It's also a reminder that when guns were invented, ""balls"" disappeared...<br/><br/>I watched the teaser trailer, once every day since its release. The anticipation couldn't reach a higher level and as is usual in a situation like this, you are always disappointed. Not THIS time. (If you exclude the Spartans' ""HOO-HA"", that is...) I'm not sure i can go to the cinema as many times as I'd like, to enjoy this masterpiece.<br/><br/>A big ""Hail"" to Miller, to Snyder, to Butler. I believe, that if I write anything else, I will only diminish the film's value.<br/><br/>...You know what? Just... go see the film. And if you already have, see it again.<br/><br/>I would also like to comment on other peoples um... comments..<br/><br/>How it stirs your primal instincts, it true, it does that.<br/><br/>How it takes the history and gives it a turn (not always for the best) that is bigger than life, true too. It's a movie. It is supposed to do that. <br/><br/>How the Persians were all deformed, mutated, and so on, and Xerxes himself a bit effeminate, ""so they must die"", in this ""Racist"" movie? Not so much. Don't forget they are the BAD GUYS of the film. Do you suppose that if Sauron and his legion of Orcs, were as good-looking as the Elves themselves, LOTR would have the same impact? Countless are the examples in that. STAR WARS, has the deformed Emperor and deformed Darth Vader. In BRAVEHEART, the true villain is Robert the Bruce's father, and he is a leper. The heir to England's throne is gay. In CONAN THE BARBARIAN, Thalsa Doom is a Snake. You want more? It's a movie and bad guys in movies look worse than good guys in movies.<br/><br/>Also a comment for the people who parallel this work to G.W's propaganda tools... That was ""Alexander"". As for this film, you are forgetting something crucial, that probably is genetically imprinted on US citizens DNA to forget... The Spartans were DEFENDING their land. Not INVADING somebody else's. So any talk made for freedom, is used in the very accurate and pure form. Not as a manipulative tool for US troops, dudes... US troops, don't defend...<br/><br/>And in any case, IT'S ONLY A MOVIE."

Second, the appearance of Persians shown in the movie including the color of their skin is not and has never been black. Also, it promotes that there were slavery in Persia, which is the biggest lie of all. There is no documented sign of slavery in ancient Persia. Even all the palaces are built by paid workers. Human rights have been introduced by Cyrus the great for the first time in the history of human being! Even women workers had maternity leave and insurance and this shows how civilized they were. If I want to write about how really Persians were, it would be a glorious book. They were pioneer in the first single god religion, calendar, post, highway building, and many more. I could not figure out why the producer and director should have made such a movie other than making money or ? It is shameful how the power of media is abused to despise a nation. However, the graphics and special effects of the movie were great.

It's easy to be reluctant that real world defies our poetic interpretations, and has its own (cruel) way. Tragedy does happen, but only in a pathetic (or funny, if I may say so) way. That said, you might wonder how come the declaration of human rights is often referred to as the ""prism"" of human rights. Perhaps you will be blown away to learn that Cyrus (the father of the Persian emperor who's depicted in this movie as a barbarian)wrote the first declaration of human rights on a piece of rock that looked like a prism, 2500 years ago, when Bush's great grandfathers were chasing rabbits in western Europe, and raping each others' wives, and daughters. Don't take my word for it, do some research. Warner Bros once experienced a shameful failure in its mission of politically twisting the history: Alexander with its Golden Raspberry nomination.

","I will be as brief as I can. The Greeks symbolize Americans. They yell aloud that they are 'free men'. In contradiction to this, the Persians symbolize everything Americans see as negative. They are supposed to be 'slaves' who are being pushed around by the will of a tyrant. The movie made use of the ongoing war between American and Afghanistan/Iraq to gain weight. As a historian let me tell you that the concept of 'democracy' that prevailed in Greece was not even close to the current meaning of the word. Greeks were not 'free men' and Persians were not 'slaves'. If you are looking to get historically sound stuff, don't even venture close to this movie. Persians/ people from the middle east have distinct features... they are generally fair-brown, have dark hair, sharp features and light brown eyes. In no way do they even resemble Africans. The error of depicting Persians with negroid features is an unpardonable error. Some might say that the movie is visually stunning... let me assure you that the graphic novel is much better.

This version is sure to inspire some to visit the site of the heroic last stand, but may also inspire others to delve into the history books. On that note, there are minor historical mistakes, such as the Spartan king demeaning the Atheans as boy-lovers (which law allowed) but in fact, it was Spartan culture which habitually practice pederasty. Another literary goof, was the use of War-rhinos, elephants and mutants. One in particular which bothered me was the Greek traitor 'Ephialtes' as having been deformed. No historical reference to that. The idea of single Spartan fathers training their sons individually goes against traditional schooling in military academies. One last criticism. The Spartans claimed they fought for freedom and stated the Persian king was a tyrant. Any history book on Sparta, will illuminate the fact, Sparta used Helots as Slaves. Nevertheless, if you don't mind, these and a few other inaccuracies, the film will astonish you with its movie magic and I predict, will imprint itself as a Classic. *****"

","Comic Book. Thats what this movie is. Nothing more, nothing else.

I didn't mind some of the mutants such as the hunchbacked Ephialtes as this reinforced the idea that he should have been killed at birth like Spartan law dictates...and I am sure that in the retelling of the story Ephialtes would have been portrayed as a sub-human and the large Xerxes as he is a Character from history that was usually referred to as looking down on his audience/enemies (whether this is due to him being carried around or his being tall doesn't really matter). Some of the mutants though just didn't add anything at all to the movie, such as the strange fat beheading choppy armed thing..<br/><br/>I think this movie will appeal more to the teenagers it has naked women, sex and for the girls a movie full of buff half naked men as well as beheading, blood and heroic fights against the odds....""Come for the Hype..stay for the boobs"" I think should have been the slogan"

","Overall it was magnificent, graceful and extremely bloody. I have to say, some of the best flesh penetrating effects I've seen. The puncturing of the flesh, the spearing of bodies, it was very realistic. Of course someone needed to tell the effects guys to put some blood on the blades of the swords of the Spartans during the bloodiest of scenes. It was amusing to see them slaughter Persian after Persian and have clean swords after piercing and slicing thru flesh. The film was highly detailed in costumes, props and wounds. Images up close were clear as crystal, yet the background was always soft, blurred and colorful. A few scenes where we see the main character of King Leonidas standing overlooking the ocean, or the battleground before him, we'd just see his back, but it looked as if we were seeing the rear of SUPERMAN. I guess it was the dark black hair and the red cape, but it was symbolic in the fact that Leonidas was in fact a ""Superman"" to his troops and in the eyes of the enemy. The scene of young Leonidas and the wolf was just one the coolest and most snarling beast vs man confrontations I've seen on the big screen. Overall, the film was non-stop action and it seemed almost too short. I was as thirsty for 20 more minutes as the Spartans were thirsty for 20 more Persians to conquer. Larry Fong and his 3 camera side by side Cinematography made the fight scenes flawless and so much more fun to watch. The dark overtones mixed with rich color really brought out the comic book feel that Frank Miller intended when he drew it, but to see it on the big screen was a real treat. It's will be well worth the money to see this again on the big screen and I cant wait to be blown away catching it on IMAX too."

","What a great piece of cinematic history this movie is - ground breaking CGI, music and a fantastic rendition of Frank Miller's comic books! Miller meant his comics to be more contemporary and a little ""tongue-in-cheek"" I believe. It is not meant to be a true historical re-telling or a documentary of this heroic tale. It is what it is - a ""kick-ass"" version that is heavy on mood and violence with nice little dollops of humor on occasions! If you approach it as for what it is, you will thoroughly enjoy the experience! The acting was superb - Gladiator on Steroids - Leonidas beautifully played by Baker and Henly as a sexy but hard-nosed Queen. The supporting cast, even the Persians, were great too and Xerxes was painfully exquisite as a rather tall and ""pin-cushioned"" king! My only critique is with regard to the Immortals - I understand what Miller was doing but to me they sort of looked like grown-up ""Teenage Ninja Turtles!"" They really did! However, that aside, this is a great movie and one worth seeing many times - my next trip will be to an IMAX theatre - now that should be something!!!!!"

Everything is predictable about the film (of course for those that have read the novel) but the uninformed will not be surprised much by the story, but the absolute joy that is in the violence is what gets you amped up. <br/><br/>The music by Tyler Bates leads the charge.

","Do you dislike homosexuals? Really? Even now, in this enlightened age? Well your rampant, ingrained homohatred may be itself loathed by every liberal commentator on the planet but spankgoodness you've still got a home in Hollywood. That's right, in the dream factory no-one had even thought of buggery until some time in the early nineties when Tom Hanks tepidly kissed his lover but even then the story had a nasty twist. Hanks may have been in a loving relationship but thanks to his cocoa shunting he had contracted AIDS and would die. Nevermind! <br/><br/>Fast forward a few years and we have the 300 - a homo-erotic fantasy no less that simultaneously cries 'kill all homosexuals' while getting drunk on a gay saturated orgy of cartoon violence. Basically it goes something like this: The virile Spartans, we know they're virile because they kill wolves and screw their women, are told to roll over by the Persians lead by androgynous gay icon King Xerses. Leonaydas, a real man and don't you forget it, tells the flamboyantly decorated, well dressed Persians that they can take their threats and shove them where the sun is obscured by arrow fire - at least he would if they didn't enjoy it so much. The social lepers and lunatic mystics won't sanction a war so the King grabs 300 of his best warriors and moves to head off the incoming Persian army, even though they're rumoured to number in the millions.<br/><br/>What follows is roughly 90 minutes of slaughter in which the Persians - gay, grotesque mutants or both, are given a taste of Spartan steel - real men showing these limp wristed imperialists how to fight. Sure, they may only have 300 men but with 1 real man worth roughly 200,000 ear pierced Persians, its like shooting fish in a barrel...only easier. The thing about this is that its all beautifully rendered, CGI crayons scribbled large but there's more depth in thimble of water. Fans of slow motion, painted in blood spray and decapitation will need to keep their legs crossed. The rest of us should wince at the Xerses/Leonydas buggery scene (you'll know it when you see it), Xerses constant references to hedonism and kneeling down in front of him, you can theorise his motives for this on your own and the blatant gaffe - namely that the last part of the story is narrated by a character whose left the scene of the action. How does he know what happened exactly? Did someone e-mail him some clips? <br/><br/>All in all a very strange experience."
"reventropy2003-1","1","11","24","23 March 2007"," How do you spoil the spoiled?
","Comic books used to cost a nickel so that little boys could afford to buy them with their allowance money and huddle around them in tree forts outside of which a sign hung proclaiming ""NO GIRLS ALLOWED"". So what happens when your all grown up and you still are captivated by the fantasies of Silver Surfer and Ghost Rider? That's when you start reading graphic novels.<br/><br/>I fully understand that this film was based on a graphic novel. I'm not too concerned with how well that translated to the movie screen because I probably don't want to watch a comic book for growned-ups for two freaking hours. At least I thought so until I saw Sin City. So I thought I'd give this one a shot.<br/><br/>What does concern me is that film is that the battle of Thermopylae was not a graphic novel. People actually died in that battle and in the following war. Lots of people. Some of which you could even call real life heroes. People who never saw their families again. Who never again filled their lungs with air, tasted, smelt, or touched anything ever again. Who's rotting maggot ridden corpses were left to fester under the fiery Greek sun. Who's eyes were consumed by ravens as sacrifice to blood Gods. These people at least deserve a courteous and respectful accurate recount of those few fateful days. I guess we no longer even respect stories of dead heroes. Instead we erect cold stone slabs to remember only names.<br/><br/>Maybe I'm being too graphic. Perhaps graphic novels aren't so appealing when the graphics portray gore that we know in our hearts is real. This is primarily why I despise this boring yet disturbing film. This is precisely the reason so many reviewers felt completely empty after watching it. It was engineered to be a baroque play. If the characters are scripted to be ghosts and the men are all chiseled Davids, then the audience begins deep down to believe that what they are watching is not real (I know it's not but let me finish). This subconscious realization allows your conscience to grant you a free pass, so that you can copulate in the violence and gore the back of your brain supplicates for. If it wasn't glossed up with the CGI and farcical characters then it may instead open the gates for a flood of bona fide emotions. One of these emotions could be repugnance. Then we might have a movie audience resembling a Pentecostal revival. Complete with shouting and flailing of extremities. This is something that movie producers consider a liability.<br/><br/>Now that I've covered the films ethical framework I'll start with the nit-picking. Some Greek historians recorded that the Spartans had gay sex with one another. That's right. It wasn't just the Athenians who were ""boy-lovers"". Many Greeks were just somehow inclined that way. I guess that was a little too graphic for Frank Miller. I'll admit it's too graphic for me too (being a bit homophobic myself). So¬Ö An omission of this historic fact might have been a great idea. But to assert that the Spartans weren't practicing homosexuality is just imaginary.<br/><br/>Moving on. In the film King Leonidas must solo climb a crag of loose rock in his sandals to ask the oracle what she knows about the future of Sparta. HUH? How often does he do this? How is he still alive after all these years? I guess the oracle and the leprous dirty men at the top were transported there with some kind of Athenian pulley system. I suppose space aliens built the pillared structure they dwell in. How do they get food and water up there? Why are there enough mutated Spartan babies to necessitate a big eugenics landfill full of their skulls? I guess their water was contaminated with Uranium or something. Why are the Persians half Africanized? How did they transport the wild animals? Why is Xerxes so gay etc. If you read the other reviews you'll see these same questions over and over again. It could go on all day.<br/><br/>Lastly. Style is all about how you use it. In this film it was abused. Somewhat like the guy's 64' Impalla with the LaCucaracha horn and six inch wheels is abused. I got the feeling that the director filmed this debacle in black and white and then soaked the roll of film in some chemical mixture. Didn't seem too revolutionary to me.<br/><br/>I see the inverse of this film's IMDb rating as being proportional to this country's overall well-being."

","What can you say about 300, a movie that is one long and woozy love letter to the ancient, war loving Spartans? That pictures infanticide and extreme child abuse as an admirable form of social engineering? Where the light skinned and English accented heroes slaughter vast numbers of their dark and stupid foes? Where to be a woman is to proudly bear sons for the Fatherland and stand by your man as he swaggers off to suicidal carnage? Where to be old, sick, malformed or effeminate is to be evil? That proudly wears its fascistic heart on its national socialist sleeve? Well, what you could say is that it is one fantastically entertaining movie! <br/><br/>300 tells the story of the three hundred Spartans who held off the entire Persian army at Thermopylae. Sparta runs afoul of the Persians by refusing to submit to their rule. Treachery rears its ugly head and good King Leonidas is forbidden to use the Spartan legions to lay waste to the enemy. He sets out with three hundred doughy volunteers to hold the eastern horde off long enough for the Spartan senate to come to their senses. The eventual fate of Leonidas and his comrades is one of the most famous stories of ancient times and 300 more than does it justice.<br/><br/>There are no real stars in 300 though Gerard Butler has a star-making role as Leonidas. He handles spear, beefcake poses and faux-Shakespearian dialog with equal aplomb. Lena Headey is very good as Queen Gorgo but can't rise above the fact that she is a chick hanging out in a boy's club. Her role is primarily to look decorative and stoic in equal measures. Beyond these two and perhaps Dominic West as a dodgy member of the Spartan senate or Rodrigo Santoro as the ten foot tall and supremely swishy Xerxes, there isn't a member of the cast well known or forceful enough to stand out from the rest. Everyone involved delivers fine performances but the fact is their roles are subservient to the design, emotionality and heedless energy of the piece.<br/><br/>300 is another movie made on a virtual set. That is, with the exception of the actors, most of what you see isn't real, it's computer animated. While perhaps not as amazing as the similarly filmed Sin City or Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow, 300's surreal copper and sepia-toned fever dream of ancient Greece is an achievement in its own right.<br/><br/>300 is being damned and praised by all sides of the political spectrum. The fact is 300 could be used as a motivational tool for just about any group in need of a testosterone fix. It's guaranteed to get your guys on their feet and ready to rumple. Make no mistake though, there have been few truly excellent movies made with such dodgy sentiments since Birth of a Nation. Judged solely on the merits of it's politics 300 brings certain words to mind, ""venal"" and ""pestilent"" being the most polite. Judged as adventurous entertainment however, 300 has few equals.<br/><br/>It would be easy to dissect 300 and lambaste its lack of historical veracity. After all the historical Spartans were sort of a bronze age Hell's Angels and were roundly hated by their long suffering neighbors. As to their vaunted militarism, even the effete Athenians were able to kick the tar out of them from time to time. This is all beside the point. 300 was not made for rational discussion. This is a movie made to bypass the frontal lobe and stir the Cro-Magnon id. It is supposed to get its audience frothing at the mouth. This 300 does with such dexterity and malevolent ingenuity as to render it an instant classic of its kind."

And for all those who might oppose the significance for historical detail, then the movie shouldn't refer to King Leonidas' 300 but to ancient swordsmen of some tribe fighting ogres, trolls and wild elephants 100 feet tall somewhere in ancient Greece and thus being named Battlefield Hot Gates or something.

I don't know, I have never met the man. His movie, on the other hand, isn't.

It's both homo-erotic and homophobic at exactly the same time, which I think is brilliant.<br/><br/>This film has everything a balls-out, wall-punching, thrash-metal soundtrack action film needs: Uber violence, cheesy speeches, 6ft Greeks in loin cloths, hot girls getting it from all angles, lesbians, and, best of all, endangered species getting pushed off cliffs.<br/><br/>And if you don't like that, put down your U2 CD, get off your high-horse, go down to your local cinema, smuggle some beers into the place, relax, and live a little."
"sillybuddha","1","9","19","24 March 2007"," Thoroughly nasty little film
","This film is quite grotesque in many ways. Firstly, it seems pretty homophobic (Athenians are insulted as 'boy lovers') and Xerxes is portrayed as some sort of bizarre, make-up-wearing effeminate. It teeters on the brink of racism (references to ""asian hordes"" are pretty disturbing and there is the slight stench of fascism about the whole thing) and the enemy are dehumanised headscarf-wearers. It's a pain to watch, lots of dull, cipher characters stomping about and shouting before a load of CGI-heavy violence takes place. Tiresome, slow-motion effects are over-used, the CGI often looks fake, and the sub-plot involving the Queen is bolted on and uninteresting. Everything is a gigantic clich√©. Some critics have defended the film by saying that 300 does not really take itself seriously - (but if you read some of Frank Miller's post 11/9 interviews he expresses a lot of the sentiments echoed by the characters and themes in the film). If you do choose to view it without believing it's a joke then you are confronted by a nasty, spiteful little film that rants on meaninglessly about freedom without any context. It does seem weirdly like propaganda and no doubt will be popular with the U.S military. Everyone involved with this production should be thoroughly ashamed they were involved in this visually, aurally and intellectually unpleasant little film. It must be a miserable place inside Frank Miller's head. This production contributes absolutely nothing, not one micron to the sum total of human artistic endeavour or experience. And to finish on a lighter note, how annoying was David Wenham's narration? Was his voice played backwards through a faulty tape recorder? What's that accent all about?"
"elcopy","10","9","19","18 March 2007"," Many writers wish their books were adapted likewise
","First, 300 is based on a comic book by Frank Miller (Robocop 2), inspired in the battle of Thermopylae. So don't even bother seeing it, if comic book violence, action over character, style over substance, fantasy over realism is your thing. Second, this movie captures the very essence of the comic book, frame by frame and word by word. Sounds familiar? Maybe because Robert Rodriguez already did it in 2005's Sin City, based on a comic book by, guess who? Frank Miller. Other comic book artist in the vein of Miller have seen their work butchered on the screen. Example is Allan Moore, whose comic books have spawned a bunch of mediocre movies (V for Vendetta, From Hell, The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen). But Frank comic books are perfect for the screen. The stylish frames are the perfect storyboard. The characters over the top, the wardrobe iconic and visually arresting. Of course, Spartans didn't go to war wearing tongs and red capes, but the symbolism of it, godlike bodies almost nude, tells you about the characters more than any words. The same with the mangled, ugly bad guys, visually altered to give maximum impact. His words are simplistic, but piercing, and like the medium, macho as hell (""Spartan, come back with your shield, or on it.""), that's why you can do a script by simply copy/paste-ing exactly what you read in the comic book. It's the perfect blueprint for an action movie. Snyder knew all this and took every artistic license possible to do this movie like a comic book. He used tricks done by Rodriguez before, only that Rodriguez relying on star power distracted me from the stories in Sin City, also Sin City's pace was not enough to savour each story: Sin City tells 3 stories from 3 books as long as 300 in the same space of time. A lot of people will look at this movie looking for other entertainment tricks used more in regular films. This is looking back. The great thing about 300 is that freshens up the tired sword-and-sandal genre. It's a very welcome update and one of the best films of the decade."

The countless thuds of bodies getting cut up and bloodied do little to compliment a very cheesy soundtrack. The cgi animals seem to beg for a dynamic change in the decidedly static plot.

This film had truly great potential with a far deeper plot than Braveheart, greater scope and even greater armies than Lord of the Rings.<br/><br/>But things were just wrong, the consummating moment for the hero of the story was cut short like it had begun and was instantly edited to the end for no apparent reason. The Introduction to the hero looked like a scene for Jungle Book, it actually had a Wolf with glowing eyes. Much of the dialog looked like it was taken off the back of a patriotic serial box and then just Greekified and repeated with no apparent rhythm, and almost comically the soundtrack seemed to try to beef up every really bad section of dialog with really grand music.<br/><br/>This film could have been great instead it's only good; but giving honor to whom it is due. It has what is probably a three minute sword fight complete with about twenty kills done from one camera angle. In terms of filming, it is a triumph like nothing I've ever seen; and in terms of viewing, you've got to see it! So many things in there are still that good that I totally recommend it.

","I was really looking forward to seeing this movie, as the trailer was awesome and the first couple of pages of reviews on IMDb were all very positive.

Then I went and saw it... I have seen many a film in my time, but I have to say that this is the most morally offensive film I have ever seen. And it says something about how morally offensive it is that its offensiveness manages to transcend its cartoonish nature and offend someone as unoffendable as me. What's wrong with it? How long have you got? It's racist, homophobic, it glorifies violence more than any other film I've ever seen, and it even manages to deliver a few not-so-subtle stabs at disabled and deformed folk. It's also a blatant but terribly misleading defence of both current American foreign policy and of Nazi politics. And I don't think that's reading too much into it either; these messages come across pretty strongly in the movie. And nor does this film begin to make up for its moral failings with a storyline or decent characterisation. It is totally 2-dimensional and sometimes extremely boring. On the plus side, it does have four stars worth of great art direction, but don't let that lure you into seeing it. You can get all the goodness you need from the trailer, but without the indigestible 90 mins of war propaganda that make up the full-length film."

Anyway, it's an all-tech movie, shot basically on green or blue backgrounds and just spectacular... in the way ""Twister"", ""Dante's Peak"" or ""Volcano"" did have its time due to visual effects.

Freeze-frame any scene and it can be transposed to the comic book of the same name, and you have to applaud the technical skill that accomplished that. However, as a MOVIE, on offer to millions, I was squirming in my seat. I watched this back to back with Apolcalpto and hated 300 and loved Apocalypto. I was prepped to hate Apocalypto and love 300, but I stopped watching 3/4 thru and here's why: it is the worst sort of political movie. It must've been selected by the White House because it takes shots at legality and rights and glorifies the fame/hate-focused head of state. It is a racist movie: I'm white but boy I was glad I wasn't black because every bad-guy is black and it is so obvious a ploy that I just had to stop watching because i was starting to feel as if I was tacitly approving. The casting is appalling: the current fashion is an English woman opposite an American male and how do you make that work in a story about the Spartans? I'll tell you how: you saturate the senses with so much eye-candy and erect nipples that no one is able to think the concept thru. Maybe the movie saves itself in the last 30 minutes (which I missed by choice) but I doubt it could.

","300 roars through the post-Oscar Hollywood climate and delivers a bone-crunching, head-slicing, rip-roaring good time with a dark, twistedly delicious CGI-generated style. Essentially a dark fantasy movie-graphic novel adaptation of the 480 BC battle of Thermopylae, 300 moves with style and substance.<br/><br/>The mighty Persian empire looms over Greece with the threat of invasion. King Leonidas of Sparta (Gerard Butler) answers the call, defying the laws of his people by taking 300 men with him to the Thermopylae pass to battle the vast horde summoned before him.<br/><br/>First off, the battle sequences are amazing. Whether fighting light Persian infantry, calvary, the fearsomely and awesomely garbed Immortals, their hulking brutes, rhinos, elephants, magicians, archers, or soldiers drawn from all over the Persian Empire, the scenes of the Spartans completely owning the Persians are fast-paced and deliriously exciting as well as beautifully shot. Blood is plentiful, gushing in rich CGI gouts from the hacked and mangled corpses of the thousands of Persian dead. The scenes transition from slow-mo to FF in the individual fight scenes: for example, after the Spartan phalanx breaks and Leonidas rushes out to demolish two dozen or so Persians single-handedly, he kills a Persian in slow-mo, then FF in the lay-up to kill another, then slows down again to deliver the killing blow. It's all remarkable.<br/><br/>All the acting is spot-on, with Gerard Butler and Lena Hedley leading the pack as the ruling family of Sparta. The Spartans all come off wonderfully as battle-crazed nut-jobs with dark senses of humor. Xerxes is a bizarre king who seriously thinks he's a god.<br/><br/>300 is to date the best movie of 2007.

The enemy soldiers are pure evil and totally dehumanized looking like cartoon figures or creatures in a video game that video game players love to destroy. In my view, it's the worst form of entertainment. What's the point of the use of slow motion of a flying severed limb or head? In Bonnie and Clyde, the shooting scene at the end in slow motion was gut-wrenching, and there was nothing 'cool' about it. The larcenous pair met a violent death, and the viewers were horrified to see it on the screen.<br/><br/>Most of the main characters in 300 are so busy slaughtering in the CG battles, there's hardly any storyline. Simply put, the only message in this film is that freedom is not free; sacrifice yourself in the name of freedom and kill as many enemies as possible. Modify the characters and eliminate the historical aspects from 300, and you'll end up with an excellent recruit video for new Al-Qaeda suicide bombers."

","Like the animated cover of a cock rock album, laughable if it were not so tedious, watch as the heads of various grade z actors barely connect with their computerized bodies. Gerard Butler looks like he's attached to a large crab with a six pack while Lena Heady""s heady floats somewhere on a level with Mount Olympus, (although what she has to say is a long way from Plato. ) What is most objectionable about this unremitting junk is the notion that the ugly and deformed are Bad and only the immaculate and toned and buffed can be Good. It's like contemplating a kitsch fresco in a gay bath-house with clouds of steam wafting across various muscle Marys pouting and posing and unsheathing their swords. It's like a Nazi rally in leather jock-straps. I find it hard to believe no-one who worked on this film didn't stop for a moment aghast at what they were perpetrating. There are no laughs in fascism. No irony, no wit, no humor."
"Doylenf","7","7","14","21 March 2007"," A striking visual feast and stunning audio experience...
","No, I wasn't expecting ""depth"" to the characters nor was I expecting to see a documentary about the famous battle at Thermopylae--and perhaps that's why I can happily state that I was caught up in the frenzy and excitement and visual splendor of 300 from the opening scene to the touching ending.<br/><br/>King Leonidas (brilliant performance by GERARD BUTLER), is the Spartan King who must send his brave warriors to fight the huge Persian army. Butler is certainly not one-dimensional in the role, which is what would have happened in the hands of a less talented actor. He found many facets that humanize this ferocious King with an appetite for battle and he makes the most of his every moment on screen. The eye is drawn to him like a magnet, even in group scenes where his commanding presence dominates the action or the talk. Snyder certainly lucked out in finding exactly the right man for the role. In many close-ups he reminds me of the classic screen star ROBERT TAYLOR (think ""Ivanhoe"").<br/><br/>And others around him are fine too. LEONA HEADEY makes an interesting, spirited Spartan Queen, with a beautiful face and a lovely commanding presence of her own. She's especially good in her scenes with the conniving DOMINIC WEST, as the two argue over sending a larger army against the Persian hordes. Their final confrontation is a shocker.<br/><br/>Visually, the film is an artistic achievement that makes stunning use of the CGI and blending it with the studio shots in a way that resembles murals and famous works of art. This is one aspect of the film that is easily guaranteed to earn Oscar nominations in technical categories.<br/><br/>Butler's command of the screen is more evident here than in any other film to date, including his work in PHANTOM OF THE OPERA. No doubt this will be an iconic role for him.<br/><br/>Only drawback, at least in the theater I attended, is the sound mix of music and dialog could have been improved to the point where the spoken words are not drowned out by the relentless (but fascinating) background score, which tends to milk every melodramatic moment to the max.<br/><br/>The battle scenes are well staged and I never found the use of slow motion distracting or inappropriate. Snyder has done a fantastic job."

","High on drama, grotesquery and violence. This is a fantastically accurate rendition of The graphic novel on which it is based and not only, does the images and lighting of Miller justice but has a fair stab at Varleys much unsung colouring as well.<br/><br/>As such it will appeal to the spotty herberts, angst ridden teens and a few plump gothy girls that read this kind of material but I don't expect it to bring the importance to western democracy of the sacrifice made by the thousand or so Greek citizens and slaves and in particular the 300 spartan royal guardsmen that stuck it out to the death, to a much wider audience.<br/><br/>This is a shame because if this doesn't do well financially it will (after the debacle that was Troy) put another nail in the coffin of the ancient historical movie which is unjustified. It's just that they're not being done very well. My daughter sat with me to watch Spartacus the other day and was absolutely wrapped up in it, shouting and crying at all the places I did 20 years before her. 300 probably means that ""Gates of Fire"" will never get made and even that if it did follow the novel will focus on blood and guts rather than the important elements of the story The willingness of people we think of as less civilised than us to show far greater nobility and humanity when the going got tough"

","The hype will kill this film far more effectively than it's quality. It can't live up to it. Is it a bad film? No. Is it a great film? No. It's a good one with some big problems. The first is the script, which is TOO close to Frank Miller to work. You notice how shonky the plotting is, how laughable the dialogue is the moment it is read out aloud. Or in Butler's case, shouted at the top of his lungs. There are no characters, just poses. No-one to root for, no-one to boo. So you're left with the action and the look of the film.<br/><br/>The action is pretty good at first but not quite the great you hope for from the trailer. It's like everything is geared so closely to looking like the comic book that they forgot that means a lot of slowed-down or static shots that get a bit boring. Even more boring is the look of the film. Every shot in the film is washed out and rusty and that gets tired very, very fast. Apart from blood red in the battles that's all you get and you really long for something different just to break it up. It's the most boring use of colour in years. Taken with the animating out of many of the actor's features to touch them up to look more like cartoons it just blands everything out. Even when the singing goat turns up in Xerxes tent it looks a bit ordinary and samey.<br/><br/>So, some good battles but it never flies because everything looks the same and you don't care about anything or anyone that happens. On the Arnie scale, with Terminator being the tops, Total Recall being great, T3 being okay, Raw Deal being weak and Red Sonja being the pits, I'd give this a T3."

Bare in mind that it all takes place in an era of myth and magic (Minotaur,3 headed serpents,Medusa,...and tons of other Greek based mythical creatures). Looking from this perspective,they have done a super-job keeping the level of mythical creatures low. Thus bringing us one hell of a film.Furthermore it's a loyal adaptation of a very graphic novel. So over the top-NO.If you liked the novel,you should like the film.The first half hour gave us an insight in the Spartan society. Then came the action.

The movie pretty much follows suit. <br/><br/>There are at least 1300 comments here about ""300"" and I doubt I can say anything better or more insightful than what is already here.

It certainly was visually stunning, 10 out of 10 for that part. However, a good movie needs more than that, and to me 300 just failed in almost every other aspect. It was all far too simplistic; too black and white, and lacked a descent storyline. <br/><br/>What I didn't like: <br/><br/>-The overly muscular and 'perfect' Spartans versus the ugly deformed faceless Persians and their monsters. <br/><br/>-The simplistic Good versus Evil thematics. It sometimes was like looking at some Bush-administration propaganda.<br/><br/>-The historical references; if you want to make a movie (comic) about a rather unknown historical battle, don't use monsters, hunchbacks and other fictional creatures. If you want to use those creatures, just create a fictional battle. <br/><br/>-The story itself. It was just a little introduction to a battle, and then the battle itself. To me, that might be enough for 30 minutes, but not nearly enough for 2 hours. <br/><br/>If the movie wasn't looking as good as it did I would've walked out. I was there with a few friends, and it was interesting to see that some really loved the movie, and others (one of them being a professional historian...) didn't like it that much, usually for the same reasons I didn't like it.<br/><br/>Conclusion: Over-rated, but visually stunning.

The musical score which often contains heavy metal riffs is amateurish and unfitting for anything but a video game which this movie isn't too far from. Every battle scene features at least one long shot that varies from super slow motion to super fast motion repeatedly.

It had a little nudity and the building of a great story. My favorite scene had to be when the king of the Spartans pushed the messenger into the well in a battle cry ""this is Sparta."" However the movie concluded terribly meriting little applause or any of my approval. The movie shot for historical accuracy as the Spartans were defeated by the Persians, but the defeat was not glorious. In the climax of the story, the Spartans are surrounded by the Persians; however, this surrounding by the Persians is failed to be shown. At the very end, the king of Sparta throws a Spear at the Persian king and is killed along with his entire army. How could such a strong fighting group die in such an unceremonious way. For destroying a potentially amazing movie, I rate this movie a 0, if such rating could be given.

It seemed like the entire movie was in slow motion. It literally took seven seconds just to cut off the leg of some random foot soldier. Slow motion should be used to show a complex move that the viewer would not be able to follow in real time or to show a slow down in time from the perspective of the focused character. I don't think there is any need to slow something down if it's something that the viewer can obviously see and there is no complexity to the moves that were slowed. Cracking a whip is not complex nor emotional. Flying through the air with a sword is not complex nor emotional. Kicking someone into a giant hole in the ground is not complex nor emotional. The other big reason I hated 300 was the dialogue. It seemed like the entire movie is spoken in one liners just to be repeated among prepubescent, teenage boys. The action is ruined by constant slow motion. There is no thought to this movie, unlike Sin City. I would put this as one of the worst movies ever made."

","OK. I get that this is a comic book depiction of a notable moment in military history. But this pseudo-epic is neither comic book nor history. What it appears to be is pro-war, pro-nationalist propaganda of the most American kind, aimed at the young, male and impressionable, at a time when we are debating sending more and more youngsters to the botched war in Iraq. It seemed obviously racist to me. It also seemed obviously homophobic. This is particularly odd since the real 300 were also known as an army of lovers and were trained to fight and die in pairs. It also seemed obviously ethnocentric. I you don't see these elements, I suggest you do some reading other than comic books. Oh, by the way, 'graphic novel' exaggerates this form to a literary level it does not actually satisfy. In my early years, we had Steve Reeves in the Hercules movies. These were dubbed perversions of Greek mythology. It seems one thing to pervert mythology and another to pervert the national history of another country. I don't believe this is a Greek production. Finally, I studied ancient history in great detail during my old-fashioned education. The picture I came away with hardly resembled this Kung Fu, soft-porn epic. I advise those inspired by the film to check out the rich history from which it evolved and morphed. It is far more interesting."

","300 is an incredible, action packed movie. The battle scenes were perfect, and by far the best I've ever seen! Nothing, not even the Lord of The Rings movies, Gladiator, or Braveheart comes close. The dialog is simple, and the acting is nothing to talk about but the battle scenes are like a sheer adrenaline rush.<br/><br/>300 is amazing and I would recommend it to anyone who likes action movies and gore. I loved it, a perfect 10 out of 10. When the movie ends you'll feel as if you just ran a mile, that is how fast your heart is pumping. Seriously, no matter how old you are at the end of this movie, you wish that you had a sword, and could go into battle, that is the effect this movie has on you.

","Okay, so the dialogue is lame, the battle scenes repetitive, and the tone heavy handed, but how about that art design? It's the film's saving grace, right? Actually, the style of the film is another source of annoyance. Everything is stylized to the point that the drama has no impact. The event the movie was based on needs no such embellishment. Think of how powerful the story would have been if shown in a gritty realistic way--a spartan way.<br/><br/>What attracts attention is the 300's gratuitous violence, but the real problem is its gratuitous slow motion. Twenty minutes could be shaved off this movie if the slo-mo is shown in real time.<br/><br/>The voice over narration--holy crapola. A sampler: ""King Leonidas took off his helmet. His head felt cramped, trapped--a bit chafed around his ears. He put the helmet on the ground. It was the helmet that protected the head of the bravest, most rootinest tootinest king ever. Oh yeah, did I mention that these warriors protected freedom and that his head felt too big for the helmet? Maybe my constant gushing made his head to swell."" Okay, that was not a direct quote, but--trust me-- the voice over was almost that awfully redundant."
"lee3993","10","8","17","12 March 2007"," Russell Crowe and ""Gladiator"" - move over!!!
","In my opinion the most recent movies of this kind don't live up to expectations. 2004's epics ""Alexander"" and ""Troy"", and 2005's ""Kingdom of Heaven"", were all serviceable but fell short of being great films. In the recently released epic ""300"", that trend came to a screeching halt. This movie is unlike anything I have ever seen. Although the scenery is obviously computer generated, it is simply breathtaking. Some fans may argue that it looks like a Playstation game, but that only makes it that much more unique and enjoyable . The acting, cinematography, the music, the wardrobe, etc., were all done with precision and style unsurpassed by even ""Lord of the Rings""! Although the battle scenes are more violent than anything I have ever seen on film, they are highly stylized and graceful, as in an opera setting, sometimes shown in slow motion. This technique, however, does not hamper the special effects at all. Gerard Butler, who plays King Leonidas, commands the screen with the same presence that has made an international superstar of Russell Crowe, a fellow actor who also excels in captivating audiences with his awareness on stage. Butler's performance as Leonidas is reminiscent of the aforementioned's role as Maximus, in the also superb epic ""Gladiator"". Although I do recall Butler's exceptional performance as the phantom in 2004's ""Phantom of the Opera"", nothing would have prepared me for his role as King Leonidas, which has surely catapulted him into the upper echelon of first rate actors in this era. He has to be considered an early odds on favorite to receive a Best Actor Oscar in next years Academy Awards. King Leonidas, the Greek leader and general of a group of soldiers called Spartans, takes on a Persian army of thousands(who want to rule the world)in an effort to remain free as men and as a Country. His dignity, swagger, perilous conviction, and unmatched skill make him a formidable foe for any army. The problem however, is that his army consists of only 300 men, thus the title ""300"". Although they are grossly outnumbered, these Spartans are highly skilled in the art of killing and quite vicious by nature. Take no prisoners and have no mercy is their pledge. Lena Heady, who stars as Leonidas's wife, Queen Gorgo, is quite convincing as a strong willed woman, who will stand by her King to the end, under any circumstances. David Wenham as Dilios, Dominic West as Theron, and Vincent Regan as Captain, are all stunning as fellow Spartans. Rodrigo Santoro, relatively unknown, is striking as Persian King Xerxes, a giant among men. Some patrons of the genre may be put off by the presence of mythical beasts and unworldly creatures included in the film, but that is partly what sets this movie apart from all others. Unlike ""Lord of the Rings"", it is based on a true event, but like the comic book that it is adapted from, it is reinvented from the the vivid imaginations of Frank Miller(the comic book's author), and Zack Snyder(the director). With ""300"", along with 2004's ""Dawn of the Dead"", Mr. Snyder has become a director not to be taken lightly. Anyone who doesn't like ""300"" doesn't like movies. My only problem with ""300"" is the running time, at only 117 minutes, it should have been closer to 3 hours in length. After all, it is an epic."
"MDBum","8","8","17","7 March 2007"," Good but not great
","No Spoilers The Digital Cinematography and the wardrobes were spectacular. The Persians and the various fighters were so well done and the spartan cloaks really got your arm chair general blood going. Everything else was just 'pretty good'. The problem with this movie is that it simply came a little too late. So many aspects of the film had already been beat to death. The lamenting sound of a woman singing in some foreign language during scenes of sorrow or death. The slow motion action sequences (however the first clash between persian and Greek was awesome). The woman walking through the wheatfield scenes reminded you too much of gladiator. The speeches are pretty good but when he finally says ""This is Sparta!!!!"" you cant help but laugh a little bit. The characters really weren't developed well either as i didn't really care whether the spartans lived or died (of course you knew going into it that they would die) but i didn't really care about their sacrifices either. I understand that this is not a completely faithful interpretation of the event and i had no problem with that. It is a different take from what we have discovered to have happened, yet the different story itself was rather weak. Then again its based off of a comic and although i am not a comic reader i think its safe to say that it lacks the depths of novel turned movies. The glorification of and dehumanization of one or both sides unfortunately often makes for a pretty boring storyline without much emotion. As dramatic and straightforward as the battle of thermopylae was, i believe they could have done much better in evincing emotions from the viewer as well. However, as an action movie, there is so much that the girl behind me wouldn't shutup about how she was going to be sick. Its a good movie to watch because the fight scenes are pretty good and the colors are fantastic but i left wanting more of a story."

"The_Void","7","9","20","23 March 2007"," History, comic book style!
","It was obvious after the success of Sin City that we were going to see more of Frank Miller's graphic novels adapted for the screen, and someone was obviously impressed enough with Zack Snyder's visuals on the dire Dawn of the Dead remake to give him the directing reigns. I have to say, I'm not the biggest fan of period epics; but I knew that wouldn't be a problem going into this film as Frank Miller obviously has a very over the top style, and as soon as I heard that it's ""very gory"", I was sold. I have to say that this film is not as great as Sin City; the visuals aren't as good, the film isn't handled as well and the central plot thread isn't as interesting as Sin City's three narratives; but 300 is still a spectacular piece of cinema. The film focuses on the war between the Spartans and the Persians in 480 B.C. A group of 300 Spartans, lead by the fearless King Leonidas, moves in on the advancing Persian army. The warriors are massively outnumbered, but thanks to their impregnable strategy; the few manage to out fight the many for a short time.<br/><br/>I haven't read Frank Miller's graphic novel, but I'm guessing that certain sequences were based on it pretty much frame for frame. While this is good in some ways as it allows Snyder to capture the comic book style, in other ways it's very bad as some shots look completely out of place, and make it seem like Snyder doesn't really know what he's doing. There's no problem with post-production, however, as the cinematography is excellent and the way that the fight scenes are shot is good in that it allows them to be completely brutal, while never becoming completely exploitative. I read in British newspaper 'The Sun' that 300 is 'the bloodiest movie in history', which of course isn't the case. There is a lot bloodshed, but it never really FEELS like there's a lot of bloodshed as the atmosphere is completely other-worldly. The way that Snyder uses his actors is good as the impressive Spartans add to the overall look of the film. The two central performances - those coming from Gerard Butler and the beautiful Lena Headey are both impressive, while the largely British support cast impress in their roles. Overall, this isn't a brilliant film as there are a lot of niggles; but it has it's moments, and during the fight scenes (which, thankfully, take up a large proportion of the film), you won't care about 300's shortfalls."
"mehr_narsey","1","9","20","14 March 2007"," We endorse the 300, an unethical movie picture
","It is a proved scholarly fact that the Persian Empire in 480 B.C was the most magnificent and civilized empire. Established by the Cyrus the great, the writer of the first human right declaration, Persians ruled over significant portions of Greater Iran, the east modern Afghanistan and beyond into central Asia; in the north and west all of Asia Minor (modern Turkey), the upper Balkans peninsula (Thrace), and most of the Black Sea coastal regions; in the west and southwest the territories of modern Iraq, northern Saudi-Arabia, Jordan, Israel, Lebanon, Syria, all significant population centers of ancient Egypt and as far west as portions of Libya. Having twenty nations under control, encompassing approximately 7.5 million square kilometers, unquestionably the Achaemenid Empire was territorially the largest empire of classical antiquity. Based on the Zoroastrian doctrine, it was the strong emphasis on honesty and integrity that gave the ancient Persians credibility to rule the world, even in the eyes of the people belonging to the conquered nations (Herodotus, mid 5th century B.C). Truth for the sake of truth, was the universal motto and the very core of the Persian culture that was followed not only by the great kings, but even the ordinary Persians made it a point to adhere to this code of conduct. We did not expect Warner Bros. Picture company, as one of the world's largest producers of film and television entertainment to ignore the proved obvious historical facts, and damage its own reputation by showing the Persian army at the battle of Thermopylae as some monstrous savages, and thus create an atmosphere of public mistrust in its content, and hurt the national pride of the millions of Persians while doing so."

","This movie held my interest ... the acting was solid and dialogue interesting. The variety of different accents of the actors became distracting; it was hard to understand how the Spartans, living in one small city could have so many different accents! Also distracting were the cinematographic effects. I got tired of the slow motion, the sepia toned frames, the red toned frames, etc. Also distracting in this movie was the number of mutant humans. The battle scenes were quite interesting, but historically VERY inaccurate and most likely impossible as well. I also took great exception to Xerxes (the name of a real king) being represented as very different than the real person was. Also of note was the large numbers of Persians the movie had portrayed by Black persons; Persia is now Iran and there are very few Black Iranians! The whole movie struck me like a comic book brought to life - so if you are in the mood for a completely untrue, totally fantasy, completely impossible plot and you don't mind lots of mutants, strange lighting and colors, and ultra fake backgrounds, you will enjoy this movie! It does move quickly and the actors hold your attention."
"Maniac714","10","9","20","9 March 2007"," A Beautiful, Cinematographical Masterpiece
","Forget Braveheart. Forget Troy. Forget Gladiator. These films do not hold a candle to the amazing piece of artwork that is 300. Frank Miller with Robert Rodriguez delivered a breakthrough film with Sin City. Miller amazes us once a gain with Zak Snyder with 300, the epic story of Sparta and it's king Leonidas at the battle of Thermopylae. The Battle of Thermopylae is a well known tale, and Miller takes away nothing from historical accuracy (save for the part of the Athenians actions by sea against the Persians) of Spartan life. Gerard Butler's performance is one to be modeled by; his emotional performance as the fearless, and battle-tested leader of the mighty Spartan nation transcends even the scenes in which he is not present. The bond of brotherhood and passion for his fellow man is affluent in this film and every person in the theater will feel that bond in their own bones. What makes 300 standout is that each scene brings a very unique look, from the rustling of the wheat grains while the sun pierces the cloud-covered sky, to Snyder's amazing ability to use human skin as a palate of contrast to the colors around it. Snyder, it seems, never uses the same camera angle twice, and the combination of color and shading makes for an absolute beautiful vision. Much thought had also been put into the music, and sound effects chosen by the director. Powerful choirs set the tone for pre-battle, and the orchestra sings the hearts out of these Spartans. An Epic film, 300 is not. It doesn't even come close. It exceeds ""epic"". ""Stratospheric"" would be better fitting for Zak Snyder and Frank Miller's 300. People will be talking about this film for a long time."
"almost-rockular","7","9","20","16 February 2007"," No epic film but uncompromising fighting!
","I saw the movie at the Berlinale Film Festival! I was very eager to see it, as I loved Sin City (the movie), loved the trailer (of course the one with Nine Inch Nails's song as soundtrack!), and was pretty impressed by the epic graphic novel. But could the movie really be as fast, strong and straightforward as expected?<br/><br/>With regard to Troy or Gladiator, I would actually just compare the fighting scenes. They are absolutely gripping! The dynamic between slow motion, angle change and frame-dropping is amazing! Most of the blood seemed to be CGI, but that fits in perfectly with all the other CGI. For example, all the background images should be CGI as well, since the same technique (or at least a very similar one) was used as for Sin City. But whereas Sin City was very dark and almost had no need for any background at all, it is crucial for 300!<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I can't really say if 300's backgrounds are too comicesque flat or if it is too obvious, that because of the technique the sets couldn't be as huge and realistic as in Troy or Gladiator; perhaps it could also be the lack of different 'sets' or just the adapted story itself... but somehow, I wouldn't call 300 an epic film. An epic film should be of breadth, depth, change and straight narration, in both visually and literary.<br/><br/>Also, as far as I noticed, the movie, in contradistinction to the trailer, contains no songs from Nine Inch Nails. However, the soundtrack wasn't too conventional, too, but a love theme is something you probably wouldn't think of too much after reading the graphic novel. Well, Leonidas in the movie is definitely not quite as self-righteous as he is in the novel.<br/><br/>To sum it up: The pace is rather stumbling, not really smooth nor fast as it seemed in the trailer, and the script is not as straightforward nor stubborn as the original novel... but at least, 300 definitely contains strong, uncompromising fighting scenes!"

","In about 480 B.C., the actual Battle of Thermopylae was fought in the narrow pass of the same name, which inspired many persons to come after, from military strategists to artisans. In our time, one such person, provocative graphic novelist Frank Miller, was also inspired by the tale, and has in turn inspired director Zack Snyder to produce what must be hailed as two parts art, one part history, and a full seven parts wild, unbridled anarchy.<br/><br/>The classic historical event is played out with a good measure of drama; as King Leonidas (Gerard Butler) and his force of 300 of the legendary Spartan army join with the rest of the Greek forces to hold the pass from the vast forces of Persia, his queen Gorgo (Lena Headey) fights her own battle on the home front, attempting to sanction reinforcements for her noble husband. Both heroes face incredible odds. Butler's Leonidas was not done justice by the film's trailers, which painted a bloodthirsty maniac--the actual portrayal shows a wise and cunning leader, as capable of understanding and forgiveness as he is patriotic and defiant to the enemies of honor and decency who rise against Greece. This of course makes for a fascinating character. Additionally interesting are the characters of the veteran Captain (Vincent Regan), proud to rise to the challenge alongside his son, and Queen Gorgo, willing to do anything to uphold the ideals of her husband, and of all Sparta. There are, of course, wild liberties taken with the account--although debauchery indeed ruled in Persia, and animals may have been larger, they were perhaps not so heavily armored, and King Xerxes, while intimidating, was not twenty feet tall. But, hey, it's art, right? It's a sure thing all of this takes a back seat to the stunning visuals, and the tremendous carnage of the battle scenes. Unless your clan views evisceration as a virtue, consider leaving the kiddies at home. Prepare yourself for a wild ride, with, mind you, the HINT of a history lesson."

Also the scene where Xerxes grabs Leonidas on the shoulders I thought he was going to rape him from behind. So gay!! And the scene were the Spartans die, why the f**k did Leonidas drop his helmet and shield? Makes no sense. How come there were creatures in this film? Was it LOTR IV or something? The sex scenes. What were they for? It's not like I didn't enjoy them, but they were unnecessary. When the Spartans pushed some Persians over the cliff, it was stupid. The Persians would rather throw themselves into certain death than fight? Makes no sense.<br/><br/>Good comedy film, stupid plot, bad acting, I was expecting a lot more since it's obviously so popular."

","One of the best movies that I have ever seen! And I really know movies since I have seen over 10000 and I know what I am talking about. First thing is the acting. This movie has an all star cast. The actor who played King Leonidas (Gerard Butler) is an absolutely wonderful actor. He will go on to be famous. The camera work was just as good as the acting also. A lot of the movie is CG but you can hardly tell and it doesn't take away from the movie watching experience. The editing and the slow motion effects really add to the drama and excitement to this movie. I have seen Sin City (which is great) but this movie is a lot better. I recommend this movie to anyone that knows what a good movie is!"

I have always been a fan of frank millers creations: sin city comics and movie, and 300 comics and the movie! Sin City was one of the best films i have ever seen on a decade, so i knew from the start of 300 that i would enjoy it. I mean Gerard Butler is the perfect actor for the King, King Leonidas! The action in the film was awesome. ! know this sounds cheesy but, come on there should have been more blood. But to me that doesn't really change my opinion.

","This is just an awesome film. It combines the feel of a video game with the realism of cinematography and the fascination of ancient history. Gerard Butler is outstanding as King Leonidas of Sparta, a warrior, a husband, a poet, and a king.<br/><br/>The bloody action is incredible, with heads chopped off, arrows and spears piercing every organ of the body, and all the majesty and paraphernalia of ancient warfare, including elephants and a rhino and monsters and a hunchback traitor and shields massed together in the phalanx formation. The well-known story of the decisive heroism of the 300 Spartans at Thermopylae in Central Greece in 480 B.C. against the invading Persian hordes of Xerxes is explored in detail.<br/><br/>The male bodies are well-developed, as Spartans should be. Their attitudes toward warfare and freedom are also full of definition. War is seen as a chance for glory and beauty, even in death. And, the death of the 300 Spartans offered Athens the time to prepare for the naval battle of Salamis during the following month, which forced Xerxes to retreat back to Asia.<br/><br/>Warfare in this film is shown to be an artistic exercise, in many respects. And, Homer would have been proud to endorse this film, which combines many of Homer's themes of warfare as found in the Iliad. Finally, perhaps freedom is not ""free,"" but rather simply the consequence of sacrificial heroism in the face of almost overwhelming odds, a feast of patriotism, warrior skills, and death."

","Well, this is my first review since joining. I am by no means a movie expert however I am reasonably intelligent, and open-minded when it comes to movies. First of all, I am glad to see that the rating is slowing going down, and is currently at 8.0. I hope that once all the hype dies down it eventually settles on 5 or 6.<br/><br/>300 looks good, at times great, but is let down in a number of areas. Slow pacing and predictable battles are probably the major reason I found this film so boring. On top of this, I found it quite hard to emphasize with the Spartans... I didn't care if they died or not and the predictability of the movie, coupled with the wooden acting, only added to this. You can really tell the actors recited the entire movie in front of a blue (or green?) screen. The use of slow motion was obsessive and honestly a lot of the battle sequences would have looked better in normal speed.<br/><br/>I wasn't turned off by the historical accuracy nonsense (who the hell could expect it to be accurate anyway) but a lot of 'practical' things annoyed me, for example the fact that 1000s would charge the 300 at a time, and yet in the 'slow motion slash' sequences there would be like 3 guys in the background. And who could not laugh at the guitar-playing goat LMAO.<br/><br/>I honestly cannot see how people could rate this 8 or higher, I know everyone has different tastes but... well, I saw this with 4 mates and all agreed it was a stinker- the highest rating it got was a 6. It really is quite boring between battles and VERY predictable. People keep lauding the battle scenes but I felt interested ONCE during battles, when Leonardis was fighting the big guy from the Immortals.<br/><br/>In short, I came in feeling a little apprehensive and left knowing that these feeling were fully justified. Terribly over-rated. 4/10."

His army is as numerous as it is insurmountable.<br/><br/>Courage is an understatement for the Spartans.<br/><br/>By impression to be all violent and gore, the movie is actually elemental in humanity and beauty. It is story telling of enormous captivity, trilling and emotional. This film is highly graphic with its amount of details in every scene. CGI aside, notice the colours that were used to paint every mood. Admire the camera angles that dynamically transform the idea on screen. Do grasp tightly for the tension is compelling.<br/><br/>Greed, deceit, betrayal¬Ö Arrogance, imprudence, valiant¬Ö Slavery, mystic, lust and more¬Ö<br/><br/>Humanity is raw, beastly and loving.<br/><br/>Think not towards that this film as brainless fighting, making blood spills and amputations its entertainment.

This film is not for the weak but for the brave.<br/><br/>Notice the minimal descriptive leads of the ""300"" story in this writing. The concept of ""300"" is simple, but the execution is perfection.

I am half Greek but one would say that living in Greece would make you biased against the film, Greeks today do not live up to the past standards. However, the film made me feel very proud and was a pleasant change to the usual Athenian democracy and philosophy which is always mentioned throughout Greek history. Excellent battle scenes, superb actors/actresses and fitting music. The colouring was also extremely suiting and gave a perfect impression of the world in those days compared to the scenes from other movies such as Troy etc. I couldn't have asked for anything more:-)<br/><br/>The only thing I was a little disappointed with was the love scenes, the filming of them seemed a little funny...<br/><br/>Apart from this I could not fault the film for anything else."
"vin_moran","2","6","12","28 March 2007"," I could not contain my disappointment
","First off, if you go to see this film, go knowing it is a comic book adaptation and as such don't expect historical accuracy and expect mutants and everything else thrown in for good measure. It's pretty unfair to criticize the film on these points.<br/><br/>But you can be forgiven for thinking that with this sort of creative freedom surely the film can't fail? Well actually, it can.<br/><br/>There are so many bad points to this film it is hard to concentrate on exactly what to criticize. The most prominent failure of the film, however, is that it makes no effort to get the audience to care in any way for any character in the film at any time. It is a drawn-out, slow motion snooze-fest.<br/><br/>Admitedly the effects and cinematography are superb, but it is perhaps the films only saving grace.<br/><br/>Poor acting, simply awful dialogue (at which the audience sporadically giggled - not the intention of the film makers by the way) and a non-existent storyline hamstring what could have been a superb film.<br/><br/>The film is full of rousing speeches and gut-wrenching battles - but no ground is laid before it. What exactly are the Spartans trying to defend? They talk of being 'free men' who will not surrender to the dark forces of Persia. But what do they mean by free? From the evidence of the film, their definition of being free seems to mean being free to commit infanticide, to be free to practice homophobia (quite strange for such buff, under-dressed men who hang around all the time wearing nothing but thongs and flexing their muscles) and freedom to be blood thirsty thugs. In fact, the only admirable quality in their society may be that their women are not second-class citizens.<br/><br/>The 'bad guys' are de-famed as homosexuals (thus making it more righteous to kill) who are all black or Asian - specifically not white.<br/><br/>But aside from semantics and politics, the film just doesn't work. There are obvious holes in the plot that are glossed over (like the fact that there are 300 soldiers - but half way through the narrator says hundreds leave the battle field but visually the numbers remain the same). The characters are bland and have no individual personality. Their backgrounds are not given - therefore giving the audience no idea what they stand to lose and robbing them of all empathy. I could go on and on but this films simply isn't worth the time. Rent Sin City let this one go under your radar."

","Sometimes it does wonders when you enter a theater with mixed expectations. More so when you don't know much about the Greeks, not that I care much about history.<br/><br/>Well first things first. This will go down as one of the best visual treats one would ever experience on a silver screen. The frequent ""oohs"" and ""aahs"" every now on then in the crowd, goes on to prove that everyone was engaged throughout the runtime of the enterprise. The fight sequences are enthralling and anyone who is interested in the craft of movie making would understand that the crew, on as well as behind the screen shed that extra drop of sweat to get exactly what they aspired.<br/><br/>With a war movie involving kings and queens, comparisons to past giants like The Gladiator and Braveheart is inevitable. But make no mistake, 300 is as much a thoroughly enjoyable piece of art as any of its predecessors.<br/><br/>Do yourself a favor, watch 300 on a Sunday afternoon even if it means overlooking your backlog of errands that you have been pushing off to this particular weekend for ages now.

","Since Lords of the Ring, Peter Jackson a legendary director has set a new trend, a trend that many multi million budget movies had tried to copy and transform into a clich√©, a clich√© that is not working anymore. Audience is thirsty to see more of that but it is not there anymore.<br/><br/>When the teaser of 300 was released, it was eye catching and stunned every single audience. It had a message that wanted to say this is just part of the great battle and a great detailed story.<br/><br/>This matrix selling, tried to be Lord of the ring, Braveheartish movie had something else at the first glance. The Persian old saying for this is: ""Drum has stunning sound but with nothing inside"".<br/><br/>After the first public release of the movie, for the first quarter of the movie time all audiences were waiting for the battle to start and when the battled started it was good. It was part of the trailer they saw. And this was just part of their expectation. But it did only show one part of the formation of armies which was only Spartan side and no sign of Persians. How did that multi-million army, the greatest and the largest of army of all time gathered into a single group? What kind of organization was there to control that massive army? How did they plan and how did they move? Even Peter Jackson spent a while showing the enemy and how it was formed and motivated. It even showed a bit of audacity in the enemy, something that was ZERO in Persian side. But was there absolutely not a single human being among those 2.7 million (according to Herodotus) had not a single strong person to show in the movie? Or it has be movie selling junk? Was it again another fast-food movie? Yet audience expected more. They wanted to know what movie has to offer beside those eye catching shots from the teaser. That nice ""THIS IS SPARTA"" was the nicest phrase and gesture from Gerard Butler in the movie and it was already shown and it already spoiled, in fact it looked nicer in the teaser than the movie itself.<br/><br/>Zack Snyder had actually offered his best parts except few into the teaser. That made the movie a big shot box-office to start but will it last for another one month? By the time that this article is written it is not even end of the first weekend but it smells that it is another Troy. Yet another big shot by big stars and polished, eye catching colors movie made by computer graphics.<br/><br/>The word Persian was mentioned more than a hundred times and Xerxes was mentioned more than ten times. It was shown as a naked, shaved, homosexual king. So it was supposed to be based on true existing country and true existing battle and of course it is undeniable by any audience that is illustration of battle of Thermopylae. But was it loyal? Was it even tried to be loyal? It was all fantasy, but the director did not even dare to mention that it was fantasized by writer and many characters was added just to make movie sellable! It was clear that even in the Spartan way of fight they added technique of fighting that was not even exist or being used by them but just to make the movie look better and nicer.<br/><br/>The Persian generals and armies looked anything but Persians. From Indian to Arabs or even Chinese and even the king is looking absolutely Indian with many pierces and jewels that only used by Indians.<br/><br/>Apparently nor the director or writers or even novelist did even do a simple Google search as part of study of making a movie based on historical names and facts. Just googling the name Xerxes in google image will result him on top of the page and impossible to miss. That Xerxes has very long bear, he wears a cylinder eastern style hat (which used to be black in color) and a clothing that fully cover body, but not naked. He wears a very long and very covering frock that is indistinguishable in pictures carved on stone from his own palace.<br/><br/>The military techniques of Persian was not shown at all in the movie. It was pack of lies when they crossed the sea when it did not showed who exactly was the first maker of longest floating bridge of all time joining Europe and Asia to pass more than a million people, Cavalry horses and elephants.<br/><br/>Persian were called barbarian many times just to fulfill the Spartan hatred and only to fake audience point of view in Spartan way.<br/><br/>But why everything is Americanized? Why Americans want to show everything so American? Was Spartan indeed acting like American army? Was American army based or inspired from Spartans? I was personally disappointed from Frank Miller, specially being a translator of his previous art ""Sin City"" and I believe he indeed destroyed his art by his wrong illustration of one side of battle (looser or winner) without any neutral point of view in regard of a historical event.<br/><br/>I wished 300 was another independent movie from Frank Miller but it was not anymore."

","Well I knew going in to 300 that I was probably going to dislike it. I disliked Sin City. I went because I do like comic books but the guess the violence on the page just isn't as visceral as the violence translated to screen. On screen it just seems ridiculous especially when their is no story behind it. Comic books are one thing; they're short the narrator and the characters tell their story through pictures. For some reason the directors and producers of these movies just can't seem to translate that storytelling of the characters to the big screen. The narration on screen just falls flat. The whole time I was watching the movie I had to wonder whether David Wenham ever said to the director and the writer, ""you're kidding right, you really expect me to say this!"" The narration and well, most of the dialog was laughable. There was too much of what we have seen before. Muted tones, wheat fields, blustering speeches of glory and death done far better in other movies. The arrogance of the King, his political and deformed adversaries plus the filmmakers is the undoing the all of us.<br/><br/>The only saving grace of the whole movie was the Queen. If all of the roles had been written as well as her's the film would have been far better.<br/><br/>On another note I think that parents should be extremely caution before taking their young male children to this movie. There isn't just violence in it; there is a lot of sexual content(nudity) and expect for the role of the Queen at lack of respect toward women. 1/10"
"zadoc-paet","1","28","81","16 March 2007"," 300 Reasons Why this Movie is Awful
","The number ""300"" must stand for the number of reasons why this movie is awful; and that's not counting the roughly 300,000 ways that this was historically inaccurate. Frank Miller's rewrite of an important historical event in world history fails on many levels: It's not entertaining, it's poorly written, it's poorly acted, it's poorly directed, and it's poorly produced.<br/><br/>The ""300"" focuses on the Battle of Thermopylae, a battle which took place in the year 480 BCE when Leonidas, a co-king of the Greek city-state of Sparta, led three hundred of his finest soldiers and an additional 6300 allied Greeks from other city-states to hold off an army of 300,000 Persians who intend to burn Athens to the ground. The goal of Leonidas was to stall the Persians long enough for his Athenian allies to defeat the Persian navy. That is recorded history.<br/><br/>Here is the premise of the movie: Let's watch the Spartans kill 10,000 Persians. Okay, let's watch them fight a rhino. Okay, let's watch them fight some elephants. Okay, now they they've killed hordes of Persians, elephants, and rhinos, let's have them fight mutated Persians! It's not hard to realize that ""300"" quickly devolves from the retelling of an epic, to a simple smut film for those who delight in senseless violence.<br/><br/>The writers of ""300"" forgot to bring the plot, which shouldn't have been so hard since the Battle of Thermopylae is among the greatest tales in western culture! The writers where obviously very gorked when it comes to history. Not only did they portray the Persians as a demon-like race, they turned the Spartan army into a mass of shaved and nearly nude men, who fought in an undisciplined manner and out of phalanx.<br/><br/>What of the 6300 other Greeks at Thermopylae? They are hardly made a mention of. And the 700 Thespians and 400 Thebans who also made their last stand alongside Leonidas were completely ignored. Even the heroic death of King Leonidas and the heroism of the last of the standing Spartans was erased from this movie and rewritten.<br/><br/>As for the Persians? King Xerxes of the Persian Empire is portrayed as dim-witted and evil, which is very far from the truth. The Persians themselves are shown was hideously twisted monsters, the likes of which only exist in Christianity's descriptions of Hell.<br/><br/>Sure, Hollywood has always altered history in moves: JFK, Spartacus, Gladiator, et cetera; but at least the men and women who produced those moves hired writers that lent intellectual entertainment to history, not this farce that is ""300"".<br/><br/>The common response to all of the criticism is, ""Well, '300' is based off a comic book."" Really? Let us not be so naive. The Battle of Thermopylae is the heritage of the entire western world. Every western nation has adopted the men who fought and died at Thermopylae as their heroes. This film not only insults Greeks, but it is a disgrace to the memory of those who fought and died at Thermopylae, these men who have had their legacy live on 2480 years, only to have it now perverted for the purpose of entertainment. The film is an insult to all of western culture.<br/><br/>It is also impossible to ignore several racist overtones in the movie, especially at a time when several western nations are at war with Middle Eastern countries that are home to modern Persians. In ""300"", it shows Persians to be inhuman deformed monsters, who are without morals. Even mighty Xerxes, a hero in Persian history, is made a mockery of. Along these same lines, is it coincidence that every ""bad guy"" who had lines in this movie is Black? A proper analogy for ""300"" would be that it is an enormous wall. Each brick in the wall is a lie and an insult to the entire world, and the mortar that holds it together is filth and excessive violence that would make John Rambo seem tame. All in all, this movie is a pack of lies sewn together with poor special effects and a loop of action sequences that has more in common with a broken record than cinematic art."

From 483 BC Xerxes prepared his expedition with great care: a channel was dug through the isthmus of the peninsula of Mount Athos, provisions were stored in the stations on the road through Thrace, two bridges were thrown across the Hellespont. According to Herodotus, Xerxes' first attempt to bridge the Hellespont ended in failure when a storm destroyed the flax and papyrus bridge; Xerxes ordered the Hellespont whipped three hundred times and had fetters thrown in. Xerxes' second attempt to bridge the Hellespont was successful.[3] Xerxes concluded an alliance with Carthage, and thus deprived Greece of the support of the powerful monarchs of Syracuse and Agrigentum. Many smaller Greek states, moreover, took the side of the Persians, especially Thessaly, Thebes, and Argos. Xerxes, with a large fleet and army (Herodotus the Greek historian claimed that there were over 2,000,000 soldiers), set out in the spring of 480 BC from Sardis. Xerxes was victorious during the initial battles. At the Battle of Thermopylae, a small force of warriors, led by King Leonidas, resisted the much larger Persian forces, but were ultimately defeated. After Thermopylae, Athens was conquered, and the Athenians and Spartans were driven back to their last line of defense at the Isthmus of Corinth and in the Saronic Gulf. At Artemisium, the battle was indecisive as large storms had destroyed ships from the Greek side. The battle was also stopped prematurely as the Greeks learned news of the defeat at Thermopylae and retreated. But Xerxes was induced by the message of Themistocles (against the advice of Artemisia of Halicarnassus) to attack the Greek fleet under unfavourable conditions, rather than sending a part of his ships to the Peloponnesus and awaiting the dissolution of the Greek armies. The Battle of Salamis (September 29, 480 BC) was won by the Athenians. Having lost his communication by sea with Asia, Xerxes was forced to retire to Sardis; the army he left in Greece under Mardonius was defeated in 479 BC at Plataea. The defeat of the Persians at Mycale roused the Greek cities of Asia."

The costumes are clearly invention based on the graphic novel that, unfortunately, is in the film origin. The protagonist, Leonidas, is a beast full of blood-lust who Buttler lends undeserved talent. The villain, the Persian emperor Xerxes, is a devilish and effeminate creature covered in gold and mounted on a golden wedding cake, to which called the Brazilian Rodrigo Santoro (perhaps by any actor in Hollywood have allowed himself to pay similar humiliation?).

","In ancient times, King Leonidas of the Greek region of Sparta takes a small cadre of men to defend a narrow pass against a vast enemy force. Defying the Gods, his Council and the odds, what fate and glory will become of them ?<br/><br/>As a historical epic, this movie doesn't work very well; it doesn't really explain why the Spartan force was so small, it grossly oversimplifies Sparta's role (there were at least eight other Greek city-states represented), and takes a lot of liberties with a realistic depiction of the battle. As a character drama, it doesn't work either; all the heroes are macho clods with paint-by-numbers personalities and the villains are debauched weakling fools with nothing to say (although gold-encrusted, eight-foot-tall, androgynously campy Xerxes is at least some fun). As an adaptation of the comic-book series by Frank Miller and Lynne Varley however, it fares a bit better; the CGI backdrops, the lovingly severed limbs and heads and the various bestial mutations give it an interesting look, although for me the complete absence of any location photography is a big turn-off in a sword-and-sandal epic. The big downer though is the look-at-me direction, which is dismal. Synder overuses lots of clever and intricate techniques but fails to understand that narrative, exposition, character and atmosphere drive a picture; if we don't care about the people and can't relate to them we don't feel anything. He just copies other movies (Braveheart, Gladiator) and other directors (Sam Peckinpah, George Miller, Peter Jackson) without realising that they built the style of their films on a solid foundation. He uses slow-motion so much (I lost count after about two-hundred shots) that it has no meaning, no effect. He should look at something like Shichinin No Samurai, where the director reserves the use of slow-motion for one moment (Kyuzo's initial duel) and the effect is simply stunning. There are some other problems - accents range from Butler's Glaswegian to Wenham's Aussie to the standard Posh British, and the stupid they-won-later-really ending kills the pathos of the story - but maybe I'm being unfairly harsh. The score by the prolific Tyler Bates is good, as are the endless effects, and there's enough bare-chested bloodletting to keep it going. But the bottom line is this is MTV movie-making - unoriginal, overblown and vacuous, with sixteen producers and no soul. If you want a choice, the 1962 Rudolph Mat√© film of this story - whilst hardly Citizen Kane itself - is a much better picture."
"jackwelch06","1","4","7","5 September 2007"," Good visuals but no storyline
","The movie has a lot of good special effects. The camera work is fine but at a lot of places one can easily make out that its a set. There also was a lack of a good storyline. From the moment the movie starts, one can predict where its headed. People who love visuals effects n non stop action are gonna love this movie. The start of the movie is good but somehow i didn't find the rest of the movie all that engrossing. The aim of the director was to show as many battle scenes as possible and he has succeeded in it. Most of the action too is pretty predictable. The hype created was excellent and to some extent, explains the high collections by the movie."

"funkyfry","3","4","7","16 August 2007"," a dirty shame
","Let's start with the good -- the visual style is clearly this film's main asset. The filmmakers have confidence in the ability of the images to tell the most important aspects of the story. For example Xerxes' coins ¬ñ we get a prolonged scene of the temple priests (who, strangely enough, look kind of like the aliens in ""V"") admiring the gold they received from Xerxes to give a negative prophecy, and then later gold falls out of the purse of the politician Theron (Dominic West), revealing his corruption. But a lot of movies, especially nowadays, would have to dumb it down by having some dude say out loud ""hey, that's Xerxes' coin!"" or something like that. Like I said, ""300"" has confidence in its visual storytelling.<br/><br/>And it needs to ¬ñ because the dialog is terrible. Liberally taking its best lines from Rudolph Mate's 1962 film ""The 300 Spartans"" isn't enough to solve the dialog problems. I'm not sure if a lot of the actors were poor or if they were poorly directed, because I haven't seen many of them in other films. But I've seen more compelling dialog in episodes of ""Xena: Warrior Princess"". In fact the whole film felt to me somewhat like a high budget TV-show. The entire environment is so hyper-stylized that I just couldn't imagine myself into that space if you know what I mean. It was interesting to look at, but hard to look into or to imagine that it could be a real space in any world. For instance, whenever the Spartans drove people or animals off the ledge, you never saw how those people or animals actually got from the open plain into this tiny space where they would allow themselves to be forced off the cliff. The film didn't create a realistic space for these events to take place in, and in fact the battle in general was not shown in any kind of way that was interesting or realistic from a strategic standpoint. The Spartan king Leonidas (Gerald Butler) talks about how they fight in a phalanx and even one Spartan dying will ruin their strategy, but then when they actually fight they only fight in the phalanx formation at the very beginning of the battles and quickly dissolve into random groups of fighters. Everyone except the Spartans seems to have been inflicted with a ""Matrix-esque"" slow-motion disease so that the Spartans can stab and spear them at will.<br/><br/>The great weakness for me in the film is that it takes itself too seriously. With a little dose of camp or even just irony, the film might be palatable. But this film actually has less humor than ""Shindler's List""¬Ö intentional humor anyway, because I laughed at a lot of the idiotic scenes like Spartan warriors raising their spears in the air to the strains of generic heavy metal music and a King Xerxes who looks like he just emerged from an S&M boutique. I watched incredulously as one of Leonidas' men called to his son at the end of the battle; the son was so distracted by an old man shouting his name on the other side of the battlefield that he didn't hear a large horse coming up behind him and cutting his head off. Then in the aftermath of this event, we are treated to a cheesy speech by the bereaved father that made me laugh out loud.<br/><br/>I can't forget to mention the film's extremely questionable politics and morals. I recently watched ""The 300 Spartans"" and was not surprised to see a lot of stuff in the film that would today be very ""politically incorrect"". But it was surprising to see so many of these elements both repeated and embellished in this new version. Kind of refreshing actually that they didn't bother to make concessions to modern politics¬Ö. But it's not like the film's creators can cry ""historical accuracy"" (after all, in real history there were no lizard-priests in Greece nor mutants with axes for arms). In fact the writers have gone out of their way to falsify history in order to fit the Spartans into modern ideas of masculinity. Leonidas, for example, mocks the Athenians as ""boy lovers"" despite the fact that the Spartans practiced homosexuality as part of official military policy. Xerxes is depicted with decidedly homo-erotic overtones, and his overtures to Leonidas have a sexual nature. The film seems to be saying that no greater evil could befall Leonidas and holding him up for praise for resisting. When you put these 2 scenes together it's impossible to avoid the conclusion that the film exploits fear and hatred of homosexual people. For personal reasons I find this reprehensible, and for aesthetic reasons I find this cheap. If you take the film seriously (and it seems to take itself seriously, being totally without humor), it is almost an advertisement for fascism ¬ñ the heroes of this movie serve with the understanding that the individual exists for the service of the state, not the state to serve the citizen. By mocking the Athenians and deliberately marginalizing their role in the Peloponnesian War (which the original film showed more accurately to Herodotus' account) this film purports to show heroes who stand up for ""freedom"" and ""reason"" while embracing a culture where the vast majority were slaves and where even ""free"" men existed only to service the State. This is compounded by the treatment of the Thespians, who in the film are shown retreating in fear whereas to my knowledge twice as many Thespians died as Spartans. Only by including the Athenians and other Greeks would we get a valid picture of who the Spartans were and what role they filled in Greek culture. Instead in this film we have this simple-minded portrayal of the Spartans as the only worthwhile Grecians, and therefore an implication that fascist states are superior to easily corrupted democracies and that warriors are inherently superior to politicians or philosophers."

","A Western head of state breaks his own laws and sends an inadequately small but highly-skilled army away from the homeland to battle Middle Eastern jerks and force a military stalemate.<br/><br/>But enough about current events.<br/><br/>If you were hoping for something a little more uplifting in ""300,"" the second cinematic adaptation of a Frank Miller graphic novel, I'm here to tell you it's pretty much another deep-sea dive into the black Id of our basest instincts.<br/><br/>Yay.<br/><br/>First, some quick kudos to those in charge of the visuals in this film: Bravo. Truly. Watching this film was like seeing a Frank Frazetta painting come to life. Gorgeous action sequences. Luscious costuming and set design.<br/><br/>But in terms of plot, the film's tone is set early when a diplomat from the Persian Empire comes to visit the Spartan King Leonidas to suggest the Spartans surrender or be invaded. The diplomat's a black guy with a lot of freakily jewelry and lip-gloss. Not quite the olive-skinned Greeks one might imagine, all the Spartans in this movie look as though the cast of ""Desperate Housewives"" decided to have a toga party. The cynical symbolism zooms off from there like some kind of Nazi propaganda film.<br/><br/>Based on true historical events, King Leonidas proceeds to mobilize the Grecian world against Xerxes I and the Persian Empire by bravely leading the small fighting force for which the film is named until they are ultimately overwhelmed by superior numbers. We all certainly owe a debt of gratitude to the real Leonidas for his part in repelling a culture that may have otherwise devoured the very basis for our democratic traditions. Bravo, my brother.<br/><br/>But if it's an accurate dramatization of these events in their true historical context you're looking for, be prepared to be disappointed big-time. If you're in the market for a lot of dubious implied parallels between this ancient struggle and the current state of relations between the Judeo-Christian West and the Muslim Middle East, however, you're in for a rare treat.<br/><br/>In the present version, King Leonidas responds to the Persian diplomat by killing him and his entire entourage in cold blood. It's okay, though, because the diplomat, as we mentioned, was just some fruity black guy and the entourage were all dressed like modern-day terrorists. The parallels being implied stand out in stark relief when Gerard Butler's Leonidas waits for permission from his wife to murder the diplomat. You could see even the hardest Gulf War vet waiting for a nod from the wife to shoot a burglar. But I bet the real King Leonidas didn't ask his woman if he could declare a war. The willowy Lena Headley's Queen Gorgo, of course, gives the nod and later cuckolds her husband to score him some political points. She's clearly a real lady. As security mom simile, she all but drives from one scene to another in an SUV. The comparison couldn't have been more complete if she were sitting in a Spartan Starbucks spouting self-serving tales about the trials of being a full-time queen while raising an eight-year-old prince. We naturally never see the horde of slaves the real Queen Gorgo certainly had at her disposal night and day.<br/><br/>Like some kinda neo-con suck-up's wet dream, the film proceeds to demonize nearly everyone who isn't a statuesque white guy with really nice abs. These white guys strut around in cod-pieces and red capes with their pecks hanging out like some kind of Chippendale chorus line with spears. Of course with rare exception they annihilate everyone in their path until they are betrayed by a hideously-deformed warrior wanna-be they wouldn't let in their club.<br/><br/>Poor, poor us.<br/><br/>Here's a quick reality check:<br/><br/>First, Persia eventually became Iran and in 1953 the CIA helped engineer a coup in which a democratically elected prime minister was deposed and a monarch, the Shah of Iran, was installed as the head of state and this was all done to protect Western oil interests. NEVER MIND the Crusades.<br/><br/>Second, Western-style democracy is on the march all over the face of the planet. Even communist China has embraced western-style capitalism.<br/><br/>Third, no Muslim state exists which could hope to match America's military or economic might.<br/><br/>But gosh, that's no fun, is it? I mean without some big enemy juggernaut with which to spar, we might actually have to sit down and think about what to do with the unprecedented peace and wealth all our forefathers, from Leonidas to Bill Clinton, have bestowed upon us. Should we ensure health care for all? End poverty in our lifetime? Address global warming? Explore the depths of the sea? Build high-speed rail? Go back to the moon? Challenge ourselves to forever raise the bar for all our noblest aspirations?<br/><br/>Naaaaaaaaaaaahhhh.<br/><br/>Let's demonize everyone who isn't just like us and make them all look like a pack of corrupt, deformed, homosexual religious fanatics. Let's lump them all in with the rag-tag network of Muslim malcontents that manages to slip a bomb by us every now and again.<br/><br/>YES!!! I feel so much better, now. I no longer need to worry if my abs are the tightest or tannest! I can just align myself with this cabal of hatred and everything else will just fall into place. Sig Heil!!!<br/><br/>If you want to see a good historical drama about courage colliding with politics, might I suggest 'Serpico,' 'The Hunt for Red October,' or 'All the President's Men.'<br/><br/>If you want to see a good movie about dutiful and honorable warriors realistically dispatching enemies, I'd recommend 'Gladiator,' 'Glory,' or 'Saving Private Ryan.'<br/><br/>As for '300,' the people who crafted this ugly little ball of snot masquerading as entertainment ought to be sent to walk foot patrols outside the Green Zone in Iraq."

","Quite the visual feast, so much so that the story just can't keep up. That's not to say that the script is bad, but it just can't compete with the look of the film. Every scene of this film is beautiful to watch, and shot so perfectly that one is simply in awe of the talent involved. The big action scenes manage to remain intimate and personal by the slowing down and speeding up of the film, making it much easier to follow than the typical MTV-style editing and vibrating camera. It makes it obvious what is going on, a welcome change from most sword-and-sandal epics. The story is a bit too complex for a film like this, and the political subplot really doesn't work at all. The acting is surprisingly good, especially from Butler, who really owned this film with his magnetic performance, and the film's weirder moments were balanced out nicely by the fight scenes. Not especially great, but very entertaining and quite beautiful."
"JHerculano","9","4","7","12 May 2007"," Art on a wide canvas
","300 is not an historical film, as we understand and define it. It is, for the lack of a better definition, a super-realistic (as in beyond surreal) vision over an historical fact that is in no small way vital to our western identity and culture. Like an art photograph, or a portrait, it attempts to distil the emotions and broad canvas of a time and place. And in it succeeds far beyond what I thought possible from an adaptation of Frank Miller's comic book (or, if you wish, graphic novel). I am a lover of history, and have studied for quite a while ancient Greece, and, as a personal favorite, the Battle of the Thermopylae. Anyone that approaches 300 on hopes of historical accuracy will be sorely disappointed, as almost nothing fits. But one who approaches it from that angle does so in utter ignorance, against all that has been written, promised and otherwise mentioned about it. I must have seen this movie, on my computer, more times than any other movie that I can remember, and always with the pleasure of immersion not on a different time and place, but on a gripping story well told, where 21st century technology meets old campfire story telling. As for Iranians or others feeling offended by it¬Ö any old story is bound to leave someone offended, if offense is what you constantly seek in this world."

","THE FILM Despite some traditional slowmo and semi-interesting fighting choreography, the fight-scenes are AT BEST mediocre.

Music and situations are at 100% adrenaline/drama all of the time, from first to last frame. So you kinda loose interest. <br/><br/>THE POLITICS Now, for the story/moral. If you'd studied history, you know this film is like a total ripoff of Nazi Germany, Pol Pot or extreme rightwing American propaganda. Which is kinda remarkable. This is a highly political, prowar, racism film, i see no other reason why it would be made in this way. If he just wanted to make a ""fun action film"" he wouldn't have done it so flamboyantly bias. And that he is doing it from an old comic book, what kind of lame excuse it that? Sin Sity did not have this problem (that was a good film, it was extremely ""comic book stylish"" but managed to work as a film anyway).<br/><br/>Even if you disregard plot, characters, politics, acting and music (and how the **** can you?) this is still a pretty boring film.<br/><br/>THEY SHOULD HAVE Cut together a 10min action-sweep with the best fighting scenes (there are about 10min of them, the rest is just repetition). I would probably give that a 7/10. But the film in its current form is just silly.<br/><br/>YOU LIKE IT? Sadly many people that like the film says ""its just a film, but by the way: its kinda of like that in the world today/the film brings up a important issue these days"".

But it wasn't enough; this absolute worthless rubbish storyline is not made up for by the outstanding visuals seen on screen.<br/><br/>The story doesn't provide any sort audience engagement, rather just a bloodbath of Persian warriors.

To put it simply, 300 is a revolution in modern cinema, bringing back the classic 'epics' of old (Spartacus for example) and refining it to the point of perfection. No movie that I've seen has come close to the sheer power and ferocity that encompasses 300, coupled together with the fascinating story of the might of the Spartans against the incomparable number of Persians.<br/><br/>Visually, well, it's just mind-blowing. Reminiscent of Sin City and Gladiator, the direction and color offers a unique and awe-inspiring feel and energy to the movie. The CGI is just fantastic, portraying some truly frightening beasts and unsettling warriors. The battle scenes make The Two Towers battle scene look like a bunch of drunken hooligans at the bar, but then again, 300 did not hold back on the onslaught of blood and gore, no complaints there.<br/><br/>The only possible negativity I could see in the movie is that maybe the excessive violence won't suit some, but the fact is, the genre it's in, the comic it's based on and the story that ensues, you'd have to be crazy to think it isn't apt. 300 is a classic of our time and a milestone in cinematic history.

There is a fair amount of equally rationed violence (of course), nudity, ugliness, passion and an abundance of nonchalant behavior by the Spartan warriors in the face of imminent death.

","Not since Lord of the Rings movies, have I seen a movie this good. I have seen this movie 3 times since it was released 5 days ago, and every time I have enjoyed it just as much as the first time. Gerard Butler does one of the most believable acting jobs I have seen in a long time, he truly brought the character of King Leonidas alive. The scenery in this movie is captivating, and the soundtrack is great. I love the way Zack Snyder brought this story together and brought the pages of Frank Millers graphic novel to life. This is what movies are about, this is proof that it pays off to do something different. Thisis why I love movies!!!"

","OK OK, I was reading the comments on that it is not historically correct. You are stupid, whoever complains that it is not is a moron and should be taken out into the woods and shot. This is based after a fiction graphic novel, and it is meant to entertain not to inform. Yes Yes it was inspired by true events but by no means is it supposed to be a history lesson for anyone. Anyone who says the plot and script were bad, shut up. It was well written for the most part and the comments about the whole ""speeches"" about fighting and stuff, it is great speeches, it is not really clich√É¬© at all it is just showing that they have emotions and they are not just mindless killing machines, if you have any kind of a mind for great, epic (yes i said it), stylish movies, go see this movie, sneak in do anything, see this movie it is well worth anything you pay."

","If you're a fan of movies such as Gladiator or Braveheart then do yourself a favor and don't see this cornball movie. You will regret it. The only thing cheesier than the characters and the acting is the super annoying narration. The movie tries to be stylish and epic, but there is nothing compelling in the wooden characters and thin storyline. And I am someone who loves a simple well done story. All of these reviews with words like ""stunning"" and ""breath taking"" must be part of some ad campaign. There were some pretty good costumes and OK battle scenes. I could also comment on the huge political overtones of the movie, but it fails so badly as a movie that there isn't much point."
"shawny11_2001","9","7","15","12 March 2007"," The New Age of War Movies
","It did not start with ""Saving Private Ryan"" & the motto ""War is Hell."" The new age for war movies started with ""300"" and ""Why we fight."" No, this isn't a recruitment movie for the armed forces. Surprisingly, this movie is about the reason for going to war, what would you lay your life down for, and ultimately about the sacrifices that have to be made for victory. But if you walked out of the movie saying ""Gosh, that was really violent,"" you completely missed the point of the movie and should be kept from breeding.<br/><br/>Acting - Gerard Butler as Leonidas is at his best in this movie. No one else could deliver a corny line (about fighting for too long and how kneeling would hurt) any better. It was said with kingly charisma. The other standout was Lena Headly as Queen Gorgo. It's not often you see a strong woman character in a primarily male cast. All the others played their parts well, as Spartan soldiers willing to die.<br/><br/>Music - The perfect blend of metal and symphony but separated. Tyler Bates did a wonderful job. And there's nothing better than watching a band of angry Spartans marching towards the Persians with a heavy metal guitar-riff going.<br/><br/>SFX - Absolutely fantastic, except for Xerxes towering over Leonidas. That was very bad, but overall, the CGI and blue-screen work was fantastic. The stylized feel of the movie was brought out through this technique, and gave it a true comic-book feeling, even moreso than Sin City.<br/><br/>Overall - 9 out of 10. For the depth of this type of movie, it was near perfect. Eat that, Troy!"
"MelanieG6","10","7","15","12 March 2007"," Not for men only
","So far, I've seen this movie twice on IMAX -- two days in a row. I looked around and I definitely felt outnumbered! I was one of a handful of women in the theater. I think the two men sitting near me couldn't figure me out and why I was there alone on Friday afternoon. I told them, hey I'm a Gerry Butler fan and the movie is full of half naked men, what's not to like? I have been waiting for this movie for two years, and it is Zack Snyder's masterpiece! It is simply visually stunning. I just wanted the experience to wash over me. Every frame was like a beautiful oil painting. The violence didn't bother me. I'm not one to seek out slasher films (or zombie films, but I did enjoy Zack's Dawn of the Dead), but I like Gladiator and films like it. It's like Debbie Snyder characterized it -- a ballet of death. It's all so over the top and beautiful that it's nothing like the horror of a war movie like Saving Private Ryan. The severed limbs and decapitations -- Seems strange to say, but it's weirdly beautiful. You just sit there with your mouth open in admiration at the way Zack filmed this. I love, love, love his filming technique for the battle sequences. So many films -- think Gladiator here -- just make it a choppy viewpoint of a man in the battle maelstrom. You're sharing in the confusion of the battle participants and you have no idea how the battle is going -- it's just all chaos. THIS movie was not like that. I loved how the alternating speed up, slow mo had you appreciating each movement. It wasn't just a crowd of guys banging around.<br/><br/>I couldn't help thinking about the words of some of the negative reviews. So I asked myself, is this dialog cheesy and trite? I didn't have that reaction -- I just ate it all up. It's like nothing you've ever seen before, and I don't really expect an action movie to have the deepest plot. Some people said the plot was too thin, but really, what else would have been added to have MORE? I think more background would have dragged down the story and the impact of it all. It's tight, concise and packs the punch promised in the trailer. Does Gerry's journey have less Gravitas than Crowe's Maximus? Maybe Crowe had more to work with for an emotional body blow to the audience, but I still enjoyed the ride Zack took me on. Contrast this to drivel like Fantastic Four. If you're going to do a comic book movie, do the damn thing RIGHT! And that's just what Zack did. Even the ending credits were beautiful graphic art. You gotta love a movie that credits ""Transexual Asian"" numbers 1, 2 and three! lol! <br/><br/>Gerry Butler was absolutely amazing! He had the mantle of a king always, and it was totally believable that those men would follow him to their death. I have to thank Zack for that moonlit shot and the love scene. That was probably mostly for us women, and we thank you most sincerely!! Very tastefully done. I feel like most R rated films that have love scenes are all about giving eye candy to the men in the audience, but I felt like you gave all genders a little gift there.<br/><br/>All the actors were great, and having seen Lena Headey in much lighter fare before, I was quite impressed with her regal performance here. Rodrigo Santoro was so different than most of his previous movies. Loved his menacing presence. Michael Fassbender as Stelios really stood out for me as well. He got some of the best lines of the film, ""We will fight in the shade"", etc. but his wicked grin looking forward to his beautiful death is something I won't soon forget.<br/><br/>I've been a Gerry Butler fan for years, but now I am a die-hard Zack Snyder fan. I can't wait to see his upcoming films. He has the eye of a true artist."
"FMACDONALD","10","7","15","12 March 2007"," So Far, In This Early Tear, This Is The Movie To Beat
","I'm a comic book geek. For those of you that know me and read my reviews, this most likely will come as no surprise to you. I grew up on a steady diet of superhero comic's as a kid, and I'm proud to say it's still a diet I keep to this day. I love that superhero movies have broken out under the action genre label, and are now labeled as what they truly are, superhero. That being said though, it seems like most movie goers are getting burned out on superhero films. Hollywood has been cranking them out left and right, to the point now that second tier characters like Ghost Rider has gotten his own feature film.<br/><br/>Does this mean that films based on comic books are a dead thing? No. Enter the anti-hero. The first big anti-hero film that made a big splash at the box office was Mike Mignol's Hellboy, a film in which the hero was a demon from hell. Then came the over rated but still good, A History Of Violence. The hero of that film was a killing machine for the mafia. Then the man that changed the face of comics forever with their dark undertones and more for adult audiences, Frank Miller threw his hat into the Hollywood ring and brought us the amazing film Sin City. Miller not only wrote and drew the graphic novels for Dark Horse Comics, he also co-wrote and co-directed with Robert Rodriguiez, to make the best comic to film transformation ever. Sin City was praised by fans and critics alike and it's sequel is in the works. It came to no surprise from me when I heard that Miller's other graphic novel that he wrote and drew, 300, was going to be brought to life.<br/><br/>Like Sin City, 300 was filmed entirely in front of blue and green screens, and the back ground was totally computer generated. That doesn't mean the 300 wasn't amazing.<br/><br/>300, so far in this early year is the best movie of 2007. The acting is awesome, the battle scenes are incredible, and it's just a fun movie. The plot is simple. The Persian Empire wants King Leonidas (Gerard Butler, who was awesome) to surrender Sparta to the Persian's. Leonidas refuses to do so and chooses to send his small country to war against the Persians. Sadly for King Leonidas, the corrupt council of Sparta will not back his plans to go to war and wants his to surrender.<br/><br/>With no help from his country, Leonidas gathers 300 of his best soldiers, to fight against over 1 million Persian soldiers, and the results are an amazing film that deserves all the attention the very overrated Gladiator got.<br/><br/>Unlike Sin City, Miller was not 100 percent hands on during this film. He wrote and produced 300 but did not direct. Instead Miller handed the directing chores to Zack Snyder, who directed the amazing Dawn Of The Dead re-make in 2004. That makes sense seeing as how Dawn of The Dead is about a handful of survivors fighting a million zombies.<br/><br/>300 is a movie for guys who like movies. You just leave your brain at the door, or you can just turn it off, and go and watch the carnage unfold before you and have a blast like I did. I saw this film with my wife and two of my friends, and all four of us loved it. Fans who do not like a lot of violence and ballad will not enjoy this film, but for those who can overlook it, run, do not walk, to your local theater and see this film. It looks even better on an IMAX screen.<br/><br/>Now a note to Mr. Miller. Please, Please, Please turn Batman: The Dark Knight Returns into a film."

","This movie was riveting and inspiring.... The audience broke out in applause twice during the movie. Leonidas was a very charming and transformational leader. The Spartans trusted their ""King"" and believed in their right for freedom and liberty. The cinematography was breathtaking. The set didn't not look ""modernized"" at all but set the mood for time travel back into the past. All in all, it is the characters that draw you into the story line. You begin to empathize for the Spartans and stand behind them in the fight to maintain their freedom. It is the must see movie of 2007 and for now it is top contender at the Oscars in my book."

You might as well be watching a snuff film. 300 seems to think war and killing is glorious as it lovingly films decapitations left and right.<br/><br/>It's also homophobic. Xerxes was not really gay, and real Spartan warriors also indulged in a fair amount of man love.<br/><br/>Could the dialogue be any more ludicrous (""Spartans! Enjoy your breakfast, for tonight we dine in hell!"")? And yeah, the traitor walks around carrying his incriminating evidence everywhere with him. Oh, and historically, the Spartans lose that last (unseen) battle in the movie."" <br/><br/>------------------------------- <br/><br/>This last (unseen battle) is the battle of Plataion where the GREEKS won the war so that we can all be free these days to speak any other language except for Persian, worship any other god except for the king and safely write nonsenses -as the above- from our pc. ""Celebration of stupidity""?...Boy, u give humanity a bad name.<br/><br/>The film is OK, not the best of all times of course. It can't be compared to the KING of all epic movies, LOTR, but its true that every frame is a beautiful painting. Nice job. Most of all, its useful cause it reminds us what is worth fighting for in this life and why some men deserve to ""live"" for ever (something that we will never ""taste"" the way we live)..."

","lets face it, I went into this film with high expectations because a lot of people said the visuals was very stunning. Which I didn't find it was. Sure, you could see a lot of cgi was put into this film, but nothing breathtaking.<br/><br/>There wasn't much of a storyline, which is always the most important to me. Man raises kid, kid goes to war, and they battle. Granted that some of the battle scenes was good, but without a proper storyline, its nothing more then a hacking and slashing gore war film.<br/><br/>Acting was OK I guess, but nothing special.

She was the perfect match to stay home and ""hold the fort"" so to speak. Each person was amazing in this movie. The backdrops were breathtaking and the costumes were beautiful in their detail and unity. The battle scenes were a little gory but nothing to awful that you couldn't enjoy the movie.

","I always hated the movies that tend to lie to the audience and flip the reality. Greece and Persians were neighbors at the time. How come one is such a savage country and the other is so democratic and how come one is full of ugly barbars and the other is all about good looking men and women?! history doesn't approve that. Persian empire was in deed a democratic empire founded by Kouroush: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrus_the_Great<br/><br/>Some might argue that showing an enemy, we shouldn't expect much of how Persian would look like. However, this movie is based on a historic fact and when embedding history, film maker must stay loyal to it. At least some research about how Iranians looked like or what they use to wear would be appreciated!"
"sethness","1","12","30","4 June 2007"," Dazzling blue-screen work, but utterly worthless and unwatchable
","Prepare to run from the theater. It's that mind-bogglingly bad.<br/><br/>The racism, homophobia, nationalism, warmongering, fear-mongering, and fascism are both artificial and ballooned into levels that are childishly inappropriate even by Hollywood standards.<br/><br/>The constant references by Spartans to their love of ""freedom"" (and how it would be replaced with servitude if they bowed down to the Persian king) are laughable, since the plot revolves around a Spartan KING protecting his KINGdom. He is, in fact, the only ""free"" person in Sparta; the other 299 warriors must be too hopped up on adrenalin and bravado to have a single political thought while they volunteer to die.<br/><br/>(When will sword-and-sandal movie makers give up on trying to tie violent kingdoms together with anachronistic ideas of freedom and fair society? It's like making a pro wrestler put on a dress and serve tea.) The movie portrays all (good) Spartans as physically perfect white folks, all the way down to immaculate hair, perfect teeth, and immaculate clothing. All ""bad"" characters have physical defects (for which they are scorned) or are made androgynous/homosexual or Asian or African.<br/><br/>Even the math involved is ludicrous and utterly unconsidered by the scriptwriters: the number ""300"" is used again and again, though the size of the ""300"" falls and expands repeatedly. The sun is blotted out by arrows shot at the Spartans, yet nobody (apparently) considered or cared how impossible it would have been to fire that many arrows. (And the number of arrows that land is barely a handful.) The number of soldiers from Sparta is supposedly ""300"", yet we never see more than 20 to 40.<br/><br/>The logistics are as empty-headed as every other part of the film: soldiers travel endlessly without food or foot sores or bedding. Swords never break or dull. Flies never buzz around corpses.<br/><br/>In short, this is a nightmarishly childish, moronic piece of filth with no excuse and no redeeming qualities. Nobody could like this film, except perhaps a violent, heavily medicated, muddle-headed, neo-Nazi 5-year-old boy who doesn't know what ""freedom"" means yet.<br/><br/>If this film has any positive value, it might be as a cautionary tale: an example of conservative, militaristic madness (like ""reefer madness"") that hyperbolizes the worst parts of the culture that produces it. While trying to stir up patriotism and pro-military sentiment, this film merely turns those concepts into (rightfully) laughable yet nauseating material."
"WriterDave","5","12","30","13 March 2007"," One Nation Under a Raving Lunatic
","Zack Snyder's gleefully insane adaptation of Frank Miller's graphic novel, ""300"" just may be the first movie to appeal to both radically hawkish hard-line conservatives and to the most outgoing section of the gay community. Zack Snyder, it seems, is a uniter, not a divider. ""300"" is over-the-top visually and thematically, morally corrupt, erotically jingoistic, and infected with both nihilistic and fascist sensibilities.<br/><br/>In an attempt to make the onslaught of computer generated images appear more like film, Snyder decides to add a faux-graininess to many of the more elaborate shots, which makes much of them hard to see. Of course, some of these images aren't without their artistic merit, often visually transfixing and compelling in their composition. Overall, he does a commendable job in his literal translation of comic book images to the big screen (much in the same vein as the far superior ""Sin City."") Some of it (like most of the well staged and fantastically gory battle scenes) is amazing, but much of it (even the Spartan soldiers' abs look computer generated) is just plain silly.<br/><br/>For a movie that attempts to be so trailblazing from a visual perspective, the storyline stays alarmingly close to the conventions of both macho-man war epics and comic book action films. The dialogue is mostly screaming and vague speeches about ""honor and liberty and justice"" backed-up by glaring and pompous music. It makes the script from ""Gladiator"" seem like Shakespeare in comparison. As far as the cast goes, the beautiful Lena Headey lends herself nicely to the film's aesthetics and acts as if she is staring in a far more refined historical epic. In the lead role of mad King Leonidas, Gerard Butler does a wildly entertaining impersonation of someone doing a spoof on a young and robust Sean Connery. He's the only one seeming to have fun with the self-seriousness of the whole endeavor, and dare I say it, this could be a star-making role for him.<br/><br/>Lambasting ""300"" for historical inaccuracies would be like condemning ""American Idol"" for not allowing presidential candidates to debate on the show between songs. History is not what this film is about. In some ways it feebly tries to channel the spirit of Greek myth. In its celebration of physical beauty, view of courage as how loud you can scream and how many people you can decapitate, and idolizing the mentality of ""freedom at any costs,"" it appeals to both ancient Greeks and unfortunately, a certain segment of the modern audience. Ultimately, this is just another film that fetishizes death and martyrdom over the innate will to survive. Even Mel Gibson's equally violent ""Apocalypto"" recognized man's unshakable will to live. Willing a glorious death is no way to spend one's life, and as entertaining as much of it is, ""300"" panders to our basest desires of self annihilation."

Unfortunately, I don't know a thing about the story this is based on, so I'm not saddled with any preconceptions there, and I'm judging this movie COMPLETELY on its own merit, which I found really lacking.<br/><br/>I went expecting a big ol' bloodbath with some witty quips, lots of freaks, badassery all around and no story to speak of.<br/><br/>What I got was a flick that tried WAY too hard for the one-liners, a story that would've been bearable if it the narration hadn't been so forced, and characters that were painfully predictable. I wouldn't even mention that, but yes, this film DID try for plot, and it tried a lot harder than I had been led to believe by other people's reviews. I wish it hadn't; I would have enjoyed it more.<br/><br/>The battle scenes were just vaguely amusing chaos with two notable exceptions: When they actually used the phalanx, it was cool, and when they were fighting that giant dude, that was pretty well-done. The rest of it was just dull repetition of uninteresting scenes; OK, a limb there, a limb here, lots of blood, woohoo. But wait! We can do slow motion! We can do slow motion! We can do slow motion! We can -- WE GET IT, STOP WITH THE SLOW MOTION. It works sometimes for dramatic emphasis. It was overused in this movie to the point where it actually interrupted the action, and that's all this movie had going for it to begin with.<br/><br/>Another thing I wasn't impressed with was the cinematography. I don't know why people are so impressed. There are a few shots where it's obvious they were going for some kind of art-film appeal... mostly, though, it's just adequate. Not bad, but certainly not great. The mood was cool; I love the whole monochromish color thing, but aside from that... there wasn't much there.<br/><br/>Bland choreography, hokey dialogue, uninteresting visuals... this movie just has so little going for it.

","While this movie is xenophobic, homophobic, misogynistic, historically inaccurate, and generally offensive, it is entertaining by being unintentionally funny.<br/><br/>I could talk about the actual plot, but there isn't much of one worth talking about. Summed up: Manly white men fight the gay/Middle-Eastern menace for ""freedom"", while mocking those boy-loving Athenian intellectuals (the ones with democracy), and showing that the hideously deformed really should be thrown off a cliff.<br/><br/>There were entire scenes that had me in tears from laughter, most notably, when the villain (a nine foot tall drag queen, not actually played by RuPaul) orders the hyper-masculine hero to kneel, gesturing emphatically with his rhinestone studded crotch. The Hero responds by throwing a large phallic object at the villain's face. Comic gold.<br/><br/>The fact that the Spartans seem to have been costumed from a fetish shop adds to the visual appeal if one is into oiled down muscle men in black leather hot pants. Don't worry - they put something in for the straight guys too: the only female character has a long, lovingly shot, gratuitous sex scene near the beginning of the film. And if you're into the armless, horribly scarred or disfigured women, there's some gratuitous nudity of them for you, too. Something for the whole family, really.<br/><br/>If one feels the need to see this movie, I would recommend watching it for the sheer joy of seeing some homophobic, women hating morons overcompensate their way into making a fetish film."

Now that Iran (If you didn't know, Persia is the old name for Iran) is in conflict with the US, they are shown as barbarians. Also, the dialog was really cheap and insulting towards every nation.

It dragged in many places and could've done better without going into the needless details it did.<br/><br/>The film's high point was it's beauty. The whole movie was beautiful, even the terrifying immortals and Xerxes' concubines, as well at the battlefield, were all beautiful in their horror. It has an amazing atmosphere and style not found in many movies. As far as acting, I hand it to Gerard Butler, who gives his best in everything, and David Wenham and Rodrigo Santoro who impressed me.<br/><br/>However, the main issue of the film is that it never knows to which audience it caters to. Is it to the Miller fans, and graphic novel enthusiasts? Or is it to the teenagers leftover from Sin City, who love gore and sex, but would be bored by a simple historic film? Or even to the adults who enjoyed other epic movies? It never quite makes up it's mind about this. It tries to be edgy and trendy, and even at times to be shocking, and fails at this, it all seems a little silly and out of place. It fails at the very thing that makes other graphic novel and comic movies succeed.<br/><br/>I rated it a 7.

I want to believe, that this director won't be famous, because his films are showing us only violence. Violence is not a problem, Oldboy is also full with violence, but it is a beautiful and shocking story. 300 has only a liar story. Please keep distance from it!"

This is nothing more than a film of some great special effects but it soon gets very boring and they just keep on repeating themselves over and over again, Sure it has some cool pictures in it but it really becomes ridiculous when these 300 SPARTANS (that the scream out to many times) take down most of the Persian empire.

","300 tells you a little about Spartans and how they are selected and trained as warriors. King Leonidas takes 300 of the best warriors to fight the Persians supposedly against the wishes of the Oracle.<br/><br/>There is no character arc and little story at all. It's war with lots of visual and sound effects of slicing, dicing, and blood splatter. There were some scenes that I found disturbingly weird like the Persian king's harem tent.<br/><br/>If you're into movies for special effects, you might like it.

","I saw this in theatres years ago. I'm just reviewing this now because I've been reading up on how Hollywood tries to re-educate the dumbed down general public..and this movie is a prime example.<br/><br/>1) The Greeks were savages compared to the Persians, that's why they lost their empire to them.<br/><br/>2) Spartans were known for being gay, any history book will tell you they slept with each other. FACT <br/><br/>3)All the Spartans speak about is freedom, but in their society they owned many slaves. FACT <br/><br/>4)All the Greeks look Aryan..GIVE ME A BREAK, I know most people don't know history, but go to Greece and look at the people, they have olive, to dark skin, they have thick black curly hair and brown eyes. Why do the Spartans, even the women have blonde hair and blue eyes?? Fantasy<br/><br/>5)Everytime a black person was on screen they were getting their head chopped off or dropped down a bottomless pit. Ancient Greeks had the utmost respect for Africans, and held them in high regard..if anything they looked upon the Aryans as savages.<br/><br/>I didn't leave the theatre feeling ""That was an Amazing movie"" or ""That movie was sooo boring""....I felt ""meh""....but when you put it into perspective of what this film is trying to do...glorify war, make a bunch of teens join the marines, and re-write history....I had to give it a low score.<br/><br/>2/10 for some okay action."

","Absolutely abysmal. Unless ALL you want from a film is comic book violence and gore, this film is entirely and completely without merit. Watch the History Channel program on the 300 if you want to gain ANY useful information about actual history. No mention of Themistocles is made, though he (an Athenian) proposed holding the Persians at Thermopylae. No mention of the naval battle that held the Persian navy at bay is made, though it prevented the flanking of the Greek forces until the Persians traversed the path through the mountains. <br/><br/>The film comes across as a Lord of the Rings wanna-be set in the midst of historical events. Unfortunately, almost everything historical (with the exception of names and places) was expunged from the script. Clothing is ridiculous (naked Spartan warriors?), animals are stupendously exaggerated (40 foot tall elephants?), the Persians are depicted as monstrous and Orcish... The film ignores the fact that the Persian army continued to take Athens and didn't leave Greece until after Salamis, another naval battle and part of another strategic flash of brilliance from Themistocles.<br/><br/>The story of the 300 is amazing history and deserved so, so much better than this. Visually, this film may appeal to hard core graphic novel fans. Anyone expecting an actual plot or any fidelity to history should look somewhere (almost anywhere) else."
"Leonard_Nimoy","2","5","10","13 October 2008"," Actually pretty awful
","I waited some time to see 300 but it really wasn't worth the wait. The basic plot is this: The Spartan's Glaswegian king kicks some Persians into a conveniently placed bottomless pit. The Spartans then go to the ""hot gates"" to have a fight against the advice of a semi-naked chick, Spartans then have another fight, then another, then another, then another, then another then the Spartans die. The end. Being a comic book conversion it's done with the usual over the top violence and screwed up ugly monsters, like ogres with moobs and kitchen utensils for hands etc. The dialogue is pretty awful/Americanized and the Spartans keep banging on about fighting for Greece even though it didn't exist at the time.<br/><br/>Gerard Butler is especially awful but maybe that's just because I'm Glaswegian as I kept expecting him to shout ""ho' you ya bam, am pure gonnae kick yer heid in"" and ""run, it's the polis"" THIS IS SPARTA!

"hannahp_1985","1","5","10","9 March 2008"," Like being shot in the knee, painful but can't stop thinking about it... (Part 1)
","I dislike this film so much my review is in two halves...<br/><br/>My first knowledge of 300 was actually seeing a tiny preview of it on a Saturday morning news show. The two clips of it that I saw made me think this was going to be one of the best viewing experiences of my life. I could hardly have been more wrong. Throughout most of 300, while I was watching it, I was reasonably enjoying myself, although I was never impressed. But even then, things that were bad about the film were occurring to me. It was only as I was leaving the cinema that I realised what a horrible experience I had just been put through. As time has gone by, this annoying movie that seems to have taken over my life has gotten worse and worse. <br/><br/>What's bad about the film: The film thoroughly overuses its slow motion technique, using it at virtually any opportunity. The scene that has claimed international knowledge, the 'this is Sparta' scene, is the third time in the film that the technique is used. The other two being for utterly pointless utilisations. The entire film is CGI except for the actors. On the whole this feels lazy more than anything else. One could describe the images shown as being breathtaking, but there's nothing that man can do, that God (and/or Ridley Scott) can't do better. Enormous computer-generated charging Persians are no replacement for real earth-shaking, war-crying Zulus (that's a reference to the everything-done-for-real epic 'Zulu'). The acting is very unenergetic, with the exception of Leonidas and Xerces, and their energy is rather misdirected. The battle sequences are little short of appalling. Their problem is that never for a minute do we believe that Leonidas and the Spartans are going to die. In the best epics, e.g. Lord of the Rings and Zulu, we believe there is no way that our heroes are going to survive, even though to kill them would be going against the laws of fiction. <br/><br/>One of the few things the film does well is to bring a fascinating mix of 'Warhammer'-style villains, e.g. fifty foot tall elephants, masked double-sword-wielding immortals, sun-blotting-out archers, and a strange naked giant with butcher's blades for arms. All this backfires spectacularly, in that none of these villains last more than five seconds up against the seemingly invincible Spartans. We don't even get to see the butcher's blade arms guy fight. The truth is, even though its current 8.0 rating on this site would say otherwise, this is really just very disappointing. Everyone prefers villains to heroes, e.g. Captain Hook over Peter Pan, Darth Vader over Luke Skywalker, the Joker over Batman. Invincible heroes are an utter bore. The Spartans only take one casualty in the film (excluding the fact that they all die at the end, but there are limits to how much Hollywood is allowed to change history; having them win would be like doing the version of Titanic, where the Titanic doesn't sink). When said Spartan dies, a good looking extra of no importance, the film plays it as the greatest shock in the history of the world. <br/><br/>After a short while, the film starts to develop a rhythm, a short battle with the Persians involving some super cool villain who is apparently extremely vincible (as opposed to invincible!) Cut to the boring sub-plot with Queen Gorgo, something to do with treachery. This sub-plot is neither historical or in Frank Miller's novel, a book which I have read since seeing this atrocity and now hold in the highest esteem. This sub-plot has the feeling of being added in, so that the film can actually be the length of a feature (the graphic novel is only 88 pages, and that's short even for a graphic novel). Then King Leonidas gives another rousing freedom speech (was the script written by Terry Goodkind or something??) and then another uninteresting battle commences. The 'amazing effects' produce a whole load of 'amazing images' (many of which are stolen from Frank Miller's novel, yes I mean stolen) which I found more distracting than interesting. Some film-makers know how to blend image and story, Zack obviously doesn't. <br/><br/>There's also a very boring narrator throughout the entire film, who refuses to shut up about how great the Spartans were, how evil the Persians were, and more times than I can count you have him saying 'and then next the Persians sent in...', 'and then next the Persians sent in...', 'and then next the Persians sent in...' etc. First prize for the world's most over-narrated movie.<br/><br/>Lastly, the film's climax drags on forever. History tells us that the Spartans kept on fighting until every one of them had been slain. At the end of the film, they just stand there and take it, 'it' being a wave of Persian arrows. This plays into the annoying idea that the Spartans are completely invincible, they'll only die on the battlefield if they want to. The film-makers play their death as being some kind of strange statement, probably about 'freeeeeeeeeeeeeeedom'. The real 300 must be spinning in their graves (although obviously being Greek, they wouldn't have had graves but would have been cremated). It is possibly the most disappointing climax in history.<br/><br/>To be continued..."

","Wow, I looked forward to this movie for months, expecting a sweeping epic, and instead received an over-edited, CGI filled, brainless gorefest of a mess.

Actually, absolutely beautiful. But that does not excuse this movie from having zero depth, zero plot, zero character, and zero dialog.

","I give it 10/10 not because of special effects or action or anything like that. It was really refreshing to see AT LAST a Hollywood movie in which OUR GUYS were not the EVIL ones while the other guys were not the only good, the enlightened, and the oppressed by us. It has become a tradition that everything related to our own Western Civilization is questioned and disavowed by the left-dominated world of politics and show-business. (I bet it wasn't the intention of the creators, but never mind.) What those critics fail to recognize is that IT IS ONLY THE QUALITY OF OUR CIVILIZATION TO QUESTION ITSELF. There were too many fanatically critic movies already, example being the very bad Kingdom of Heaven in which all Muslims are - of course! - so civilized - everyone to a man! The Christians - on the contrary (again: of course). As for the Thermopile battle: we owe everything to those brave men (and to many others: philosophers, rulers, law-makers, ...). We would not have the science if not the Greek's concept of truth; nor the private property if not the Roman law; nor the human rights, the abolition of slavery, the emancipation of women if not the Chrisitan concept of human being and human dignity. Observe the other civilizations: neither developed all those achievements. We should start to appreciate what we are and stop being ashamed of everything."

"ingelith","Null","5","10","12 March 2007"," A must see!!!!!
","I just saw this film expecting it to have many historical inaccuracies like Alexander or Troy.However,I was pleasantly surprised that the story followed the true events very closely,with small exceptions like the spartan council that was shown as a bunch of monsters,Ephialtes that was shown to come from Sparta(he was actually local from the Thermopylae area) and all the monsters that the persian army was carrying .Still small details like those are not important compared to how greatly the true story of the Battle of Thermopylae(=Hot Gates) was given on the big screen.King Leonidas was put to flesh exceptionally by Gerard Butler,for whoever has seen the real statue of Leonidas at the town of Sparta you see that he looks exactly the same!Same clothes,same shield,same helmet,same spear.The battle itself looked exactly as one must have imagined it while reading about it in historical books.The phalanx and how it worked,the perfect fighting skills of the Spartans,the way they used the narrow passage.Amazing scenes with the Persian arrows covering the sun and the Spartans saying ""then we'll fight in the shadow"".700 Thespians (Arcadians) indeed went to help but they were amateurs as Leonidas mentions so they left before the final battle.The Spartans of course were extremely trained,they were training for battle their whole life. The special effects and the music of the film fitted extremely well to the scenes and I never had to think of it during,it just fitted.The colors were kind of extreme sometimes but perfectly served in order to show the intensity of the facts.I also loved that they used the original phrases that were mentioned from that time,like ""come and get them"",""come with your shield or on it"",""then we'll fight in the shadow"" and the inscription from the real grave of the 300 at Thermopylae. The ending was exactly like I hoped it to be,it showed exactly that Leonidas was not just a proud psycho who wanted to die for glory,but knew that the sacrifice of himself and the 300 would inspire the rest of Greece to come together and fight for their freedom against the invading Persians. It would also delay Xerxi's army,therefore giving enough time to the rest of Greece to prepare for the big battle of Plateai and the Ship-battle of Salamina where Xerxi's army was completely defeated. At last,I would like to mention that this film is talking only about what happened at that time.Of course everyone is free to compare it with modern events but in my opinion it's blasphemy to compare the glorious sacrifice of 300 ancient Greeks for their land and freedom to the War for oil,power and money that the Americans are making around the world.If any comparison could be made then the Persians of that time would be the Americans of today.The Greeks fought against a huge army that invaded their land,threatening their freedom.Therefore,only people that have been invaded by nowadays' biggest militaristic powers and have fought in their land to defend it against them can truly sympathize with it. Congratulations to Franck Miller and Zack Snyder for making an amazing movie without lying on the true facts.May more film-makers get inspired and show the world how real heroes put their lives above any personal ambition.How their sacrifice led to the freedom of Greece after which the Golden era of Perikles came and gave the term ""democracy"" to the world.<br/><br/>PS:to Iranian friends,you are right to complain that the film is overreacting with the monsters and the evil look of the persian army.However,at that time the invaders and therefore ""bad guys"" were the persians that had a huge army trying to bring free Greece under their rule.But that was at that time.The future movies to be made about our time will probably be showing the Americans and the other militaristic powers of today as monsters because now they are the ones invading other countries and trying to rule the world.So please don't take it personally,it's just a movie based on a historical event."

Knowing that it is based on a comic book I didn't expect much depth or subtleties in any aspect of the movie- and I was right. The attempts the movie made to convey any comprehensible emotion or feeling in the viewer were bland and predictable. The acting was forced, strained and generally devoid of emotion and the only upside to the movie would be the comic book like visuals which appeal to some, but not me. Halfway through the film my cell phone went off and normally I would be embarrassed to interrupt a movie but I didn't care and neither did the shallow, neck bearded, violence gorging graphic novel enthusiasts as what was I interrupting? The plot? The stumbling dialogue? An arm, a head or a leg being cut off? Oh, excuse me, sir! If you're looking to see a mindless piece of entertainment with plenty of violence, sex and macho bearded dudes in thongs marauding around bellowing corny war cries then I recommend 300- but for the rest of the movie viewers who find films to be more than bland comic book interpretations of history, more than the lifeless acting and over-dramatic predictability depicted in 300- steer clear."

","If Braveheart were stripped of its meat, spray-painted gold and served as the poorest of value meals at McDonalds, there's a good chance you'd end up with something resembling 300 -- Zack Snyder's long-awaited adaptation of Frank Miller's graphic novel. Imagine if the front page of (insert the name of a popular muscle magazine) suddenly sprung to life -- in all of its fake tan glory -- and brought with it one of the most overly hyped films in history. You know its bad when the audience laughs at your main villain and, when they boo as the end credits begin to roll, all there's left to do is whisper -- not scream -- ""This is Sparta?"" Like Robert Rodriguez's Sin City, 300 was filmed entirely in front of a green screen. Thus, it looks pretty but feels fake, making it so the entire film rests on the shoulders of its script and cast... http://www.cinematical.com/2007/02/14/berlinale-review-300/"

","After all the excitements and blood thirst implanted in my unconscious by the spectecular trailers, after waiting this movielike a hungry wolf for 3 months, after all that macho egoism I agitated in myself, my expectations rumbled down like that pile of dead in the movie. Admirer of Sparta as I am, born and raised in soils that inspired the stories of Heredot, I was filled with joy when I saw the woman standing in the wheat fields like the symbol of mother nature. My mouth was wide open when I saw the scene of phalanx pushing the others off the cliff against the bronze-like sunlight, like seeing those soldiers on ancient pottery coming into life. But no! That was in the trailer! After I watched the movie, these great feeling subsided. The movie added nothing if not a hair to its trailer. As rythmic and striking the trailer was, boring and out of phase was the movie. I also found out that 70% of the dialogs were already used in the trailer. I did enjoy the story of Spartan boys in the beginning, although the scene with wolf was a little too long, and there could have been several more kids to depict the story. Anyway, the beginning was OK, but after that, the story got more and more incoherent and out of rhythm. There were totally unnecessary scenes like the sex scene of the king and the queen. Later the scene where Leonidas climbed to the oracle was a disaster. The gods sucked. They looked more pathetic than the humpback in the later scenes. There was that absurd scene of the fat Persian guy in the temple. After that when the king he assembled his men infront of the town, I didn't hear any encouraging speeches from the king. Why didn't he tell something like: let's win this war with blood.. at least? The only impressive sentence i heard was the joke he made to the Athenians. Other than that, there wasn't a figure like Spartakus infront of us. The war scenes were OK, but nothing revolutionary or something. It reminded me of Lord of the Rings, although I would have preferred the more realistic Troy style. Overall it was an OK movie, but it didn't agitate me, it didn't make me want to grab a sword and thrash the cars in the parking lot. It didn't inspire heroism in me as in the great Ying Xiong (The Hero). It was nothing comparable to that. Indeed the movie contained obvious racism (cmon now someone has to say it) and stupid remarks like 'defending the age of freedom'. What was that?? Sparta ain't defending nothing other than its own values, which have no relation with the new age (whatever that is). Hey, I love Sparta, I am a macho, and have a moustache, but get real, Sparta is the fantastic city-state of the distant past. It has nothing to do with today, especially democracy, if you are mentioning that. By making Leonidas tell that, they just made Spartans a bunch of sheep rather than wolves, or lions. Anyway, the movie had some good stuff. It was in a different world, closer to computer games', and had some nice battle scenes. I give 10 to the trailer, 6 to the movie."

","Today 300 premiered worldwide in Greece (even though some Greek theaters arranged some screenings on 7th of March near midnight). What can anyone really say after seeing this spectacular movie? It's all about your entertainment really!!! Don't expect to see a documentary or all the historical facts. It's purely for what it meant to be. A Hollywood movie based on Frank Millers' comic, which itself was based on the story of Leonidas and his 300 men that fought against Xerxis and his vast army(to say things in plain English). I'm not going to bore you with details and so, just to say that the movie is a milestone for the film industry considering the whole package, acting(Butler is absolutely mad(!), really into his role, photography is breathtaking making you to hit the button (if there was any) and to make any shot your favorite wallpaper and finally directing is beyond any fantasy. Some may try to compare it with Sin City and the Lord of The Rings. Well, as years go by the sure thing is that films that depend on technology will outdo the older ones. This is the case and for that, the comparison would be unfair and subjective. Don't get mad or disappointed. Maybe Sin City 3 will outdo 300 as well(well Sin City 2 may find things difficult, don't really know, just a thought). To summarize, one of the best movies I have ever seen, even though I can't get out of my mind the fact that there was only one external shot, a real test for your eyes and your mind!!! If I would see it again?Definitely!!! By the way I expect a serious DVD packaging and of course an Extended Version!!!Yes we wants it!!!"

Really. The historic inconsistency is terrible, the story is silly, the action is hysteric. I know the basis of this all is a comic book. But I would expect at least some reality. Frankly it reminds me of the old German propaganda movies like Hilterjungen Quex and Triumph des Willens. Die Stukas is also a nice one.

","I've seen this movie and I've found it awful. Let us decide, what makes a good movie out: <br/><br/>1) The Plot¬Ö [1/10] There is no plot in that movie. Yeah, that's right, there is no plot at all. Spartans are going to the battle, that's all. I don't want to list any holes in the story, as holes completely swallow the story. It is the story of Palpatine (Seer) and the hole-to-falling'-in of Starwars, Orcs and Gollum of LotR, 300 plain equal action figures of any comic book you've seen before and several other clich√©s. <br/><br/>2) Acting¬Ö [3/10] Well, there is no attractive character in this movie and all they can do is to briefly speak their role and acting cool in slow motion.

","This film significantly fails any test of aesthetic merit. Compare with the Battle of Rork's Drift as brilliantly executed in ""Zulu"".<br/><br/>Characteristation? A collection of cardboard cut-outs masquerading as actors where the one-dimensional heroes combat flat antagonists. On occasion there is a hint of potential inner conflict and character development.<br/><br/>Narrative development? There's a big fight: That's it. Which is a crying shame because the real battle of Thermopylae and the events that led up to it was actually *interesting* - indeed one of the most important moments in history.<br/><br/>Those who condemn this film the lack of historical accuracy in this film have an aesthetic point (as well as an objective one) because the *real* story is more interesting than the fictional one. Film did include the limitations imposed by the Carneian festival; well-cited and a good plot device.<br/><br/>Anarchronisms? The film is full of them. From the cross between an effete giant Darth Vader who's supposed to represent a short, bearded Persian King, Xerxes, to the ridiculous claim that the Spartans were fighting for freedom (they had several slaves per citizen).<br/><br/>Theme? Firstly, if you're going to make a film based on a real event, real people and real nations you have a moral obligation to be, well, realistic. Sure it can be an enhanced reality (cf., Mary Renault's fictional books on Ancient Greek society) but don't contradict reality.<br/><br/>The historical theme of Thermopylae is important; the advantages of training, terrain and courage against overwhelming odds. That is a good theme; it is worthy of exploration.<br/><br/>The theme provided by this film is the few and noble free West versus the many nations (from sub-Saharan Africa to the land of the Samurai) seeking to enslave them. We note of course that the the overwhelming majority of Greeks who fought at Thermopylae were on Xerxes side.<br/><br/>Style? Lots of CGI, technically proficient but much of it over-the-top and even inappropriately executed.<br/><br/>I'm a big fan of ""authentic"" violence in film and usually condemn the lack of graphic portrayal in others. In this case I condemn the graphic portrayal because it isn't authentic - it looked like a cheap video game.<br/><br/>The voice-over by Dilios were a necessary feature, partially for historicity and partially because the scenes were themselves incapable of portraying descriptive emotion. The buff semi-naked Spartans with thrusting spears was OK, and especially if that's your kink.<br/><br/>Tha acting was melodramatic ham with the a range of one-liners (some OK, mostly bad) and the mise en sc√®ne in most shots was thoroughly unconvincing with one excellent exception; the view of the Persian camp is actually close to the actual view from the wall).<br/><br/>Popular Appeal? I note that 49% of reviewers on IMDb - fully 40000 at last count - voted this film 10/10. Under these circumstances I usually despair for the future of culture; however the lasting influence of this product will be slight. As for the memory of the Spartans - this is one the greatest unintentional insults that could be cast at them."
"gradyharp","4","6","13","31 March 2007"," HaRoo, HaRoo, HaRoo: Cinematic Overkill
","Writing a review of a film such as '300' when not a fan of comic book style, superheroes, violent games carried on by children's hand held instruments, a film so overwhelmingly popular with the public that it promises to be the largest grossing film in history, and a film based on a 1999 'graphic novel' (read comic book) by the talented writer-artist Frank Miller and colorist Lynn Varley in an updated version of the famous battle of Thermopylae in 480 BC, places a viewer in a vulnerable position. Yet every film made deserves the attention of a well-rounded examination and with that in mind this viewer offers the following thoughts.<br/><br/>Zack Snyder directed this screenplay, sharing the writing credits with Kurt Johnstad and Michael Gordon about Spartan King Leonidas (Gerard Butler) and his group of 300 trained from birth soldiers to know no fear and to die as heroes who together fight the huge forces of King Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro) while leaving behind Queen Gorgo (Lena Headley) and the venomous Theron (Dominic West) to end to matters at hand in Sparta. A keen plan to meet the Persians (Persia of yore is now called Iran!) at a narrow gulch at Thermopylae supported the courage of the mighty buff Spartans to have a logistical advantage. But of course Xerxes' legions of rhinos, elephants and warriors ultimately kill all the Spartans: it is a story of heroism in the face of extraordinary odds.<br/><br/>With the exception of a few moments at the beginning and a few well placed breathers through the long two-hour film the subject matter is fighting, blood, decapitation hither and yon, and piles of corpses used as barriers as the huge animals of Xerxes tumble off the cliffs. Blood spatters the air and the actors and the story, giving credence to the illustration used to promote the film. The problems, other than the 'overkill' of endless battle to the tune of soldiers shooting repeated 'HaRoos', for this viewer lie with the script which mixes contemporary slang with pompous Grecian proclamation - stretching the credibility of the story beyond the limit of tolerance; the excessive noise of battle in competition with a 'musical score' that keeps the volume to maximum level; the fact that the acting is minimal at best, though this may be part of the 'comic book' concept; and the apparent emphasis on having every Spartan look like the same beefcake mold form from an art department.<br/><br/>There are a few moments of tenderness as when the Captain (Vincent Regan) watches his son's decapitated head float to the ground in slow motion and he for the first time offers human anguish. But for the most part this is a blood red movie that relies on audience appreciation for gore. Yes, it is a successful cinematic transition of a comic book, but the real story of history being told is so much more moving. Yet the lines at the movie theaters remain long after 4 weeks of release... Grady Harp"
"commandercool88","6","6","13","30 March 2007"," Visual Spectacle
","'300' uses amazing visual effects to make you think it's a meaningful and poignant film. But rather, its heavy stylized action covers up its lack of emotional resonance. It is what it is, a visual spectacle. It won't change the way films are made, and it's not the best film of the last decade. What could have been a modern epic is hurt by poor direction and choppy editing. Staged and intentionally over-the-top, '300' is captivating yet underwhelming.<br/><br/>When the Persian Empire threatens the Greek state of Sparta, King Leonidas defies law and order when he leads 300 of his bravest men against the mammoth Persian army of one million. Though in the face of unwinnable odds, Leonidas and his men stand strong in the face of death, refusing to admit defeat and give up hope. They fight with dignity and die with honor, while Leonidas' own decision to lead his kingdom to war divides his homeland. And through the actions of these few fearless soldiers, an entire kingdom will be inspired to rise up and fight for what they believe is right.<br/><br/>If '300' succeeds at one thing, it will surely hypnotize you with its stunning landscapes and visual effects. Filmed entirely on green screens, it allowed filmmakers to create a unique and magical world with oracles, hunchbacks, ravenous wolves, unworldly creatures, and breathtaking cinematography. No doubt, it's the film's true stroke of genius. Yet above all else, what '300' promised us above all else were unforgettable and mesmerizing battle scenes. And despite all the visualization the film provides audiences with, the war sequences fall short. While there's enough blood and detached limbs to satisfy most, the over-stylized, slow-motion capture is problematic. It prevents you from seeing much in the way of fighting at all, when a short clip is stretched out for what seems to be an eternity. Entertaining to watch? Yes. But when 'Return of the King' and its mind blowing battles keep coming to mind, we all know who wins that match-up.<br/><br/>'300' strives for epic status, but with a script and direction that's riddled with problems, you can see how '300' falls short of greatness. With a script that's better at giving us prepared one-liners than a story with depth, director Zack Snyder (2004's 'Dawn of the Dead') struggles when he attempts to make '300' a film with relevant political undertones. In between battle sequences, which are numbered to begin with, the dialogue and dramatic elements drag. And so we're left with a very choppy film. Gerard Butler does a fine job in the role of King Leonidas, whose body alone looks like a god. Rodrigo Santoro, who plays Xerxes, the self-proclaimed god and leader of the Persian empire, gives an interesting yet impressive performance. Though for the most part, the majority of the cast consists of B-level actors. The slim script and story doesn't require much from their part, and they seemingly take a backseat to the film's eye sex.<br/><br/>While '300' is no masterpiece, it's a film worth experiencing in theaters if only for its visual assault. A TV screen just won't do it justice. It's a classic example of style over substance, and in this case, style is all '300' has going for it. But it's just enough, even when the film lacks in almost every other department. '300' succeeds mostly at what it sets out to do, and will probably cause many to tap into their inner alpha male. Your eyes are certainly in for a treat, just be sure to check your brain at the door."
"evanston_dad","6","6","13","27 March 2007"," Gird Your Loins, Men!
","It's amazing to me that ""300"" is being taken seriously enough to stir up so much controversy. Some say it's homoerotic, others that it's homophobic. Some say it's an indictment of the Bush Administration's attitudes about war, others that it's a right-wing, pro-war diatribe. Iranians are apparently offended by the portrayal of Persians in the film. There are at least three reasons that all of these people need to chill out about this movie: 1.) It's based on a graphic novel, and when was the last time we expected subtlety, realism or political correctness from a graphic novel? 2.) Since it's a virtual recreation of a previously existing graphic novel, the blame for its offensiveness should rest on Frank Miller, not the film. 3.) The movie isn't nearly intelligent enough or important enough to be offended by.<br/><br/>""300"" is one long, witless, sustained shout of a movie. Sadly, the filmmakers take their purpose very seriously, so this has none of the knowing humour or kitsch value of ""Sin City,"" the 2005 masterpiece that also recreated a Frank Miller world on the big screen. The creators of ""300"" seem to think they have an important story to tell, and they tell it with deadly earnestness. Therefore, every single line of dialogue, every gesture, every sound effect, is pitched at the same over-emphatic level, with the results being a poundingly monotonous movie.<br/><br/>After all the talk of the striking visual style, ""300"" ended up not being stylized enough for my taste. ""Sin City"" truly created a whole other world on screen; realism was not only ignored -- it was completely shunned. In ""300,"" the artists try to create a realistic universe for their characters to move and fight in, so what we basically get in the end is an imitation of films like ""Gladiator"" and ""Troy,"" with even less brains.<br/><br/>Not surprisingly, the movie is at its best when it's fighting. There are a couple of dazzling sequences, like the one in which our feisty band of Spartans sends a horde of Persians hurtling over a cliff; or a montage that shows an extended series of battles including charging rhinos and elephants. But any time it slows down for plot exposition or scenes of dialogue, you might as well hit snooze, because you're not going to miss anything important. None of the actors really makes much impression, though they probably deserve credit for even doing as well as they do, considering they had nothing but blue screens to interact with. Gerard Butler is o.k. as King Leonidas, but his mush-mouthed line delivery was a constant distraction. Rodrigo Santoro gets stuck with a humiliating role as Xerxes, king of the Persians. The costume designer bedecks him in jewels and piercings, and the sound team give him an electronically fake voice that sounds ridiculous coming from such a fruit loop of a character. But no matter. The only thing you really notice about any of the actors are their sculpted abs and pecs, which are on constant and prominent display. Indeed, by the end of the film, I was identifying the characters by their torsos rather than by any distinguishing personality traits, since there aren't any.<br/><br/>I was in the mood for a film like ""300"" and wanted desperately to like it, but it wore me down. Now I know how those Persians must have felt.<br/><br/>Grade: B-"

Are you really trying to say, that in real life, the Persian army was comprised of men and not demons? The Persians didn't really have a goat smoking a hookah in their tent? And come on, the Spartans didn't really consult a floating naked chick before going to war? Xerxes wasn't really a Goa'uld? I find that hard to believe....

"ian_wil40","10","6","13","17 March 2007"," Visually Impressive, but nationalistic?
","I loved this movie 300, i found it visually impressive. At first i was confused to why the Persians and Spartans looked so exaggerated, i then realized that it was for artistic interpretation of characters, many need to remember that this is based off of a graphic novel so to give it an effect all the characters look comic bookish (example sin city) once I came to this conclusion i was very satisfied. I don't think the Persians were portrayed in the right light though i some what doubt that the Persians would brutalize women and children. In fact ancient Persia was the most tolerant and peaceful of all the empires at one time, a very civilized people. But what people forget is that that in this movie The Persians came to conquer Sparta and Greece, and the Spartans had always been militaristic and tough. Once again the Persians came to conquer, so naturally they defend their lands like any people even today would do despite the best intentions of the opponent. So really i feel this movie suffered only minor inaccuracies and even they were few. And another thing, the reason why the Persians may look so tall is because the Greeks were not very tall, and this film is coming from a Greek soldiers point of view, hence all the monstrous looks to some characters, to an ancient Greek I'm sure a six foot man would obviously appear to be a giant (Artisitic Interpretion).<br/><br/>My problem with this film is that the Spartans sound just like those over patriotic television commercials we see here in America ""freedom isn't free"" was the impression i got this film and i felt very disturbed of the possible intentions of this film, maybe it was just a coincidence."

","This movie is gorgeous to behold! There is bloodshed, but that is unavoidable in a tale that pits 300 Spartans protecting their right to live as free men against a massive army of invading Persians.<br/><br/>The bloodletting is not so much extreme as it is relevant and poetic and stylized. Zach Snyder has portrayed this battle - which includes skewered limbs and decapitations - with an artistic grace that removes the 'cringe' factor. The spattering blood is not overdone. It is relevant and understandable. It is elemental.<br/><br/>I am a woman and I drank this movie in. 300 strips away all the nonsense that we are sometimes subjected to in story telling and gets to the basics. There is no foolish fluff in this movie. It is raw! Every word, move, action, look and sound is relevant. The soundtrack blends flawlessly. There is nothing to distract you from the pure beauty of the visuals and the unprocessed emotion portrayed. 300 is about strength and honor and courage and even love. I know¬Öthe twenty something males do not want to hear that but it is true. 'My queen, my wife, my love¬Ö' Remember the line.<br/><br/>It's as though in preparing their bodies¬Östripping down to raw muscle¬Öthe actors stripped down to raw emotion. Every character is an unfettered archetype. King Leonidas (Gerard Butler) is all a king should be. Power, authority, responsibility, and honor pulse around him and are reflected in his blazing eyes in a way I have never seen before. I did not see Gerard Butler on the screen. I saw King Leonidas and Gerard's portrayal of him was complete and flawless and ferocious. It was compelling enough that I wanted to follow him into battle. Stelios (Michael Fassbender) is the epitome of a strong young man, full of confidence and eager to do his kings will as honorably as he can. Michael was riveting on the big screen. The Captain (Vincent Regan) exhibited such raw emotion as to make the hairs on the back of my neck stand on end. Theron (Dominic West) made my skin crawl with his seedy smile and dishonorable intentions.<br/><br/>The fighting sequences are astounding. I don't recall drawing a breath during the sequence that involved Stelios and Astinos (Tom Wisdom). It was amazing and the cycle involving King Leonidas surging through a throng of Persians was magnificent in its choreography and flow. It was flawless¬Öthe perfect ballet.<br/><br/>In 300, Zach Snyder has presented a movie devoid of extraneous and distracting garbage. There is a purity in the visuals, a purity to the soundtrack and a purity to the acting and dialogue that absorbs you, sucks you in and leaves you feeling the two hours where but a moment. To say this movie is cinematic falls flat. Visually, 300 is stunning - a moving piece of art. My biggest disappointment¬Öit ended. This is the first movie in all my 36 years that I will go to the theaters to see again.<br/><br/>As far as a message in this movie¬ÖI have to agree with Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro)¬ÖThe message is 'Go Buy A Ticket!' and loose yourself for a short time in a beautiful, evocative, refreshingly raw movie!"

Because it really deserves it. I doubt I will see a better film in theaters all year. I haven't been so amazed by a movie in the theaters since United 93 and I haven't had so much in the theater sine Borat or maybe even King Kong. This is an experience.<br/><br/>Hmm... the plot well there isn't much but Snyder does as much as he can with it. The movie is basically about 300 Spartans ( Led by Leonidas.) who take on a million or so Persians in order to maintain their land. There is also another story taking place back in Sparta where King Leonidas's wife is fighting a war of her own. This war does not have swords or blood though. She is fighting a war of words against the senate in order to send more warriors to help the 300. In both stories betrayal is a theme. And that's all I can really tell you with out giving some surpirsing moments away.<br/><br/>This is a super violent, super sexy movie which is highly enjoyable ( the whole theater was applauding.) but well made as well.

This is immediately up on the list with Gladiator and Braveheart for the ultimate manly movies of all time. I can honestly say that I have never seen any fight scenes like the ones in this movie. I think the cinematography from this film could forever change the way movies are filmed and edited. The only thing that could possibly be considered anywhere near bad about the movie is that this was based on the graphic novel and not what really happened. So you will have the people accepting this as truth and that is dumb, but in reality, they are dumb for accepting a movie as truth. The characters are all portrayed in a way that makes them seem larger than life (not just in physical size). Do yourself a favor and go watch the movie...especially if you are a man."

","Anyone who'd go see this film about 300 Spartans who hold off the endlessly vast Persian army expecting a history lesson of any sort would be well off picking up a book sometime. No, the order of the day is heavily stylized violence and a good Frank Miller adaption. Well-acted given the superficial tone of the film. Having the feel of the epic ""Braveheart"" (but not excelling to the greatness of that modern day classic), I did enjoy the film for what it was. Of course they will be some tools who use the film to promote a given agenda, be it liberal or conservative. (but such is the case with any film touching on the subject of war of any kind). Try to ignore those conversations as both sides are looking too deeply in a movie this shallow. Perhaps the film would have been better if they played it a little more straight and nixed the elements that bring the film into the fantasy realm, however Gerarld Butler pretty much nailed the role of King Leonidas (grossly glaring inaccuracies aside) and Director Zack Snyder, who's already accomplished the impossible by making a horror remake that was not only watchable, but able to stand on it's own merits, has another winning film to add to his short but not insubstantial resume.<br/><br/>My Grade: B+"
"knoxvillian","5","6","13","12 March 2007"," Not nearly what it ought to be.
","I had high hopes for the film 300. I really did. The previews showed scenes of cool, stylized violence with the twinge of a historical epic. The writer, Frank Miller, was fresh off his success with Sin City, showing what stylized violence and innovative visuals could do against a film noir story and background. Letting him go after a big budget epic with Gladiator overtones seemed like a sure thing, or at least a fun diversion for a warm Sunday night.<br/><br/>I was wrong. 300 turned out to be a deeply flawed film, and Miller is at least partly (perhaps mostly) to blame for it. On Miller's end, we are presented with a story of heroism and honor and freedom encapsulated in the struggle between 300 warriors from Sparta and the advancing hordes of the Persian army led by ""god-king"" Xerxes, bent on capturing and enslaving Sparta. It is based on the actual battle of Thermopylae between Sparta and Persia, but the film departs from the historical record in many notable ways. I personally won't begrudge Miller and director Zack Snyder for wanting to play fast and loose with history in the name of a more compelling film.<br/><br/>This is a good premise, but the film never really moves out of the premise. Lost in its own sense of portraying what a hero really is, the movie forgets to tell a compelling story or employ any strong narrative. Instead, it almost feels like a series of vignettes wherein the Spartans clash against one Persian attack or another, with brief flashes of the struggle at home between a corrupt senate and the noble queen. There is a slight sense of progression towards the end, but as a whole the narrative feels like it replays itself and thus, when the ending comes, the plot feels tired. Not unlike a Clint Eastwood film, 300 clings to a moral and proceeds to hammer that moral into its viewers with the subtlety of a crowbar.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Miller also seems to have run dry in dialog and character development as well. What succeeded in Sin City is almost entirely absent in 300. Instead of ethically complicated characters making tough moral and utilitarian decisions, as was the case in Sin City, 300 tells you exactly what the characters are going to do and seems to imply that they only have one route to take. There is no ambiguity to their decisions, and so the warriors of Sparta come off as much more bland and uninspired than Dwight and Marv and Hartigan. The dialog and long-winded monologues don't help things either. Instead of a hip, insightful and fun narration, 300 gives us trite speeches about ""freedom not being free,"" loud but empty chants of ""Sparta!!,"" and contrived meetings where characters who are in all ways good spout clich√©s at characters who are in all ways bad.<br/><br/>Even with a weak story and characters, at least the film is fun to watch, right? Actually, it is on the whole something compelling to look at. Director Snyder, best known for a remake of Dawn of the Dead, does give the film a very distinct visual feel, opting to create Sparta and it's surroundings entirely from scratch instead of relying on location shots and the like. Although not as stylistically heavy-handed as Sin City, the film does have a vaguely artistic feel with washed-out colors in the background (for the most part, beautiful or compelling landscapes) contrasting with the red of Spartan cloaks and the gold of Spartan shields. Some of the battle sequences are fun to watch as well, but after a while I began to wonder if Snyder was just overly fond of slow-motion sequences or had no other directorial tricks to use (thus, some of the battles seemed like they were shot by a very amateur director). Unfortunately, style is not enough to carry the film through to the end.<br/><br/>300 is a film that should have been a great film. It aspires to be, and does it's damnedest conjure up epic films. But it is ultimately an empty film, pretty to look at but lacking any real core or resonance."

","Sometimes I wonder what critics are looking for when they watch a movie, most people could care less about cinematography or color highlights. People nowadays want a good story or good plot they can follow and most of all they want something they can feel is real and gives them an energy about life. This story of defying the odds against treachery and narcissism was very appealing, very empowering and very uplifting. We live in a world that worries so much about violence, but violence in this film is necessary to the degree that these men held back nothing to save the lands and families. I read the history of the battle and was even more intrigued how the twists and turns of the characters were made to give it that extra humph. Please don't rely on the critics for this one. Go see it you will not be disappointed. Its not just a so called ""Man's' film, its a film for anyone who believes they can overcome any situation when the odds are so stacked against them."

","This was a phenomenal movie from beginning to end. I truly loved everything about it, the graphics, the backdrop, the clothing, the actors and actresses, of course. I am a big movie fanatic, book reader and writer. I have written and published a few books and also one screenplay so far and working on the second one. The experience I felt watching ""300"" is what I want reviewers to feel as they are watching my movies. God gives each of us gifts and everyone who shared in this experience of 300, I must say, is talented. This creation was carefully orchestrated, from the Kings childhood to his death. I was moved to the fullest. I cried, laughed, I felt sorrow and pain but I was also overwhelmed with the courage displayed by the King, Queen and soldiers who fought to their death. This had a very spiritual impact on me. I don't know if that was in the plan of the director but God's plans are never altered. When people see this film, they will leave knowing the power of God and how He equips one not only on the battlefield, but in life period. Kings will be put into difficult situations but they must stand, and fight for something, lest they will fall. That goes for Queens as well. They have to be strong and stand firm on what they believe. We are virtuous beings and God created us equally but we must stand and let Him be ruler over our destiny or else, the enemy will defeat us and our purpose here. ""300"" was one of the best movies of the year for me, thus far and I plan for my first movie ""3 Men I Chose to Love"" to impact society in such a way as this, that one will truly know the power of God once they've watched the blessings unfold through our work.<br/><br/>www.alycecthompsonbooksinc.com www.myspace.com/alycecthompson"
"Robert-132","5","6","13","11 March 2007"," Some great scenes, but not great overall
","Forget the historical inaccuracies, forget the strange costuming, forget the fact that this feels like ancient Greek history on acid - is this a great movie? Unfortunately, despite its potential, it isn't. There are some truly great visual scenes, such as a sky so full of arrows that the sun is blocked out. There are some wonderful character moments, like the Spartan king debating whether to fight. But these are moments - and a movie needs more than just moments.<br/><br/>The film suffers in part due to the very computer technology that makes the stunning visuals possible. With no proper sets, there is a lack of continuity that sets would provide. For example, the bottomless pit from the trailer comes out of absolutely nowhere. It isn't there before the emissary is tossed in, and it isn't there afterwords. It is a computer effect, and comes out only when it is needed (there is a tree later on that does the same thing).<br/><br/>This is a film about images - and to a degree, it suffers because of that as well, as many of the images don't make sense in the larger picture, and often come across as overblown and comical. For example, while a single war rhino charging in slow motion towards the Spartan ranks, killing Persian soldiers as it moves, is an impressive and striking image, it doesn't make a lot of sense - surely the Persians would want to use more than one, and to have it die before killing so much as a single Spartan renders the scene anti-climactic. These beautiful and striking images bombard the viewer, but they are missing a cohesion that would elevate the entire film to fine art.<br/><br/>Ultimately, 300 is a beautiful example of both the strengths and limits of computer technology, and the art in motion it can create. It is a brilliant and beautiful technology demo. It's just a pity that it isn't a better movie."

Good God, I mean, what was the need for being so totally incorrect. The Spartans who were actually the ""boy lovers"", use the phrase loosely for the Greeks.

"classicsoncall","8","8","19","21 March 2007"," ""Spartans, prepare for glory!""
","When writer Frank Miller was a mere five years old, his older brother took him to an opening day screening of ""The 300 Spartans"". That event remained permanently etched in his mind, and allowed Miller the luxury of years of research into the customs, traditions, training, weaponry and military strategy of the ancient Greeks. In 1998, his graphic novel was released as a series of books from Dark Horse Comics, with Lynn Varley supplying the painted visuals in a stunning work that garnered numerous awards, both for the material itself and the artists involved.<br/><br/>It was with some trepidation that I went to see the movie, as the few TV commercial ads I saw made it look like an advanced video game. By then though, the positive reviews had been piling up, from professional and amateur critics alike. Not to worry, though the degree of CGI involved in the filming is extraordinary, the actors themselves are very real. They had each other to work with, along with the singular artistic vision of director Zack Snyder, who kept copies of the '300' comic series on the set and referred to them daily to maintain the integrity of Miller's original work. In that regard, one might characterize the current film as a movie about a book about a movie, based on a real historical event. Of course liberties are taken in the telling of the story, but for veracity, you have history books. This piece is offered as entertainment, an often times brutal ballet of flashing swords and grisly hand to hand combat. The action scenes are further enhanced by a technique of speeding up and slowing down that helps concentrate the viewers attention. Be prepared for blood, but not in the spraying and pooling style of slasher flicks, here it's chunky and messy, crimson and muddy as befits the somber locale of Thermopylae, the ancient 'hot gates'.<br/><br/>To be balanced, a drawback of the movie might be the often clich√©d dialog, spoken by Spartan friend and foe alike. However I found the appearance of Persian King Xerxes to be a cinematic and artistic achievement, an androgynous marvel who commands his screen time like no other villain I can think of.<br/><br/>This movie won't be everyone's idea of a good time, however action/adventure fans as well as followers of Frank Miller's work will be well pleased. It should certainly be seen on the big screen to take advantage of it's unique filming style, and to get a good glimpse of the next generation of movie making."
"DonFishies","9","8","19","9 March 2007"," The anti-epic for the hard rock generation
","From the moment I heard that 300 was based on a Frank Miller graphic novel, I was hooked. I absolutely adored every minute of Frank Miller's Sin City, and liked it even more after I read all 7 graphic novels. So despite not reading the 300 graphic novel, I was still very hooked on the idea, and heavily anticipated the movie. And I was not all that disappointed with the final result.<br/><br/>300 is a heavily stylized version of the Battle of Thermopylae in 480 B.C. To stop the advancing Persian army hellbent on ruling the Greek nation of Sparta, King Leonidas (Gerard Butler) brings 299 of his best men to fight against them. Despite having no real permission from Sparta's elders, Leonidas goes into battle anyway, as his wife, Queen Gorgo (Lena Headey), attempts to bargain and get more men to fight alongside him.<br/><br/>Despite being epic in its scale, 300 feels like anything but. Everything is so stylized and completely otherworldly that anyone hoping to come and get a history lesson or something in vein of Troy or Alexander is sadly looking in the wrong place. It is more of an anti-epic, and is significantly shorter than any film like those mentioned.<br/><br/>All of the scenes are played out in obvious CGI, allowing the scenery to take on a whole life of its own. Much like Sin City before it, everything looks real enough, but clearly looks to be computer animated. It brings a certain element of the graphic novel to life, and allows it to feel more original and not so comparative to those other ancient Greek-style epics. The colours used in the scenes, the backgrounds and on the characters themselves also look very graphic novel-esquire, and all add to how stylish and unique the film looks, particularly scenes that take place at night-time or just after a huge battle.<br/><br/>Speaking of battles, all of them are well choreographed and brought to life on screen. Slow motion sequences are frequently put to work here, and they only help to add to how amazingly choreographed and orchestrated the battle scenes are. Just watching these men fight so valiantly is an experience on its own. It is almost like it is a form of dance, coming to life right before our eyes. A dance of course, that is saturated in blood. It flows heavily and fluently throughout the picture, from the days of Leonidas youthful training, and well into every battle. It becomes so red when it flows in certain scenes that it almost turns black as it flies in the wind. Despite it being gratuitous in many areas, it was nowhere near as bad as I thought it would be. This may be as a result of it being all CGI-created (which makes for more blood flying through the air than landing on the ground), but it may just be that my appetite for graphic violence is more than should be expected.<br/><br/>Without ruining anything, some of the creatures and monsters that show up during some of these battles are also very cool looking in their uniqueness. They show mere glimpses of them in the trailers, but when they show up on screen, they feel like they are almost completely different in the way they look and act.<br/><br/>Another interesting aspect of the film is the use of music. In some scenes, the music pounds in epic opera tones, really stretching for how the film looks as opposed to how it plays out. It works very well, and allows it to feel more at home with the more contemporary epics. But unlike those epics, it blends right into the hard rock that plays throughout the majority of the battle scenes. It pounds and smashes almost at the same speed and veracity as these Spartans and Persians are battling. It is definitely something I was expecting from the trailers, but not something I expected to work so well during these scenes of hyper violence.<br/><br/>Butler does a great job carrying the film. He has an obvious presence from the moment he enters the film, and he just hands on with a great amount of strength throughout. Listening to him blare out Miller's poetic writing only continues to perpetuate how different the film is from other historical epics. David Wenham, Vincent Regan and the rest of the actors playing Spartan soldiers hold up to him greatly, and really do a good job at it (bringing in a lot of humour along with Butler throughout the film). Headey surprised me in how much intensity she brings to her role. She is strong-willed from the start and acts like she is almost a soldier herself. Dominic West and Rodrigo Santoro are okay in their roles, but they do not get nearly enough time to really sink their teeth into their roles.<br/><br/>If there is anything wrong with the film, it is in just how much style is brought into the film. It looks great when it starts, but watching almost every scene in slow motion becomes a little dull after awhile. Thankfully, many of these scenes are all different in how they are conveyed, but it still does not make up for just how much slow motion is used. I also think that it was slow in certain areas, but really quick in others. It felt like it could have been trimmed down a bit more than it already was, and could have been a whole lot faster paced as a result. It also lacks the spark that made Sin City such a beautiful film, but is more than a worthy successor.<br/><br/>While it has a few issues, 300 is the first great film of 2007 and no doubt, will have an impact on its viewers. It is a bloody good time, and has just enough uniqueness to set it apart from other epic-style films.<br/><br/>9/10."

","I'm a big fan of the Peplum genre, i.e. Italian Sword & Sandal films of the late 1950s and 1960s. The genre is criminally underrated and many of those films are colorful, action packed and fun. So naturally watching ""300"" was a given of sorts, even though everything about the trailers and the publicity told me that I wouldn't like it. The trailers showed continuous scenes of Gerald Butler screaming his dialogue, which made me laugh out loud and the whole thing has an obvious fascist slant which automatically made me weary but I thought I'd watch it for its artistic merits. Well, I shouldn't have bothered.<br/><br/>First, I needed to press mute button because the dialogue was painful. PAINFUL. Worse than any badly dubbed Italian film. Thank god I didn't see this at the movies where you can't turn off the volume.<br/><br/>Second, though the film is sorta great to look at, the tone and general aspect of the direction is so fascistic that any artistic pleasure to be had was nullified from the get go. It's as if the director thought: ""Well, to justify the entire near naked male cast, we'll go overboard with portraying every character as one-dimensional and as ultra-macho as possible so any wussiness associated with the concept of all these near naked men will be eclipsed to most viewers."" See also my first point above about this.<br/><br/>The film is clearly meant to be watched as a visual experience and the 300 Steve Reeves move about like a synchronized special effect, their moves, appearance and ejaculating blood are what basically constitutes as acting here. And anyone bemoaning historical inaccuracies is really barking at the wrong tree. It's a visual interpretation of a historical event, nothing more. I just wish the tone wasn't as unpleasant as it was (fascist, racist, sexist, etc). But as visual as it was, the whole thing is simply too processed and there's rarely a believable moment in it. It looks too sleek and designy. Heck, TRON was more believable than this. In the end the visuals lacked gravitas.<br/><br/>Third, the direction is overwrought and over-baked. Again, I suspect the director overcompensated here to tone down the wall-to-wall beefcake. In fact, the whole film is just an extreme tug-of-war of two waring concepts: how to visually showcase 300 Steve Reeves with the most base, simplistic and repellent machismo ever to appear on screen.<br/><br/>When all is said and done though, ""300"" is the biggest fetish movie of all time, even more than ""The Passion of the Christ"". There are some folks out there who actually get off from images of muscular men, dressed as gladiators, being stabbed or skewered. For them this would be their Holy Grail. It's perfect Peplum Porn."

This corruption is reflected in physical degeneration to the point that the army of Xerxes largely consists of beasts, cripples and monstrosities.<br/><br/>For example: Some Priests that the Spartan King visits to get a hint what to do by their oracle, are struck by a skin disease and the narrator describes them as old, diseased, inhuman, rotten and finally moral corrupt. One points to the other, from the obvious to the hidden. Of course the priests are in league with Xerxes and deliver deceptive advise.<br/><br/>In opposition to that, the Spartan Warrier Elite are male Superheros with perfect looks and superior faith, prepared for any sacrifice.<br/><br/>This idea of fitness, that (only) in a perfect male body a perfect soul lives, is something that is attributed to the antique Greece. But this idea stands in strong opposition to modern western ideology.<br/><br/>300 is aware of that opposition and this is shown by the struggle of the Spartan Queen at the Heimatfront against the spartan Council. In this Parliament so called politicians are listening to deceptive speeches while the King acts and dies for their freedom. The Queen succeeds only by stabbing her opponent in the Council to death, who has been bribed by Xerxes with gold.<br/><br/>While Western democracy traces its roots to antique Greece democracy, 300 suggests the opposite: That the Greece fought and died to defend their honor and freedom of Kings, holy oaths and sacrifice against a weak system of personal interest and debate prone to corruption.<br/><br/>Western ideology draws a line between beauty and truth, to the point that what is beautiful is considered to be a lie. For us, awful and truth goes together well. For us, truth is a matter of words, not of action. Antique Greece Ideology considered a connection between physical beauty and truth, but the goal of their thinking has been truth as well and they used words to find it. That is one source of western philosophy and culture.<br/><br/>By turning around this relationship between spirit and body, declaring physical beauty and sacrifice a material and therefore only real sign of truth, picturing words as misleading and a means for corruption, 300 cannot convince today. Mankind has 2000 years more experience to know better than that."

","One of the great stories in history reduced to a comic book isn't going to be everyone's cup of tea. BUT to make it such a boring experience took some doing. The movie is one scene after another of ""dramatic tension"" consisting of moving from affectation to more affectation. Even the battle scenes have this formula. Someone says something, then someone says something louder, then they fight, then they fight louder. There is zero reality and zero humanity but posing, posturing and preening are tossed around like eggs at 50 cents a gross. Evenually what kills 300 is the lack of any genuine characters. All emotion is press board material, which suits comics but at 120 minutes becomes intolerable long before the last frame. People die, so what? This is one tedious movie."
"arsenick","8","3","5","29 September 2007"," Could be a successful propaganda
","I feel exactly the same as many people about this movie (i.e kind of fascist values, melting defense of the race and civilization, body glorification, and hate over decadent and perverse eastern peoples), but I am wondering about the intent: was it made to condemn that fascism or to glorify it? I preferred to choose the second option, while kind of liking the movie anyway. It is well shot, not too bloody, and much better than epic movies like ""the lord of the rings"". Sex scenes are very exciting and beautiful, as well as the oracle's scene. I also fear that this version of the Battle of Thermopylae will be kept in the mind of main people to be historical. We do know that Xerxes was not evil and Leonidas was not good. The reality of both aechemenid Persia and Sparta is more complex. Anyway, we must also remind that the story of the Battle of Thermopylae had been written in ancient times to be a glorification to Sparta and Greece, as a propaganda against new enemies and towards a unification of the geek cities. We knew the same with the war of Troy, the battle of Marathon, all Egyptian stories, even the bible's stories were mainly made for strategic and political goals. So, it would not be fool to think that this movie nowadays could be used as a propaganda against Iran and/or an alliance of Turkey with Asian states."

","An absolute knock-out. Photography as good as it gets. 300 is based on a historically-inspired comic book series later to become the novel by Frank Miller. The retelling of the Battle of Thermopylae circa 480 B.C. may be historically inaccurate, but hell fire its a great movie. King Leonidas(Gerald Butler)of Sparta collects his best soldiers numbering 300 strong to defend against a Persian invasion. Leonidas knows this battle will be suicidal, so he only selects men that have sired a male child to continue linage. The mission calls for stopping King Xerxes's(Rodrigo Santoro)invasion of Greece at Thermopylae. A hunchbacked Ephialtes(Andrew Tierman) betrays the Spartan's planned passage through the narrow cliffs; this will allow the Persians too surround the overwhelmed Spartans. Dilios(David Wenham)is dispatched to tell the story of the sacrificial battle and to expound the glory of the 300. This film contains tremendous in-your-face graphic battle scenes. Lena Headey plays Queen Gorgo. Also in the massive cast: Dominic West, Vincent Regan, Tom Wisdom and Michael Fassbender. 300 is awesome."
"Thunderbuck","7","3","5","23 August 2007"," Oddly uninvolving
","I find Zack Snyder's 300 a bit of a puzzle: I think I admired a lot of it, and I didn't dislike any of it, but it really didn't move me much one way or the other.<br/><br/>There's a lot to recommend this movie for. The performances are believable, the visuals are spectacular, and the battle scenes are convincing. Gruesome? I guess, though in a rather stylized way that seems to drain the life out of the whole venture (as opposed to the violence in, say, PAN'S LABYRINTH, which at times made me cringe).<br/><br/>Odd, then, that this film that has radically polarized its audience somehow left me as indifferent as it did.

"catheter1st","10","3","5","4 August 2007"," Historical Accuracies of Frank Miller's 300
","Of course this is a Hollywood drama based off of a dramatic graphic novel, so certainly all artists involved took liberties with the historic premise of the story of the 300 Spartans. So critics who thirst for precise historical accuracy, or mock over current political themes can continue to pine and trash this film. Do not listen to them.<br/><br/>However much of this film is bathed in accuracy. The Spartan Agoge(a'go-gee), or military training of all boys over 7 years old. The discarding of offspring found to be puny, weak, misshapen, or sickly. The wrangling between Spartan Kings and the Ephors and the politicians. The elevated status of women within Spartan society. These are accurate portrayals of Spartan culture of the time. The set design is wonderful, reflecting an Ancient soldier society.<br/><br/>Facts of the Battle of Thermopylae are many. For the first time, Sparta aligned with other Greek city-states(Athens, Arcadia, Thespae), to form and initial defense against the Persian advance lead by Xerxes. The defense took place in a narrow crevasse just wide enough for a chariot or two to fit through, and the Greek phalanx dealt the Persians considerable losses in comparison to the Greek numbers, which at the beginning of the battle was roughly 5-6000 Greeks, and 500,000 Persian. The Greeks did rebuild the seaside wall, they were betrayed by a local resident of the area named Ephialtes, who did lead the Persians around the Greeks via a mountain goat path. Spartan King Leonidas, and his 300 Spartan soldiers then remaining, stood for the last stand against Xerxes. Their fight allowed the Greek states to complete the Olympic Games, an important Greek festival, and prepare to mount a defense against Xerxes, which ultimately paid off for Greece.<br/><br/>This film is a great modern restoration of these events, told in a way that will keep the average contemporary 18-35 year old movie goer entertained, enthralled, and hooked on the last stand of the Spartan 300. Definitely not for the very young, as it contains lots of graphic violence and nudity."

Violence is glorified at every turn. Those who aren't willing or able to fight are portrayed as the scum of the Earth.<br/><br/>The story has a great hook and an effective ""David vs. Goliath"" setup, but it basically amounts to a sequence of bland battles. Once the spectacle wears off, there's not much there besides hollow violence.<br/><br/>There are a few memorable lines of dialogue that have managed to permeate the popular culture, but they're the exception to the norm in this movie. Most of the dialogue is painfully on-the-nose and flat out stupid. The people I saw this movie with were laughing constantly at the stupid things the characters were saying.<br/><br/>You'll probably enjoy this movie if you're an insecure young man who wants to pump up his manhood by proxy of some homoerotic ultraviolence.

","This movie is clearly for the action buffs of the world, or for young women who have nothing else to do but look at ripped abs in a movie all day. That aside, this movie is bland. The characters in this movie are presented poorly and one dimensional. I am a huge Frank Miller fan after seeing SIn City and I expected no less from this incarnation of his work. Clearly I was wrong. Everything that worked for SIn City seems to play against this movie. The action was nicely done and the slow motion in those sequences were very pleasing to the eye. That said, that is where the slo mo should have stopped. It seems that every time they show a human on the screen that isn't computer generated, they want to slow them down. I understand this is for a comic book look and feel but after a while I want to press fast forward to see what the movie is like in regular speed. I wont say anything regarding the historical inaccuracies because I realize it is a comic book adaptation and you must allow for inaccuracies when dealing with a fantasy and thats fine with me. Also I wont say the movie is racist because it is a comic book like I said before and I could care less if it depicts the Persians wrongly because its one mans perspective. For all its faults the action couldn't save it. The dialog was so cheesy and lame I almost wanted ear plugs so that I could enjoy the movie. I mean seriously, I would rather watch the Passion of the Christ or apacolypto and hear a language I don't understand than to hear the same old phrases taken from every other epic movie and cut and pasted onto this movie. SO for all the hype this movie received and for all the reviews I received from my friends, I cant say it was enjoyable."
"deanofrpps","8","3","5","5 June 2007"," Recycling the Myth
","When the Greek writers composed the original version of King Leonidas' stand at Thermoply, Athens and Sparta were locked in a deadly internectine war. The Greek writers recollected upon a time when Athens the Great Democracy stood together with Sparta the Great Autocracy and saved Greece from the Great King of Persia. Greek writers were careful however in treating with the enemy extolling the Persian warriors for their courage in battle.<br/><br/>The original version of this film was released when US and USSR, former allies in World War II, the Great Patriotic War, were deadlocked in struggle for the mastery of the world. the deadly duel between Athens and Sparta was often used as a simile for the conflict between former allies. Why couldn't they work together as before might have been the hidden question.<br/><br/>Today the USSR is gone and the US now a debtor nation is hardly the industrial or military giant it once was. Where once the plains thundered with US troops in an army of millions, President Bush can barely raise an army equal in size to that of Switzerland.<br/><br/>Every civilisation in stress returns to its happier moments. Here we see the Greeks representing the cause of Western Civilisation fending off the hoards of Asia. We can savour the courage of the Greek Alamo, as a sop for US impotence.<br/><br/>The author of the updated version did not do honor to the Greeks who scribed the original tale. I don't believe Herodotus described Xerxes as a pervert. I believe Herodotus claimed that Xerxes' proclamation to the Greek City States before embarking on war was conciliatory in nature. Xerxes even claimed to be an Acadian, IE Greek. Herodotus also extolled the virtue of the Persian immortals who shoot the bow straight, ride in formation and always tell the truth.<br/><br/>The film made perverts out of the Persians and imported part of the Hanibal legend into the tale.<br/><br/>Yet I gave the film an 8 as the story deserves to be told and the character of Leonidas is true to that which history credits."
"cerrax","5","3","5","17 April 2007"," Visually stunning, but not a wholesome experience
","300 is an entertaining film. So let's start with the good.<br/><br/>The visual style of this film is unlike anything witnessed in cinema before. Every frame is a work of art, and at any point in the movie, you could freeze it and hang it on a wall in a museum. Even simple scenes of conversations between characters feature excellent cinematography. Battle scenes (which make a good portion of the film) inspire awe and adrenaline. The almost inhuman strength and skill of the Spartans is dramatic and sweeping. They are almost God-like in nature when in a fight. If you have any appreciation for good choreography, the battle scenes in this are quite amazing.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, every other part of 300 is less than stellar. The characters one dimensional, emotionless people. The story is older than dirt, and the way its told is fairly boring. The entire plot is predictable to a fault. Cheesy dialog and lack of any real humor doesn't soften up the movie's blindingly strong and pointless pace. The music is standard run-of- the-mill epic movie music complete with ""oh so cool"" electric guitar riffs.<br/><br/>This is definitely a crowd pleaser and if you're looking for some crazy fight scenes and a sappy (but weak) love story so your girl can tag along, 300 is a good flick. But aside from raping the box office (thanks to Frank Miller's name all over every piece of advertising for the film), 300 will not be remembered the way the true Spartans were."
"KiltedGreen","5","3","5","8 April 2007"," Visually spectacular but that's it
","Well, I'm glad I didn't pay √Ç¬£12 to see it at the London IMAX ...<br/><br/>There's good and bad.<br/><br/>The good is that it does look amazing - the gritty and almost monochromatic visuals really add something special to the film. This approach really creates a superb historical evocation with desaturated colour and some spectacular sweeping visual panoramas. The acting is appropriate to the aims of the film, but the action is so much of the whole film that the characters definitely take second place.<br/><br/>The bad, for me, is everything else. The film is, as at least one other has noted, a 20 to 30 minute intro followed by a battle. The End. And yes, it's an adaption of a graphic novel from a few years back now, but there's far more testosterone spraying across the screen than blood over those 116 minutes. Basically, there's one (strong) woman in this film and everyone else is a man (or boy) trying to outdo every other man in how hard, heroic, fight- ready etc. etc. he is. No weakness. No love - save the love of battle. OK, maybe a little at a few other select moments. For me this makes the film so one-dimensional that I couldn't engage with it at all. I just can't relate to that much death-dealing, lack of compassion and male love of violence (and I am a man).<br/><br/>Now it was perhaps foolish of me to see a film when I knew it's subject and general gist. But I had the feeling that 300 would somehow transcended its subject. It didn't - for me. I suppose I look around this beautiful world of ours and see it trashed, subjugated and destroyed by men and their generally violent outlook to life and sitting through this seemed to simply provide even more of it. Ah well, I'm a little wiser about myself and what I want to watch I suppose."
"sdx","3","3","5","7 April 2007"," dull, slow, and not very interesting in any way
","I'm not going to be verbose. Let's just say that this movie isn't good in any way. Here's why:<br/><br/>[*] The soundtrack is inconsistent. [*] The direction is sloppy. Many unclean cuts and sometimes you get the feeling that there are scenes missing, just because they would be too expensive to make without CGI [*] All characters lack depth, and the Persian king reminds me of HIM in the Powerpuff Girls [*] The movie as a whole lacks depth, story and splatter (enough of it to make it a good splatter movie) [*] It feels like the creators watched Braveheart, Gladiator and LOTR, and tried to put those concepts into a blender, with undesirable results.<br/><br/>It might be a good movie for 7-12 year olds who want to see a hack'n'slash movie though, but outside the scope of that, I doubt it appeals to anyone else. If you want to see a really good B-movie, which doesn't have any ambitions to be anything else than that, watch Attack/return of the killer tomatoes."
"regs-normal","3","3","5","4 April 2007"," Disappointing
","When my friends invited me to join them and told me about the plot of the movie, I was quite interested, especially because of its historic aspect, be it realistic or not. I didn't know that it was based on a comic, so I assume that I have a more neutral view on this movie than people who watch the film of their favorite comic.<br/><br/>I must say, I was quite disappointed about this film. First of all because of the meager plot: It is all about slashing throats, blood and spears. A lot of pathos, a few erotic scenes now and then that are quite redundant: More about ""sex sells"" than a stringent plot.<br/><br/>And then the characters don't show through, even Leonidas is portrayed merely as a heroic maniac. His relation to his wife, soldiers and his enemy, the politics of the war, the strategy, etc. are all side-dish and very simple. The film builds up very fast by showing these circumstances very quickly, just to reach the fighting scenes as soon as possible.<br/><br/>The end was also very disappointing for me since it did not fit well into the suspense that has been built up, either as a continuation or a contrast of it. It was simply banal. The only thing that was interesting for me was the visual effect. I've never seen this style before, it's a mix of comics and ""real"".<br/><br/>I'd say if you're a comic fan and you want a film of violence and blood, with an exaggerated plot and nice visual effects, then go for this film. If you're looking for a good and beautiful plot, ambiguous characters and a touch of realism then this movie will be disappointing for you."

"LoneObserver","3","36","120","11 March 2007"," Sorry, but I like a little subtlety with my fascism
","First off, let me say that trying to apply this movie to modern political reality is a bit of a stretch. Is Leonidas supposed to be Bush? Or is it Xerxes? Is Theron a liberal who hates the troops? I think that it is difficult to make those analogies, or even to see the movie as an allegory for the ""Global War on Terror."" What is not hard to see is the fascistic philosophy that underpins the movie. Spartans are judged worthy solely on their ability to serve as soldiers. Physical beauty, martial quality, and moral worth are all equated. The soldier-first mentality of the Spartans is what distinguishes them, and supposedly makes them better, than their allies. There are even hints of a death-cult amongst the soldiers. All of this without a single suggestion of irony by the filmmaker.<br/><br/>The movie is only tangentially related to the current political situation. It goes much deeper than that, which should be far more disturbing.<br/><br/>The movie is visually stunning, but empty for all that. Seeing the men cheering in slow motion as rain pours down is a fine image, but contributes little to nothing to the film. Neither did the sex scene, or half of the battle scenes. Even one of the salient dialogue scenes of the movie is ruined by the fact that the Spartans don't fight in the way that Leonidas claims. The sum effect of this is comedy. The movie takes itself so seriously that it never seems to realize just how empty many of these scenes are.<br/><br/>All in all, an entertaining waste of 2 hours. Especially if you enjoy overly-serious seeming movies. Or if you have fascist sympathies."

I'm very willing to suspend my disbelief when I go to the cinema, and am not averse to a bit of cheese, but after a few minutes i didn't know whether to laugh or cry. If this was meant as a joke, then fair play to the creators-it succeeds beautifully. If it is meant as a new style of film then it's 'hello' to yet more dumbing down and replacing real acting with limp melodrama, shouting a lot and CGI. The Spartan dialogue, which I assume is supposed to be heroic, stentorian, Homeric type stuff, comes across as tedious, pompous, wooden ranting which makes Nazi eugenicists seem, by comparison, quite liberal. To say that the acting was bad would be an insult to 'ham' actors. The Persian army, especially Xerxes, is depicted as some drug-fuelled gay disco on wheels-hilarious- this bit really must be a 'knowing' camp joke. Other inconsistencies arise in the Spartan's championing of 'reason'- and then ruling out of court any sensible military strategy. They denounce 'weakness', but all seem terribly moved when one of the characters mourns a loss to a frantic and 'unSpartan' degree. According to their own endlessly repeated ethic, he should be killed for being a bit of a wimp. Well, I can't decide: whether it means to be or not, it's an hilariously bad camp classic."

","300 comes out today. Will I go see it? Hmmmm...let me think about this one.<br/><br/>NO.<br/><br/>Yes, it's based on a Frank Miller graphic novel, but as was proved with Daredevil, Electra, Batman Forever, and the diamond of all comic book movie flops Batman and Robin, not all comic book premises translate well to the big screen.<br/><br/>From the previews, here is my synopsis of the movie...<br/><br/>Let's take the most famous last stand in history, The Battle of Thermopylae, a true demonstration of sacrifice, courage and strategy, and put the warriors in g-strings! and coppertone tans!!! Then, let's add industrial music and most importantly nymphets and ORCS! LOTS OF ORCCS!!! because we all know that Xerces had orcs fighting for him, right?! Then, there's lots of blood and more blood and gore...probably lots of black orc blood, too, since Jackson got away with it. Oh wait! There are actually orcs in The Lord of the Rings, and the book is a fictional masterpiece. Maybe Miller even threw in some other fictional things, too...like fairies, minotaurs and Merlin. Merlin would be a nice touch! He's from a different time period, but since there's orcs, why not put a fictional wizard in there? That's my synopsis.<br/><br/>Not to spoil it, but it is a bit of history. Leonidas and his army of 300 all die. However, there were more than 300 men fighting with King Leonidas, but who cares about the roughly 7000 men who also fought with the Spartans? Also, there weren't a million Persians, just a mere 150,000, but that's Hollywood. Even so, they were outnumbered by the Persians by about 20 to 1, fought a good fight, held off the army for three days and were eventually defeated. <br/><br/>The movie is a stylized telling of a great moment in history, and it's a shame that it had to be glamorized so much to make it interesting for our culture. I predict that the movie is probably visually spectacular for the first five minutes, and after that, the coppertone just won't shine as brightly.<br/><br/>Whatever you do if you see this film, don't take this as a history lesson. It's entertainment, and not even good entertainment at that. The dialogue is flat, aside the few historical gems, and I have difficulty feeling involved in any of the previews. When the monster is released during the fight against ""the immortals,"" I actually laughed at the idiocy of the scene."

","I just returned from a midnight screening and all I can say is wow, the movie industry has managed to create something bold, original, weird and at the same time extremely enjoyable. After Lord of the Rings, we were tired of seeing massive battles that used CGI to create armies containing hundreds of thousands of troops, and after Gladiator, Kingdom of Heaven, Braveheart, etc.... I was a bit tired of the historical period-piece films.<br/><br/>300 has managed to rejuvenate this genre. Snyder (director) was not afraid to mold his movie into the image of the graphic novel it is based on. The skies glow vivid colors, and the clouds seem to almost touch you in the theater. The use of slow-motion, even in non-battle sequences, made certain segments so much more impacted. One thing I will commend them for is not over-using the slow-motion, and keeping the camera controlled (no shaky/Blair Witch Project here, you can clearly see the battle scenes).<br/><br/>The story moves relatively quickly into the main plot line: the 300 Spartans making a stand against the might of the ""million man"" Persian army (although the trailer claimed a million, in the movie Leonidas only comments that the Persians ""claim their army is in the millions""). Once it begins, it grabs you and doesn't let go.<br/><br/>The Spartans are unarmored, wear heroic red cloaks and look like the fiercest SOB's you will ever see. The fighting direction was very effective, and the use of blood splatter made the fight scenes unique (although I could complain none of the blood ever made it to the floor and stained the ground, partly due to it being 100% CGI).<br/><br/>However, past the blood and historical inaccuracies, the only thing that truly bothered me was the freaks/monsters. A mutant who is locked in chains and then ""unleashed"" on the Spartans, a hunchback who follows around the Spartan army, a Rhino strapped with war ""garments"" and war elephants resembling those of Lord of the Rings. I understand these are stylistic devices from the graphic novel but they could have toned it down a little bit. I loved the look of the immortals, but the rest of the Persian Army generally looked like crappy Middle-Eastern militia fighters, against the gleaming, flowing red capes of the Spartans.<br/><br/>This movie made we want to grab a spear and head in the Phalanx formation. If you like action, fighting, a bit of nudity (and for those girls, 300 sculpted and muscular Spartans), this movie is for you. Forget guns: This is SPARTA!"

Their king looked nothing like a homosexual transvestite from a German love parade. /note that i mean no offense to people that are, i respect their decision, but when Hollywood is trying to convince us in something that is obviously wrong... that's a whole other story/ The movie is crap! I am horribly disgusted by the movie if i could i would have my money back from the movie theater! i am deeply saddened that WB dealt with such stupid movie! The movie gives the persians such a bad reputation that i think the producers should apologize on the evening news on all television networks, to the country of Iran, and to the people of Iran, although i doubt that the present day people of Iran are really successors of the ancient persians, but they do say they are, so we must respect their right of identification, must not we, same as the homosexuals, or you, my dear producers think otherwise?

The graphics were awful, specially the wolf in the beginning, also the elephants and rhino as well, also the ""AROOOOO"" thing, it was unpleasant at all!!!! And the cheesy lines about freedom and so on!! Awful script indeed!!

","While stunning to look at, and a technical marvel, 300 is a hateful film that leaves a sour taste in the mouth.<br/><br/>Like other Hollywood attempts to romanticise history, the film makes no attempt at all to understand the Persians - or even to give them any credit for humanity or culture. No, we take the tired old Euro-centric route that the Greeks invented civilisation, while baby-eating barbarians hammered at the gate.<br/><br/>Worse, the Persians here aren't just barbarians - they are actual, no I'm-not-kidding MONSTERS. Ugly, disfigured creatures with sharp teeth, multiple piercings - oh, and they are sexually androgynous and sadistic too. Though that may be more to satiate our ""civilised"" boy audience.<br/><br/>Art? Culture? No, the Persians were obviously too busy murdering each other in nasty ways, or having kinky sex for that.<br/><br/>Balance? Pah. This comic-book history robs the Greeks of their true victory, and provides fuel for small minded haters of cultures other than our own.<br/><br/>Frank Miller is a genius? Maybe as an artist. Personally I found his message in this film puerile and simple-minded."

With Sin City, the experience was so engrossing that I felt a connection with each of the characters, and I couldn't take my eyes off of the screen for a minute. I just didn't have that feeling here.<br/><br/>For whatever reason, I just couldn't get into it. Part of it I think has to do with the original material. The story of Themopoli is really a very simple one, which I suppose doesn't lend itself to character development.<br/><br/>Either way, the film is worth seeing for the visuals alone.

","Yes, I know the movie was based of a graphic novel, but I am afraid that people will start citing this film as a historical reference, which it is not. The acting was good but all of the sex scenes were completely unnecessary. All of the battle scenes were awesome, except the first one with the immortals and the wall of dead bodies, no one in their right mind, including the real Leonidas, would leave their superior Phalanx formation just to make a few bodies fall on 1 demented immortal. Why were all the immortals beast like? Last time I checked they were regular humans who were just good fighters. Also, for some reason none of the Persians had wicker shields and spears, which was the preferred weapon set. The elephants were the size of the ones from Lord of the Rings, which was pretty cool, but I am afraid of idiots thinking elephants were that big. The other Greeks left their position far to late also. Darius looked like a large girl who would get tangled up in her own jewelry if she tried to fight. Darius was a normal guy in real life and was not so girly looking. The Persians also preferred chariots over regular horsemen. I did not understand why they had a crab type man cutting of the heads of the generals, I guess a man with an axe is just too real for the writers of this film. Were all the weird priests like lepers or something because they sure looked like them. As a film to watch for action this movie was great because the fight scenes kicked butt, but I am afraid of idiots who will start using this as a historical reference and they will think they know what they are talking about.<br/><br/>Compared to The 300 Spartans, this film has better action yet it is much worse in the historical realm.<br/><br/>for action a 9.5 out of 10 for historical accuracy a 1 out of 10 (at least it was based on a real event)"
"moviefan1725-1","10","7","17","9 March 2007"," A true epic of courage and sacrifice.
","Ever since Gladiator, we have been subjected to many lesser movies like Troy and Alexander. But now with 300, the bar has been raised even higher. A visual masterpiece, 300 tells the story of King Leonidis and 300 of his Spartan warriors that defend their land from 250,000 invading Persian warriors. Their courage rallied an entire nation to fight against a foe previously thought invincible. I can't say enough about the amazing visuals in this movie. What surprised me the most is the film's use of slow motion. Normally I am wholeheartedly opposed to extensive use of it in action movies. What you usually see in slow motion action movies is things like a character leaping through the air firing 2 guns at the same time, or bullet casing hitting the floor, or people making impossible leaps in carefully choreographed martial arts fights. You guessed it, I'm not a fan of The Matrix, or any movie directed by John Woo. Not that I hate them, but give the slow motion a rest. But here, it actually serves the story and the characters. The Spartans were the best combatants of their time. They weren't simple countrymen who served in battle when they were needed. They were born and bred soldiers. They could easily handle themselves when faced with odds of 3 to 1...or more. The slow motion shows the ease with which they could dispatch multiple enemies without even breaking a sweat. The slow motion also gives an epic sense to the battle scenes that, if played in real time, would simply be a mind boggling jumble. It brings the brutality home. But the slow motion is just part of the visual style. From the great use of CG, to the color schemes, to the camera angles, the movie is a feast for the eyes. It truly NEEDS to be seen on the big screen to be appreciated. There is a sequence that shows the Spartans watching from the cliffs during a torrential storm while the Persian fleet is consumed by the sea that is a particular favorite of mine. Is there a ton of character development? No. But then, you don't need it. This is a simple story of men doing what they were trained to do, fighting for what they believed in against an enemy they knew they had no chance of defeating. Even in the face of certain death, their courage never wavers. They knew going in that they were fighting for something greater than themselves. Zack Snyder is quickly becoming one of my favorite directors. His remake of Dawn Of The Dead is not only the best zombie movie ever made, but one of my favorite horror movies of all time. He turned the genre on it's ear by changing the lumbering zombies of George Romero, and turning them into fast running, meat seeking missiles. Now with 300 he has taken the gladiator genre, shaken it, and given it a life like never before. It's truly unlike anything ever seen before. Hopefully a sign of things to come, 300 is the first must see movie of 2007."
"prbach","8","7","17","7 March 2007"," Beyond Blood and Guts: ""300"" Fights in a Dreamscape
","Imagine sitting by the fire and listening to the village elder tell of how 300 Spartan gladiators held off a million Persian invaders. Well, you don't have to. ""300"" is a campfire tale come to screen and mythologized to epic proportions.<br/><br/>The film is an adaptation of a graphic novel of the same name by Frank Miller, whom viewers might recognize as the novelist of ""Sin City."" ""300"" isn't as richly textured as ""Sin City."" It's focused more on the build up to war as opposed to the character clashes that brought an equal level of violence to ""Sin City."" But ""300"" has a very similar look and soundtrack, and more importantly, its narrative shares the same dark poetic qualities (I hesitate to use poetry, lest I conjure maladroit comparisons to Virgil or Homer) as those of the three ""Sin City"" story lines.<br/><br/>These poetic qualities are absolutely vital because ""300"" holds no pretense to realism; it's much closer to an opera (without arias) than the dramatic naturalism found in recent films, such as last week's ""Zodiac."" There are more than a few occasions early in the film when its gross characterizations of the Persian army could've been rather offensive. The film casts audacious black men as Persian emissaries, draping them in robes and chains that might've been ripped from racist cartoon characterizations of ""African heathens"" or ""ragheads."" The Persian king, Xerxes, is the pagan devil himself, decked in odd facial piercings, eyeliner, and beads that make him effeminate even as the bass notes in his voice are artificially enhanced to seemingly erupt from the most masculine bowels of the earth.<br/><br/>Yet because of the visual and lyrical poetic qualities, it's clear the film depicts an alternate plane of reality of the kind encountered during bizarre dreams half remembered come morning. In fact, the production notes suggest the film seems more like a dream dreamt by the narrator the night after the battle, preserving the events' emotional truths and employing facts not as objective truths, but as symbols that texture the emotion. This suggestion, to me, seems the most accurate way to view the film. And I think it counters those who'd find social metaphorical or allegorical statements supporting racism or the pros and cons of Bush's Gulf War efforts (which might otherwise be appropriate if the film were more literal).<br/><br/>It also helps that the dream emerges as its own independent reality. Fine performances from the leads are indispensable to this end, particularly those of Gerard Butler as the king, Lena Headey as the queen, and the narration of David Wenham (of ""Lord of the Rings"" acclaim) as one of the king's best friends and fellow soldiers.<br/><br/>There's also a distinct look and feel to the film that facilitates its independent reality. The lighting has odd and portentous contrasts. Distinct detail in the special effects carves edges into a misshapen human monster's tooth and chisels contours into the Spartan warriors' six-packs. A gritty soundtrack that fuses acid guitar rock with orchestral themes melds with the narrator's Australian accent to lend a course sense of order to the action, a Croc Dundee-like Outback fusion of simplicity and toughness. In short, the film is otherworldly.<br/><br/>Was it a great film? No. But an enjoyable film that's remarkably consistent with ""Sin City"" and will likely be an influence on other films later this decade? Yes. And it certainly makes Russell Crowe's ""Gladiator"" seem, well, un-poetic by comparison."
"misterembryo","10","7","17","5 March 2007"," Explosive to the Extreme!!!
","Only the hard and strong can be called Spartan. 300 is a film that brings forth the same intensity and passion to film-making that the Spartan warriors they portray bring to the battlefield. Visually stunning frame-by-frame with sword clashing, bone crushing audio that creates the same impact to the film.<br/><br/>The Spartans are beasts. A whole army of 300 bloodthirsty soldiers... an 8-pack of abs seems to be a mere requirement. King Leonidas is so fierce and hardcore, he makes Achilles and dare I say Maximus look like Ben and Jerry.<br/><br/>With each fleet that King Leonidas and his army of 300 Spartans must endure, comes new surprises and new challenges that keep the audience wondering if or how they will survive. The fights are unsparingly brutal and innovative, beautifully shot. And the scenes aren't just blood, sweat and gore. Although you get all that and more, the fun is also in witnessing the different tactics the 300 use to outsmart and overpower the Persian Army. One thing that sets the 300 battle scenes from Troy, Gladiator, or Braveheart are the wide assortment of creatures they are forced to do battles with. I guarantee you will not find a goat playing a sitar in any other movie but this. I will say no more.<br/><br/>Even the love scene is shot so intimately and passionately with the same intensity as the battle scenes. (By the way, on a side note, isn't funny how an audience giggles when there's a naked man, and goes dead silent when it's a naked woman?) Anyway...<br/><br/>The Queen is just as powerful as the warrior king. She has the challenge of gaining the support of the rest of Greece to join in her husband's fight against the Persian Army. She's so likable and respectable, you have her back the whole way through.<br/><br/>So far the Frank Miller series is 2 for 2! This is a film not to be missed. Yet again another theater that ended with a resounding applause. King Leonidas can now join the ranks of the other epic heroes that shoot fireballs from his eyes and lightning bolts from his arse. FREEDOOOOOOOM!!!"

The history of that time is actually interesting and complex as were the contesting sides. To say it was a lost opportunity is fairly irrelevant as they clearly had no intention of trying to use their resources to create an historical drama. They created a comic book which was likely what they wanted. What we get are a swirl of images and clich√©s. All of them are tired along with their symbolism. This is just formula. The skill is in the computer graphic people. The dialog, story, acting are virtually non-existent. All that can stay with you is in the tiring images that are pounded at you. Do the creative geniuses have nothing else to offer? <br/><br/>Formula, clich√©s, tired symbols; The one dimension talking/shouting head characters, the black and white choices, the obligatory lesbian kiss, the quasi-rape, the quasi-orgy, the whacko jewelry, piercings, straps and thongs, the torches, the staircases, the earth-mother in the field of grain with the rising sun and her young son running to her, the treacherous hunchback, the blatantly scheming and treacherous politician, the treacherous priests, the one eyed messenger, the miscast ethnicities, the blazing light between columns (several times), the soldiers doing super-human movements, the disjointed battle sequences, the illogical battle tactics, the endless symbolic gestures, the killing of the messenger with the threatening message, etc.<br/><br/>Then we get to the outright nonsense. The ""good"" Spartans are given costumes that approximate reality but their opponents are faceless leftovers from Lord of the Rings. One swears they were dressing from the same closet, although a few did have robes that some Persians might have worn. Then we have the beardless, effeminate Xerxes with multiple piercings and gold speedo trunks, essentially a joke from bars and salons I try to avoid. This takes Hollywood's willingness to disrespect history to new heights. It's a new low standard that will be hard to beat.<br/><br/>Even if you want blood, gore, action, fight scenes, what you get here is a video game of dark CGI. A comic book. But that is to insult comic books which often do have dialog, characters, depth, etc."
"alcator","9","4","8","14 June 2007"," True to the original, entertaining and visually stunning
","Frank Miller made a comic book. It took an actual event -- a suicidal stand of 300 Spartan warriors under the command of king Leonidas against a vast armies of Persian god-king Xerxes -- and transformed it into exaggerated heroic legend. It added cool remarks, cool view angles, cool action sequences, and readers loved it.<br/><br/>This movie is that comic book transformed almost frame-by-frame onto the film; the only change is the addition of a secondary storyline about the king's wife's desperate attempt to get some reinforcements for him.<br/><br/>These events are more than 2000 years old; the people portrayed in there have nothing to do with today Arabians (after all, the ""losers"" were worshiping their KING as god, not Allah, for god's sake!), nor with ""the West"" (those ""winners"" were disposing of weaker children without mercy, after all!). So it's not US against THEM, it's not U.S. against Muslims, and anyone trying to see that parallel in the movie is a stupid warmonger.<br/><br/>The transformation of the comic onto film was superbly done: Same colors, same visually stunning angles. It's much better than Troy, it's much better than Gladiator (in terms of the visual appeal of the fight scenes); the edit cleverly uses ""temporal jerkiness"" (wow, I wanna trademark on this expression! :-) ) , i.e. slowing and speeding one continuous shot so that you see each kill in slow motion and the ""dance"" between kills in fast-motion; the CGI of 2006/7 allowed the film makers to create absolutely unbelievable battle sequences that are jaw-dropping.<br/><br/>The secondary storyline seemed to me to be heavily cut; I'd say prolonging some of the scenes of that storyline with a bit more solid background for them (i.e., adding more of ""before"" and ""after"" for the scenes) would be good and I think that the extended version will add formidable amount of time to this storyline, as it seemed too brief. It's similar to Gladiator (the Extended version of which I greatly recommend), where in the original cut, certain acts didn't really seem rational, but the extended cut added plenty of ""evidence"" that justified them.<br/><br/>To sum it up, if you're looking for a historical action, you won't be disappointed. And if you are paranoid and see anti-Whatever-ism in everything, being it The Passion of the Christ or Black Hawk Down, give this movie a break - it's over 2000 years past the events depicted and we do have a brain."

","The Battle of Thermopylae, might be one of the greatest battles in history. Three-hundred Spartans defending against the quarter million strong Persion army under the command of Xerxes. Frank Miller's graphic novel 300, fictionalises this point of history into a surrealistic manner, while increasing the Persion army stronghold to one million. Making a mark with the Dawn of the Dead remake, Zack Snyder adapts 300 in a Gladiator meets Sin City.<br/><br/>Snyder is loyal to Miller's novel, staying true to the bronze soaked visuals and going as far as lining up blood splatters from the novel. Visually 300 triumphs effortlessly, with lush computer generated backdrops and an odd beauty within all the blood shedding. Visually engulfing 300 may be, a deep lack of drama and substance hinder 300 from Synder's aspirations. Men of the most extreme, the Spartans are the baddest of the bad, with 300 constantly wearing this badge of manhood on its sleeve, but makes the error of mistaking this badge as a shield. Grand standing and posturing with each man pelting out the loudest voice is all emotional deft when these are men of action, not ones to emote. Strangely scenes turn awkward the moment any one shows any emotional side. David Wenham's narration of Dilios recount, falters on every aspect, mainly on Wenham's lack of commanding voice and over emphasis to dramatise every moment; along with Synder trying to jam Epic! down your throat from point dot.<br/><br/>For the lack of substance 300 holds, the battles sequences are among the greatest place on celluloid. Firing on all pistons, fueled by extreme levels of testosterone, adrenaline and fierce intensity, Synder's directional skills excel with awe inspiring onslaughts and choreography among the blood thirst, which in effect glosses over any short coming the drama creates. Characterisations are kept minimal, there's no time to flesh anyone out (there's enough flesh on display anyway), when there's people to kill, though with this lack of dimension to play on, Gerard Butler cuts to the forefront. Showing Leonidas as a man with ideals and convictions, ripping out the odd quip, while slaying man after man on the field. Butler makes the most of broadly drawn Leonidas, the rest of the cast falls short. David Wenham's shortness of presence and story telling escape him. Dominic West's Theron, playing behind the scenes with his own schemes overly exaggerates. Rodrigo Santoro's Xerxes is all glam. As the only touch of femininity, Lena Headey rises above most as Queen Gorgo.<br/><br/>Visually stunning and battle sequences of the highest caliber, 300 on the surface is capturing and belligerent, the drama is too shallow in the depth department."

","300 is a visually and aesthetically well-made film. Whoever styled King Leonidas must have studied the ancient Greek statues very closely (I particularly like the accuracy of the pointed beard). Great use of technology, lighting, music and effects (although a bit overkill on the slow-motion sequences). <br/><br/>However, I couldn't help cringing throughout the entire film, thinking how some of the lines sounded like something you hear on Fox News. References to 'freedom' kept bringing to mind 'Operation Freedom Force' as Fox News dubbed it, whereas all other news medias around the world labelled it for what it was: the war on Iraq. Forgive me for being cynical, and I'm all for a good sword flick here and there, but it's no accident that this film is out now, considering the current political climate in the U.S. surrounding their concerns about nuclear proliferation in Iran. We must all be very careful and see this film for what it is: a good action-packed film, and not read into the subliminal pro-war messages. <br/><br/>When I went to Thermopylae (as all Greeks do), I read the inscription and it brought tears to my eyes - just like visiting WW1/2 sites in northern France did, as Auschwitz and Hiroshima did. Why? Why did all these people have to end their lives so tragically? <br/><br/>Instead of glorifying war and bloodshed we should be using this to make us remember that war is wrong. That mankind have got it all wrong and that we need to look at things through different eyes; not ones with borders, nationalities, faiths, colour, creeds, etc. but as humans. We have to say: What are we doing to each other? Is all this death that necessary?<br/><br/>It's good to rehash history but it has to be done responsibly, like Ridley Scott did with ""Black Hawk Down"" for example. <br/><br/>History is here to teach us, but this battle happened in 480BC, which sadly tells me that the lessons are lost and we haven't moved on as a civilisation..."

Philosophically, this is a good movie for those who found the ""Star Wars"" movies to be too subtle. Virtually everyone who opposes our noble heroes is portrayed as, quite literally, an inhuman monster, while visually, the only tricks the director and editor seem to have brought to the table are (a) color everything bronze and (b) the old slow-fast-slow routine, a digital effect that was thoroughly played at least five years ago.<br/><br/>Add in some endless fields of softly swaying wheat, and all that was missing was for the latest Dodge SUV to come sweeping majestically around the mountains."

The acting consists of little more than flexed muscles and gnashed teeth. Snyder's obsession with slow motion is maddening. Without slow motion, used in every other scene for no apparent reason, the movie would only last about 42 minutes."
"Boba_Fett1138","8","6","14","26 March 2007"," The movie is exactly what it promised to be.
","This movie never promised to be the ultimate and definite historical movie about the Battle of Thermopylae. the movie instead promised to be a visual spectacle with big effects and spectacular action sequences. The movie promised to be simple entertainment and entertaining it was.<br/><br/>It's like how entertainment should be; simple and deliciously over-the-top. ""300"" is of course a movie that deliciously goes over-the-top with its images and overall style. The Frank Miller graphic novel gets translated very well to the big screen in terms of its style and atmosphere. The entire movie is greatly comic book looking, with its backgrounds, characters and action. Just like the other Frank Miller graphic novel turned movie ""Sin City"", the entire movie was shot in a studio, with the use of blue- and green-screen, to give the movie an authentic, unusual but beautiful and spectacular looking visual style.<br/><br/>Its style and characters make sure that you won't ever take this movie serious, unless you of course really believe that the Persian army used big over-sized misshapen, mutant looking creatures, Xerses really had such a deep voice and all of the battles happened in slow-motion. If you have a hard time coping with this comic book style and way of storytelling and interpretation of history, don't watch this movie and stick to historical books instead. But if you're simply interested in good quality action and entertainment, this is the perfect overblown blockbuster movie for you.<br/><br/>The story is simple and its basically about the Spartans standing their ground, attack-wave after attack-wave. The story trows in some more plot lines, involving King Leonidas' wife Queen Gorgo, who tries to convince the council to send more military support to save her husband, who knows he's going to meet a certain death. The diversity between those two main plot lines of attack and mostly talking and corruption work out well. Had the movie only been purely action it would had become tiresome after a while, I am sure. Also especially since the action is mostly of the same. Every attack-wave they encounter more dangerous, better skilled and often also more ugly looking enemies. Like a computer game, in which you advance one level-up, after you've beaten the enemy.<br/><br/>But yes, it's also a missed opportunity that they didn't stick to the true story, since it's far more interesting and in my opinion also more heroic as the story portrayed in this movie. But it's of course also more complex and because of that also possibly less entertaining. I've always been greatly interested and fascinated by the story of the battle of Thermopylae, so I've wouldn't minded some more accuracy but I can understand and appreciate the approach of this movie and its story of the famous battle. Still sort of too bad that they decided to go with a voice over that tells what happens on screen and what the emotions and atmosphere was. The images themselves should be powerful and perfect enough to tell all of this.<br/><br/>Everything in the movie is just basically very black & white and doesn't get complicated. Meaning that the good guys are all extremely good and they look like perfect creatures, with perfect biceps and white teeth and the villains are extremely evil and look like monsters, also complete with bad teeth.<br/><br/>Definitely true that the best parts were already in the trailer but the movie still has plenty of visual surprises and spectacular action in it. The idea and sight of 300 Spartans facing an over a million man large Persian army is both impressive as spectacular. The best parts are definitely the action sequences, that show the bravery of the Spartans and their fighting skills and tactics, against the poorly organized and trained Persian army.<br/><br/>The acting by the way was definitely better than expected. From a movie like this you just don't expect grand performances. Gerard Butler was great as the roaring and heroic King Leonidas and David Wenham and Vincent Regan play some good supporting roles. Of course the dialog isn't much special but this again perfectly suits the comic book style of film-making.<br/><br/>I don't think that is a movie that will ever grow into becoming a classic and therefor I feel that it's also slightly exaggerated that the movie is actually in the IMDb top250. Nevertheless it's a movie that shall always remain perfectly entertaining to watch.<br/><br/>8/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

","Interesting that the critics have panned this one, my local paper refuses to even rate it - apparently it's politically incorrect! Killjoys! It's a film, get over yourselves! Saw it today and was blown away. I haven't been on the edge of my seat like that for some time. This film has it all - tragedy, heroism, love, sex, betrayal, and more action than your going to believe - what more do you want! Some people have become 'upset' apparently at the portrayal of Sparta (though it's a comic book adaption, it is of course a fantasy adaption of the real Battle of Thermopylae in 480 BC) - but the Sparta the film is based on is historical fact, that's how it was idiots! At the real battle about 7,000 Greeks (with King Leonidas's 300 Spartan bodyguards way up at the front of a very narrow pass) faced down King Xerxes I's Persians - the biggest army ever seen in the classical world - estimates range from 150,000 to possibly half a million. If that isn't worth making films about what is? See it, believe it!"
"rcvilau","9","6","14","23 March 2007"," ""A new age has come, an age of freedom""
","Yes, a new age has come. An age of computer generated landscapes and special effects that make you feel like bleeding with the heroes on screen. That's 300. A great battle that keeps you with your eyes glued to the screen for two hours, not even trying to anticipate the next move, because it simply does not matter. You know that the spartans will stop wave after wave, and if you don't, you want them to. The landscapes are extraordinary, the soundtrack is something everyone wants to have at home, something to listen over and over again. The story is not the best I've seen. It can not be compared to Gladiator, Braveheart or The Last Samurai. Those have well built story lines, that make you symphatize with the heroes, even wish the ending was different , although you know they're going to die. 300 has no such worth in writing. Reading the screenplay would probably not get you ""there"". But it doesn't need it so much. Who, except maybe for the persian's descendents, would not symphatize with the spartans? It's a classic battle between the few and the many. Now, to all of you who wrote about this movie not being historically accurate...IT'S NOT SUPPOSED TO BE! It's a movie based on a comic book. Nobody complaint about the comic book being inaccurate. But when the movie appeared on screen, they were on it like vultures, complaining about this and that. This movie is made so people would enjoy watching it. It doesn't replace the history book. About the acting, Gerard Butler is perfect for the role, he has the attitude and the power to lead his people. All the cast is very well put together, from the child Leonidas, to the treacherous Theron. All the spartans are well placed, although they don't look like being three hundred men in the battle(more like 50). The only flaw in this cast is Lena Headey. She's so awful, that I had to drop my rating one point. From the beginning to the end she keeps the same face expression, she only smiles, with no reason of course, when she's speaking to the council( a thing that would have never happened at that time). She has the same eyes while saying goodbye to her king and while killing Theron, after offering herself to him with the same eyes as greeting her child. That would not be such a great deal if she had a minor role, but in this movie the spartan queen is as much as a hero as her husband,so some good acting would be appreciated. <br/><br/>All that said , I gave this movie a 10 for effects, a 10 for soundtrack, a 10 for atmosphere, an 8 for acting and an 8 for storyline. So, that's a 9. Go see it if you haven't done it yet. It's the first of many."
"optiktrik","10","6","14","22 March 2007"," 300
","It really aggravates me to see others accuse a movie of being a blatant form of propaganda, when it obviously isn't.<br/><br/>Movies are made... and meant to entertain, and hearing that 300 is a stale movie with brittle characters and I guess what some have called a ""fascist"" message, and then there are the ones that say the way Persians are portrayed in the movie is offensive.<br/><br/>These are people who obviously don't respect movies as the art they are. Calling a movie, ""fascist"" and exploiting the tag line of a movie just to force their own opinions on everyone else. Furthermore, in a movie... there has to be a protagonist and an antagonist, its how things have always been and always will be. In this instance, Sparta are the good guys, and the Persians are the bad guys... OF COURSE THE GOOD GUYS... are going to be made up and the BAD GUYS are going to look like beasts, its not racist, and it definitely shouldn't be thought as such. Thats like someone making a Beowulf movie and some ethnic group getting offended because they feel Grendal(besides being a monster) portrays their race incorrectly.<br/><br/>We all know, before 300 was a hit in the box office, it was Frank Miller's graphic novel, however not all of us know before that was the movie. ""The 300 Spartans"" and yes, it was made in a different time... but I urge anyone to watch and dare them to say... its racist... or fascist, it'd be entertaining to see.<br/><br/>I loved the newest 300, its visuals.. its story and its characters, and I was glad to see it in theaters.<br/><br/>Thanks."
"yukiya_munoki","10","6","14","21 March 2007"," Short and Powerful
","I had very high expectations for this film, and I must say that it has exceeded far beyond my expectation.<br/><br/>Although some may consider the story too simplistic, it is nonetheless so powerful that the simplicity can almost be overlooked; we should consider that the story is a based on a tiny portion of the tales about Spartan wars. The storyline may not be perfect, and perhaps even a bit melodramatic, but its flaws are excusable as are adapted from a comic.<br/><br/>The cinema-graphics were just amazing, probably the best and most artistic battle scenes I've ever seen in a movie. Anyone who's a graphic junkie should definitely see this film on the big screen.<br/><br/>Also, for those who protest that the Persians were wrongfully portrayed in this film, please realize that this is a comic-adaptation of a film, and that most people probably do recognize the fantasy in it. I doubt anyone really believed that the Persian king was some eye-liner-wearing tall freak with jewellery all over his face who sits on a 6-foot golden throne carried by people....or that he really has those mask-wearing, ninja-wannabe death soldiers. So please stop making a big deal out of it.<br/><br/>All in all, this is the most entertaining film of the year so far, and we should just appreciate its beautiful choreography, its fantastic graphics, and the powerful performances that Butler and his fellow actors gave us.<br/><br/>If you're going to spend $$ to feast the eyes on the silver screen, spend it on this movie."
"alecwest","9","6","14","17 March 2007"," Perfect for what it was.
","There are times when a film starring virtually unknown actors electrifies the screen and the audience. This is one of those times. From beginning to end, I was riveted to my seat. I predict that a few years from now, when some people say, ""They don't make 'em like that anymore,"" they'll be referring to ""300"" and movies like it.<br/><br/>Now, a ""critical"" comment on certain ""critics."" There are a lot of naysayers who complain about historical inaccuracies in the film. My question to them is ""Why?"" This movie is about a real historical event and many of the roles were of real people who participated. But everyone going into this movie KNEW (or should have known) that it was based on a ""graphic novel."" Some such novels are referred to as ""faction"" - a mixture of fact and fiction. So I went into the theater expecting nothing more than a good tale of action and adventure. And, I got what I was looking for. Critics looking for a factual retelling of events should rent or buy the History Channel special, ""Last Stand of the 300."" But if you do, buy some ""No-Doz"" tablets to stay awake ... something no one needed to take for this film.<br/><br/>Final note. If you're wondering why I only rated it 9 out of 10, here's why. I was totally immersed in the action when a film-goer 2 seats behind me started laughing and said, ""Oh, God - a smallpox vaccination."" My eyes were immediately drawn to the bare upper left arm of a Spartan soldier who was talking to Leonidas and, sure enough, there was a big-as-life circular smallpox vaccination scar on his arm. It did take some enjoyment away from the film as I confess to spending some of my time looking for other flubs (Rolex watches, etc.). Didn't see any. And, if it hadn't been for a sharp-eyed film-goer, I'd have rated this film a solid 10.<br/><br/>It is already on my ""to buy"" list when the DVD is made available."

Though, there are bits that are not historically accurate, no skin off my nose. But those scenes add to the film, making it stronger. To me, what i felt like when i was watching this film, i was living a Conan book. Conan being pure fiction not withstanding. Its a very violent film, but what did you expect concerning this subject?

The concept of an 'army' of 300 men plus allies being able to do what it is that they did is unbelievable...until you see it for yourself.<br/><br/>With no 'big names' this movie, in it's entirety, centers around itself and its characters and its own story lines and visual effects, opposed to many films nowadays that seem to revolve around the actors they lasso into playing the roles.<br/><br/>Every moment depicted is breathtakingly perfect, the cinematography unbelievably fascinating as well as the battle scenes that embody the Frank Miller-esquire manner of fighting, making the deaths almost comical and quite drawn out.<br/><br/>There is nothing about this film that I would change, given the opportunity, and for this I award 300 with a 10/10, because I just can't rate it any higher."

","Let me start off by saying that the concept for this movie was an excellent find and was a story that definitely needed to be told. Yet their was one problem.... where the f*ck was the plot or character development. Hell if you dozed off for a couple of minutes which most people around me did you probably missed the basis for the story. The cinematography was brilliant and was the only thing that actually kept the viewers attention at certain instances during the several battles. But thats it.... in my personal opinion the abuse of slow motion and lack of character development makes this probably my choice for one of the biggest disappointments of the year.How could this of been a movie when their was little to no dialog? I mean outside of 3 scenes i didn't catch any. The majority of the dialog had to do with a side story that was so out their it just seemed like it was their to eat up more time between the slow motion bits.As for the ending it seems like the Spartans went out kind of weak i mean their was no big finally just a couple of arrows and boom and of movie.<br/><br/>This movie was very disappointing and a waste of money!"

I was wrong, fortunately.<br/><br/>The movie stays true to history as far as the battle went. (some historical inaccuracies were there, like Spartans were gay for example, and only had sex with females to have a son. Also, women could not leave the homes. Scenes in Sparta shows women walking around town.) Despite that, the movie was excellent. Character development, music, and of course the Battles. This might be the best battle scenes I have ever seen in my life.<br/><br/>Very entertaining movie, Just don't bring the kids.

My biggest complaint is that I didn't care about any of the characters. Even Leonidas fell flat. I expected the Spartans to be completely ""hardcore"" Achillean-type heroes but instead they spouted corny lines about love. Oh, and the whole thing is in slow-motion. The political back-story is poorly executed. I could go on forever.<br/><br/>300 basically takes Frank Miller's graphic novel, CG's the hell out of every shot, adds some lame dialogue, and then slows down the action enough to make even the most graphic violence become boring."

","300 lives up to its hype, a must-see for movie lovers -- and see it in a theater, don't wait for DVD. I went with friends, and we all agreed to go again. Once is not enough. To all involved, especially Zach Snyder and Gerard Butler, you have given your audience one wild experience. Having read mixed professional critical reviews, we were prepared for disappointment, though audience reviews were mostly good to raves. We side with the ravers. If you can do so, see it at an IMAX theater. It is a groundbreaking, starmaking film, a visceral immersion in a living painting of an ancient time. As to historical accuracy, this is art and myth, a tale within a tale as told by a storyteller to rally his people to what he deeply believes to be a noble cause. In that vein, 300, to paraphrase Picasso, lies to tell the truth."
"eflemieux","6","6","14","10 March 2007"," Welll made but i'm disappointed
","I feel like a Spartan facing the hordes of fans who will run me over after I dare criticize this movie...<br/><br/>The 300 is a very well made movie - no doubt about it - but, as a cinematographic work, it suffers from sticking too much to its origin as a graphic novel. Graphic novels are a special form of expression, with impressive graphics and short texts, but the reader knows he's looking at a graphic novel and suspends his/her disbelief to follow the story. Movies on the other hand, are expected to look and feel realistic. The 300 is somewhere between the two, a comic book with photographic images but not an epic movie like Gladiator.<br/><br/>The preview contains 80% of the best scenes of the movie and, furthermore, it does not prepare the viewer for the look and atmosphere of the movie. The CGI is too oppressive, it is ""too much"" and it crushes the performance of the actors and ends up looking phony. The characters are ""flat"", they miss personality (besides Leonidas), they each have one personality trait and that's all we see.<br/><br/>The character of Xerses is laughable (but it's not the director's fault, the character comes straight from the graphic novel)and most of the villains look as real as any bad guy from a Batman book. The Spartans are noble and all but once you start looking closely, they start looking unreal and cartoonish. Leonidas' wife is major eye-candy though, and she sticks out like the only realistic character in the whole movie. Also, the dancing oracle is wonderful to look at but if you observe the image too closely, the filming technique used becomes obvious and it ruins the feeling.<br/><br/>In short, this movie is an excellent ""moving graphics-graphic novel"" but don't go in looking for Lauwrence of Arabia, you'll be disappointed."
"amunsbane","10","6","14","9 March 2007"," Just for a little bit....I was a Spartan.

Like any good war story some facts must be embellished, some of the events skewed all in an effort to draw the listener in and FEEL what happened in that battle. The movie 300 does that in a way that leaves you craving another chapter to be told. Those that are going to see this movie expecting a documentary of Spartan life, skip it. Wait for another special to be done by the History Channel....or, go and enjoy this sensory feast of art. . Think comic book come to life and you've got this movie spot on. Even if you aren't a fan of comics it is well worth the price of admission for the speeches King Leonidas gives his men.

"Mr-Brightside","3","19","60","25 March 2007"," Just not very good...
","Dreadful. Utterly dreadful. That's about as much as I can muster in regard to this absolute mess.<br/><br/>Now, I think I should first let it be known that I'm not a fan of historical epics at the best of times (Spartacus, Lawrence of Arabia and Gladiator being the exceptions to that rule) but I am always willing to give the genre the opportunity to win me over, as the storytelling value, historical relevance and powerhouse performances are often enough to keep hold of even the biggest detractor's (i.e. me) attention. However, from beginning to end, this really did just take the proverbial Mick. <br/><br/>Whilst a marvel in just how a movie can now be made (albeit at the complete detriment of every other cinematic fundamental), I found it insipid, slow moving but not particularly detailed, poorly acted (shouting and snarling whilst already shouting and snarling your way through the script should never pass for the kind of emotive acting the genre demands), and beyond ridiculous. There is far too much focus on premise, visuals (completely detached me from feeling anything for anybody in the film - the best films tend to make the surroundings an extra character to juxtapose with the foreground, 300 doesn't even bother trying) and plot and therefore there wasn't a single character I could care less about by the end of the film, as each of the primary protagonists were given nothing like the development or emotional layers that invoke the viewers empathy or sympathy. Each of the main protagonists in most of the films I choose to advocate have a narrative that are equal measures of intriguing, thought evoking and emotionally viable, something 300 would have done well to at least try an attempt.<br/><br/>Style over substance and nothing more than a glorified, hammed-up action flick, in similar vein to something as historically and cinematically apt as Conan the destroyer. It really is a shame that they chose to take this particular route and soil a flick and a story with so much potential.<br/><br/>Pathetic film."

","A brave, oddly blue-eyed group of Spartans screech about ""freedom"" and serve as a model for humanity as a seemingly alien race of ugly, deformed, evil mutant Persians tries to conquer them. This movie, made during the US-Iraq war that began in 2003, is nothing but propaganda to inspire hatred for people from the Middle East. The Spartans certainly excelled at warfare and were brave warriors, but the rear-guard force of 300 was part of a much larger Greek army, numbering as many as 8,000 -- something the movie entirely leaves out. Second, the Spartans were war-like primarily to control the massive numbers of slaves held in their homeland, who outnumbered Spartan citizens 10 to 1. Hearing the brave, blue-eyed (LOL) Spartans screeching about ""freedom"" really made me laugh. The invading Persians are depicted as nothing more than cowardly, ugly monsters. As a former military officer, I admire the bravery of the Greeks at Thermopylae, but this type of propaganda, styled as ""cinema,"" makes me sick. My previous review, making these points, was deleted by IMDb. I wonder why."

","It's relatively high rating notwithstanding - this was dreadful. From beginning to end and everything in between. I have no argument with its bloodiness. Warfare in the ancient world was surely bloody and I have no problem with it being depicted in this way. But it was depicted poorly. The battle scenes were poorly presented and had an overall air of unreality to them and much of this seemed locked in the world of fantasy.<br/><br/>The movie depicts the great Battle of Thermopylae, when the Spartan King Leonidas led a combined army of Spartans and Athenians against the Persians under King Xerxes. The movie is historically accurate to the extent that Leonidas did indeed die in battle against the Persians at Thermopylae. Aside from that this is mostly a muddle. The opening half hour or so showed some depictions of life and military training in Sparta (for Sparta indeed was a highly military culture) and offered some views of how boys in particular would have been raised in this culture. But that recreation of Spartan life cannot overcome the basic conclusion I was forced to, which I share now again - this was dreadful!"

I wonder how they would explain the ultimate downfall of the Spartan, and Greek, civilization in ancient times? The Spartans are like the Nazi ""uebermenschen"" taking on the inferior Africans and other dark skinned peoples. Only the treachery of a handicapped ""untermenschen"" could bring them down.

It is really unwatchable. The only reason we watched it is the inexplicable good reviews we have all seen for this movie, but we can only assume that those reviewers were sadomasochists with no interest in historical accuracy or a good story.<br/><br/>Why is it sick? I could write a book to answer that question, but briefly, tell me if you do not regard this sick: seeing mounds and mountains of dead Iranian/Persian bodies piled high, with some of them squirming as they die, with Spartans seeking out the squirming bodies so they can spear them a few more times, walking on top of mounds of dead and dying bodies without a care in the world. Or how about seeing a giant wall constructed with boulders AND the bodies of Iranian/Persian soldiers, with arms and legs dangling out of the wall. Those two images are just for starters.<br/><br/>There is no reason to care which side wins in the bloody battles between the Spartans and the Persians. Both sides are written to be so detestable that it really is a draw. And then you have to accept that the star of the show is a Spartan with a heavy Scottish accent. There is virtually nothing to hold your interest as far as a story line goes.<br/><br/>The sets look so cheesy and I am shocked that this is not the main comment in every review of ""300."" Cheesy, cheesy, cheesy. The pace of the movie moves like a snail. And of course there is less than ZERO historic authenticity to any of this. It is a contrivance. But it is also a contrivance of the sickest order. Pure perverse obsession with killing and brutality. This film will have a very seriously negative impact on those children who have no moral guidance at home.<br/><br/>Finally, the film is dark and boring in its scenery, which doesn't look real and doesn't look interesting. <br/><br/>It very well may be the worst movie ever made.

All the homophobes who are critical of the movies portrayal of the Spartans need to grow up. The women were no less toned and attractive so what's the big deal? First off, it's a movie and doesn't claim to be an accurate history lesson. Second, the whole purpose of the movie is to entertain and visually please with photography, images, costumes, etc. On that level, this movie succeeds wildly. All this movie inspired me to do after watching its scantily clad actors was to go work out. Being in my upper 30's and married I realize a body like that takes a lot of work and should be appreciated.<br/><br/>This is a niche or genre movie that lovers of fine artsy films will probably hate. The plot is...well, there really is no plot. The acting is over the top and the images are enhanced. If you like artful, choreographed violence, stunning photography and visual images, and movies that glorify the warrior culture ¬ñ you're in for a real treat. I look forward to the DVD with features and maybe even a directors cut. My biggest regret was having to watch this movie on a small 19"" screen with a mono-speaker. This movie has huge presence and I hope IMAX brings it back for a second or repeated screenings."
"sugrulla","10","5","11","23 May 2007"," A different point of view of that story.
","This movie is beautiful, has incredible visual effects, a not really complicated plot and really fantastic battle scenes, if someone loses it's head, it'll show exactly the head falling from the body and hitting the ground like a soccer ball. ""If you want blood, you're welcome to join us"", said Leonidas in the movie, and it's quite like that.<br/><br/>People mostly describe it as a spectacle of blood and action, with really fantastic visual effects and a lot of clich√©s as dialogues. I don't think this movie is quite like that. You can really tell the whole story of the movie in 3 lines if you wanted, yet, this movie is not so empty as they say. It's not because it's very simple and plain, that it's meaningless.<br/><br/>I think, this movie has a message and it's something very deep.<br/><br/>When the Persian empire comes to Greece with it's huge wealth and military power, threatening the Greeks with annihilation or submission, most people will just get afraid and think of a way of escaping from being destroyed by becoming subordinate of the Persians, even through for the Persian empire, being subordinate means becoming a slave. Even through their leader is nothing short of a tyrant, people will not only abdicate of their freedoms for their lives, but they'll try to benefit from that greater wealth and become corrupt. <br/><br/>That's what everyone does, not only in this movie, but everywhere. The easier choice always prevails. It's easy to just stay and do nothing, it's easy to be corrupt, it's the easy path, becoming an ally of the Persian empire.<br/><br/>That's reality, that's what happens everywhere, all the time. The easier choice is leaving all that's right and becoming corrupt for the sake of your own greed. Yet, in this movie, someone, knowing it's impossible to win, will fight to the death to preserve what they believe it's right, even if it's a war of 300 against a million. There's examples of that in the movie, the Ephors, Theron, the council and others versus the queen, Leonidas and the three-hundred soldiers.<br/><br/>The entire world around you becomes corrupt, a great power it's about to take over everything, meaning it's the end of your lifestyle how you are used, so you'll just low your head and accept it? Or you'll stand with the few who won't accept that even if it cost you very much? <br/><br/>What's the ""glory"" they keep talking about? It's just a matter of pride? Or it means that glory, it's defending what you believe, to the end, even if you die for it?<br/><br/>This point of view it's different from everything I've read about this movie and it made me think a lot about things I've been doing recently in my life and what other people having been doing too. <br/><br/>This movie it's not empty at all. <br/><br/>And people should be careful about not becoming biased by critics opinion and so-called experts when watching this movie."

","300, the Oscars are calling your name! That is how I felt after seeing this movie. It's always refreshing to see the film medium pushed to its limits as in Sin City, The Matrix and other groundbreaking movies. It's encouraging for movie-goers to know that a director is feeling for every boundary to give them the best a story can offer as was done with 300.<br/><br/>The Cinematography was flawless, some scenes literally took my breath away. The Direction was tight with all the seams invisible unlike other epics. The cast; Brilliant, a new God has been found in Gerard Butler and I gladly worship. The script was impressive and faultless, Who came up with those lines?? The intensity of this film is breathless, it just doesn't let up. The artistry is something extraordinary. It's something when a film as highly stylized as this doesn't leave you with a yearning for reality.<br/><br/>In summary, an immensely powerful film, one of the best cinema experiences of a lifetime and a must-see for every man, woman and supervised child. Brilliant!"
"Bo16","9","5","11","11 April 2007"," Life as a comic book king...
","When you see a Warner Brothers film, 99% of the time, you know how you feel about the film within about 20 seconds. Warner Brothers just about always change the logo's colour design depending on the film. 20 seconds into 300, I was ecstatic. The logo, in front of the dirty, cloudy sky looked beautiful. 20 seconds later, an old man stands holding a baby. He looks like the kind of guy who should be playing Moses. A gravely (yet distinct) voice begins talking about Spartan rituals. Basically, you have to be a really hard bastard from the point you're born. Or you're thrown from a cliff. As a baby.<br/><br/>Suddenly, the camera drops about 30 feet and you see the ground below the cliff is littered with skulls. Very small skulls. This really is a film that isn't afraid to cause controversy. From this point in, we follow the growing up of future King of Sparta, Leonidas. Not once does the film drop its pace. Whether beating the living shite out of another warrior trainee or fighting a wolf, this film knows how to keep you on the edge.<br/><br/>Just when you think the film really can't get much cooler, it starts introducing characters that will not only stay with you until the end of the film, but as long as you remain a lover of ultra-violence. Other than King Leonidas, you have Queen Gorgol, his wife. Very wise and happens to be the only speaking female character within the film. Dilios; the narrator is very passionate about fighting. Other than narrating, he does very little for the first half of the film but has a crucial role towards the end. Ephialtes; This deformed Spartan outcast is a hunchback and an example of what inspires 'beautiful disgust' which I'll come onto in a moment. King Xerxes; In short, he's the baddie but he considers himself to be more of a deity than a king and tries to use his powers to tempt people.<br/><br/>Throughout the film, just about all the background is CG'd in. I'm not a massive fan of CG but like Sin City, 300 makes perfect use of it. The backgrounds are never anything short of astounding and throughout, I found myself wondering whether I should admire the action or the background. Similarly, because the film plays about with mythology a lot, there are some great horrendous beasts in 300. But unlike films such as Harry Potter or Pirates of the Caribbean 2, 300 manages to create these great horrific creatures, but still make them seem absolutely beautiful to watch. There is not a moment in this film that is dull or ugly. Everything looks perfect.<br/><br/>Finally...the fighting. What can one say? It's a huge let down... ... Just kidding. The violence in this is absolutely spectacular. Remember thinking Kill Bill was crazy? Then this is the film for you! The action is immense. Perfectly rehearsed and choreographed violence, mixed with great acting to make it seem as if it's unexpected make the action scenes in this film some of the best ever! The editing takes a very unorthodox style that works uniquely. As King Leonidas runs through battle the action has been slowed down to basically make everything seem really cool. Then suddenly, as an opponent comes into view, the action speeds up really fast. Rather than draw back, slice, blood splatter, carry on running...it's all a case of running, death, running, death, running, death. A 45 second steadicam shot following a soldier suddenly becomes a 3 minute blend of hyper violence and gore. Throughout this film, very little real fake blood was used. It's mostly all CG'd in. It creates an effect similar to that in Sin City: the blood is obviously fake but looks remarkably pretty. In comparison to the obese amount of death, the amount of CG'd blood is just about right. The editors weren't generous. Nobody said ""This will be the goriest film ever"". They made it the most violent, but not the goriest. And for that reason, it seems 300 stands above other films that seem to attract teen audiences because of the obscene amounts of violence. 300 retains it's dignity, because it has no problem mixing fact with fiction, mixing depth with stupidity, and mixing fun with utter drama.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>Screw it, if you're reading this review, you don't really care about any of this. If you want to see sex, violence and humour, check it out!"
"jacqlyn1964","10","5","11","7 April 2007"," What was expected, and more
","I have been anticipating this movie for well over a year, and I was not disappointed.<br/><br/>As expected, the look of the movie resembles that of the graphic novel it is taken from; therefore the colors are richly antique and fit the brooding melancholy of the movie perfectly.<br/><br/>As expected, the storyline is loosely based on the actual historical event that inspired the graphic novel; however, the creatures and hybrid humans throughout the movie are taken directly from the graphic novel, and are not meant to mimic reality.<br/><br/>As expected, the acting was superb and every actor deserves recognition for the amount of physical training that was involved in getting prepared for this film. Gerard Butler, King Leonidas, literally owned his character - showing emotion in every nuance of his body; with the most profound moments being with his queen - notably portrayed by Lena Headey. He makes you believe in his cause with every word yelled or softly spoken and she is strong and determined - supporting him in all that he does...the perfect match. Every part was played superbly by the mostly unheard of actors that Zach Snyder chose. The dialogue is witty, heart-wrenching, and - at times - eerie.<br/><br/>Unexpectedly, I came away from this movie with a new respect for Spartans and their way of life; for their unyielding courage and sense of duty. I hold King Leonidas in high regard, as one of the best leaders I have ever had the joy of learning about; and the 300 men that followed him, although not known by name, are heroes.<br/><br/>I know this movie is a love/hate movie - you will either love it, and want to see it time and again; or you will hate it. In my opinion, it's one of the best I have ever seen."

","I will keep this short and sweet I saw 300 tonight and i have to say it was amazing the visuals were stunning it is that good that it looks better than real life. The acting was good i really enjoyed it, the performances were great from all the spartan actors. Gerard butler is a f***n gun his roars and speeches were crazy no body else would fit the part i don't think. The violence please I've spoken to people and they said this had no violence prior to me seeing it and there is enough blood it might not be the bloodiest movie but there's plenty to go round. Now for those who think that this is propaganda against the Persians from the US and for those who think that the movie depicts the Persians as some demonic creatures LET ME GET THIS THROUGH TO PEOPLE Xerxes was the ruler of Persia HIS ARMY WAS A MIXTURE OF 100 NATIONS FROM AROUND THE WORLD. So because he ruled these other nations i guess that those armies become apart of the Persian army. Now if your eyes work you can see Persians in the film and im quite sure that the narration tells you that these other soldiers are from other nations because Xerxes was their ruler. This bull crap of people saying its not accurate and this makes Persians look like barbarians and blah blah seriously back then how many different types of soldiers were barbarians or had barbarian tendencies. I still think people use this as ammunition to feed their twisted minds that the US brought this out as mere propaganda. That having been said im not exactly backing the US up im just giving my point of view WATCH THE MOVIE IT IS AN AWESOME FILM I WAS TOTALLY JACKED UP AFTER THIS AND MAKE YOUR OWN MIND UP ALL THE CRAP I HAVE READ IN PAPERS AND ON THE NET MAKE ME SICK SOMETIMES."

","First off, do not, I repeat, do NOT listen or read the comments by these stupid simple minded liberals. All they can do is bitch and moan about the historical inaccuracy, the fighting, the alleged political propaganda, and the lack of plot. Rest assured, these people are the dumbest people on the planet. I didn't see them complaining when Michael Moore's vomitous mess came out years ago. Anyways, this movie was probably the most brilliant movie ever made. Of course it was historically inaccurate but it was supposed to depict the main idea of what happened between Greece and Persia. The acting by the guy who played Leonidas and the one who went to tell the story afterward was in short, amazing. I can't say anything about the graphics, slow motion, and the music because I was absolutely stunned when I saw it for the first time, and have been stunned every time I've seen it since. The word ""revolutionary"" doesn't even begin to describe it. This is a must see for anybody who is a true fan of movies. I'm not saying this is the best movie ever made but I have never seen a movie like that.

"glennsouthall","6","5","11","29 March 2007"," I make this review...FOR SPARTA!!!
","WOW!! Is this movie a testosterone junkies fix or what?!!? I gotta say that I came striding out of this movie firm of jaw and broad of chest looking for a little guy to beat up on....for SPARTA!!! Not finding one of suitable proportions I marched off home (stiff and upright of course) and roared at my wife to get my supper ready....for SPARTA!!! Once I had brushed all of the bolognese sauce out of my hair, I sat down to reflect on the movie I had just seen.<br/><br/>I was attracted by three things. Firstly, the 60's movie ""The 300 Spartans"" is on my top 10 favourite movie list and secondly the trailer for 300 looked great, promising to give a Lord of the Rings feel to essentially the same historical storyline. Added to that the same team provided me with my favourite movie of recent years, Sin City. So how could I not enjoy this movie!?! On the plus side. 300 is a non-stop feast for the senses, even though it is possible to over-indulge. The CGI is amazing, the comic-book feel is a delight, the battle scenes magnificently choreographed (I use this word because the battles were unusually dance-like) and the music score is supremely empowering without being imposing. The fantasy element a la LotR did not disappoint either.<br/><br/>All in all a very good nights entertainment.....however....very reluctantly (because I so much wanted this movie to be flawless) I feel compelled to mention a few gripes......<br/><br/>Even though there are one or two significant scenes with women, this is so overpoweringly a mans movie that they fail to redress the balance. Now this does not mean it cannot be enjoyed by women, but rather that its main appeal (intentionally or otherwise)is to a largely bygone male stereotype. Hence my reversion to Neanderthal Man as I left the theatre.<br/><br/>Next, and I gotta say it, the whole ""FOR SPARTA!!!"" thing was just a little OTT. By far the most dominant of the 300 Spartans was of course King Leonidas and his men followed him blindly, but wasn't he a little barking mad? That whole ""tonight we dine in hell"" thing certainly would have had me pondering whether he was one sandwich short of a picnic.<br/><br/>In essence, King Leonidas' going totally tonto in isolation would not have been noticed, but when the, shall we say ""idiosyncrasies"", of some of the other Spartans are added, then some parts drifted dangerously toward a Monty Python sketch. Sorry.<br/><br/>And finally in my little gripette. The most interesting character in this movie, by a country mile, is Xerxes, but far too little development time was given over to him. If I were Frank Miller, I'd already be outlining a sequel...""300, the rise and fall of the return of Xerxes rides again"". Guaranteed money-spinner.<br/><br/>Anyway, taken as a complete package, well worth the entrance fee and a welcome injection of testosterone.....I wonder if the wife has calmed down.....time for a little horizontal refreshment....FOR SPARTA!!!!!"
"TheUntamed2002","5","5","11","24 March 2007"," Eye Candy Left Me Hungry
","300 was a movie I couldn't wait to see. I enjoyed ""Sin City"", so I was looking for something in the same style. I left the theater feeling disappointed.<br/><br/>The look of the picture was captivating. It was similar to what was used in ""Sin City"". Monochromatic shots with accents of chosen colors at appropriate times was effective. The sculpted bodies of the Spartans looked like open house at a gym that puts steroids in their water cooler. Spartans are presented as the heroes in this story. It's the classic underdog story - 300 against a million. The theme appeals to most of us at some level.<br/><br/>Apparently nipples work to take attention away from awkward dialog. There are lot of nipple shots in this movie. When the Oracle writhes seductively on the floor while the disgusting black cloaked Elder licks her face, it's easy to forget what's being said.<br/><br/>Not that it matters much anyway.<br/><br/>Action is the King in this film. Slow motion sword fights with bloody severed limbs, a lot of yelling followed by more blood, and then a nipple shot. (Hey, they work.)<br/><br/>That's my problem with the movie. It's okay, but not great. Xerxes is the King of the Persian army who considers himself a god. He never really does anything that caused me to hate him or dislike him. He's an arrogant ass, but doesn't do anything particularly evil. He doesn't seem much different that the Spartans.<br/><br/>King Leonidas seems like a good guy. I like him on one hand, but he never really does anything to make me like him. In a few instances, I thought he was less than heroic. I could cite them, but I don't want to spoil the movie.<br/><br/>Unlike ""Gladiator"", I never felt an emotional connection to King Leonidas - the alleged hero of the tale. Xerxes never really does anything to make me hate him. In one scene, he won my admiration for his openness. In a graphic novel movie such as this, it's better to have memorable villain who's evil than to have a forgettable one who's kind of naughty.<br/><br/>So, I just let the fighting scenes wash over me like a slow motion dream. They were like a ballet spattered with CGI blood. At it's most primal, perhaps the slow motion violence of this film is what appeals to the audience.<br/><br/>That and a few good nipple shots."
"DSilv444","10","5","11","24 March 2007"," Visually beautiful, wonderfully acted film.
","This film is a visual feast for the eyes. Gerard Butler is superb as King Leonidas. The courage of the characters, their strength, and their message gave the film its integrity. The choreographed fight scenes and the special effects were a pleasure to watch -- due to the ""artistic"" vision of Zach Snyder. These graphic scenes did not have the disturbing factor that most war movies carry with them, because they had a heightened sense of visual artistry, making reality, fantasy, which cleverly softened the effect of the violence. The art direction and lighting were impeccable. I did not expect this film to be so beautiful. It is haunting. A film you will not soon forget. Zack Snyder did a wonderful job."
"beresfordjd","8","5","11","24 March 2007"," Surprisingly good
","My wife and I watched this with a cynical eye, fully expecting a video game writ large. While there was an element of that we were both surprised how involved we became in the story and action. My wife said(after the first battle) ""Its going to get tedious now!"" But she was hooked from beginning to end as the director cleverly sidestepped that trap. The film looks superb and the acting is pretty good. Butler as the king makes up for the lacklustre performance in Phantom of the Opera and is convincingly macho. I understand the cast spent a while beefing up for their half-naked roles.It is occasionally quite erotic in scenes involving Butler and the beautiful Headley (as well as homo-erotic). The battle sequences are beautifully staged and while bloody, are not gratuitously gory. Kudos to all involved in this. I am watching ""The 300 Spartans (1962)"" on TV this afternoon. I saw it as a kid and thought it was great. It will be fascinating to see the treatments side by side almost 50 years apart!!"
"brownj00","7","5","11","23 March 2007"," simple, loud, gory - and maybe important nonetheless
","Not much subtlety here. I thought the references to ""modern"" concepts and polities was a bit obvious- but you know what? This movie is aimed at young men and you have to be a bit obvious (two-by-four across the head?) to get through to most of them so I can't really fault the approach. You have to know your audience and use the most appropriate avenue. It still works for what I think it was intended to be. In the current age of non-heroes, relativism and selfishness, the story of self-sacrifice is still very powerful and perhaps even more needed.<br/><br/>Visually great, even if it was stylized to the point of distraction. Mostly special effects shots. Makes Gladiator look like a history PhD thesis for accuracy (and it wasn't). So what?<br/><br/>Gorier than it need to be (""sets a new standard"" which the next film will have to exceed. Ugh.) and anybody that takes an 6 year old to this film should be smacked. Sex, almost-rape, nudity, decapitations, mutilations, etc. Everything you don't want kids to see unless you are... well nevermind no need to be rude. Not as actually disturbing as something like Pulp Fiction or Sin City, maybe because of the setting and context for the violence.<br/><br/>The culmination? It was a major conflict between east and west in the ancient world with real impact. Something like this did happen and it is worthy of attention. If it gets young adults to realize that maybe the modern world with our western culture and all the (implied) benefits thereof hasn't sprung from nowhere well then GREAT, and overlook the technical inaccuracies. Not that the Spartans were role models, really. Probably won't be viewed in such a light by most however, perhaps it will intrigue some just enough. And maybe that's just wishful thinking of a middle-aged history buff who likes to think we enjoy a better existence and live in a better world thanks to western culture and ideals (compared to what most of the alternatives would have been). Feel free to disagree, I know many will. And hopefully this film will irritate you silly. Good. <br/><br/>It is likely to become a cult classic and have a following for awhile either way. Enjoy it for what it is or steer clear."
"cerulean_blue_2000","9","5","11","22 March 2007"," A work of art based on a work of art based on a work of art...
","This was a truly stunning movie and it exceeded my expectations. Every moment was a visual treat, and my jaw literally dropped several times. It really was clear to see that it's origin was graphic novel, as I could appreciate the composition and coloring of most every shot.<br/><br/>I want to talk about art. I'ts really clear by reading some of the other reviews that some people simply don't get it. I have read reviews criticizing the ab brigade, and the ""cartoony"" feel. Um... my advice is to plug this into Google: <br/><br/>Leonidas at Thermopylae, Jacques-Louis David (1814) <br/><br/>I am sure that any artsy type will be pleased to agree that David did ""cartoony"" paintings. They called them ""neo classical"" paintings, though, and they were all the rage to portray Greek events about 200 years ago....<br/><br/>Its clear to me that Frank Miller was highly influenced by David's depictions of ancient greeks in his neo-classical paintings, and the movie, in turn, translated this influence to the screen. When *I* watched it, I had a nagging feeling I was watching a neo classical painting come to life - I was aware that the color corrections and shadows were intended to invoke this feeling.<br/><br/>Back in the 80's someone did a music video of a painting come to life - paintings have different shadows than real life and they had to paint the people in this kind of an exaggerated shadow in order to get real people to resemble painted ones. The end result was amazing - everyone ""oooh'd"" over it. So they do the same thing in this movie but it seems not many got that its supposed to invoke the feeling of a neo classical painting, its not ""bad color correction"" lol! Oh DOH! Hey, MAYBE they did that on purpose.<br/><br/>Complaints about caricatures and simple dialogue are just silly. It's a graphic novel! How much dialogue and depth do you think they can fit in a graphic novel? Its not like you can fit a 4 page dialogue in one of those squares. Graphic novels by necessity are more art and less story.<br/><br/>And complaints about racism? Again, I direct you to our famous dead artist, Jaques Louis David, who spent a lot of time painting white greeks. It is just how it was done back then - and even before then. Da Vinci painted a white Jesus in one of the most famous paintings of all time. Do you think they intended any insult to people of our time? As for Persians being portrayed as bad guys...were they not at that battle? Were they not trying to take over Greece? To greeks, they *were* the bad guys. That's how ""conquering"" works. If you are the ""conqueree"" the ""conquerer"" is the bad guy. To other cultures, Xerxes was a hero - but this story is not from the perspective of one of those other cultures. I don't get how this is an insult? Is it not historical fact that persia tried to take over Greece? <br/><br/>Silly for people to get all offended over something like this. Its obvious the movie was based on a graphic novel - not real life. The novel was based on an ancient and famous battle. This is a Greek heroic story and it was undoubtedly a conscious choice on Miller's part to execute it in the same neo classical style used over a hundred years ago to portray Greek heroic events. This is actually ""fitting"" and quite brilliant from an artistic standpoint.<br/><br/>Most of the complaints I see - lack of clothes, abs, color correction, rascism - are made by people who have clearly never seen neo classical art, don't understand the concept of ""influenced by"", and cannot appreciate or understand what Miller did and how he did it. *All* these things are marks of a certain ""style"" for portraying Greek stories which was used 200 years ago - and what you see on the screen is a faithful reproduction of a graphic novel which used a lot of that style.<br/><br/>This movie IS a work of art. I appreciate it's origins and influence and am literally in awe of it. The only reason I didn't give it a 10 was because it's true, I didn't really care for the characters. I am not sure if thats wholly a flaw of the movie though...I might have been too busy picking my jaw up off the floor."
"nuvesta","5","5","11","21 March 2007"," Say Sparta 300 times & you have the script.
","For Sparta! This is Sparta. Like a Spartan. Spartan man, Spartan woman, Spartan land, Spartan movie, Sparta, Sparta, Sparta. (I wonder how many times they said Sparta?)<br/><br/>That pretty much sums up the dialogue of the movie. Due to the choice of using narration, it feels like you're being read a story from your grade school teacher the whole time. It makes it more difficult to emerge oneself into the movie & reach a sense of disbelief. I have problems with it not being well defined where the lines are being drawn in a historical fantasy. What parts of the story should we take as recounting history & what parts do we discard?<br/><br/>A couple parts I had problems with were: 1) The battles were also not suspenseful, since the Spartans were very much like using a cheat code in a video game to reach God-mode status. Then without much resistance, the Spartans put nearly no fight at the end. 2) Sparta's stance on slavery & freedom wasn't well defined. Historically weren't the Spartans also slave owners of other Mediterranean nations? Was this something that we accept as not being true? Sparta wasn't known as a great symbol of freedom, so are we supposed to ignore the fact that they were slave owners? I felt the line wasn't well drawn in this historical fantasy. 3) Why was the final deal so horrible that it had to be rejected? The Persians offered to empower Sparta, so they'd rule the Athean nations (as they wanted), they'd be richer than before & they wouldn't be enslaved. All they had to do was acknowledge that the Persian king was a god. Why were they against this? For a country built on reason, they didn't outline this very well. 4) The Spartans worshiped these ugly old men as god-like beings, and also allowed their beautiful young Spartan girls to be enslaved by them. Isn't that inconsistent with their stance against the Persians?<br/><br/>I should also add that for me, plot & dialogue is something I weigh more in judging a movie than some others do. The visuals were outstanding, so I'd definitely recommend this to anyone who doesn't really mind a script of clich√©s. It's probably great to have on TV in the background while just doing something else around the house.<br/><br/>Finally I'd add that I think Frank Miller's Sin City adaption into film was tremendous (A-) and would easily recommend it over this."
"aubrey-clark","8","5","11","21 March 2007"," Didn't like the 300?
","Neither did I after my first viewing. I had just come of watching This Film is Not Yet Rated on DVD, and I was a bit jaded for gratuitous violence.<br/><br/>300 is a fairly decent film I've decided. What it lacks in the quiet dramatic passion seen in Heston-style historical films, it makes up for in visual acuity and battle sequences which speak volumes. You become aware quite quickly what it means to be Spartan, and when that is taken in the context of a world in which 'Conqueror' is more than a WOW handle, it soon becomes apparent that violence is also far more than an ingredient which the MPAA rarely chastises with NC-17 ratings. It is the 300. It is Sparta. And that makes it relevant, not gratuitous. Which is why I realized the 300 isn't the mediocre film it is being made out to be by people like myself.<br/><br/>I advise whomever reads this to do as I did not: Go watch 300, but check your preconceived notions at the door."
"autumncovington","Null","5","11","21 March 2007"," Graphic Novels and Their Effects
","It's absurd how many people are forgetting that 300 is based on a graphic novel, a comic book. One of the major parts of a comic book is to glorify the hero and discredit the villains. All Frank Miller did was write a comic book that told a story in a legendary way. Yes he built the Spartans up to be some kind of super human army, and yes he portrayed the Persian as vile scum trying to take over the world, but that is exactly the kind of story telling audiences of graphic novels are looking for. If anyone knew anything about the film and the novel, they would know its not supposed to be accurate. Its supposed to be a legend, and legends aren't always the truth. It was also written from the Spartan point of view. From that view point, the Persians were the enemy and they wouldn't have been seen as great people. They would have been seen as terrible even though it was not the truth. Its like when you're a kid and you don't like someone else on the play ground because they beat you at a game. They could be an amazing kid, but you will only see them as bad because you are opposing each other.<br/><br/>As for the criticism over the colors and lighting of the movie, they were trying to keep the graph novel feel of Frank Miller. The dramatic slow motion and speeding up had a very graphic novel feel. It was an amazing depiction of the graphic novel in movie form."

","I had great expectations from this one. I am a great fan of the old war movies like LOTR, Troy, Alexander, Jason and the Argonauts etcetera. This fictionalized account of the Battle of Thermopylae could have been much better. The special effects are OK, when compared to movies like The Lord of the Rings. The acting is mediocre, the story is not captivating and there are too many slow motion action scenes. I got the impression that the makers of this movie are trying to sell it only for its violent action scenes and nothing else. The movie might have been OK if a few recognized actors were part of it. And if only the screenplay and dialogs were a little better. I felt it was a total waste of time."

","Let me start off by saying that this film was getting a lot of good reviews and excellent praise. Just like The Departed. Okay direction. Pretty good cinematography. Good visuals, boring film, lots of TALK TALK TALK, and then they get to the fighting and the fighting is uneventful. The trailer's awesome, but the movie is mostly boring. The Best War Movie is Saving Private Ryan and it always will be. I only recommend it to people who love war movies on matter what or are fans of the actors or the director/writers. Bridge to Terabithia was excellent though. Disney's trying to make it LOOK like Narnia or something, but it's more about these kids and their lives, with not a whole lot of 'fantasy' CGI stuff.

It's a classical masterpiece. <br/><br/>It depicts the passion and the bravery a free man can achieve, only by being free and fighting for his rights. <br/><br/>In a world where people kill for money, in a world where the ideas of brotherhood, righteousness, ethic, honesty and religion tend to be overwhelmed by a constant perversion of every aspect of life, the Spartans show us the way. The only way. The way of Virtue, just like the one Hercules chose to walk.<br/><br/>In Greece we have a word for it... ""dobrosini"". Can't be translated exactly in English but ""directness"" is the meaning... Being honest, and straight. Abiding by the laws of virtue and being immovable when defending them.

","Absolutely remarkable movie! I can call it nothing else but simply sinful for the eye. This was due to the excellent graphics and skilled design in filming this movie. And also due to the amazing acting done and the beautiful characters developed in this story. I couldn't peel my eyes away if you asked me to. I am personally a sucker for epic movies. The ones that make your heart race, your eyes tear up, your fingers clench around the arm rests. The movies that make your hands fly upon your eyes because you can't bring yourself to watch it out of sheer fear, but you still leave a gap in between your fingers cause you just gotta watch it. And 300 did exactly this for me.<br/><br/>The Spartan culture was captivating and not of the norm. The actors were full of talent and raw emotion. And when he yelled, I could feel it. Every fight scene is breathtaking for the action lover. The Spartan's skill in battle is so fluid and captivating. AMAZING! I don't want to spoil the plot line, so I won't say much more. But no matter if you love action movies or chick flicks, this is one of those movies that you just can't leave behind. And the visuals will stick with you long after this amazing 2 hours. Personally, approximately 30 seconds after the movie ended, I turned to my friend and said, ""wanna see it again?"" And I haven't had that reaction since Under the Tuscan Sun. It was brilliant!"
"ace_m","8","5","11","13 March 2007"," ""300"" Presents a Glorious, Action-Packed, Stunning Slice of Greek History
","At first sight the splish-springing blood and hyper-gory violence in 300 may seem cartoon-like and excessive to some. But this is only because the film is based on a graphic novel. Thus, it is indeed appropriate for the graphic-novel turned feature film scheme.<br/><br/>This film is one you can literally call a ""picture."" The Larry Fong's cinematography in this absolutely movie stunning. Everything from the ebullient field's to the soldier's pewter-gray shield's to the rustic golden sun rays which occasionally shine through this hardened film give the film a uniquely polished look. It' as if Frank Miller himself painted each frame.<br/><br/>The actor's own appearance will stun you as well. All the lead actors spent rigorous months to make their bodies look as though they were chiseled by Greek sculpters. The women are of course beautiful and breathtaking as well (though I don't think the female leads spent as much time in the weight room as these actor-turned-body-builders did.) At the start of the film, the characters did not seem believable. Gerard Butler and the modern, colloquial verbiage seemed out of place for a period piece. But as the movie progressed, the acting and the speech seemed more believable. When he Butler's Leonidas proclaims to the Persian messenger ""THIS IS SPARTA!"" you can't imagine him saying it any differently, such is the power and conviction of his voice.<br/><br/>The film is very accurate historically as well being quite realistic irrespective of the fantastic artwork and special effects. Besides a gnarled monster or two and the strange absence of food or water supplies for the soldiers in between battles, everyone and everything looks believable, and most importantly all the key plot points check out on the historian's checklist. These particular war-obsessed ancient Greeks really did ""discard"" many weak-looking male babies and all disfigured ones. It really did happen as like the citizen-type selection process in Antz (at birth, the male baby ants in that film were either given spears or hammer's, signifying them for either the soldier or the worker-ant life).<br/><br/>I found it inspiring, and I immediately thought of the soldiers who choose to enlist (and sometimes fight) in our army. Without them (and the laws that banished the draft), many would have to join up and fight against their will. The few and the proud these mighty Spartans are, indubitably."

"XFLRWF","9","5","11","12 March 2007"," ""300"" Brings Old World to New Light
","The thunderous sound you hear is not the film's booming soundtrack. It is the sound of 300 Spartan soldiers marching forward to do or die for their country. This inspiring image is just a small sample of the visual feast that director Zack Snyder presents in ""300."" The film, based on Frank Miller's graphic novel, details the battle of Thermopylae in which 300 Spartans warriors stood against over 100,000 soldiers of the Persian army. Snyder's vision is brought to life by the talented cast led by Gerard Butler. The cast does not merely bring out the viciousness of the soldiers but the nobleness and dignity of fighting for and defending one's country.<br/><br/>The country of Sparta is protected by the most skilled and trained warriors of the ancient world. When the self proclaimed god-king Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro) leads his Persian army to conquer the world, he wants Sparta to submit an offering as a symbol of allegiance. Valuing the importance that they are a free nation, King Leonidas (Gerard Butler) leads 300 of his best soldiers to battle against Xerxes' massive army. With the odds tremendously stacked against Sparta, the soldiers fearlessly fight against Xerxes' tyranny for their home and country.<br/><br/>Snyder has a wonderful gift of storytelling. He gives the audience all they can handle and does not hold anything back to show the gore or ferocity of the battles. By capturing many of the battle moments in slow motion, Snyder gives the audience the full strength of each kill, each swing of the sword, and each throw of the spear. Another strong point of Snyder's direction is his choice of a dark colored background for much of the film's settings. This assists with setting the mood and tone of an early time in human history and furthers the ominous task at hand for the Spartans. After showing the tremendous battles, Snyder lets the audience catch their breath by reminding us there is a side plot on the homeland. However, when that story comes back into play, the audience is caught off guard as that plot is practically forgotten. In this one weak spot, Snyder would have served well to integrate the two plots better rather than going 90% battle and switching to 10% story.<br/><br/>Gerard Butler is great as King Leonidas. He is not simply a barbaric, warrior-king. Instead, Butler presents him as loving, thoughtful, and patriotic. He shows the complexity of Leonidas when wrestles with the decision of fighting an impossible situation. Although Leonidas is a skilled warrior, he does not go to war simply because he wants to fight. He fights because he is protecting his country from a force that is threatening his land and his people. In battle, Butler shows the other side of Leonidas: ferocious, cunning, and merciless. Butler attacks his enemies with such fervor that there is little wonder why his men follow him. He instills in his men a pride that he feels of himself and Sparta that they are willing to die for their country and their leader. He does not need to say much to motivate his men as his actions are more forceful. Rodrigo Santoro really brings out the arrogance and ego in Xerxes. As Xerxes, he portrays the conviction that he is a god that it is almost believable that Santoro thinks this of himself. Santoro accomplishes this in the way he carries himself and the words he chooses to describe his actions. He feels he is kind and benevolent and it would be wise to surrender than battle a god. As Queen Gorgo, Lena Headey does not simply sit at home worrying when her husband will return. Headey is just as headstrong as her husband and her convictions are just as tough. What she lacks in physicality, she more than makes up for with his shrewdness and intelligence. The film is also backed by a great supporting cast including Dominic West, David Wenham, and Andrew Tiernan. Whether narrator, soldier, or villain, each actor leaves an impact with their limited role on the screen.<br/><br/>Pure and simple, ""300"" is a sumptuous visual feast. Director Snyder throws in everything that an audience could possibly handle and leaves them wanting more. The writing trio of Snyder, Kurt Johnstad, and Michael Gordon supply a very straightforward script. They stick mainly to the battle sequences and do not rely on unnecessary clich√©s of motivational speeches. ""300"" is backed by an incredible cast who bring the fantastic old world to new light. By the film's end, the booming you hear will not be the soldiers marching but of your own heart pounding.<br/><br/>GRADE:A-"

","A good movie. Certainly not one for the squeamish. Even I, and avid horror movie guy, was tempted to turn my head a couple of times. This is by far the bloodiest, most violent movie I've ever seen. There are some flaws in the story (Read Herodotus' ""The Histories"" book seven to get the real story) but, overall, the story has some solid historical truths. As a ancient history teacher, I believe this is an appropriate movie to watch. Unfortunately, my students are too young to watch it. If you value things like honor, duty, and others you will find this to be a very heroic story. I like trying to take movies and applying to the present. There was a message in the movie for Ted Kennedy, and the other leftist zealots...""Freedom is not free"". It wasn't in c.590 B.C. and it isn't now."
"truerock2","7","5","11","10 March 2007"," A visual art movie with the bonus of action/adventure
","If the idea of Spartans battling an overwhelming Persian army in 480 BC sounds interesting to you - then I think you'll enjoy this movie. I enjoyed the movie immensely and as an action/adventure film it met the requirement of increasing my adrenalin level.<br/><br/>I was hoping for something that was good as or better than the 1964 film ""Zulu"". I was disappointed in that respect. There is something very primal about holding off an overwhelming enemy while ensconced in one's ""fortress"". I think the 1971 film ""Straw Dogs"" struck that primitive part of the psyche. A more recent film (of a lower caliber) that played on this aspect of the human psyche was ""Starship Troopers"" - where thousands of giant grasshopper-like aliens attacked a military base. But, this is me saying that ""300"" wasn't the film I was hoping for ¬ñ which of course is essentially irrelevant.<br/><br/>It seems evident to me that director Zach Snyder was not reaching for the ""Zulu"" genre. This was a movie designed to create a visual artistic atmosphere based on Frank Miller's graphic novel. In that respect, in my opinion ¬ñ Zach Snyder was extremely successful. The acting was very good and enhanced the overall impact of the visual art.<br/><br/>To summarize my opinion: Story/plot: good, Acting: very good, Action/excitement: good, Cinematography: excellent<br/><br/>I'll follow my entertainment oriented comments with a little social commentary. I was somewhat interested in what types of non-artistic related reactions the ""300"" would evoke. I guess I wasn't entirely surprised to see an extremely harsh review of the film by the New York City weekly tabloid ""The Village Voice"":<br/><br/>""On first glance, the terms couldn't be clearer: macho white guys vs. effeminate Orientals. Yet aside from the fact that Spartans come across as pinched, pinheaded gym bunnies, it's their flesh the movie worships. Not since Beau Travail has a phalanx of meatheads received such insistent ogling. As for the threat to peace, freedom, and democracy, that filthy Persian orgy looks way more fun than sitting around watching Spartans mope while their angry children slap each other around. At once homophobic and homoerotic, 300 is finally, and hilariously, just hysterical."" <br/><br/>In this film, the Spartans (and their culture) are good and the Persians are the bad. You may want to avoid this movie if you feel that plot premise is not acceptable to you."
"deltajuliet","10","5","11","10 March 2007"," Orgasmic
","300 is a plethora of awesomeness. Awesomeness that only magnificent testosterone-driven battle scenes can deliver. And deliver they did! Oh, how the blood and limbs fly! I'm not a sadistic violence-loving fan of Hostel or anything, but while watching 300 I was constantly bloodthirsty for more. More of that awesome regular-mo/slow-mo Persian ass-kicking that Gerard Butler proved to be great at. Every battle scene was a superb montage of blood and guts, interlaced with Persians falling off cliffs and Butler and company shouting chilling battle chants.<br/><br/>300's cinematography was dazzling, although much of this was more post-production work than camera work. Nonetheless, Sparta, wilderness, and the ""Hot Gates"" are all mesmerizing to look at: think a talented artist's depiction combined with realistic CGI to create surreal dreamscapes of an epic scale.<br/><br/>Undoubtedly, this film's selling point is its monumental action sequences, but I have to credit the acting of both Gerard Butler and Lena Headey, here, too. Butler, who I haven't really noticed before, is now at the forefront of my favorite actors. He's intense, serious, and unflinchingly awesome as King Leonidas. If I was ever to go into battle, I'd be happy to have him there. His character's wife, played by Lena Headey, was also terrific. Women tend to take the backseat in movies like this, but she played her character with strength and conviction, allowing her to shine in several of her scenes.<br/><br/>I was drooling for most of this movie. It was just so utterly amazing in a number of ways, especially, again, in its battle scenes. I'm confident that this movie will be received well for years to come, that it will age like fine wine. Red wine, if you catch my drift..."

","My movie fan brain tells me that this is not a good movie, in particular the dialogs and the casting (not the actors performances). In fact, this movie's flaws were Sin City's strenghts. I even called the film crap. But the guy in me loved it. In fact, it's the perfect testosterone movie: Greek warriors making homophobic comments to hide their own tendencies; considering diplomacy as a sign of cowardice; swords/spears/limbs and liters of blood; back stabbing politics; beautiful women; sex; rough sex; mindless yelling; cheap virile philosophy; cheap emotional speeches (us against the world); hiding feelings; fighting through pain (even a ""Monty Python Holy Grail black knight"" scene); dramatic score with a metal score for the battles (more manly). Shall I go on? In fact, the real achievement of this movie lies in it's visual effects (the CGI staff is from Qu√©bec). It's essentially CGI - comic style - but it's impressive. It is visually compelling to watch. I'm willing to bet 20$ that as soon as this movie is released in the US, ""for Sparta"", etc., will become the summer catch phrase and millions of guys (hmm, hopefully essentially teens) will redefine their notion of manliness and virility."
"Coventry","6","9","24","26 March 2007"," 300 against millions¬Ö I like these odds!
","First and foremost, ""300"" sadly is one of them films for which all the highlights already featured in the trailer. All of Gerard Butler's aggressive speeches (""Madness? This...is...Sparta!"" or ""Spartans, tonight we dine in hell!""), and all the Spartans' monstrous opponents simply aren't exciting anymore, since theaters have been playing the trailer since December 2006 already. Sure there are other encouragement speeches and other, less extravagant enemies to battle, but it's all pretty tame compared with what the trailer promised us. This is rather unacceptable for a hugely promoted epic blockbuster like ""300"". Cinematic events like this should be a non-stop series of excitement, spectacle and they should feature so much action it couldn't possibly fit in one trailer. Mel Gibson's ""Apocalypto"", for example, was a film that featured a constant level of adrenalin-rushing footage, and the trailer only served as an appetizer. Other than that, ""300"" is a pretty remarkable and visually impressive movie that'll certainly appeal to all fans of savage macho-behavior and slow-motion dismemberment sequences. Hollywood recently discovered a new prodigy and they're already exploiting all of his works. The unique style and giant success of Frank Miller's ""Sin City"" immediately resulted in a screenplay-adaptation of the man's other graphic novel ""300"", which revolves on the historical battle of Thermopylae, where a small army of 300 Spartan warriors defended their land and heritage against literally millions of Persian soldiers under the command of the greedy and self-declared demigod Xerxes. The Spartan king Leonidas encourages his troops, who were all raised as relentless fighting-machines, never to surrender and to give their lives for Sparta. Even though is a thoroughly unfair battle, Leonidas and his men nonetheless manage to seriously deplete Xerxes' armies. I don't suppose Frank Miller's outrageous depiction of this battle counts as an accurate history lesson ¬ñ unless the Persians really did recruit mutated monsters and giants as soldiers ¬ñ but it's a vivid image of ancient barbaric warfare. Fans of shiny biceps, muscled torsos and really loud yelling will have the time of their lives and they certainly don't have to bother about the racist portrayal of literally every country that isn't Greek. Exactly like in ""Sin City"", the actors simply had to pretend to fight in front of blue screens and the decors as well as the scenery only got added afterwards. It seems like this is becoming a new trend in cinema, because it increases the idea of watching a comic book that comes to life. It's not very realistic or convincing, but it offers the special effects team a wonderful change to experiment with surreal and grotesque tableaux and optical illusions. ""300"" is pure testosterone-driven entertainment, you just know to look for intelligent dialogs in this film."

There's a badass setup and then the film is basically a non-stop gore fest until the credits roll. The overabundance of monsters is distracting, as the novel had only one monster - the hunchback.<br/><br/>For the positives - Snyder wants testosterone-fueled buffed dudes to exhume the awesomeness portrayed on screen and he succeeds beautifully. The fight sequences are filmed marvelously and Snyder even started a trend of ""fast-mo"" editing, which after this movie got really annoying.

","Zack Snyder is probably one of the most divisive contemporary directors, with almost all of his movies completely polarizing the audience ‚Äì and his 2007 box office smash '300‚Ä≤ is no exception. I first saw this movie ‚Äì based on the Frank Miller comic book of the same name ‚Äì upon its theatrical release, when I was still a lad, and I quite enjoyed it (as an early teen, who wouldn't?). Fast forward 7 years, I decided to watch it again, to refresh my memory in preparation for the unnecessary sequel ‚Äì 300: Rise of an Empire. This time I wasn't as satisfied as when I first saw it. Actually, I thought it to be mindless and silly and I'm less enthusiastic about the sequel than ever.<br/><br/>'300‚Ä≤ loosely portrays the Battle of Thermopylae during which the Spartan king Leonidas (Gerard Butler), aided by 300 of his finest soldiers, stood against the mighty Persian empire, ruled by the self proclaimed god-king Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro) ‚Äì and that's pretty much the whole movie. Of course, there are some scenes depicting the Spartan way of life, and a subplot concerning Leonidas' wife, queen Gorgo (Lena Headey), trying to influence the Spartan council to send more soldiers to aid Leonidas, in spite of corrupted councilman Theron's (Dominic West) intentions too keep the army at bay, but all of this is utterly overshadowed by the movie's action sequences.<br/><br/>With its thin plot and extreme historical inaccuracy, it wouldn't be an overstatement to call '300‚Ä≤ a style-over-substance movie. Not that that is necessary a problem, but some people (including myself) may find the movie to be bland if they want something more from a movie, instead of excessive violence nearly all the time, and in return get senseless scenes and poorly developed characters (one of the more prominent characters, played by Vincent Regan, is only called and credited as Captain, and his only character traits are that he has a son, and is a captain). As for the movie's style, '300‚Ä≤ is most famous for its unrestricted use of slow motion, which, to be honest, does look impressive when used correctly. However, more often than not, slow motion is used incorrectly and in certain scenes is simply unnecessary. Due to this incorrect use of slow motion, quite a few scenes in the movie look like excerpts from some music video, which isn't a good thing.<br/><br/>'300‚Ä≤ definitely isn't a horrible movie. Like I said, some action sequences look truly impressive (which should be more than enough for action movie fanatics) and the movie does have the charm of a mindless popcorn flick. In fact, I think '300‚Ä≤ could have been more enjoyable and better if it had been somewhat less serious than it actually was. Without that little special something, '300‚Ä≤, in spite of its cool looking action scenes, some memorable quotes and characters, doesn't really stand the test of repeated viewings, at least not in my case.<br/><br/>Rating: 6/10 Read more reviews at http://passpopcorn.com/"
"wildamike","Null","2","3","7 August 2011"," Some good creative material, but too derivative, too repetitive, and too long
","This could have been very good, but in the end it fails. The comic book ""feel"" is fairly well done but after two hours of numerous artistic and technical flaws, it's just tedious. <br/><br/>Its supposed to be part of a ""graphic novel"" or ""comic book"" genre, and there is some really spectacular artwork. Scenes like villagers nailed to a tree, ambassadors thrown down a bottomless well and lurid battle scenes are well done. Horrifying, yet compelling. <br/><br/>But the battle scenes are repeated again, and again, and again, with long slow-motion sequences. From the time the Spartans reach the Hot Gates, Snyder just keeps hitting us with the same stuff. In ""Sin City"" he spends down time developing the characters so viewers can recharge their interest, but that doesn't happen in 300. <br/><br/>And so much of this is unoriginal. Many scenes are all-too-obvious rip-offs from Gladiator (note the wheatfield pathos scenes), Braveheart, Troy, any Kurosawa film (ninjas masquerading as Persian immortals!), and Lord of the Rings - many Persians seem to be copied from orcs and they even bring a large misshapen bald creature who could have stepped straight from Balin's tomb. I was waiting for Sean Bean to step forward and proclaim ""They have a cave-troll""!<br/><br/>There are also logical errors which distract the viewer ‚Äì these don't matter if covered with deft direction or scripting (as Shakespeare does so often) but Snyder doesn't manage it. Leonidas tells the deformed Ephialtes that he can't be a Spartan because they fight together in formation; yet for almost the entire movie the Spartans fight widely dispersed! And the blood ‚Äì okay, I can cope with gallons of blood being shed yet never a drop or smear of it on the ground; but when you can actually see the blood vanishing as it reaches the ground, its just a distraction. It doesn't do anything for the story or the ""comic book effect"".<br/><br/>And in a film with such heavy use of CGI, surely they could have blanked out Gerard Butler's dental fillings and Lena Headey's rubella vaccination scar?!<br/><br/>This is also a film where historical inaccuracy detracts from the experience. Its not a generic period film like ""the Vikings"" or ""Ran"", but consciously aspires to being a re-telling of actual events. So its all the more maddening that the producers get just about every historical detail wrong! The list is endless, but here are a few: * Thermopylae was not just defended by 300 Spartans, but by 10,000 Greeks, who all did as much frontline fighting as the Spartans. * After the Persians turned their flank, 1,000 Greeks decided to stay and die in order to cover the withdrawal of the rest ‚Äì less than one third of these were Spartans. * The bit where a Spartan derides the Athenians as ""boy lovers"" is hilarious (Spartans were as much into that sort of thing as any other Greeks of the time)! * Showing ephors as deformed pederastic priests is just bizarre ‚Äì they were actually respected retired warriors and leaders. * The Persian Empire did not send any envoys to Sparta before Thermopylae; the well-throwing incident occurred ten years previously and did not involve Leonidas, * The Persian Empire in general treated its subjects far better than the Spartans treated their subjects (perioiki and helots), and Spartans did not believe in ""freedom"" in any sense we would recognise today. * Greek hoplites of this period did not throw their spears * The Persian invasion force was eventually defeated in a sea battle, not the land battle at Plataea. <br/><br/>The problem is that you don't need to be a history buff to know this ‚Äì plenty of children study these things at school. My son's class were warned by their teacher not to take anything in this film seriously if they watched it!<br/><br/>Verdict: just too many problems to sustain this over 2 hours ‚Äì 3/10"

","Story: Not much to say. It's the classic story of the 300 Spartans, retold in the style of the Frank Miller graphic novel. It's perfectly adequate to showcase the awesome fights and visuals. Nothing earth shaking here, but it gets the job done. C <br/><br/>Acting: Gerard Butler is one of those truly great actors that disappears into a role to the point where you sometimes don't recognize that he's the same actor from movie to movie. He is great in this movie and deserves the lead role. David Wenham and Stephen McHattie are also really good in their roles. Overall, acting gets and A.<br/><br/>Direction: Zach Snyder is very quickly becoming one of my favorite directors. This one isn't as good as Watchmen but it's still very, very good. A friend of mine didn't like the movie, describing it as being ""very, very gay."" She was using gay to mean that it showcased lots of very pretty, muscular men acting as masculine as possible, not gay as in a generic insult from the 90's. Now, as a man who identifies himself as being a 2 on Kinsey's scale of sexuality, I don't see this as being a bad thing. Besides, there have been quite a few movies lately in which the only positive thing going for them would be lots of hot women in skimpy, skin tight outfits, so I see the pendulum swinging the other way as a positive. B <br/><br/>Visuals: What can I say about the visuals beyond that they're truly awesome? This movie has some of the best sword play I've ever seen. The switches from slow motion to regular speed create an epic effect of showcasing just how fast these guys are moving but also allowing us to see the details of their movement. A <br/><br/>Overall: This movie is lots of fun. It's not realistic at all and doesn't try to be. See it, unless you're a history major who would be offended at how historically inaccurate it is. B"
"moviesleuth2","8","2","3","17 December 2009"," Visceral and Awesome
","The best thing about ""300"" is not the jaw-dropping visuals, not the muscle-toned heroes or the gorgeous women, nor is it the story. The best part about ""300"" is its visceral enjoyment factor. You gotta love a movie where the characters don't just kick ass and take names, they thoroughly enjoy doing it.<br/><br/>The film is about the Spartan King Leonidas (Gerard Butler) who takes 300 of his best soldiers to hold off the Persian advance. Meanwhile, back at home, his beautiful wife, Queen Gorgo (Lena Heady) is getting ready to appeal to the Council of Elders for sending more soldiers to assist Leonidas. But to that end, she has to get them to listen to her instead of Theron (Dominic West), the slimy Elder who wants the position of king for himself.<br/><br/>The first thing one notices about ""300"" is its visuals. They're spectacular. It's like a painting come to life. The people look like a mix between real and computer generated, but the effect works. The film is highly enjoyable on regular DVD, but it's even better in HD. In his late-written review of the film, Roger Ebert criticized the film for having all the Spartan soldiers be perfectly toned musclemen. He's missing the point. This is a highly stylized film, and having them look like that adds to the visceral enjoyment of the film.<br/><br/>The acting is solid, although unspectacular. Gerard Butler got his big break here as Leonidas. Butler is great as the warrior-king, and knows exactly how to play the character. The film is over-the-top in a very stylized sort of way, and Butler fits right in. It helps that he can scream some of the famous lines in the film, ones that are already going down in history. As his wife, Lena Heady is equal to him. She may be a female, but she's no meek housewife (as one Persian finds out the hard way). One immediately gets the sense that if she could, she'd be fighting right beside her husband. Dominic West is perfectly slimy as the traitorous Theron. Imagine the villainous alter-ego of Mark Wahlberg, and this is who you get. David Wenham is also good as the Dilios, who is also the narrator. He has an interesting voice, and it is used to great effect. Rodrigo Santoro is perfect as the androgynous, but no less menacing Xerxes.<br/><br/>Zack Snyder has a clear knack for visuals. Even if the story was dull, which it's not, it would still be worth watching just to see the visuals. His trademark technique of slowing an image down then immediately speeding it up is used very effectively here, and while he keeps the film over-the-top, he never goes overboard.<br/><br/>This is a very violent film, almost cheerfully so. A story like this needs to have blood, guts, and brutal finishing movies to have its effect. Thank God the studios realized this and allowed it to have an R rating. The film would have been ruined had it been neutered to anything less. It's a shame to think about how many films have been rendered inert from diluting the violence.<br/><br/>Historical accuracy was not a concern to Frank Miller (the author of the comic book which the film is based on) nor the filmmakers except where it suits the story. The film portrays Spartan culture very well, probably because it suits the story. The training of boys into men is very true, and the Spartans were ruled by a council of Elders (although since the council was made up of men who became too old to fight, West is too young to play the character, but never mind). Also, Spartan women were given a lot of freedom, and the portrayal of Queen Gorgo is reasonably accurate. More importantly, the film's version of how Spartans viewed military endeavors was also very true. The quotes ""they were taught that to die in battle was the greatest glory a Spartan man could ever achieve"" and ""Come back with your shield, or on it"" are very true of Sparta. The Persians don't fare as well, though. The actual number of Persians who fought at the Battle of Thermopylae is debated, and there certainly weren't any of the bizarre creatures that Frank Miller dreamed up. Not that this is a bad thing...<br/><br/>""300"" has everything an action movie should have. You want action? You got it. You want visceral enjoyment? It's here. Blood, guts, naked women and hot sex? Yup.<br/><br/>In short, ""300"" is a thoroughly enjoyable and unapologetically violent film that every guy will love."
"keremrs","5","2","3","21 November 2009"," A stunning videoclip and .......that's all!
","Before getting on with 300, I must remind to those who don't know, that the story -or even the scenario- was taken from the comic novel of Frank Miller (also the creator of Sin City), bearing the same name. Though being a great fan of him, I must admit that it is far from being one of his best works. The saddening thing is that he is also the executive producer in this feature.<br/><br/>The film has awesome visuality. Every single frame has photographic value and are well composed. One is awed by the beauty of each scene. The battle choreography is well planned and very vivid too. No need to say that the story is quiet exciting.<br/><br/>The thing I mainly disliked was the inevitable feeling of artificiality. The environment, buildings, sky, people...you can't help but be irritated by your own awareness that too much CGI or Photoshop was involved. Thus, you cannot really surrender yourself to the film and savour it. While watching my mind kept thinking if this was a deliberate method of Director Zack Snyder, creating a set decor-like environment and obtaining a theatrical splendour. But there wasn't any depth in the story or the directing to meet and justify this artificiality aura. It felt rather like a regular blockbuster ordered to a former director of photography. Director Zack Snyder has a superb taste for photographs indeed and I am afraid that is the reason why he overdid it, leaving any concern of making this a movie, rather than a very long videoclip of antique heroes fresh out of gym.<br/><br/>A sad thing that it is turning from ""trend"" to ""accepted mainstream"" to make films abundant with CGI or new visual technics and leaving the acting, the story, the ""meaning"" aside. 300 is another example. (On the other hand, thumbs-up for same director's ""Watchmen"") One other thing: How can we accept an invader eastern king to be portrayed as a pervert, psychotic, coward, mass murderer freak while it is generally just the other way around with an invader western king. In this sense I recommend ""Alexander"" by Oliver Stone to everyone who loves movies about heroes and invaders."
"smellthecult-com-1","10","2","3","18 September 2009"," Fantasy battle epic
","Quite simply, one of the best films I have ever seen. Based on a series of comics of the same name by the legendary Frank Miller , this is to historical epics what Sin City is to film noir. Inspired by the infamous tale of 300 Spartans holding back a mighty Persian army, this is more fiction than fact, containing a strong fantasy element that may come as as surprise. Sure, the characterisations are two dimensional, but this is not about great characterisation, simply bloodshed and mayhem. Possibly the most bloodthirsty movie I have ever seen, this stylises the violence in a way I have never before seen, whilst at the same time borrowing liberally from The Matrix along the way. Slow-motion slice and dice sequences are sprinkled into the battle scenes, and there is heavy use made of CGI, though for once this merely serves to enhance the experience, not detract from it. Huge battle sequences go on for minutes at a time, but not once do you get bored and, cleverly, the blood factor increases as the movie progresses. In the first battle, there is next to no blood drawn, but by the climax arms, heads and legs are being lopped off at will. Visually sumptuous in terms of costume, sets and backgrounds, this sits somewhere between the world of cinema and the world of gaming as, clearly, the events portrayed are unrealistic, but are no less compelling as a result. A superb movie."
"CherryBlossomBoy","10","2","3","1 August 2009"," The Art of Being Cool
","I was meaning to put the title ""style AND substance... but mainly style"", but you wouldn't even bother to read the article then. It might be true, though, but I think that style vs. substance nag comes from the same intellectual basket as does chicken vs. egg, and is therefore irrelevant.<br/><br/>Coolness is what ""300"" is about, same as ""Pulp Fiction"" was so many years ago. It's not about history or historical accuracy and certainly not about some balanced point of view on the events depicted. If you expected that look somewhere else. I would have expected that and probably be disappointed hadn't I firstly read the Frank Miller's comic book the movie is based on. And since I couldn't hold anything against artistic liberties Miller took with his work I would have been unfair to do it with filmed version either, because it's been done almost verbatim.<br/><br/>Needless to say ""300"" is visually stunning. Or cool, if you want. From color grading to direction to the use of CGI, there has hardly been a flaw. It seems Zack Snyder should be henceforth forced to direct as many epic blockbusters as possible since he obviously knows how. Scott, Stone, Petersen and others can retire. ""300"" is impressive, energetic, sexy, humorous, poignant (when it needs to be) and resonates long after viewing, in short a future classic. I won't go as far as to say this is the best movie there is, but to make it a classic it only needs to satisfy one criteria - to make one wanna see it again (and again and again). And it does.<br/><br/>Yet, there are people who are only concerned with inaccuracy and bias in content it presents. I have to defend ""300"" on that point because it just isn't fair. Why? Because it occurred to me that while the events at Thermopylae didn't go down exactly this way and the Persians most certainly weren't like those depicted - that's EXACTLY how Spartans would have seen them AT the time. It occurred to me that ""300"" is the Spartans' point of view on that part of history. That's why Persians are seen like monsters from hell, that's why Athenians are mocked as cowards, that's why you don't see other Greek nations battling alongside. That's perfectly in line with Spartans' well known arrogance and to this end the movie is an accurate portrayal of Spartans' mentality. The difference is you don't get to objectively observe it from by-stands, it pulls you right in the middle, whether you like it or not.<br/><br/>Other critics are worried about political weight of ""300"" in today's world. Some see it as a pamphlet against Middle-Eastern nations. But that's a shallow and ill-meaning view. It is, however, a perfect example of how each side sees the other in times of conflict. But, there is no politically correct resolution at the end in terms of ""we're all the same"" and ""lets hold hands"". I'd say it is so because the makers didn't give a hoot about contemporary politics and rightfully so - they just wanted to make a cool piece of cinema. But if they, by any chance, had politics in mind then I commend them for not balking in the end and playing safe. There are enough ""politically safe"" movies going around, this one punches you in the gut and doesn't apologize for that."
"politicon2003","10","2","3","24 November 2008"," A brilliant Movie with some Historical Flaws
","The setting is in the late summer of 480 BC as the Persian King of Kings Xerxes' vast army invades Greece and his fleet dominates the Aegean Sea. This happens ten years after the decisive defeat of King Darius'army and marines at the Battle of Marathon on the east coast of Attica).<br/><br/>The Spartans in the movie are depicted as hormone boosted muscular-bound grunts wearing diapers. In truth the classical heavily armed Spartan hoplites would have been muscular, lean and sinewy with beautifully proportioned bodies. As hoplites they would have been heavily armed with their weapons, helmets and shields but they would also have sported breastplates, shoulder protection and metal greaves on their limbs plus a short kilt. The Spartan women in the film are all beautiful. The Spartan Queen is particularly lovely.<br/><br/>One of my minor gripes is that although the audio is available in Spanish it is not offered in Modern Greek. It would have been very convincing for me to hear Leonidas speaking in Greek instead of English with a Scottish accent. Leonidas is much closer to Adidas when pronounced correctly with the emphasis on the last syllable.I winced every time it was mispronounced.<br/><br/>When the various states of central Greece appealed for help it was the magistrates who instructed Leonidas to lead a single army unit of 300 hoplites to scout out the Persian and if possible to stem their advance until a larger military force could be mustered from Sparta and other allied Greek states. The festival of Carnea was being celebrated in Sparta and it would have been risking the Gods' wrath I it had been abandoned.<br/><br/>The Spartan army unit 300 of heavily armed infantry (hoplites) were joined, as shown in the film by some of the citizen armies of the Arcadian Greek and others, including Thebans (whose bias is in favour of Xerxes was suspected) plus contributions from hoplites and other warriors who dwelt in central Greece regions close to the Hot Gates. Altogether there were 10,000 Greek warriors present at Thermopylae when the Persians first attacked and before the betrayal. When the situation became hopeless because of the betrayal , Leonidas told the non-Spartan Greeks they could return home. Most went but a few stayed to support the 300.<br/><br/>As to Ephialtes (a name derived from a mythical demi-god and the Greek for ""nightmare""). He was not a Spartan but a local from the Malian Gulf. According to Herodotus his motive was the gold the Persians offered him because he was reputedly very familiar with the local mountains and it was he who revealed the hidden back path to them.. There 's nothing in history to suggest that Ephialtes was a ugly hunchback, except perhaps his name.<br/><br/>Another rare distortion of the facts in the film is the presumed ability of the Spartans at Thermopylae to witness the destruction of much of the Persian fleet by violent late summer storms. Because this actually occurred off the coast of Magnesia (after the modern town of Volos) Leonidas could not have seen it happen even if he had a powerful pair of modern binoculars. However, he probably did receive news of the disaster as Magnesia although out of sight is not that far away.<br/><br/>After Thermopylae the Persians went on to suffer a dramatic navel defeat at Salamis near Athens in the same year. After that Xerxes had had enough and neither he nor any other Persian king was ever seen in the European part of Greece again .The final battle was at Platea in 479 in which the Spartans participated and the Persians were completely routed. While Greece suffered many subsequent civil wars and conquests from Alexander the Great, the Romans and the Crusaders, they were all European conquerors. The Spartans' heroic stance at Thermopylae some 2500 years ago was a major factor in this. Not until 1453 with the fall of Constantinople (Istanbul)was Greece invaded and occupied by any Asiatic nation again.<br/><br/>In short I highly recommend this film as entertaining , and maybe instructive, for most adults. It is probably too graphically violent for young children. The soft-core sexual and nude scenes are more likely to simply puzzle them and embarrass their parents but the violence, including very explicit decapitations and amputations with simulated Persian ""monsters"" will give most young children nightmares."

","Undeniably this is one of the greats, visually its a masterpiece with jaw dropping effects and mouth watering visuals. What made this film so good in my opinion apart from the aforementioned is the believability of the acting.<br/><br/>The spartan soldiers especially are all ferocious and dedicated to the scene. The acting is superb ranging from the philo-counsel men to the Persian soldiers. There is no clear weak link and what is particularly nice is the message the film projects and although subtly done and never preaching is still powerful, even in todays modern world that even 'the little guy' can have a voice even in the face of adversity."
"nowtheworldisgone","4","2","3","19 May 2008"," This is not a glory actually!!
","Well, it has happened lots of time in the movie industry that a director takes a side just like this one! And this is the one of those films, in which Zack Snyder seems to be prejudiced, and also in which the Persians are seemed like creeps!! This is not fair and it does not make any sense. <br/><br/>It is certain that this product is based on Frank Miller's Graphic Novel; however, I am sure that the general theme of that novel is not like this one. If truth be told, the action scenes are perfect; the visual effects are really fascinated, and the story is fluent but the all film is just biased. At least, the legendary Xerxes should not have been reflected like that.<br/><br/>I am not talking about the acting, it is also great but something is missing, something else should have been added to solve this paradox. In this film the enormous difference between the Persians and the Spartans can be seen very easily. While the Spartans are reflected as heroes, the Persians are reflected as aliens, freaks or monsters.<br/><br/>Overall, the director should have avoided reflecting the racist scenes. People, who think that; if the comic book is like this 'there is nothing to change the theme', are completely wrong because the problem is not that. The problem, however, is to annihilate all of the prejudices in people's minds because everyone knows that there are numerous of people who are affected by movies books etc. And movies like this make people close their eyes about the realities of life. The job is just to get rid of the egos.After,the glory will come to gather people...."
"EUyeshima","6","2","3","19 February 2008"," Unleashing a Massive Load of Testosterone in a Fancifully Gory Version of a Real-Life Battle
","In 480 B.C., the Battle of Thermopylae was a precursor of the more familiar Battle of the Alamo in 1836. Both were examples of how a small battalion of men was able to fend off a much larger army by a combination of resourcefulness, fortitude and sheer will. However, the scale of Thermopylae was far more dramatic as 300 Spartans under King Leonidas held at bay for three days over a quarter million Persians under Xerxes the Great. Directed with technical flourish by Zack Snyder, this visually elaborate 2007 action film is a fictionalized retelling of that momentous event as it was vividly envisioned in Frank Miller's 1999 graphic novel. Similar to the 2005 adaptation of Miller's ""Sin City"", a constant parade of striking, often gory images is what drives the momentum of the screenplay co-written by Snyder, Kurt Johnstad and Michael P. Gordon. However, unlike that story and more similarly, Ridley Scott's ""Gladiator"", a coherent narrative flow and a more involving sense of character development are lacking to a significant degree.<br/><br/>The net result is a stylish piece of juvenile pop entertainment but hardly more substantive than a typical Italian sword-and-sandal picture from the early 1960's. Things start promisingly as we are presented with a cursory overview of Leonidas' fate as King of Sparta when he is separated from his mother at age seven to undergo the rigorous training necessary to have the courage and bloodlust of a true leader. The problem is that Snyder keeps painting the story's mythological aspects with broader and broader brushstrokes. Dialogue takes on a contemporary, almost comical tone that makes it difficult to take seriously the gravity of the events depicted. The battle scenes, especially an overindulgent use of slow motion, are equally outlandish with the gore so exaggerated and figures so grotesque (like the Uber-Immortal) that it makes it difficult to understand or even care about the motivations behind the characters' actions. Everything is larger than life and so lacking in detail and nuance that all the actors can do is accommodate the over-stylized treatment.<br/><br/>The pumped-up, half-clothed bodies match up well with the comic book sensibilities on display here, chief among them Gerard Butler, who is ideally cast as Leonidas. It's not a complex role, but even with his distinctively Scottish brogue, he has no problem showcasing the nobility, stubbornness and mocking cockiness necessary to be leading such an audaciously fatalistic military strategy. Made up like a bejeweled NY-glam boy, Rodrigo Santoro seems less than a match for the commanding Leonidas as the seemingly omnipotent, seven-foot Xerxes. Better is Lena Headey as the Spartan queen Gorgo, whose devotion to Leonidas goes unabated in home front scenes, where she has to fend off the advances of the dastardly Theron while begging the state council to send more troops. The rest of the cast really doesn't register much beyond the epic film stereotypes they are playing, including David Wenham's obligatory turn as the narrator Dilios. It takes a certain artistry to provide grace and power to a story mythologized from a real event, but it appears most of the filmmakers' efforts lie on the surface.<br/><br/>The two-disc 2007 DVD package should make fans palpitate with glee. Disc One has the best extra - the constantly informative commentary track from Snyder with periodic contributions from Johnstad and director of photography Larry Fong. There is no doubt Snyder did a lot of research, and he is extremely forthcoming with the behind-the-scenes details, which in this case, is very helpful. Disc Two contains a lot of small extras, the most prominent being the mostly intriguing 24-minute ""300 Spartans: Fact or Fiction?"", in which Miller, Snyder and historians discuss the painstaking detail as well as the liberties taken with this interpretation of the actual battle. Another historically oriented short and a brief making-of featurette are also included, as well as a quick short on the translation of the blue-screen images. Miller is interviewed separately in one fifteen-minute piece, and there is a multi-chapter Web production diary, which seems to be a more common feature on DVD sets these days."

It was (to me) a cartoon and cartoons usually don't involve me emotionally. I saw it once, won't see it again, won't buy it, and won't recommend it. However, as the movie experience, like the music experience, it entirely subjective, if you loved it...more power to you. Enjoy. As for me, I would rather watch Tom and Jerry. I really hope this is not the wave of the future, as I will be breaking out my DVD collection much more often instead of going to the movie theater.

This genre needs to return to a grittier level. Troy was a disaster and were it not for Lena Headey so would this have been. The opening scenes of his exile in childhood are among the few good moments in this film. 300 is a comic book fan and teenage boys fantasy. But CGI should not make a film great film.

It was historically inaccurate, and putting in trolls, deformed humans, a 9 foot tall bald drag queen and elephant thingys made the whole experience just plain silly. There was plenty of muscles, nudity, yelling, and slow motion violence but the nod to Sam Peckinpah was not enough to save this turkey of a film."
"germrasputin","4","2","3","1 October 2007"," Great effects don't make a great movie--not even close!
","With all the hype and excitement around this movie, I was very much looking forward to seeing it. I had already handicapped the hype factor so as to not allow myself to go in with unrealistic expectations. First the good: ""300"" begins by setting the appropriate tone for the stark and savage culture in which the Spartans developed--warriors whom exist solely to kill their enemies and die glorious deaths. We get to see how King Leonidas first survives the warrior-selection process as a baby, then learns the art of combat from tough and unsympathetic tutors in preparation for his ascendancy to the thrown. Also, the special effects are fantastic. Unfortunately, that's it for the good. Now for the bad: While watching ""300"", the only thing that reminded me that I wasn't really viewing a computer game is the fact that computer games have better story lines! What made the movie so bad was that, after Leonidas kills the wolf to become a full Spartan warrior, the rest of the movie and dialogue are so completely incongruous to the starkness created at the beginning. The characters' speeches of fighting for freedom and rights--especially the ""Captain"" character lamenting that he never got to tell his son how much he truly loved him--were laughable and almost made me feel embarrassed for the film makers. If the writers had maintained the starkness of the characters ala ""The Road Warrior"" or ""Blade Runner"", I think ""300"" could've been included as one of those genre-defining classics. Instead, it struck me as a huge missed opportunity that will go down in cinematic history as a mere footnote about stylish effects. Too bad."
"ntsci","Null","2","3","4 September 2007"," Being a cartoon is no excuse
","I enjoyed this movie a little bit. My kids (boys) loved it. The story is OK, but predicated on the audiences willingness to see stupidity as heroic (never retreat, never surrender). Much of the story and the dialog were stolen from the 1962 film The Spartan 300. Much of the acting is massively overdone -- worthy of early episodes of Star Trek. The film is all done in dim colors to hide the poor quality of the set design. The costuming is ridiculous. It was mostly Spartan armor and strategy that gave them an edge over the Persians. Why are they depicted nearly naked? My main problem with the film is related to the gross historical inaccuracies. Yes its based on a graphic novel. But the fact that it is a live action version of a cartoon, sorry, graphic novel, is no excuse for being so historically wrong or for promoting racist attitudes towards the Persians.<br/><br/>Spartan's as freedom fighters! Gag. They were slave masters. They ruled with an iron fist. They practice eugenic selection on their own people in order to breed perfectly stupid warriors.<br/><br/>Persians on the other hand, freed slaves, allowed all ethnics groups to return to their place of origin (e.g., the Jewish people were allowed to go home to Isreal). In fact Persians are believed by some to have created the world first declaration of human right. In addition, they promoted the idea that all of the nations that came under the umbrella of the Persian empire, were equals... an idea that did not occur to anyone again until the 20th century.<br/><br/>Yes the Persians invaded Greece, but it was because the Athens was interfering in the Persian owned Greece states in Anatolia.<br/><br/>I wouldn't say the Persians were right to invade. I think the Spartans stand of the 300 was truly heroic, and saved Greece so that Macedonia and then Rome could take it over instead. The Romans incidentally greatly admired the Spartans for their discipline. The British also admired the Spartan coldness towards their children. Nonetheless it is instructive to recall that Sparta no longer exists in part because their harsh treatment of their children, their stupidity on the battle field (e.g., never retreat! what idiots), and the harsh treatment of their slaves the helots who revolted.<br/><br/>The thing I don't like about this movie is that it presents a complex historical event as a very simple conflict of good vs. evil and it has such a strong anti-Persian view. Most films have some underlying political content. In the original 1962 film The 300 Spartans the message was ""we Brits stood up to the Natzi, just like the Spartans stood up to the Persians, and we'll do it again if the Russians attack."" At the time the West was facing a real threat so creating a shield thumping rah rah film is excusable. But in the current context with the US as the preeminent superpower -- and the only real threat is terrorism (defined by military experts as a desperate war by the powerless against the powerful). The whole vilification of the Persians is inexcusable. It certainly does nothing to promote understanding of international politics or history -- indeed it does the very opposite.<br/><br/>That final speech about an age free of tyranny and mysticism really annoys me given the complete lack of freedom in the Spartan world and their adherence to a mystical ideal of the warrior.<br/><br/>They couldn't even get the skin color of the Persian right (they should be white or at most lightly tanned -- the Persian were Caucasian and speak a language's that shares many words with European languages such as Greek, German, French, etc.)."

","The story of the battle of Thermopylae sounds fascinating. It's a shame that the makers of 300 were more interested in blood and testosterone than in storytelling. For a movie that's partially about the power of a narrative and how certain tales endure over the time, this movie falls frustratingly short on these things. I wish they would have made this movie as a serious historical epic ala Gladiator, rather than something that plays as if it's the wet dream of a 15 year old boy who spends too much time indoors reading comic books and playing video games.<br/><br/>Every single line of dialog in the movie is spoken wit the same tone and urgency as William Wallace's cry of ""Freedom!"" at the end of Braveheart. Honor, fighting for a free Sparta, duty, never surrender, etc. When the fighting did commence, most of the battle scenes were filmed in slow motion. It was the kind of slow motion wherein the camera would focus on one particular part of the battle, and then whip over to another part of the battle which was also shown in slow motion. It's not dramatic, it doesn't draw out the tension of the scene, it's just really annoying. After a while I started watching the battle scenes with my finger firmly pressed down on the fast forward button. The slow motion got so annoying that I actually yelled at my TV at one point: ""Throw the damn spear already!"" I was grateful when the movie was over."
"dkw001","5","2","3","17 August 2007"," Fighting good, stuff added on not good.
","This is a challenging work to review because there are actually four different issues: 1. historical accuracy, 2. faithfulness to the source material (the 1999 graphic novel by Frank Miller) 3. the overall quality of the film, done largely in CGI, 4. and of course, entertainment, the universal requisite.<br/><br/>This is going to take some time, and I won't even try to avoid spoilers. Okay...<br/><br/>1. Historical accuracy: I have to give a big thumbs-down on this. The various other Greek factions that made the stand at Thermopylae aren't mentioned at all, the rigors of Spartan training are glossed over (we're missing at least two scenes from the novel which really drive this home), and not only isn't there anywhere near enough emphasis given to the Ephors, they're completely forgotten once the stupid tacked-on council subplot begins. I'm not expecting the History Channel, but taking this many liberties was disappointing.<br/><br/>2. Faithfulness to the source material: SOME of it is spot-on, particularly the costuming, locations, and overall feel of bloody melee. On the other hand, there were some...creative additions that I found pointless or just plain dumb (that Goro-from-Mortal-Kombat-esquire Immortal, portraying the Immortals as weird mutants, that sword-armed executioner...*ugh*), and the stupid tacked-on council subplot was just unforgivable.<br/><br/>3. Overall quality: This is where 300 shines. I'm still amazed by how perfectly it captured the essence of a relentless horde of warriors taking on a small, brave band; the opening charge alone is priceless. About the only thing I didn't like was the overuse of CGI blood, resulting in blood flying everywhere but not a single drop staining the ground; now *that* was just plain weird. Nonetheless, this is a film to be looked at an awed by, and in that regard it was a total success.<br/><br/>As for entertainment...<br/><br/>Liked: - The feel of the battle. Relentless. Chaotic. Bloody. Vicious. Horrific. Everything a massive clash of swords and spears should be.<br/><br/><ul><li>Costuming and set design; no effort or expense spared here. Really impressed by Ephialtes' grotesque body and Xerxes' mobile throne.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The choreography of the fighting. Amazing to watch, yet manages to avoid Xena-esquire corniness.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>All the little touches, especially the scenes of the free Spartan city. You truly understand why the Spartans would value freedom and defend it to the death.</li></ul><br/><br/>Disliked: - The stupid tacked-on council subplot, complete with stupid tacked-on politician (don't remember the name; I'll just call him ""Gratuitus""). Horrible, stupid, worthless idea. It's astonishing that, in a movie that's about war and fighting and dying, we'd need some cheesy courtroom drama.<br/><br/><ul><li>The gross inflation of the queen's role, which takes up ONE PAGE in the novel (because, y'know, she doesn't *fight*, which is kinda important). There is a time and place for feminist revisionism, and this was not it.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The complete downplaying of the Ephors' role. In the novel, *they* were the ones who tried to sell out Sparta to Xerxes, it was *their* edict that prevented the Spartan army from mobilizing, forcing Leonidas to fight with a paltry 300, and in fact, they symbolize everything that's wrong with the old ways of thinking. Here, they're seen briefly and promptly lost in the council subplot.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The needless overcomplication of the opening scene with the messengers (very simple and to the point in the novel), the death of the Captain's son (who's not named or identified in the novel...and the blood rage was all of two panels), and Ephialtes meeting with Xerxes in the tent (and anytime a hack-and-slash war movie needs *fanservice*, you know it's a sign of desperation). Imagine the time wasted on all this that could be used for...say, some more background on Ephialtes, who played a kinda important role in the whole battle.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Daxos, who's turned into a complete *moron*. (""Duh, where'd all deze ships come from? Cuz I saw doze other ships crash, an' dey can't have dat many ships, can dey?"") I know capturing the subtlety of someone eager to fight but with less zeal than a Spartan isn't the easiest task, but come ON.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Yeah, Leonidas is a loudmouth. I mean, I expect him to be forceful and all, but there's just *too* much shouting where it shouldn't be. (""THIS...IS...SPARTAAAAA!!!!"")</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Sex. I don't care how ""tastefully done"" it is, it's just an annoying distraction here (and more unnecessary screen time for the queen).</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Politicizing. *Completely unforgivable*. ""Freedom isn't free, so anyone who speaks out against war is at best a coward, at worst a traitor in secret, of which many examples of Gratuitus can be seen even now..."" Gag me with a pamula.</li></ul><br/><br/>So, in summary...well, read the summary line. No more or less that what you should expect from Hollywood."

","'300' can be located in the antiquity historical films genre that gave a few very good movies, just to mention 'Gladiator' and the TV series 'Rome'from the later success stories. Films in this genre usually succeed when they are true to the spirit of the times and the human dimension of the heroes and fail when they try to make a point and send messages that fit our times rather than the past. '300' makes all the possible mistakes already made in the bad category genre plus a few new ones.<br/><br/>The story of the battle at Thermopylae where the 300 Spartans faced the mighty army of the evil empire of those times is told in a bombastic manner, with off screen commentaries and heroes tirades that sound more fit to the parliaments nowadays. It would be an insult to the comics books to say that the characters have the depth of comics books characters. The whole representation of the different nations in conflict is full of stereotypes, and does not seem to care too much about historical details.<br/><br/>The only good parts in the film are some of the visuals, but even here what I read about the techniques used or invented to make this movie was more efficient than what I could see on the screen, maybe also because a wrong choice of the palette of colors that makes the landscape look in many occasions like some old-fashioned studio setting from the 50s - exactly what the creators of the effects intended to avoid. The fight scenes are fine, but fight scenes do not make a whole movie nowadays. As cinema '300' is a complete failure."
"paulo20","3","2","3","15 August 2007"," Watchable but still bad
","I gave this film a generous 4 stars but it's not one I would particularly watch again (except with the accompanying RiffTrax by Mike Nelson and co. - actually looking forward to that).<br/><br/>I enjoyed the comic series for what it was - it was well-paced and nicely illustrated - but this film failed to invoke the experience of the comics. There are some well-done action scenes (the film even manages to make a sex scene into an action scene, although it comes off as more amusing than erotic) and endless scenes of guys getting impaled, decapitated or whatever, but it's all very thin. There is very little behind it all, despite it being based on historical events. Even Braveheart (a movie I no longer appreciate as much as I used to) managed to instill its battle scenes with some weight.<br/><br/>Comparisons have been drawn between this film and a video game and they're not unfounded. Blood flies everywhere, but it's all fake and doesn't land anywhere. Impalements, dismemberments and decapitations abound but when the camera pans to the battle scene, nary a drop of the red stuff is seen anywhere. It's like the film cut costs by avoiding the use of fake blood. Whatever the case, it looks fairly silly and adds to the ""weightlessness"" of the film.<br/><br/>Then there are the beasts and monsters that appear in this movie, making the film something of a ""historical fantasy"" but they really don't add much to anything. For one thing, the CGI is terrible, notably for a wolf and some elephants. As for the elephants, they are described as being ""clumsy,"" so why should I care? There is a war rhino that is, of course, utterly ridiculous and an ogre's fight with Leonidas is just an all-too familiar rehash of recent cinematic melee. There is a thing with the cleavers for forearms that was just bizarre and I don't know what the story is with the goat-headed guy. These scenes are merely ""eye candy"" and don't add much else to the film.<br/><br/>The performances were ridiculously overstated, I thought, making the dialogue come off as cheesy. For instance, David Wenham, the actor who helped assassinate the character of Faramir in LoTR, was even worse here. He adopts an odd and unappealing narrative voice and just seems to go on an on, especially at the end of the movie.<br/><br/>And then there's the villain, who almost makes everyone else look better by comparison. Rodrigo Santoro's performance would be utterly laughable if it were not almost painful to watch. Why Frank Miller decided to depict Xerxes in the comic book this way, I can't say, but one can more easily overlook Xerxes' appearance there. Here it stands out like a, well, a bunch of fake body piercings.<br/><br/>I could go on and on, but I think the only way to see how bad it is is to watch it."

But the second the end credits hit my screen I said to my mate beside me, ""Wow"". I was wonderfully done with great portrayals from the actors and actresses. A good use of gore and it wasn't over done. But there was to many slow motions scenes the only good thing about them is they were used in very good places.

"orthodoxhedonist","5","2","3","30 May 2007"," Dumbed Down Braveheart/Gladiator Derivative Drivel is Shallow Eye Candy - Think ""The Cell""
","Spectacular cinematography and effects alone do not a movie make. Rife with historical inaccuracies, one dimensional archetypal heroes, a limp and woefully clich√É¬© plot, and an arbitrary use of the word 'freedom', this is one cheese fest that can almost be completely experienced in its commercials alone. While the acting isn't dreadful per se, the script itself does nothing to help the actors along. Fueled by bullet time slow motion, and hyper-stylized digital tints, it was much like watching a CG pilot of a movie yet to be fully developed.<br/><br/>The silliness begins but unfortunately doesn't end with the super model factor. For no good reason other than to apparently show they had all worked out, these Spartans went shirtless through battles. I suppose on the logic that their P90X bodies would somehow prevail over the much less attractive but more practical chest plates and armor actually worn at the time. Just when you're done trying to justify that to yourself in order to take these guys seriously for another hour, armies of lost LOTR orcs and cave trolls start appearing.<br/><br/>If you can stomach the inaccuracies (eg: battling without armor, monstrous mutations, time line of Battle of Thermopylae, the actual use of Mt. Taygetos and societal morality in general) what you're left with is an aesthetically pleasing but puerile recycle of Braveheart and Gladiator. To quote Kenneth Turan: ""unless you love violence as much as a Spartan, Quentin Tarantino or a video-game-playing teenage boy, you will not be endlessly fascinated (with 300)."
"mjrusso1","6","2","3","27 May 2007"," It's horrible and great at the same time.
","This film does not accommodate the thinkers of the crowd, nor is it one for the historians. ""300"", in all essence, is a man-movie through and through, not just for the alpha mentality of its battle-hardened Spartan men, but also in every other aspect from politics to the context of its sex scenes to the very simplistic, defiant and angry dialog. If there were ever a film that could define Rosie Odonnell's most ill perceived personal hell, this is it. However, it is not without a woman's scorn or influence. In a nutshell, 300 will leave you disgruntled if you demand political correctness, sexual equality, historical accuracy or believability from your movie experiences.<br/><br/>What this movie brings to the table is quite simple: barbaric mutiny displayed in epic proportions. It is full of psychological scare-tactics warriors would use to instill fear in their enemies, from massive walls built with corpses to a messenger that carries with him the crowned skulls of once defiant Kings. Couple that with the visuals and camera work that is nothing short of impressive and awe-inspiring and you'll have many reasons to like this movie.<br/><br/>That said, there are things about this film that will ruin it for you, in my opinion, and will prevent it from making the all-time lists of top movies made for men. There are a few instances where CGI is overdone to the point of cheesy. There are occasions where actors are forced to step out of character to accommodate a dialog that is surprisingly uncharacteristic of the roles they are playing, and it's very noticeable. There's also one scene that the movie had invested time to build up to, intended to be serious and inspiring, but when the scene finally comes the main actor seems to be on the verge of laughing about something that happened on the set, like a botched take.<br/><br/>However, even though there are just a couple of over-the-top acting moments and a few, very weak, two or three line castings, I cannot blame the acting at all. In fact, there's not only some good acting to be found in this film, but some of the most emotionally impactive acting can be found when there is no dialog at all: Testimony to the fact that it's just a horrible script meshed with several careless director oversights.<br/><br/>On a side note, using industrial-type music in the score, even though it's used sparingly, doesn't exactly help the movie either. Once this film becomes dated, it's going to be much worse.<br/><br/>Overall, you should go into this movie expecting nothing more than a lot of grim eye candy, valiant chest-beating and twisted concepts that would make Vlad the Impaler proud."

","I felt a bit uncomfortable as well after watching this movie. In this movie, bad and good were obvious. It was a blockbuster itself whose story line was very simple but which had spectacles. The thing that made me unpleasant most was that almost every evil was connected to ugly appearance. The Persian army which we-audience as well as Greek army- should defeat was close to monsters. The movie says in the aspect of appearance, the thing which looks nice like the blond guys of Greece is good, whereas the thing which looks ugly and almost disgusting like the Persian warriors is bad. It seems like the movie insists that we should fight against the ugly. It does not make sense, but it is very difficult to find out another reason 300 of Greek army fight in the movie. Why could not the movie makers show the reason they had wars more rationally? The Persian army must have had their own reasons that they could not avoid fighting like the Greek army did. It is not that they fought because they were uncivilized and unsightly."

","Based upon the Battle of Thermopylae, this movie is impressive in both it's pacing, carefully scripted dialog and visual images.<br/><br/>It is a testosterone laden movie boasting manhood and masculinity. Both heterosexual females and gay males should be pleased by the display of muscles flexing and skin. The script consistently sets up a one-two punch for dramatic impact and few of the words are wasted.<br/><br/>The story and the images are based upon Frank Miller's Dark Horse Comic book mini-series titled by the same name. The images and color palette on the screen come straight from the comic and it works very well.<br/><br/>With all this praise, you'd think the movie would get a higher rating from this review. Here are some reasons why it doesn't.<br/><br/>The story is very thin. It is essentially an excuse to show 300 men in bathing suits killing wave after wave of evil enemy. The setup isn't deep. The message of the movie isn't deep. The waves of enemies are intended to look more intimidating as the story progresses, but they actually look more stupid.<br/><br/>Like other Frank Miller projects which have jumped to the big screen, there is always a disturbing portrayal of women. This movie is not as bad as his others because it only shows the women as unfaithful or as lesbians. His part projects tend to display women as hookers, whores, or just plain trashy. It is the lack of positive female role models in his stories that tarnishes this work as well as everything in which he is involved.<br/><br/>The ending is not climactic. It is not poignant. It is not even clever. Given all the dramatic setup through the movie, it's actually very weak and anti-climactic.<br/><br/>Although I have no desire to own this or see it again, that may be simply because I'm not attracted to men nor their inner need to boast upon their manhood.<br/><br/>If the positives mentioned in this review are enticing to you, then clearly this movie is worth seeing. It is worth renting. It is worth buying the DVD. Otherwise hold out for a deeper more intellectual movie that has more respect for women and non-violent values."

","OK, i should state from the outset that i have been waiting to see 300 for several months, the trailers looked awesome, i think its fair to say i had high expectations. The reality unfortunately has left me a little empty. First the plus points: 1. Gerard Butler is superb, brooding, sensitive, authoritative, menacing remarkably all at the same time, his is the only standout performance in the movie.<br/><br/>2: Visually this is arguably one of the most consistent cgi movies ever made, beautiful scenery, brutal battle scenes, absolutely stunning.<br/><br/>Im sorry to say that is where it ends. The dialogue at times is cringe-worthy. The first 30 minutes had me wriggling in my seat because i was fighting to stop myself leaving. The effort to establish characters was rushed to the point where we only felt connected Leonidas and all the other cast were met with indifference.<br/><br/>Now my final complaint and for me it ruined the whole experience, the almost constant, intrusive and downright childish narration. If there is an Oscar for someone stating the bloody obvious it should go to the character who was forced to speak over several key moments with completely banal comments. Example, when Leonidas leaves for battle he sees his queen for the last time, we can see how they feel we appreciate how they feel, we know Leonidas loves her we know he is ever going to see her again the actors manage to convey this to the audience through their expressions and minimal dialogue. OK, fine, then we get some pillock talking over the top telling us how Leonidas felt like we haven't just experienced it. I got the impression the director did not either trust the audience to be intelligent enough to pick up on the subtleties or he didn't think the actors could convey any emotion without dialogue to accompany it.<br/><br/>I know the narration is in the past tense from the one survivor of the battle but it is supposed to fill in gaps and move the story on, not give us a running commentary.<br/><br/>I know it does not sound much but seriously it damn near ruined the whole thing for me.<br/><br/>Butler, and the outstanding fight scenes, by that i include the queens political fight back home, are the only things that persuaded me to stay put.<br/><br/>In fact how about remaking the whole thing with just music, turn it down when butler speaks then turn it back up again. Problem solved."

","300 is an absurdly silly film. That being said, it's one that really wants us to take it seriously, but to me at least, it fails to get me properly committed to the film's characters and paper-thin story-line. But hey, at least this movie is stylish. So very, very stylish.<br/><br/>Persians are trying to invade Sparta. Gerard Butler, king of Sparta, doesn't want this to happen. He gets together 300 fierce Spartan warriors to battle the invading Persians. That's your plot. There's few movies I can think of that are actually easier to follow; Memento or Mulholland Drive this ain't. There's a sub-plot involving Butler's wife doing stuff back in the city, but it's a side-story that feels tacked on. One of my biggest issues with the film is the way this added sub-plot frequently kills the pacing of the film, with the cutting between it and the main story never really feeling seamless. Maybe such unnecessary scenes could have been cut, and instead we could've got a bit more character development for the Spartan warriors. So we actually, you know, cared about them as they became attacked by more and more Persian forces as the movie went on.<br/><br/>Some would argue that the movie really doesn't need a plot because the style and action scenes in this movie are very impressive, but I think a compelling narrative and fleshed out characters would've helped make this movie more than just a decent guilty pleasure. I don't always like to compare movies, but I feel 300 does often try really hard to be Gladiator, so I might bounce back and forth a little between the two. Gladiator's actually one of my favourite movies of all time, and would probably even earn a spot in my top 25 favourite films. Like 300, it has thrilling action and a great sense of spectacle (it should be noted though that it is a bigger film than 300- it feels more like a traditional Hollywood epic), but it also had narrative elements that I thought were actually quite strong. I actually cared about Russel Crowe's Maximus (a great performance from Crowe, by the way), and I wanted him to get his revenge on the corrupt piece of work that was Commodus, played extremely well by Joaquin Phoenix. The film gave us a protagonist we wanted to root for, and an antagonist that we really wanted to see brought to justice, and therefore we become invested in the film, and this allows the inevitable final showdown between the two to be extremely intense. Add in a bunch of memorable side characters, notably those played by Richard Harris, Oliver Reed, and Djimon Hounsou, and you have a movie that's elevated from being just another brainless action-packed revenge film to something that I believe is a near-masterpiece.<br/><br/>Gerard Butler's King Leonidas is... slightly harder to care about. He's a fairly flat, slightly arrogant character- look at the way he just ignores his kid in the scene where he leaves for battle. Gerard Butler's no Russel Crowe either, and maybe a better actor could have injected some more likability into the character. And sure, Phoenix did ham it up in Gladiator, but his character was still believable in the film's context. In 300, we get a completely ridiculous central villain who is so over the top it becomes impossible to take him seriously. At all. He is one of the least menacing villains I've ever seen. Almost every thing about him makes me laugh- his theatrical poses, his slow motion yelling, his ""bling,"" his painted-on eye-brows, and his voice, which is about 3 octaves lower than you'd think it would be by just looking at him. Why's he so tall as well? Seriously, this is one of the silliest villains I can recall in any movie I've ever seen.<br/><br/>The rest of the characters are disappointing too- Lena Headey plays the queen as a cold, boring woman, rocking the same facial expression throughout the entire movie. Dominic West is underused here too; he just kind of lurks around making creepy advances towards Headey's character. A few of the 300 Spartans get some character development too, but it's all pretty limited.<br/><br/>I guess I'm being too negative here. There are things about this movie I like, so I'll just finish off the rest of the negatives first. The narration is forced, mostly unnecessary, and goofy as hell. The movie has some humour, but I often can't work out what's intentionally funny and what's unintentionally funny. The slow motion usually works, but sometimes feels gratuitous.<br/><br/>But sometimes this movie can get pretty cool/fun. You can say what you want about the acting, the script, and the lack of truly compelling characters, but Zack Snyder really does inject this film with a whole lot of visual flair. Without the unique style, this film would be almost worthless, and it's the film's main saving grace. It really does look like a comic book in motion, maybe not to the extent of Sin City (a much better film in my opinion), but close. Also, the actions scenes are awesome, and there's quite a lot of them after the first half hour or so. Slow motion, blood spraying, limbs flying everywhere, Persian bodies piling up- it's a spectacle of carnage, and may well have to be seen to be believed. If you go into this film hoping to see a number of awesome, large-scale action sequences, you won't be disappointed. When this movie shows fight scenes, it commits. Those slow motion long shots that show the Spartans advancing towards the Persian forces, dispatching them as they continue to walk, are pretty awe-inspiring. Also, the ending to this movie I'll admit is pretty good. It's meant to have a fairly profound impact on its audience, I think, and it didn't shake me to my core or anything, but it worked. It was a pretty strong ending to the film I guess.<br/><br/>So, final verdict? This movie's a bit of a mixed bag, with strong action scenes and direction, but unremarkable story-telling, characters, and acting. How much you enjoy this movie will probably come down to how much you enjoy its unique visual style, and that is honestly completely subjective. So give it a watch, and even if it's a movie you hate, at least it'll be good for a laugh. I mean seriously, the ""TRAITOR! TRAITOR!"" scene is Monty Python-esque. So does 300 work as an action movie? Definitely. Does it work as anything more than that? Not really, which is why I can't enjoy it as much as Gladiator, or, to a lesser extent, Braveheart. It's kind of on the same level as Troy: dopey, silly, and shamelessly promoting style over substance. But hey, that's not always a terrible thing, right?"

"brando647","9","1","1","29 December 2009"," Snyder/Miller's Stylish, Bloody Battle Epic
","Here we having an epic winning combination: Zack Snyder (the 2004 re-imagining of DAWN OF THE DEAD) and Frank Miller (SIN CITY) collaborating on an epic action film based on historical events. The film adapted from Miller's graphic novel and, as I've discovered, Snyder was as accurate as possible while using the novel itself for the film's storyboards. In doing such, he has managed to capture the style of the source material perfectly and bring it to life. The film depicts the Battle of Thermopylae in which King Leonidas of Sparta led 300 soldiers against 1 million Persians, led by Xerxes in his quest to further expand his empire.<br/><br/>The first thing I should mention (and I'm surprised I should even have to mention this): this is NOT a documentary and therefore is NOT 100% historically accurate. I've seen others slamming the movie because the film does not depict the events with complete accuracy. This is a film based on Frank Miller's stylized envisioning of the battle and it is a fiction film. So, watch it for fun and not for a research paper and you're in good shape. This film is a blast, loaded with stylish battles against in which the Spartan warriors take down everything the Persians have to throw at the Spartans, everything going well until they are ultimately betrayed. Bloody violence, hideous creatures, and slow motion to emphasize all the right moments...this is probably my favorite sword-n-sandals battle.<br/><br/>Gerard Butler is King Leonidas and he shows his potential to become one of modern cinemas great action stars. His Leonidas is a gritty, honor-driven warrior who is still able to show tenderness to his wife, Queen Gorgo (the beautiful Lena Headey). The majority of the supporting cast are interchangeable and you'll find yourself unable to determine who's who under the helmets and capes, though Rodrigo Santoro is an imposing presence as Xerxes. So, if you're in the mood for a creatively violent two hours and you're a fan of Frank Miller's storytelling, 300 will not disappoint."
"Ziya90","5","1","1","25 November 2009"," Action and entertainment are 10/10, content and script are 0/10
","When I watched the trailer 0f 300, I was shocked and thought that it would be an unusual, unconventional and in a good way weird movie. In fact, yes, 300 is very different from many epic movies, but only in terms of action and a few shots. Almost the whole movie consists of perpetual action scenes which is great. To me, this is a very important step for action cinema. Alexander the Great, Troy, Kingdom of Heaven, Gladiator, there are much more action in 300 than all these movies. However, the problem that makes 300 very very disappointing is the script. There are some bizarre details firstly. For instance, blood of Persians spills in pitch-black. I think that may be, Zack Snyder had not wanted to make the movie censored or the movie tries to mention that Persians are evil by nature! It is clearly seen that the color of blood of the Persians in the movie is black! Whatever the reason, it looks annoying. In addition, the visual effects, especially blood effects would have been realistic, but in some parts, the movie looks like a computer game, visual effects are shockingly superficial and I cannot see any reason for it. Why? How could they release the movie like that? Spartans slaughter Persians while they are half dead, lying on the ground, screams, begging. While they laugh, a Persian dies. In another scene, they shout no mercy, but when a Spartan is killed, that alters matters, we see some tragic moments, the father crocks up and the narrator talks poetically. It is extremely clear that Snyder discriminates against the other side. Also it causes that we cannot like Spartans. Personally, I hated them at times and especially Stelios. The Spartans get angry unduly that is OK, but it seems that they slaughter Persians with great pleasure, not because they have to do that. By the way, Persians do nothing like killing or raping the public. I confess that I could not feel any compassion or feel sorry for any Spartan, instead thought the opposite at times, after all those that happen. Another issue, Xerxes has a huge army, but The Spartans give them hell without any real effort or pain. The script writers would have overcome this big absurdity by thinking a little bit! For example, I have a solution. Because of his extreme arrogance, Xerxes does not send all his army. He releases small groups to kill The Spartans, so the three hundred men rout them every time. Then... Something like that. The immortals. I won't ask the question, what does a mortal immortal mean? However, let's suppose that Xerxes might call his elite warriors as the immortals because of his haughtiness. Although, they look very interesting and also crawly, when they begin to fight, we see that they are pretty weak and passive. In the fifth minute of the war, they call help. In fact, all the Persians in the movie are like that. They are represented as very weak, untalented and silly warriors. According to the movie, they do not know exactly how to fight, one Spartan gets on the war area and kills approximately ten Persians at the same time! 300 is a very entertaining movie and very stylish. Some characters are very interesting; The Immortals, Xerxes, the monsters, animals. I watched the war scenes tons of times, each time enjoyed, especially the battle with the immortals, it is great, the arrow moments, the first clash at the hot gates etc. but the rest is too hard to bear at."
"suicidalicecreamtruckdriver","9","1","1","29 June 2009"," This is sparta- magnificent, brilliant and spectacular
","Well, after watching 300, what can I say? The blood isn't disgusting: it represented the glory of the Spartans with a brilliant script, an even more brilliant soundtrack that brings something new to the war and glory genre- this is something amazing by Zack Synder who directs to perfection- similar to what Peter Jackson did in Lord of the Rings. Death, war, rape, blood- 300 is the darkest film of 2006, but one of the best (United 93 and the Prestige takes the cake and medal) but this emerges as an unforgettable film with plenty of quotes that you will be saying, such as ""this is sparta!"" It is completely an original film- with a soundtrack that seems to work better than Sofia Coppola's Marie Antoniette. Don't listen to the critics that pan this film: this is a real, unforgettable, nearly perfect film that is a rocking adventure that earns the comparisons to epics such as Lord of the Rings with it showcasing glory and passion towards Sparta, and means a new era in film. And that a good era that 300 brings. Sure, it's battle after battle but none of these are done without human emotion and not a single scene is dull. It's simply brilliant. Spectacular. Truly magnificent"
"mso88","9","1","1","19 May 2009"," Classic Greek Ideology
","Superbly scripted and acted, 300 is a statement on modern political theory as much as an historical drama. The film stands firm in its defense of individual and collective liberty (currently unfashionable among academia's white wine set) in the face of the relentless onslaught of totalitarianism.<br/><br/>300's techno-wizardry and comic bookishness is bowled over by the solid integrity of its script and concept...rare in a movie these days. The special effects scream computer geek, while the muscular dialogue conveys old-school character and principle.<br/><br/>Freedom is never free, and if we've learned nothing else from the Greeks, including out-of-control public spending, it is that. It's amusing that some reviewers make irrelevant attacks the film's imaginary ""homophobic"" references...and miss the point. Survival in ancient times demanded that principle count for more than trendiness, and the Spartans recognized that the Athenians were more than mere philosophers and boy lovers. It's the same as today as the civilized world again confronts a Satanic Persian menace.<br/><br/>Update: Hollywood's slimy political correctness was again in evidence at the Golden Globes when emcee Ricky Gervais refused to acknowledge presenter Gerard Butler by name, introducing him only as ""that guy from 300."" Cheap shot."
"Gunn","9","1","1","17 May 2009"," Very Entertaining Film!
","My brother and I absolutely loved the 1962 film ""300 Spartans"" based on the amazing 'Battle of Thermopylae' fought in 480 B.C. with the Greek City States of the time fighting the entire Persian Empire led by King Xerxes. The astounding stand of the 300 Spartans who held the Persians at bay at the Thermopylae Pass while the rest of Greece observed a holy festival. The original was a low-budget film with inferior special effects as its only fault. My brother and I always hoped for a remake, although we still revered the original. When I learned of the news of the 2006 production 4 years earlier, we waited with great anticipation. ""300"" wasn't quite what we'd hoped for but it is a very entertaining ""comic book"" version with a visually stunning style. The producers filmed the story as myth rather than reality, but it works well!"

","OK, I liked it. Didn't love it. The whole CGI comic book look was a bit annoying. But that was largely the point, so I had to get over it. Also, it isn't a documentary, so some liberties taken with history are, I suppose OK. I don't think that the Spartans fought bare-chested because they weren't, well, suicidal morons. Oddly, some of the cheesiest dialog was straight out of Herodotus and other ancient sources. And while the battle gore is played for style points, it makes one reflect on the nature of warfare prior to gunpowder. It was up-close slaughter, often on a massive scale. The movie is worth checking out, just don't expect it to be something it's not."

","OK, let's face it, this is not a masterpiece and it is not the best war movie ever. 300 throughout the movie keeps you seated with a palm full of popcorns and your eyes starring at the screen. The movie starts off really well, with an introduction to the harsh spartan way of life and the entering of a Spartan boy to the ""Agogi"". This completely historically accurate. Studying Greek history and being Greek-athenian my self i can tell you this. I would like to inform people who rushed to judge this movie as over exagerrating and a hyperbole that they should take a closer look at Greek history. the cast throughout the story performs well, with really solid acting, the type of actign required for war movies (do not expect super acting though, the film is revolving around Leonidas personality more than the rest). The film has great soundtracks with tasty tones which make you want to listen to them over and over again, (especially the Bulgarian music towards the end of the music). One of the disadvantes of the movie would probably be the the background which is used in the movie with the yellowish,cloudy,dark mood which is unreal. Although some of the effects used during the battle are smart and give an eery mood to the viewers. <br/><br/>Overall this is a good movie, with great sequence, mostly historically accurate, but is trying too hard to make things impressive. Don't judge it that hard."
"pgwhite95","8","1","1","29 December 2008"," These are the true heroes!
","Heroes! Heroes from my past were very numerous. Batman, Superman, Captain America, and all the other Marvel, and DC comic greats. I have never before seeing this movie, had heard about the magnificent 300 at Thermopylae. I know this is an actual historic event, where 300 Spartans, which at that time, and now historically, were the fiercest fighting force known through the land.<br/><br/>These chaps went out to certain death, which to them was the social norms of their society, they were threatened by Xerxes or Persia. Xerxes was an unbeatable force of power, and imperial dominance in the Middle East, and Asia Minor. King Leonidas lead his 300 Spartans not blindly but, with a full strategic effort, without any hesitation of defeat or failure. These warriors, true warriors used the land, and team work, (yes team work), to stage what is to this day one of the greatest displays of democracy known.<br/><br/>There resilience and refusal to serve under tyranny is why these guy's are heroes. Just as the film explains, ""Remember Us, Remember Us."" I hope that anyone who watches this movie remembers that the story that is explained needs to be remembered. Yes, this is a Hollywood production, it is designed to entertain and make money. Yet, the story here is more important than any of that. Forget what the critics say about the production being over-the-top or the story being to violent. We should all give praise to Frank Miller for bringing this story to life in modern form, so that we are not without this lesson.<br/><br/>This movie is a must see for anyone who needs inspiration. King Leonidas is a great symbol of leadership, and how it can be used effectively, even when it goes against the wishes of the masses. This film is a must see, and should be viewed with open eyes."

This is a pure male dominated type of movie that is about rage and aggression...the story is based on truth and how 300 men took on an entire nation; the Spartan armies defence and offence in the first fight was brilliantly done.<br/><br/>The graphics are amazing and it really brings in the comic feel and glorifies the violence that is done to the enemy."
"fearfulofspiders","6","1","1","29 August 2008"," Very Good, If Only With a Few Flaws...
","The only real gripe I could have with 300 is that there's just way too much slow-motion. The film's time could've been reduced 20-minutes for all the slow-mo there is. A couple other things that I didn't like was probably the distorted people in Xerxes's tent, and the poorly stylized vision Snyder had for flying blood.<br/><br/>The acting here is pretty good. Gerard Butler plays a very brutal king, David Wenham is a convincing soldier -- though his character is hardly seen in the film, and his affiliation with the king isn't touched upon, or at least not from what I saw. Rodrigo Santoro is okay as Xerxes. The morphing of the voice is kind of hokey, though in this barbaric film it kind of works and adds to the atmosphere.<br/><br/>The battles aren't very impressive. The first encounter with the Persian army is nicely choreographed, probably THE best battle in the entirety of the movie. The rest are montage sequences of brutal slaying, some of which seem more interesting than the prolonged battles seen elsewhere on here.<br/><br/>This is a beautiful film in terms of the palette Snyder envisioned -- mainly crimson and gold. It really does look like the graphic novel.<br/><br/>The writing and directing, while mediocre at times, is actually very good. Snyder's take on the council meetings are kind of confusing, since they weren't in the graphic novel. Though Queen Gorgo seems like a fierce woman, her character is hardly one we'd feel compassion for.<br/><br/>The music by Tyler Bates is pretty disappointing. It's very similar to the score for Titus, in fact, a lot of the music seems like a complete rip-off, which kind of takes this film down from 7-stars to the 6 I have listed above.<br/><br/>Overall, while visually arresting, 300 is very good, if only with a few flaws. Snyder's vision is creative and an attempt worthy of some applause. It's not ""big"" enough to be called an epic film, but is it emotional enough to tug at your heartstrings at the final 12-minutes of the movie. 300 is a film well worth a watch."

Facing insurmountable odds, their valor and sacrifice inspire all of Greece to unite against their Persian enemy, drawing a line in the sand for democracy.

Totally different to the excellent conformal-type film, The 300 Spartans with just a 'hefty' Richard Egan. This bristles with muscle in terms of both filmography and flesh. The portrayal of Xerxes looking like a jewel box-cum key case proves my point. It must be a hit among certain 'communities' to be diplomatic. Strangely done, but it had its moments.

Frank Miller's graphic novel based on the ancient event was not about the historical accuracy. It was about an entertaining story, as Miller described,""the best damn story I've ever gotten my hands on"" and impressive, arresting visual style. You would think these are more then enough to make an entertaining epic action flick. Well, not exactly. I really wanted to like the movie and I did not expect much but it became boring very soon along with its visual style, slow motion, and even lot (300 as the title suggests) of nearly naked gorgeous hunks who were certainly the feast for eyes with their 6 pack abs and tight leather underwear but not for ears or brains. I am all for fun and entertainment. I love action movies, I am a fan of Comic books adaptations - many entertaining movies were successfully adapted from the comic books.

","In every generation, there's usually a film that explores new grounds. Way back in the 60s, Stanley Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" changed the film medium and, theoretically, paved way for the MTV visuals. Lucas's ""Star Wars"" continued this by launching the Force of endless possibilities on visual sci-fi effects. In the 90s, Wachowski Brothers' ""The Matrix"" was the ""it"" movie--philosophically and visually brilliant. Fast forward to this decade--after Peter Jackson wowed us with his epic trilogy, almost every blockbuster attempts to have the gargantuan spectacle of ""The Lord of the Rngs"". Watching the theater trailer of Snyder's adaptation of Frank Miller's ""300"", some people thought that this movie will break new grounds in cinematic history. Unfortunately, ""300"" might have to settle under the shadow of ""The Lord of the Rings"" (that is without even mentioning the presence of Faramir, the gollum look-alike character, oliphaunts, trolls, and millions of Middle-earth-like warriors marching on in Sparta). <br/><br/>While being visually stunning, the cinematography of this movie just wants to be noticed. Every picture or every scene in the movie seems to want to say, ""Hey! This shot is epic!"" True, almost every scene in the movie can stand as part of a series of beautifully composed paintings--add some perfect abdominal muscles and hard feminine nipples to boot--you have a full-scale work of art. Yes, it's an adaptation of a graphic novel--and, unfortunately, it seems to be merely a graphic novel in motion, if not a video segment in a very complicated PC or virtual reality game. <br/><br/>The overused slow/fast motion technique can be effective if used sparingly yet appropriately. Ironically, the perfectly composed scenes just drag the viewer from one scene to the next, expecting more beauty, more mythical images, that in the end, it's just exhausting to the wide-eyed viewer. The movie makes no apologies for its raunchy, sexually arousing scenes which fittingly juxtapose the ultra-violent bloody war segments. Sex and violence in the Greek times, as depicted in different mythology stories, can be understandable if interpreted with consideration to their cultural richness. What fascinates and repulses me at the same time is how this film has taken those two aspects and made them modern--way TOO modern that sex and violence in ""300"" can leave the audience desensitized.<br/><br/>The script and its execution by many of the mediocre actors here are not even worthy to be given a criticism. <br/><br/>The one important thing missing in this film can be summed up by one word: depth. <br/><br/>Movies can be picture perfect, but there is more to the cinematic language than its flawlessly composed and enhanced visuals--the movie, ideally, must tell a story which paves way to understanding our human nature, psyche, and soul--if not, it poses more questions on human morality, aesthetics, and beliefs. <br/><br/>""300"" flexes exceedingly perfect muscles that are mostly found below the head. Thus, in an amusing way, the movie has beheaded itself and all that remain are those pornographic, visually amazing torso and legs, which like AND unlike the 300 Spartans, eventually would fall--buried and forgotten."

This movie is obviously made for entertainment,it's not one of those movies which leaves something to think about to you.The problem is that 300 isn't that good for entertainment too, it's not one of those movies which you can watch over and over just for fun.I mean there are lot of movies witch make no sense but are quite good entertaining movies you can watch lot of times.Personally I don't have any wish to watch this movie again,it was pure disappointment for me."

","The film has good graphic effects and the action is very dynamic. I don't like the idea of monsters and other fictional creatures being involved in the film because it's exaggerated. The story is inspired from a historical legend which is quite exciting and it deserves to be exploited. Sudden actions of the characters are well played and the editing is very cool. I think they used chroma key because the image is too good and sensible to be filmed on real environment.( only Riddley Scott is that good at extraordinary images in real environment). Not too bad, not too good but too commercial... Didn't like very much the film ""Dawn of the Dead"" made by the same director. Fortunatly this is better!"

","I'd give it a minus 10 if I could. This movie is that bad. It just showed different ways of killing and dying. Normally when I see a movie with blood and gore, I'd cover my eyes, but I never took my eyes of the screen even when the killing was really gruesome. Not because it's not scary, but because it's just laughable. I know the film makers made this film based on a comic book, but even with lowered standard, no expectation for historical value, it still sucks big time. It is not as enjoyable as other comic book movies such as Spider Man or Sin City. There was no emotion, I felt nothing for the soldiers. They were just comic characters in a computer game.<br/><br/>I enjoy playing computers war games more than watching this movie. It's just a completely waste of my time and money. I should have stayed home.<br/><br/>Don't go see it."

"celtic_spirit-1","2","7","18","21 April 2007"," Another pathetic heroic movie
","To my mind, the percentage goes like this: 80% pathos, 10% battles, 5% computer graphics, 5% plot. Although a heroic movie should be pathetic to some extent (like The Lord of the Rings, which I would call a good example of heroic movie), in this movie it was definitely too much unnecessary ""we, the most powerful guys in the Universe"" and ""we, whose shoulders the fate of the world lies upon"" content. As for the graphics - yes, good, stylishly combined colors, although again - meadows and trees could be less computerized. Plus during the whole movie I had to remind myself, that ""300"" is a graphic novel, not a claim of historical truth. It really helped taming the sarcasm down when seeing some brilliant historical nonsense. Anyway, if you like heroic movies or have a friend with good sense of humor, take him/her to the cinema with you and you will find out that the movie is quite entertaining. Enjoy your popcorn!"

I understand that the director did not want to be faithful for the historical events and wanted to make a play station game visual effects ( I admire the commercial way of thinking because a high percentage of people are addicted to computers games) but the scenario is so silly and the diversification between east and west is more silly by showing Dark Persians and remain saying the Nations of Asia.

"anshul_meh","6","7","18","11 March 2007"," Useless
","This movie is a big disappointment. It was the ultra cool trailer that attracted me, and probably many more like me, to the theater. But after the screening, I felt extremely let down.<br/><br/>Following are the reasons: 1) Story: This is the biggest problem in the movie. For a war movie, the absence of a story could be the biggest flaw. It fails to engage a viewer, who would quickly tire out of the grand battle scenes laid before him. In 300, there is no story. It is a simple tale of an extremely brave kingdom of extremely macho men having gorgeous women who would die to save their honor. The USP: 300 against one million, and thats the only thing to the movie.<br/><br/>2) Screenplay: I am sure a lot of moviegoers would know each and every generic motivational dialog that appears in a movie like this. ""Men, tonight we die in hell..."" and many dialogs like this are derivatives of the similar dialogs in a lot of other movies. There is an overdose of such scenes. Over and above this, it is a straight forward story telling, which makes it extremely predictable.<br/><br/>3) Editing: I bet by showing scenes in normal motion instead of slow motion would shorten the movie's length by a good 10-15 minutes. That is the extent to which slow motion has been used in this movie, practically in every other scene. That was stupid, and not cool. It was good to watch in a few scenes, then it took away the interest.<br/><br/>4) Trailer: Yes, it was super cool. But it had two flaws: One it set the expectations so high that the final product could not meet them. And two, it actually had probably 90% of the cool scenes in the movie. Those scenes were so heavily implanted in the viewers mind that one could anticipate them coming in the movie. There was no surprise package, as far as being cool was concerned.<br/><br/>5) Characters: They were half baked. As simple as that. If there is a fine line between courage and stupidity, by their actions and their values, the characters were unable to clearly justify which side of the line they were on. One time the narrator says there is no place for emotion in Sparta, and yet when someone else's son dies, he goes into this huge cycle of melodrama. The queen does not achieve anything by offering herself to the politician, and yet she was presented as if she was intelligent in doing what she was doing.<br/><br/>My final reaction after coming out of theater.. WHATEVER.."
"tavm","5","7","18","10 March 2007"," 300 was a mildly interesting epic to me
","In the interest of full disclosure, I must admit I fell asleep during some of the battle scenes (or maybe during the preparation of said scenes). I did stay alert when the son of one of the soldiers was killed. The scenes I really loved, however, were the ones with the mother queen, Lena Headey, especially when a political rival of her husband's made a deal with her for his support of her views during the next day's council meeting in exchange for his sexually violating her. You'll have to see the movie to watch the twist ending. Since the film was almost over by then, I was only mildly entertained but if you love historical, or maybe legendary would be the better description here, epics, 300 may be what you're looking for."

"jacob_puiras","3","14","44","20 March 2007"," What was that?
","I don't understand the hype about the new title ""300"". The movie was terrible is it's entirety. To have 300 on IMDb top 250 is the stupidest thing I've ever heard of. The movie had nothing to offer other than great special effects and crazy fight scenes. The movie was as follows,(and the fact some will see the movie for this is sad) Its Sex, and bloody combat. THAT'S IT! I cared nothing for Sparta at all or any of the Spartans. The battle was so rushed I could care less if Greece burned to the ground. The main problem I had was the lack of Character development and lack of plot development. Within 15 minutes we're rushed to a battle field that within another 15 minutes will be covered in blood and the dead Spartans THAT I Don't CARE ABOUT. All in all the best of this movie might just be that Greek helmets look awesome and slow motion can make a fight scene (kinda) work. The left much to be desired. They attempted to leave us with a Braveheart sort of ending and failed. After about 2 hours watching this I had to ask myself ""Am I supposed to care if anybody died?"" Another thing that was wrong with this movie, The battle was on and then we'd switch to some political scene with the Queen of Sparta being raped! WHAT THE! At the end I just wanted to leave the room. At least I wanted to see the Persians loose but no! WE DIDN'T because we wasted the screen time wit Blood and worthless violence. This movie did the impossible, It Glorified WAR! Every war or epic has done the opposite. We saw men laughing and joking when surrounded by 1000s of dead men. And if anyone says ""Thats how Spartans are raised."" then I slap you for trying to dig deeper into this crappy movie. No person can go through that and not be affected, look at WW2 veterans, the few that live today are shell shocked and traumatized by the battles they suffered through. If you enjoyed this movie, I couldn't see why. I give this a 4 out of 10 (4/10) simply because this movie is Sick and is meant only to demoralize the movie going public. If anything this is a step back in movie making history."
"jrtrotter","2","14","44","19 March 2007"," Bad Movie, and Bad History
","As we were leaving the movie, my wife made an observation that hit the nail on the head regarding what is wrong with the whole thing. ""The last scene did't make any sense"" was her observation. And she was right. The problem with this film is that it departs so far from history that, when it tries to get back in, it fails. The story falls apart. As I listened to others leaving the theater, it seemed that my wife was not alone. Many places in the film just didn't make sense.<br/><br/>The acting was unremarkable. Leonidas either broods or shouts. Xerxes is too cool for school. The rest of the Spartans are unremarkable. Early in the movie, one Spartan is hoping to find something in the upcoming battle. I can't tell you what it was, or if he found it, because I lost track of the guy. They all just became part of the scenery.<br/><br/>The only thing that makes this movie at all interesting is its visual aspect. It is very interesting to watch. However, everything seems a little too spartan (sorry, couldn't resist). That's probably because this film is primarily computer generated, and so it ultimately has the less than satisfying feel of a video game.<br/><br/>Finally, I found this movie to border on being sacrilegious. The story of the battle at Thermopolyae is, perhaps, the best war story of all time. Here we have this gift from history and the makers of this film have the nerve to think that they can do a better job. I cannot help but think that, on some level, the makers of this film understood this -- rather than using the name of Thermopolyae, they refer to the battle site as ""The Hot Gates."""

","Also (sprach) Zarathustra"" - Thus spoke Zarathustra <br/><br/><ul><li>usually known in English as Zoroaster, the Persian prophet and founder of Zoroastrianism.</li></ul><br/><br/>Today's letter from the Iranian Embassy echoes my long held belief that Hollywood is the propaganda arm of the USA and the so-called New World Order(their term not mine !). During the summer of 2002 I noticed lots of advertisements for Hollywood war films on the BTS.<br/><br/>My first and only conclusion; there is a war coming ! Hollywood is preparing the public mind set. The beginning of 2003 proved this to be correct. Weapons of Mass Propaganda; Hollywood. The Iraq War, or to put it in correct terms, the mass bombing of civilians followed by civil war.<br/><br/>Now the Iranian Embassy has written to The Nation about the War Cry = 300 ! Are they next in line for the Shock & War treatment ? It would certainly appear so.<br/><br/>Today's letter:-<br/><br/>'300''s depiction of Persia driven by 'vicious stereotypes'<br/><br/>The Iranian people are outraged by the movie ""300"", (which is) purportedly about an epic battle fought between the Persian and Greek armies in 480 BC, but which is full of deliberate distortions and derogatory depictions of ancient Persia. It is about the war between the Greek King Leonidas heading an army of 300 Spartans and the Persian Emperor Xerxes commanding an army of one million. It portrays Iranians as monsters rising from the heart of darkness to destroy Greek civilisation. <br/><br/>This insulting movie is being screened in some of the cinemas of Thailand. We are sure the wise and respectful people of the Kingdom already have found out the message of the movie, which actually is in line with the current concerted efforts by certain Western interest circles to systematically make the Iranian nation appear as demons. <br/><br/>While recognising that this is not a docudrama, and that it is a ""fantasy"" version of a historical past, it seems judicious to investigate why the film fails to convey a bare minimum of truth about Iranian history and indulges in inventing perverse, demonic images of Persians. <br/><br/>The movie is overtly racist, overflowing with vicious stereotypes of Persians as a dangerous, bestial force fatally threatening the civilised ""free"" world. <br/><br/>We feel that this movie not only has done a poor job painting the reality of the past, but also it has humiliated the Iranian culture and the reality of what Iran represented during that era. <br/><br/>Iranian history records celebration of life, light and love. Iranian civilisation from the beginning up until now respects all religions and beliefs. <br/><br/>The movie not only is trying to distort Iranian history and civilisation but also is aimed at distorting world history and shaking the foundations of human insight. <br/><br/>The movie is part of a comprehensive effort on the part of the West to launch a psychological war aimed at Iranian culture through Hollywood and other media. <br/><br/>The movie's efforts will be fruitless because values in Iranian culture and the Islamic Revolution are too strongly seated to be damaged by such plans. <br/><br/>Finally the Embassy of the Islamic republic of Iran has no doubt that the Thai people, keeping in mind the long history of more than 400 hundred years of cordial relations with Iran, are aware that the story of the movie is unrealistic and is a birth child of mental fancy of the author and producers. <br/><br/>Akbar Khodaei <br/><br/>Embassy of the Islamic Republic of Iran <br/><br/>Bangkok<br/><br/>and to quote from another forum:-<br/><br/>Now call me obtuse, but American/British government have been trying to cause war over the last 4 years to get into Iran or as David Icke would say, problem-reaction-solution. <br/><br/>PROBLEM-how do we find a excuse to invade Iran ??

"hecky-5","1","8","22","11 April 2007"," brainwashing pro-war propaganda
","I read some of the comments about the film, because I ask myself, what does the people fascinating about this movie? What I read about the movie scares me, because I have never seen a modern fascistic movie, that have reached a audience like that. 300 gave me the answer, how people could be fascinate by media for the war propaganda like Adolf Hitler, Goebbels, etc did before. By the way it was Goebbels, who compared the German troops after the battle of Stalingrad with the Spartans. If someone is fascinate by this movie, he should ask himself, what is his idea of man.<br/><br/>I want to add the comment of ""Golem78"" I found in the internet, that hits the bull's-eye:<br/><br/>The Internet is abuzz with the suggestion that 300 may be veiled war propaganda. Veiled? Hardly. 300 is the most blatant brainwashing pro-war propaganda I have seen in many years. It's the kind of film Leni Riefenstahl would be proud of. <br/><br/>Leni Riefenstahl produced propaganda films for the Nazis. Like 300, Riefenstahl's movies dazzled with their visual finesse and extraordinary aesthetics but ultimately served to glorify the Nazi ideology and promote war.<br/><br/>300 is a very entertaining movie, with great special effects and spectacular visuals. But it drips with dishonest and manipulative war propaganda.<br/><br/>Throughout the entire movie, the warmongering Spartans are glorified as righteous and superior. Even when they break laws and start a war and kill foreigners, they're supposedly justified. Anyone who opposes them, including pacifist Spartans who want peace and not war, are portrayed as traitors. The intented analogy aimed at democrats and left-wing antiwar protesters is clear.<br/><br/>Supposedly the war-mongering Spartans are ""fighting for freedom"" (nevermind that Spartans had slaves) and ""the enemy"" is an inhuman, soulless horde of foreigners, mirroring the xenophobic distrust many republicans display towards the United Nations. <br/><br/>Over and over again do characters in the movie say things aimed at elevating Spartans above all other nations or races. The mention of 1000 nations fighting against Sparta are an obvious reference to the worldwide anti-Americanism and the fact that the US is pretty much alone in its so-called ""war on terror.""<br/><br/>All throughout the movie, non-Spartans (read: non-Americans) are derided as inferior. Even the allies of the Spartans are described as inferior soldiers of negligible value - precisely the way warmongering neocons see the so-called coalition of the willing in Iraq.<br/><br/>The voice-over in the movie even uses the word ""soulless"" to describe the foreign troops. And all the foreigners are either black, gay, horribly disfigured or hidden behind masks and veils, so that they never quite seem human. <br/><br/>Dehumanizing and demonizing ""the enemy"" is the whole point of war propagada... fool your own citizens into thinking of the enemy as sub-humans that deserve to be killed.<br/><br/>Thousands of foreigners die in 300, but they're faceless, soulless masses. Their deaths don't matter - just like the American public completel y ignores the deaths of hundreds of thousands of faceless Iraqi civilians. But when a Spartan dies, it's a tragedy - just like Americans only care about fallen American soldiers.<br/><br/>Among US Army troops the cry ""hooah"" or HUA (Heard. Understood. Acknowledged.) is an old tradition to signal unified approval. In 300, the Spartans scream ""haooh"" whenever their king gives a rousing speech about the merit of slaughtering foreigners. Coincidence? Hardly.<br/><br/>Watching those Spartans scream ""HAOOH!"" with the melodramatic music in the background actually gave me goosebumps. It really is a rousing, emotional sensation to see so many men scream as one. Now I know how those Germans felt who attended Hitler's speeches. I'm sure you've seen the old black and white news reel footage... Hitler talks of total war and death before dishonor, and thousands of Germans scream ""Sieg Heil"" with one voice. Watching a movie like 300, you feel that emotional pull, that urge to scream along with all the other voices.<br/><br/>Leni Riefenstahl couldn't have done it any better."

"little_socrates1","10","5","12","29 March 2007"," An Awesome Cinematic Adventure
","This movie is incredible. Very awesome combat, and a whole bunch you can read in the other reviews. But I'll address the criticisms now.<br/><br/>Many criticize the fact that the movie is full of historical inaccuracies and impossibilities, along with the fact that there is ""prejudice"" against black men, homosexuals, the handicapped, and groups among the Persians.<br/><br/>The movie is a narrative, you must remember, told right before the battle by a Spartan, one of the 300. Many of the things that appear to be creatures are how Spartans portray them. Remember the wolf at the very beginning? It had no physical possibilities beyond what it does in our reality, but a Spartan would likely see it as a much more intimidating being. The same applies to the ogre-like creature, the creature with guillotines for hands, and the traitor. Spartans see things in a different, more mythological fashion. Nothing had powers that were really impossible with amputation and other physical possibilities, but it would not seem so to an Ares-worshiping, Hades-believing culture.<br/><br/>Plus, as a story being told, this could also come from the imagination of the Spartans, listening to the tale and letting their imaginations, fueled with hatred toward the Persians, fill in the blanks.<br/><br/>And then there's the prejudice. What would a Spartan see as wrong? They characterize their fellow Greeks, the Athenians, as ""boy-lovers"" early in the tale. The Spartans see all but themselves as weak, and all that oppose them, or their beliefs (such as their beliefs on homosexuality), as evil. These are not the beliefs of the movie makers (at least as far as I can tell) and do not truly characterize anything but the ancient Persian empire as evil, and even then only to the Spartans. Do people complain about the characterizations of many Germans in WWII movies? I thought not.<br/><br/>Also, this movie is far less gory than it would be in reality, but that's a good thing in this case. Blood spills in a very artful way, entirely CG-animated and only used in an artful way. In the instances with decapitations, blood does not pour in the way in truly does, or spray in a fountain, or anything truly gory. The blood falls in a few drops and no more. The movie is high in violence, but less blood falls than in an episode of Law and Order.<br/><br/>However, there is a reason this movie is rated R, other than the (at least with my family and friends) controversial V for Vendetta. The 300 is full of sexuality, so don't take your kids unless you're OK with that...signing out."

I felt thrills down my spine for at least half of the movie and some parts were really moving, breathtaking and monumental. Frank Miller is brilliant in some ways but has a few obsessions that he should, in my opinion, get rid of. I would have appreciated a lot more a pure historical film done in this manner, because the film making and the battle scenes are absolutely brilliantly done. My favorite history/drama movie is The Gladiator. If 300 had the seriousness and the deepness of that movie, it would have been the best history/drama movie ever made. If it weren't for the monsters and mutants, it would have truly been a masterpiece... I am looking forward to seeing other graphic novels by Miller get screened because they have that darkness that is somewhat unique. I loved Sin City, but some scenes involving Mickey Rourke, Benicio del Toro and the Yellor Bastard ruin the splendid scenes done by Bruce Willis or Josh Hartnett. It it weren't for that absurd sci-fi - fantasy touch, these movies would have beep quite deep. Frank Miller, grow up man, you're wasting your talent and the genius inside you continues to be a little too childish..."

","I felt nothing for anyone in this blandly acted nonsense. We got either macho clich√©-riven yelling and chest-beating or pseudo-philosophical boring meanderings from dull but pretty actors all trying to meld together in a mind-numbing script and all trying to be Lord of the Rings for the all tough guys out there who don't like hobbits and wimpy things like that, but aren't averse to blatant homo-eroticism. BUT, the visuals were stunning and the action generally very good, the costumes were excellent and set design great.

","Well, i read a lot of stupid comments until now, so i wanted to post one of my own. Some may like it, others may not.... <br/><br/>First of all, the movie is based on the comic book because otherwise it would've been a teen day string of continuous fighting between and impenetrable wall of shields, spears and armored men and waves of Persians, ending in a 2 day last stand surrounded and fighting to the death. Imagine the joy of seeing a movie like that :))<br/><br/>The important thing is that they respected a few historic guidelines.<br/><br/>1) He didn't accept the offer from the Persians, it would've meant submission, slavery, and death of free will, something like what the Nazis would've done if they had it their way. 2)The ""stupid"" lines people find out of place are, partly, from history ""Fight in the shade"" blabla, those are all real lines. 3) Yeah, they fought and died so that others may enjoy freedom, they fought for what they believed in, not for honor, glory, not for the pleasure of battle, but for their city, and all the other Greek cities.<br/><br/>The well in the middle of the city was historically known for being a last place of rest for arrogant fools and tyrants asking submission from the Spartans.<br/><br/>The lack of humanity? War is fought without mercy , not just then, but even now. They killed everyone because they couldn't afford to have survivors at their backs while they were fighting.<br/><br/>Yeah, the monsters and other things are a little far fetched, but it's a action movie not a damn documentary, it's supposed to entertain you. <br/><br/>Yeah, the movie isn't a historic one because it would've been boring and pointless. It's represents an idea and an homage to soldiers everywhere who fought for the ones at home, for the ones they LOVED."

","First off, I just need to say that it's very annoying that some people choose to tear this movie apart because it's historically inaccurate. OK, thanks that's clearly obvious. This movie is based off a comic that is very loosely based off the real Battle of Thermopylae. Also, I don't know what people are seeing this as some sort of propaganda piece about the turmoil in the Middle East, man guys, can't we go see a movie and watch it for what it really is without scratching our heads and looking into it so deeply? Don't destroy what going to the movies is all about. Does anything else have to be said? It's not meant to be some documentary or Oscar winning film. It's meant to entertain and entertain it does. It's a popcorn flick you go see with your buds on the weekend. Anyways, yes great movie in my opinion, seen it three times so far. Awesome action sequences, and it's not even that bloody compared to other films (Gladiator, The Patriot)come on, the blood splatters are even computer generated so how can you be that grossed out? So to reiterate, NOT historically accurate, not MEANT to be historically accurate, NOT a political film what so ever (clearly people who say that aren't familiar with Frank Miller), and it's a GREAT and ENTERTAINING movie. Go see it!"

","Director and Writer Zack Snyder's ""300"" is visually stunning and inspired storytelling. Snyder along with co-writers Kurt Johnstad and Michael Gordon tell the legendary story of the Battle of Thermopylae where 300 Spartans held off the Persian army of up to perhaps 1 million soldiers for 3 days at a beach passage. The Spartans all died to a man. The resonance of their courageous action may have inspired the formation of the Greek Republic. The movie is based on the graphic novel by Frank Miller. Snyder's ""300"" derives its look from Miller's comic book. ""300"" also has the distinction of being filmed entirely in front of a green screen. Consequently, ""300"" has an intentionally stylized look in tone and atmosphere. What are surprising is the touching pathos, and the effective performances amidst the dramatic hyperbole. Snyder's ""300"" is by no means a study in subtle; however, leads Gerard Butler and Lena Headey are amazing in the display of the unsaid.<br/><br/>""300"" got me in an opening training scene with King Leonidas (Butler) and his young son. Leonidas tells his son the lesson is ""Respect and honor."" That is the context for ""300"". When the Persian Emissary questions Leonidas's wife's presence in their meeting, Queen Gorgo (Headey) says, ""Spartan women give birth to real men."" The Spartan code is never surrender. So when the Persian King Xerxes demands Sparta's submission the answer is obvious, and the course of action mandated. Leonidas enrolls 300 of his best warriors to battle the overwhelming Persian army. Gorgo says to Leonidas , ""Come back with your shield, or on it¬Ö"" Leonidas loves Gorgo more than life, and that too goes unsaid. ""300"" is about honor, respect, and love. The movie is visually stunning and the fight scenes are spectacular. There is an amazing panoramic shot of Leonidas (Butler) dispatching a dozen Persian soldiers with shield and spear as he runs across the screen. ""300"" is blood and gore executed with great style and skill.<br/><br/>I was fortunate to see a screening of the movie, and listen to Visual Effects Supervisor Chris Watts. Chris talked about the look of the movie and the challenges of bringing to life the ambitious goals of the movie given his resources. All the actors in ""300"" look totally ripped. Someone asked Chris if he digitally enhanced anyone's physique. Chris said that the actors trained rigorously for 8 weeks, and that there were ""no digital abs"". The Spartans in ""300"" do look awesome. And the actors captured the Spartan warrior spirit and nobility. Gerard Bulter gives a breakthrough performance as Leonidas, King of Sparta. Butler is a powerful and commanding presence that is larger than life, as dictated by the story. He also effectively tempers this with a subtle introspection and an underlying compassion. Lena Headey is an unexpected delight. As Queen Gorgo she leverages her beauty and strength, and is as compelling and driving force as Leonidas. Headey gives an understated hero's performance. The supporting cast is excellent. David Wenham is strong as Spartan Dilios, also the story's narrator. Vincent Regan embodies a father's pride and torment as the Captain. Rodrigo Santoro fittingly provides a larger than life arrogance as Xerxes.<br/><br/>Zack Snyder's ""300"" is inspired movie making, and just plain fun to watch. Gerard Butler and Lena Headey give star-making performances. Unfortunately, ""300"" does not lend itself easily to a sequel, given the nature of the story. However, anything is possible in Hollywood. Consequently, Zack Snyder has distinguished himself as a talented director of vision and passion. Keep an eye out for Snyder's next project."

"Lnarc","10","5","12","14 March 2007"," A Masterpiece of Its' Own
","In my many years of watching movies it is a rare thing for me to actually write a review. In fact I've only written one or two while I've been here on IMDb, but the reason behind that is simple; only the movies that reach me will ever get my attention, and ""300"" has.<br/><br/>I knew from the trailers I would like this movie. It's my kind of movie. An over-the-top action film that doesn't draw out boringly or stall the story, nor does it avert my eyes to more entertaining things. ""300"" is a movie worth watching no matter what anyone says. And now let me display my emotion by splitting my thoughts into categories. First off, let's start with the story.<br/><br/>Storyline: Yes, this is a predictable story that really doesn't sound that interesting since it's probably been done thousands of times before, but there is something many people overlook in sake of being ""intelligently challenged"". And that is HOW the story is told. Some times scripts can be weak or terrible, but the translation from words to images is something the director must do and I must give a ""Ho!"" to Zack for successfully telling the story of Frank Miller's adaptation.<br/><br/>The story here, though predictable, is told very well. It brings you into the battle and into each choice the soldiers make. It makes you feel that raw gritty emotion of pride and glory that booms from the speakers around you. And it hardly stalls itself. You are always zoomed into what is happening like you are actually there as everything flows together smoothly. The only thing that stalled to me, even though just a little bit, was the scene of the Queen and Theron as she submitted to his pleasure for sake of getting an audience. It was sort of unneeded, but it did develop a stronger distaste for the political bad guy and made his death that much sweeter. it also helped move the ending along so it was and wasn't needed if that makes any sense.<br/><br/>Overall, I give the storyline a 9/10. <br/><br/>Acting: And now we come to the acting. Overacted? Somewhat. But there weren't any terrible performances I saw. Some actors/actresses were weaker than others while Gerald and the soldiers played their characters well. I've read over half of the graphic novel myself and I must say Gerald nailed that character down as well as the others. It was mainly Lena's acting and maybe one or two of the lesser-known Spartans that were average or above.<br/><br/>Overall the acting was great in some parts while average in others, I give it a 7.5/10. <br/><br/>Graphics: What can I say? Those were some damn good graphics for a movie done mostly in green/blue screens and nothing looked too round or too blocky. The blood itself, even though CGI itself, created the comic book feel and was actually quite cool. It really created the atmosphere of the action and the graphic novel feel to a whole new level. This movie probably will change how film-makers do their films.<br/><br/>9.5/10 <br/><br/>Action: I don't have say anything to let you know how much I enjoyed that action. Very stylized. Very violet. Very AWESOME! Even in the beginning I was screaming out ""Ho!"" with the soldiers as it really hyped me up. There was awesome kills after awesome kills and just mind-boggling kills that really made those Spartans look like bad-asses to the EXTREME. This mother ****er gets a 10/10.<br/><br/>Overall View: This movie is very loyal to the graphic novel, it is above average acted out, great graphics, great action, and great storytelling. Any flaws I saw are easily forgivable and forgettable. This movie is something any action or war fan should enjoy. Don't reference to LOTR or Gladiator. ""300"" is its' own ****ing masterpiece.<br/><br/>I give ""300"" a 10/10. I don't give two ****s what people think of that. You either like it or you don't.<br/><br/>Other things people should know: Anybody who bitches about historical accuracy must not be paying attention to the movie because excluding the weird creatures, rhinos, and the elephants, it was a lot more accurate than people think. It's just stupid and pathetic nit-picking. Don't go to this movie to learn something. Go to this movie to be entertained to the fullest. If you can't do that then I bet your as dry as my grandpa's a**.<br/><br/>And one other thing. **** Iranians who complain about this movie. I saw no relevance whatsoever.<br/><br/>Can I get a Ho??!!"
"donatolla","9","5","12","13 March 2007"," A movie that should serve as an important exclamation point for the MPAA
","I'm not going to write an elongated review of the movie. There are already a number of excellent and well thought out reviews that I agree with completely. What I do want to write is a brief comment on what I believe this movie should mean to the industry as a whole.<br/><br/>I will preface this with saying that I'm a one movie a week kind of person...meaning that I'm at the theatre once a week. Movies I miss are rented at our local rental joint.<br/><br/>The movie industry is celebrating a 2006 with increased profits over the disappointing 2005. Apparently, this is because they have been waging a war over movie downloads and winning, causing people by the hundreds to abandon their bit torrent sessions and flock back to the movie theatre.<br/><br/>Here's my point to the MPAA: If you want more people to go out to the theatre, ensure that the product that you are presenting makes full use of what a theatre can offer. If people can be happy with the quality of a downloaded product, what does that say about the movie in the first place? 300 is the second movie I have watched this year that gets it (The other is Children of Men). This is a movie that absolutely MUST be experienced in a theatre with high quality picture and sound. I see no way in which this could possibly be enjoyed in a format of any less fidelity. The visual effects and choreography are absolutely stunning, with a soundtrack that perfectly matches up with what you are witnessing on screen. Fears of an excessively violent movie were mitigated by presentation - comparisons I've read of a ballet are absolutely spot on. I only gave the movie an 9 out of 10 because I didn't enjoy the acting as much as others, but it is perfectly suitable for a movie that is a presentation of a graphic novel.<br/><br/>In short, if you view this movie in any format less than what the original filmmakers intended, you will miss out on what makes it such an enjoyable film.<br/><br/>If I'm sitting at MPAA headquarters, I would be deeply thinking about how to evolve the industry to take advantage of the technology available in movie theatres today and create a truly visceral experience that is worth the price of admission."

","Does this movie claim to be historically accurate? No. The director and others have said on the video diaries that they have taken liberties with it. And this movie is based on a graphic novel, not actual history. The History Channel had an awesome documentary about the real story, see that if you want only ""accuracy."" For the rest of us who go to movies to be entertained(and occasionally educated or enlightened), it was one incredible movie. It was a feast for the eyes! I haven't enjoyed a movie that much in a while.<br/><br/>Like others have said, the score was spot on with emotion, the acting was great...it wasn't ""oh there's Gerard Butler in a thong and cape,"" it was, ""that's Leonidas, and he kicks butt."" I was gripped from the opening title to the last credit rolled off the screen. I will probably be rated a homophobic-misogynistic-right-wing-imperialist for saying how much I liked this movie, and I really don't care, because of what the message of this movie was.<br/><br/>Have a spine. Do what is right. Don't give into the easy way out, don't bow your knee to something you don't believe, just to save your neck. It's metaphorical for life not literally fighting and killing.<br/><br/>This country (America) is so spineless and simpering at times it makes me sad and sick. So here is to you Zach Snyder and the makers of 300, and to Frank Miller for writing it! Never retreat, never surrender...with your shield or on it!<br/><br/>Compromise should be an exception, not a way of life. There is a whole lot more to be said..but I'll save it for another place.<br/><br/>It has bumped a movie which references the historical basis for this one out of my top 10.

"jaredmobarak","10","5","12","11 March 2007"," Sparta!¬Ö300
","This is what film was destined to evolve to. After decades of directors making storyboards as reference before filming and the slow building trend to adapt comic book work, we finally have the ultimate fusion of both. Sure Sin City did amazing things with the medium and created frame-by-frame transfers from drawing to celluloid, however, it was still shot as a movie first and foremost. Zack Snyder has done something different with 300; he has created a true work of art. Frank Miller's story was one steeped in truth and history if not entirely non-fiction. The heightened reality came across in the stylized drawings of the graphic novel and the honor and respect held in such high regard by its characters. Snyder takes these aspects to another level with his film, creating some of the most brutal yet beautiful moments I've seen at the movies. The artistry is gorgeous to behold and the story and acting only enhance the quality with deeper meaning. What Picasso's Guernica is to painting, an epic portrayal of war and death and the hope that can come out of it all, 300 is to cinema.<br/><br/>I am surprised how the huge success so far for this film needs to be footnoted with the fact that it has a starless cast. To me, this is a slap in the face of all the great talent involved. Gerard Butler, for one, has steadily risen in the acting ranks and just cements his talent with this role as Spartan King Leonidas. He has the rugged physique and harsh mentality of a true warrior, but also the compassion needed to lead a band of soldiers to their death and the love for not only land and country, but also wife and child¬ótheir freedom being the reason he needs Sparta to stay safe from tyranny. Then you have the beautiful Lena Headey, the actress that was forced into Terry Gilliam's Brother's Grimm after producers refused to let Samantha Morton have the role. Knowing Gilliam's history with Hollywood and being forced to do so many things against his will, the words saying that Headey actually did the role justice to his vision means wonders. To be complimented for a part he had a singular vision for can only prove the worth she holds. I still want to see last year's Imagine Me and You, the kind of chick flick that looks like it could be a really good film. Lastly you have the up-and- coming David Wenham, one of the best performances, in my opinion, throughout the entire Lord of the Rings trilogy. After a fun role in the dreadful Van Helsing and a total metamorphosis in The Proposition, I believe he has some great things ahead of him. Even Dominic West as the treacherous Theron surprised me. After his laughable acting in The Forgotten, I couldn't believe this was the same guy. I have never seen ""The Wire,"" but maybe the guy has some talent after all.<br/><br/>Again, though, no matter how effective the acting was, the true strength of the film was in the overall aesthetic. Sure many scenes were culled perfectly from the comic, but Snyder also put his own flare to it. Not only was the role of Queen Gorgo expanded from a single drawn frame to integral role of the film, but it was done so successfully. When I heard of the expansion I sort of chuckled, thinking here is an infusion of femininity in an otherwise macho story¬óif for nothing else, but to add a reason to have some sexuality and nudity in this hard-R movie. Instead it is her character's drive back home in Sparta against the villainous Theron that makes the final moments as poignant as they are. While the comic gave us an insight into a warrior fighting for freedom of men, the addition of the Queen here gives us the story of a man fighting for the freedom of humanity and equality of all those living on earth. The softer side of the king makes his brutality that much more necessary and his love for his wife the reason he is so ready to give his life for the war. The only addition I disliked in the entire film was that of a grotesque creature/decapitating machine. The ""monsters"" in the story are supposed to be elephants and inbred freaks of nature, (this is ancient Greece), not monstrosities fixed with blades as arms. I find myself forgiving it though because it was on screen for so short a time, and the only misstep I saw. <br/><br/>Zack Snyder has outdone himself. I enjoyed his remake of Dawn of the Dead, but didn't quite understand the critics when they said he had an immense talent and hold on how to shoot and craft scenes. 300 definitely showed me this to be true. Whether light scenes of stunning visuals like the dance of the oracle or dark sequences of battle and splattering blood, he succeeds with them all. The first long take of Leonidas fighting through Persian after Persian with the speed slowed and increased while the zoom jumps forward and back is amazing and makes the hallway fight scene in Oldboy seem like child's play. This is truly the first great film of 2007, whether it stays atop my favorites at the end of the year remains to be seen, but right now it sits above all with quite a gap in between."
"Matt_Layden","9","5","12","9 March 2007"," ""300 Has Bad-Ass Written All Over It""
","Based on Frank Miller's graphic novel, ""300"" centres on the 300 Spartans that defended their freedom with their lives against an army of thousands.<br/><br/>What can one say about ""300"" that hasn't already been said? One simply has to watch the trailer to know exactly what they are getting themselves into when they go to see ""300"", a visually stunning film that piles the bodies high and blood splatter higher. Without a well known cast and a director that only has one film under his belt it would take something impressive to attract people. The ""300"" trailer did just this, as hype of the film spread like wildfire throughout the internet and months before it's release was being hailed as the next big thing in cinema. Well, the film has finally arrived and it's safe to say that you can add it to the list along with: ""The Matrix"", ""Star Wars"", ""LOTR"" and ""Citizen Kane"" as films that have changed the way we look at cinema.<br/><br/>""300"" opens with a back-story to a normal starting life of a Spartan, if the baby is born too small or too weak, it's literally tossed off a cliff. Taught to fight as early as he can walk, the Spartan must learn to be tough and leave no room for weakness. Every Spartan must go through a test, in the film's case it was against a wolf. This has been done for years and you get the sense that these guys are serious.<br/><br/>""300"" is the second film based on a graphic novel by Frank Miller. ""Sin City"" generated the same amount of hype across the globe and has its own unique visual style. If ""Sin City"" was the first step into the next generation of film, then ""300"" is a giant leap. Its beautiful colours are enough to draw an audience regardless of the films quality. Lucky for us it's not just its visual style that makes the film good. Shot entirely on green screen, Snyder is able to create a world full of muscular Spartans, ugly monsters and violent battle scenes, creatively and effectively. The tans/yellows of the battle ground provide a great backdrop for the red coated Spartans. Boy, does that red ever jump out at you too.<br/><br/>Knowing the history of Spartans, the film is not totally accurate, but it gets the basics down. These warriors were born to be fighters and nothing else. The filmmakers intended to not be historically accurate in order to give an entertaining film, and it works like a charm. This is something ""Troy"" and ""Alexander"" suffered from greatly. Hearing the story that only 300 men defended themselves against thousands upon thousands could raise a few eyebrows. That's until you see these warriors and their lifestyles. They don't have normal professions back home. They're not blacksmiths or carpenters, as one character says, they're warriors, that's their profession. These men were meant to fight and the actors look spot on. <br/><br/>Gerard Butler, whom I only recognize from the Tomb Raider sequel, embodies what a Spartan is. Here's a guy who made me believe he was an actual Spartan. He has just the right amount of honours and leadership to command the army and the film; he does so with ease. Hidden behind a beard and his helmet for most of the film, Butler pulls off a great performance of a man who is not afraid to be on the front lines in battle. It's an honest performance that could take some by surprise, if you think the film is only about yelling Sparta every couple of seconds, you're only half right.<br/><br/>Snyder is quickly becoming a favourite of mine. Here is a young guy with obvious talent, who took on two difficult films that had an audience before the film was released. Creating a worthy remake with ""Dawn of the Dead"", Snyder tackled this project head on. Working on digital only enhances the creativity this guy can bring to a project. Only time will tell if he can solidify himself in the business with his next undertaking of ""The Watchmen"".<br/><br/>Much like Miller's other work, ""300"" is a brutal film that doesn't let up with its content. The film tells you point blank that it's going to be bloody violent and it actually keeps its promise. Only once or twice does it slow down for some dialogue, to let the viewer settle down after watching an onslaught of violence. The violence is stylized, mixing fast and slow motion left right and centre. The blood is CGI and legs, heads and arms do fly off at every corner. But the violence is stylized so much, that in the end the gore factor doesn't seem like a lot. You know you're watching gory images, but it doesn't send chills down your spine, instead you simply think, ""That was cool"". The entire film plays out like a wet dream to every movie aficionado, video game player, comic book reader (sorry graphic novel reader) out there. It's a shame that Alan Moore hasn't had as good a time at the movies as Frank Miller has, graphic novel adaptations need visionary directors.<br/><br/>I totally recommend ""300"", for anyone looking for a visionary film and who's not afraid of violence on the screen. It's a roller-coaster ride that only ends when the screen turns black. The final moments of the film gave me goose bumps and there are too many beautiful scenes to name one as my favourite. ""300"" earns its R rating; it's a hard nose slobber-knocker. The body count is in the thousands and the blood is in the gallons. For a fully enjoyable experience, one should see this on IMAX. If you really want to know what ""300"" is like, it's basically the trailer, extended past two hours."

","The story of Spartan King Leonidas holding the Persian Army of Xerxes at bay at the battle of Thermopylae. As far as I can remember -- I was there but it's been a long time -- it's reasonably accurate historically although perforce some of the dialog must be fabricated.<br/><br/>If it has any redeeming social value it's probably that the kids who are the intended audience will learn that there was once a city called Sparta that wasn't in Mississippi.<br/><br/>But the photography and f/x are something special. Images are in high contrast and tinted a kind of gold except at night, when they're tinted a kind of blue. Not midnight blue but kind of a neon blue.<br/><br/>The acting is professional in caliber. Some of the monsters (for that's how they're depicted) overplay their roles, if that's possible. The women are attractive and it's interesting to see that the queen has been outfitted by Dior or somebody, wearing a dress cut perilously low on her iliac crests. The men are uniformly built. Their pecs are massive. Their abs are rock hard. In fact, they're built almost identically. Can you photoshop a group scene? If it weren't for the photography and f/x it could be a sword and sandal epic from 1958 filmed in Cinecitt√° starring Lance Sterling (n√©e Guglielmo Gogliucci). <br/><br/>But the photography alone almost redeems the film. The skies are straight out of J. M. W. Turner, smoky and smudged, but slowly swirling.<br/><br/>It's thought provoking but the thoughts it provokes are primitive. There is no overlap between good (white Spartans) and evil (black Persians). This kind of binary thinking is dangerous because it's liable to lead us into believing that this is the way the real world works -- all good versus all evil -- whereas in fact God didn't make the universe in a way that renders it so easy for humans to understand.<br/><br/>Too bad they distilled Spartan culture into nothing more than a lot of heroes taking ""drunk delight in battle with my peers."" The Spartans certainly fought well and the battle scenes are impressive except when they lapse into very slow motion or are overcranked to lightning speed.<br/><br/>Sparta must have been a nice place to visit though you wouldn't want to live there. They periodically raided their neighbors, the peaceful Helots, for slaves. Older mentors adopted young boys as sexual objects. If a newborn was deformed or otherwise deemed unfit it was put down."

","One word: terrible.<br/><br/>This ""movie"" isn't a movie at all I think. I don't know how to classify but it's more like a video game or something. <br/><br/>I am irritated by the graphics all the time. You can see it's fake. I hope this is the last film of this ""new"" genre. Free us of this graphics video crap. This movie is a step too far in computer-animated movies. What is the next step in movie-world? Movies without any real actors, well then it becomes a cartoon I think. <br/><br/>In films like gladiator and Lord of the Rings the computer-animations are less profound and better."

","Forget Evan Almighty or the Simpsons Movie. This summer, if you want a movie you can laugh and guffaw your way through, 300 is the one to go see! This movie takes itself so seriously - from the over-dramatic dialogue, perpetually epic sunsets, Adonis-bodied Spartans in CK briefs, over-the-top acting and the everybody dies finale - it is simply impossible to keep a straight face for more than 2 minutes at a time.<br/><br/>I had read reviews on IMDb which mentioned the lack of quality dialogue and plot in this movie, but nothing could have prepared me for hackneyed lines such as: ""Freedom is not free, it requires great sacrifice. The price is paid in blood"", and ""My children, gather round! No retreat, no surrender; that is Spartan law and by Spartan law we will stand and fight... and die. A new age has begun. An age of freedom, and will know, that 300 Spartans gave their last breaths to defend it!"" Freedom isn't free??!! It's as if these lines were taken from the George Bush Book of Inspirational Quotes for Your Troops. Every single line was laden with so much drama and foreboding, you could practically hear the writers screaming ""THIS IS AN EPIC SUMMER MOVIE. YAAARRRR!!!!"" Also, I'm sorry, but it's simply impossible to take anyone seriously when they're standing around in nothing more than little maroon briefs, a helmet and a cape. When did it suddenly become a Hollywood trend to depict all ancient Greeks as barely repressed homosexuals? I know they dabbled in pederast, but this is just ridiculous. The way they paraded around with bulging pecs and triceps, I was half expecting to see them suddenly ditch their spears and explode into a 300 person epic orgy. Thankfully, they all just died instead.<br/><br/>The one thing that can be said is that the graphics were amazing and painstakingly detailed. But what summer blockbusters aren't these days? In the end, all the CGI in the ancient world can not compensate for the monumental disaster that is 300. Avoid this movie at all costs."

","Film critic(!?) James Berardinelli already put this movie on his 2007 top 10 list?! I now doubt his credibility of being a serious film critic for good. This is a piece of mindless, aimless, and tedious trash and will go directly to my bottom 10 list of 2007. All the critics about racist, nationalistic are true (if you don't believe my statement, try to raise your kids that way and see what would happen!), and all the praises about awesome, entertaining, and a masterpiece are false! (Unless you have a maturity of a 12-year-old boy or a video game junkie). I seriously think IMDb site should start implementing the ratings, not just by stars, but also by demographic for objectivity.<br/><br/>""WE ARE SPARTANS!!"" shouted over and over again through out the movie by actor Gerard Butler, what a moron! Seriously, maybe Americans should at least try to learn the history from a real book every now and then, instead of from a comic book or a silly movie like this.

"ponsomp-1","1","4","9","12 July 2007"," More Modern Democratic Ideals Read Back into Greek History
","Recreations of historical periods raise some ethical questions despite disclaimers that films are only pure entertainment (how many people actually think of Brad Pitt in Troy when the name Homer or the Iliad is mentioned? How many question whether or not it was even accurately portrayed?). The modern confusion of reading the modern democratic ideal of freedom into ancient Greek and Medieval history (e.g., Kingdom of Heaven) are severely anachronistic--as if individual or collective freedom was a universal ideal.<br/><br/>In 300, the notion of freedom versus slavery is what motivates the Spartan polis and its citizens to stand against Xerxes (oddly Persians are portrayed by Africans). While self-sufficiency is a key idea in much of ancient Greece, freedom (in the modern sense) is not a part of this. Freedom was seen as a bi-product of self-sufficiency, not an ideal.<br/><br/>In any case, the glaring inconsideration to narrative and historical detail is obvious in view of the cinematic effects this film wishes to achieve. For one, the phalanx which Leonides cites as the key to Spartan military superiority was something not invented until Hellenistic times. Not to mention, the 300 don't really use the formation in practice (they use it for the first skirmish but then break into one-on-one combat). Leonides makes reference to Athens as a polis made up of philosophers (seen retrospectively by the writers in relation to the predominance of Plato and Aristotle today). But philosophy was not something held in high regard (e.g. the execution of Socrates and many others). And no doubt, the Athenian hoplite was very effective (Socrates was also a hoplite). <br/><br/>Fight choreography, while amazing from a CG point of view, is rather boring like much contemporary film that has no sense of movement throughout a scene and instead relies on cutting and editing to suggest the flow of action. And I never understood why the 300 charge out of the pass (in which they are supposed to lure the Persians) rather than remain in it as it was originally suggested.<br/><br/>So while this reviewer seems like an overly academic critic, it is interesting to see what things are held to be worthy of entertainment and enjoyment when contrasting modern renditions with the actual historical sources and the philosophical and religious ideas innate to them."

","Overbearing, overwrought, over-exaggerated mess in the film-making tradition of ""Sin City"" and ""Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow"" as the focus is the Battle of Thermopylae in 480 B.C. where 300 Spartans tried to defend their empire against the Persians. Gerard Butler leads the titled group and David Wenham serves as one of his top soldiers in the charnel house vomitorium of violence and basic exploitation tactics that wore thin way back in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The acting is sophomoric, the direction is confusing and unclear and the screenplay could have been penned better by middle school students. Sickening movie tries to engross with action that honestly is mundane and boring. Based on Frank Miller's ho-hum graphic novel. A box office monster that unfortunately has absolutely no critical bite. Turkey (0 stars out of 5)."
"rkeaney","7","4","9","24 March 2007"," Neither as Great nor As Awful as i could have anticipated
","I have been keenly awaiting this movie since i first saw the trailer for it a few months back. I thought wow it's truly amazing what they can do with cgi and it also looks pretty cool i'll definitely check that out. <br/><br/>I went to 300 tonight trying not to keep my hopes up as i could easily be disappointed but what i saw neither amazed me or disappointed me. The special effects are second to none and are truly what carry this film they are breathtaking. The use of rock music really gets your pulse running and is very effective during battle scenes as with the breathtaking slow motion sequences. Although, if i had not seen the trailer for this movie beforehand i would have been much more absorbed in the awe of the special effects. After a while, while still loving it i had seen it all. Still quite amazing though. The acting i would not go so far to say excellent but it held up well and Gerard Butler as King Leonidas was very good at holding such a powerful role. <br/><br/>At parts i did find myself thinking "" why did they put that in?"" "" or is that really necessary?"" but not being a fan of the comic i can't really be one to pass judgement. Ultimately this movie has all the factors to assure it's box office success : Violence,great action scenes, very good music and of course female nudity. These key factors will appeal to all teenage boys who will make the box office success of 300 soar. I thought this movie was very good, not amazing,not a masterpiece but still very good. <br/><br/>Take it from me if your my age you will really enjoy this, I'm fifteen.<br/><br/>Verdict- 7/10 Very enjoyable and some amazing moments make 300 a very good war movie but it does seem to be lacking a killer factor. It's problem was that it was rushed slightly and didn't leave enough time for any real feeling or emotion to set in. Despite that i thought it was very good but unfortunately it doesn't live up to masterpieces in this genre such as gladiator,etc. this is pretty much a throw away epic enjoyable but not extremely rememberable."
"Sevenmercury7","8","4","9","24 March 2007"," Comic book on the big screen
","The comic book generation invades another film genre - this time, the historical epic. I had a fairly good time with '300'; I loved the super-charged fight scenes, enjoyed the painterly backdrops, and thought the royal couple (Butler and Headey) were superb. This could, and should, have been a classic.<br/><br/>The problem here is Frank Miller. Filmmakers seem to worship every pixel of his graphic novels, which is fine, but, translating those words and images to the big screen puts them under greater scrutiny. Do they pass muster? Yes and no. The visuals are punchy and dramatic; many scenes have jaw-dropping lighting and colour. The Spartans look great.<br/><br/>But this is as much a historical film as Lord of the Rings, the obvious inspiration for many of the freaks, monsters and downright fantastical elements on display here. Was the battle of Thermopylae not impressive enough without introducing fantasy? Of course it was. It was the greatest last stand in history. Those embellishments are silly, and rob the movie of any depth it might have had. Miller's freak show might have worked on the page, but I groaned every time a Persian ""orc"" warrior, a Quasimodo, or a nine foot tall god-king appeared on screen.<br/><br/>And Miller's dialogue is embarrassing. These are some of the corniest exchanges of the year. The mantra seems to be: if it works in a comic, it must work on screen. Compare this script to Braveheart's, Spartacus's or, better still, Zulu's (an infinitely better film about a last stand) and '300' is instantly juvenile.<br/><br/>Whatever Snyder would have you believe, '300' is a movie directed by a comic book, filtered through a video game. If it weren't for Butler and Headey, this would be an utterly lifeless experience. Come on, filmmakers, if you have to film a comic, adapt it, give it some depth. Don't just let an artist's imagination run rampant.<br/><br/>Overall verdict: fun but daft."
"K_Todorov","4","4","9","24 March 2007"," It looks good, it's fun to watch but there is something missing
","My initial response after seeing ""300"" was: It's good. Not great, not revolutionary, not garbage, just good. I'm not really familiar with the Frank Miller graphic novel but if it is so close to the movie as a lot of people praised it as, than I doubt I'll be buying it anytime soon. To put it simply ""300"" was good when it was trying to be entertaining but it failed flat when it was trying to create a memorable story with interesting characters.<br/><br/>As stated above this is an adaptation of a graphic novel that itself was a highly stylized version of the legendary battle at the Thermopylae. Where 300 hundred Spartan soldiers led by their king Leonidas withstood a force several times larger, for three days. And the film is just that, one big battle with a simple plot that gives enough reason for the endless amounts of cool moments and one-liners.<br/><br/>There is a moment in the film where Leonidas states that the 300 fight as one unit, I guess in sense that was what Zack Snyder tried to do when he directed the movie. He made the ""300"" one character, and if you look closely you'll see that everyone is practically one and the same, same physical structure, same way thinking, same attitude, same motivation. Leonidas being the most vocal of the group and also the one whose past generalizes theirs. Problem is that this type of character presentation limits the level of attachment one can invest into the members of the ""300"". The plot doesn't help much either. The story is a clear-cut extremely linear black and white tale. The good guys are good, fighting the right cause and the bad guys are bad, fighting the evil cause. There is no moral ambiguity, no inner struggles, no attempts at making any sort of complex narrative. Only an added sub-plot dealing with the Spartan queen and her attempts to send help for Leonidas but that ultimately leads to nowhere. This simplicity leads to inevitable failure of the conclusion. Failure to invoke any feelings, neither sadness, nor regret.<br/><br/>Seeing as most of the dialogue was delivered by yelling it's hard to talk about acting in ""300"". While the other part is spoken in a dry monotonous manner that doesn't leave much of an impression. The dialogue itself doesn't help much either, some of the lines are too overly patriotic while others are just plain cheesy. <br/><br/>The good part in ""300"" is of course it's stylish visual presentation. The CGI effects are at the highlight here, merging almost perfectly with the live action. There are some really memorable moments such as the scene where the 300 look at the sinking Persian ships, the wall of corpses, the scene where they are forcing the Persians off the cliff. Everything looks great. Action scenes are well choreographed a bit too much on the slow-motion but still bearable. Overall Snyder did his job in directing the movie pretty well considering the limitations of the script, the movie was fast, energetic and downright fun to watch. Limbs are flying, blood is squirting by the gallons in all their cinematic glory. It's bloody, it's gory and it's incredibly exhilarating watching all the carnage commence as hordes after hordes of Persians get shred to pieces by the 300. <br/><br/>""300""'s got ""popcorn movie"" written all over it, offering great entertainment for the people who like the fantasy/action genres. A perfect example at how computer effects should be treated in movies. If only it realized it's potential for stronger emotional content by exploiting themes like honor, self-sacrifice or freedom better, then ""300"" would have been even better."
"tnzk","7","4","9","23 March 2007"," Great action film.
","With all the advertisement and hype of 300, I felt obliged to go to one of the very first screenings in my local area. I only expected a through-and-through action film, but after watching 300, I realized it was a whole lot more.<br/><br/>Based on the historical battle at Thermopylae, 300 follows the story of King Leonidas and his group of Spartans (clearly 300 of them), as they hold back wave after wave of Persian soldiers (in the millions).<br/><br/>The story may be simple, but what the 3 writers brought out of it (Zack Snyder, Kurt Johnstad, and Michael Gordon), and of course, Frank Miller is exceptional. The themes aren't so subtle, but for a movie like this, they cannot be. Ideas of Spartan teamwork and glory resonate throughout the entire two hours. The dialogue is sharp, smart, and will be quoted for quite some time. One of the lines that I felt stood out was one of God-King Xerxes, who says: ""Cruel Leonidas required you to stand. I only require that you kneel."" The dialogue would have been nothing without a troupe of good actors, and 300 does not fail in this department. Notable performances include David Wenham, Rodrigo Santoro as Xerxes, and of course, Gerard Butler as King Leonidas. The characters they portray are powerful and charismatic - the passions they excite are appropriately over-the-top. At times though, I felt that Gerard Butler could have said things better than he did, as with these kind of films, there is a fine line between being melodramatic and overdoing it.<br/><br/>For most people who see the movie, it would be because of the striking visuals. It is without a doubt that this film delivers in that respect. Although the state-of-the-art CGI is well on show, what I felt was most awe-inspiring was the direction and cinematography. Quite simply, it was beautiful.<br/><br/>The costumes and props were vibrant and fitting. The CGI polish improved it five-fold.<br/><br/>Zack Snyder has come from no where to being up there with the likes of Peter Jackson and ""Lord of the Rings"" and many of Steven Spielberg's movies. I cannot tell you any single shot that caught my eye, only because it would detract you from many of the other great ones. But rest assured, you will admire at least one of them in 300.<br/><br/>I must comment on the action sequences since people will want to know what they are like. 300 arguably has some of the best new age action sequences since ""The Matrix"". It does use a lot of slow motion techniques like the Wachowski Brothers classic, but unlike other movies, it does it with (ahem) style. If it is only for the action sequences that you go to see 300 for, then you will be satisfied.<br/><br/>A definite must-see that hovers between being a cult hit or blockbuster classic. 9/10"
"JonTid","8","4","9","23 March 2007"," 'This is... Incredible!'
","I recently saw '300' in my local cinema and was blown away by it. I heard a lot of different opinions of the film so i went with an open mind and i really enjoyed it. This film i believe comes close to the greatness of such high class historical movies like 'Braveheart' and 'Gladiator'. The violence, the language, the way its shot are all key aspects into why this movie is so great, not only that its 90% historically accurate which is more than what other movies like this can say. I felt the true spirit of the Spartans and the shear will to fight for their country was shown brilliantly throughout the film and made you want to shout out and cheer when they are slaughtering all those Persians. Also i thought that Gerald Butler was incredible as King Leonidas as i have to say i did doubt him playing such a ruthless leader as the last character i saw him play was the Phantom from 'Phantom of the Opera', yet he certainly carried this character of well. I think that Zack Synder did a wonderful job at directing and i hope he carries on making great movies like this and the 'Dawn of the Dead' remake.<br/><br/>Overall if you like epic movies then this is the one for you or if you liked the way 'Sin City' was shot then i would recommend this for you, saying that i would pretty much recommend it to anyone as this could be one of the best films of the year."
"fd_inuo_fd","10","4","9","20 March 2007"," An excellent movie
","A movie made perfection out of all other action movies. Story of bravest men ever walked the earth and Leonidas' role taken by Gerard was excellently played. I don't think you can ask more in a movie than 300. A pure ingenious perfection, although it hit some sensitive spots of some countries where the Persian Empire ruled over 2000 years ago. Yet you can never complain about the ungoing action and the passion of the battle's importance to King Leonidas and his great words of leadership makes you feel as if you're in the movie yourself and your led by Leonidas to make a last stand. You also cant complain about the racism of the people whom are descendants of Persian Empire, this movie was nearly word for word made from the Graphic Novel 300 by Frank Miller."
"zedextol","2","4","9","20 March 2007"," Timmy, do you like movies about gladiators?
","The first time that I saw a preview for 300 I was giddy. It looked like a visually stunning fantasy, based (loosely) on the epic of King Leonidas and his 300 men. I was sure that I'd love it: I loved Sin City, I enjoy Frank Miller's graphic novels, and I even liked director Zack Snyder's 2004 remake of Dawn of the Dead. Nothing could have prepared me for the sheer stupidity and boredom that encompassed the two hours that I spent in the theater watching this crap-fest.<br/><br/>First off, the only (relative) historical accuracy in the film was the concept: King Leonidas and his 300 Spartan soldiers facing an insurmountable Persian army. You can take that detail however you want. Personally, I have no problem with authors taking liberties when adapting from books, I was just hoping for a bit more depth than the provided ""oiled-down men clad in capes and loin-cloths fight giant sci-fi monsters."" Even more annoying than the lack of accuracy was the blatant inaccuracies: One million Persian soldiers? Even the most generous estimates put the size of the Persian force at no larger than 500,000 (probably closer to 100,000).<br/><br/>Second, it looked like a cartoon. Now I understand that a lot of people will defend this as ""stylistic interpretation,"" or something to that affect, and that's fine. I'm simply saying that nothing looked real in this movie: not the actors, not the landscapes, and certainly not the battles. It looked like CG and surprise, IT WAS! <br/><br/>Third, the dialogue could have been better written by a high-school creative writing flunky. It was so bad that it was laughable. Practically every line delivered by King Leonidas begins with him forcefully yelling ""Spartans,"" then going into some ridiculous diatribe about how they're going to show the enemy what pain really is, or they're going to show the enemy what it means to fear, or they're going to blah, blah, blah... The worst writing in the film probably comes when Leonidas and Xerxes meet for the first time. Not only is it laugh out loud funny, it is also quite possibly the most blatant homo-eroticism that I have ever seen on the big screen. Imagine this if you will: Xerxes is gently caressing the neck of Leonidas, pushed up so close to his back side as to make me personally uncomfortable. He puts his lips up to the King's ear and says something to the effect of ""All I want you to do is to come before me and kneel. If you do this all the worlds pleasure will be yours."" Then Leonidas turns towards him indignantly and says something like ""We Spartans are strong, and hard, getting us to kneel may not be as pleasurable as you think."" Now this may not be exactly what was spoken, but if not, it's basically interchangeable with whatever dialogue was on-screen.<br/><br/>The last point I want to make (but most certainly not the last point that could be made), is the acting in this movie. It is awful, and not in that John Travolta, Battlefield Earth, so bad it's funny sort of way. It is just painful to watch. Leonidas was two moods: angry and more angry. Xerxes has two moods: angry and disheveled. Theron has one mood: treacherous (and I guess kind of angry). If you are beginning to see a theme here, you are correct. All the characters in this movie are boring and one-dimensional, and the acting sucks.<br/><br/>Last thing. I gave this movie two stars instead of one because if you look for the homo-erotic innuendos, it actually becomes quite funny."

I really liked the cinematics, the gore and violence was appalling, for a 15 year old, i would say, this has one to be one of the greatest movies i have ever watched compared to Saving Private Ryan, i mean come on, just watch it yourself and pay close attention to detail.<br/><br/>and uhh if any1 hasn't pointed it out, it wasn't actually ""300"" remember that guy who Leonidas sent to tell the Greek's he was an actor from the Lord of the Rings (Faramir) anyways, it was 299 minus some of the other dead Spartans."

""Spartacus"", ""Braveheart"", and ""Gladiator"" came to mind and so this movie was not on my ""Must See"" list as a movie that would tell a timeless theme with any new insight or awareness.<br/><br/>Never judge a movie by it's trailer. Go see it!!!<br/><br/>For all its Matrix-like slow motion, video game animation overlay on real human beings, and timeless theme retelling that is predictable, the telling of the story is powerful and emotionally engaging. Each element of film, the music, the pacing of the plot, the superb powerful performance of the actors, the artistry, the economy of direction in the battle scenes transports the viewer onto the battlefield to fight side by side, as Spartan, experiencing the heightened sense of awareness, with Leonidas and his queen. The movie moves the viewer to remember that the triumph of the noble human spirit in its freedom will always inspire one to live such a noble life in one's day to day battles against any tyranny, whatever that tyranny may be, to create a better world for those loved.<br/><br/>I look forward to buying it on DVD.<br/><br/>Go see it!!!"

","If nothing else, this film is visually stunning. Any frame of this film could be individually captured, enlarged and hung in an art gallery. Luckily the film, for its own sake, has much more to offer. '300' is an absolute success, one of the few films I have seen recently worth every cent of the ticket price. The film offers a solid plot executed with near flawless cinematography, expert narration and the sort of action that could make Jean Claude Van Damme blush with shame.<br/><br/>Very few films could successfully weave such a condensed amount of action into a wholly compelling storyline and still remain consistent and fresh, and even fewer films can maintain so many violent and gory images while still maintaining such an empathetic and human element. Almost any person should be able to enjoy this movie for one reason or another, be it the already acclaimed cinematography, the compelling storyline, the incredible acting, or just the visual enticement of brightly colored moving pictures flashing upon the screen. '300' is a smashing success.<br/><br/>If you only see one movie this year, you probably don't get out of the house much. If you want to see an incredible movie, go see '300'.

Even the end was very fitting and believable which is a real treat. Casting of mostly B rated or unknowns made this an uncompromising film in respects to who lives or dies, which is what you really want unlike ""the last Samurai"" where Tom Cruise is one of the only survivors of a epic battle.

","The film describes a really inspiring story based on the resistance of king Leonida's men against the Pursian troops. There are of course some historical inconsistencies, e.g. no reference of the 700 Thespians that stood beside the Spartans under the commandment of Demophilos after all the rest had left, the legendary phrase 'come with it or on it' was said by the Spartan mothers when they gave the shield to their sons before they went to war, Leonidas was not the last to die and quite a few more, nevertheless the scenario pretty much reflects the outline of the actual historical event. The artistic and aesthetic design completely fulfilled my expectations and was equivalent to Sin City."
"mOVIemAN56","9","4","9","12 March 2007"," Breathtaking
","The hype to see 300 has been building since September when the first teaser trailer was released and seen in theaters before the Oscar winning film The Departed. After months of anticipation, 300 was finally released nationwide and nearly every theater was sold out. Many are calling the film the wonder of '07, others, the best film since Sin City. I really couldn't formulate and opinion until I saw it for myself. I found the film o be breathtaking.<br/><br/>300 follows the story right up to and including the Battle of Thermopylae. The main character is the King of Sparta, Leonidas. He's a born fighter and a skilled strategist having been raised in the rough society that was Sparta. Problems quickly arise when Persian Emissaries arrive demanding the surrender of Sparta. Leonidas makes sure that Persia knows his answer when he kills the messenger and his guards. The table is set for the invasion to begin and Leonidas marches his men to the sea to make sure Xerxes and his Persian Army does not enter Sparta unopposed.<br/><br/>What follows is two stories. One of the Spartans at Thermopylae and the other of Queen Gorgo trying to convince the Spartan Council to go to war against Persia. Both stories are very interesting and very well written/acted. The story of Gorgo was shown a tad too much but it made it so that the film was not non stop action. Thermopylae is here most of the fun is at in the film.<br/><br/>Gerard Butler is one of those few actors who makes you want o watch a film over and over again. In 300, he's no different. He's powerful, he's smart, and even funny in a few scenes. Butler is able to portray a powerful king willing to die for his men and his family. Gerard Butler is a phenomenal actor who is making a name for himself. Expect nothing short of an amazing performance from him in 300 along with all his other films.<br/><br/>The battle sequences are over the top and incredible. Everything is choreographed but not made to look that way. Snyder used methods similar to the Matrix in filming the battles. Slowing down the camera, moving the camera's suddenly, etc, etc. The battles are not far apart and filled with historical fact of how armies fought (minus the obvious deviation from how a Greek Phalanx actually looked). They are entertaining and breathtaking. No action fan will be disappointed with the battle sequences.<br/><br/>Filming style was a big thing for this film. Everything is shot in front of a blue screen to give a strange effect to the final product. The scenery used is breathtaking though everything is filmed indoors. The blue screen really made the actors focus on their acting rather than other small things in the film. Snyder was able to make us see a graphic novel come alive when he made the film 300.<br/><br/>300 is bold, it's smart, and above all, it's historical fantasy. History buffs shouldn't go to see the film expecting history but instead a fantasy film with some historical facts to it. I prefer the fantasy element, it helped add to the surreal effect that the blue screen helped with. 300 is violent, it's bloody, and it's not for the faint at heart but if you want to see a top action/adventure/fantasy, watch 300.<br/><br/>4.5/5 stars"
"jeff_bennion","10","4","9","11 March 2007"," Spectacular Movie
","Usually, a movie is good because it has a good story line and good acting. This movie adds another dimension - art. Although 300 is a spectacular movie on the first point alone, the art aspect is so absolutely amazing that it has to be mentioned.<br/><br/>1. Plot/Acting - the plot of this movie is not unique. 300 against many. But, 300 takes that storyline and makes it its own. You get unique character development, plot twists, and unique battle sequences. That being said, it is a movie about war. There are a lot of battle scenes. The movie is not overly bloody and violent to the point where it becomes grotesque or distracting, like Texas Chainsaw Massacre, but there is plenty of blood and violence. The acting is good. There were never any parts of the movie where the acting was lacking or the bad acting was distracting. The acting was convincing and led into the great character development.<br/><br/>2. Art - Chances are, you've seen a trailer or pictures from this movie. The art design and rendering is absolutely amazing. The whole movie is a piece of art. It's like 1 billion carefully created painted masterpieces made into movie film. Every scene is amazing. There is some cgi, but it is done really well and it does not dominate the film like you see nowadays. The creatures/mutants are great. The colors play a good role in this movie. The Spartans have dark red cloaks and it just looks really cool on the back ground of the battle scenes and the sunsets. Sparta and the Greek buildings are done really well.<br/><br/>I also want to address some of the negative comments that have been left about this movie. When I got home from the movie theater, I immediately checked IMDb to see what rank this movie got. For the first time in my life, I could not imagine anyone not giving a movie a 10. I was surprised to see that it was only about 8.5. I checked the negative comments to see what the people who didn't like it were saying. Once I read the comments (they all hit the same couple of topics), it all became clear. There are a few main issues that people have with this movie.<br/><br/>The first is the alleged gay bashing. There are I think two references to gay people. They are both derogatory. They are both made in the context of something like, ""I'm glad we have solid soldiers on the field and not those gay philosophers from Athens."" First of all, without ever addressing whether that is appropriate to say or not, this is a statement made by a general and a king from Sparta, probably the most testosterone driven society in history. Secondly, if you were going into battle, who would you rather have at your side? A gay philosopher or a Spartan? I'm not saying that being gay makes you weaker, but empirically, gay people are more effeminate than straights.<br/><br/>There were also a few related comments about sexism. There are a few moments where the politicians make comments about how the queen should stay out of the political affairs because she is a woman. First of all, it is believable that that is how politics was run back then. Some cultures still believe that. Is there anyone out there that can say that it is a coincidence that in the last 200 years, all of the US presidents have been men? Imagine how it was almost 3000 years ago in villages and tribes. It is no more offensive to depict women as having no say in politics 3000 years ago, as it is to make a movie about slavery 200 years ago. That's just the way it was. No one is saying that is the way it should be now, but they are just depicting the way it was. Secondly, The queen is given a very powerful role. The king respects and loves her and seeks her advice and listens to her as do the other politicians. This was the dumbest argument I saw.<br/><br/>The next argument is that this movie depicts Iranians in a derogatory light. This is absolutely ridiculous. It's a movie about one side against the other. The Persian army was huge and to make the movie more interesting, they created strange creatures/soldiers from the opposing army and there were myths about the sorcery of the Persians. I cannot imagine one person walking out of 300 thinking, ""Man, I sure do hate Iranians more now."" It's just as ridiculous as saying that the movie the Ten Commandments paints present day Egyptians in a bad light. Everyone knows that Arabs had a great culture back then and that they invented a lot of things. Baseless argument.<br/><br/>The next argument is that this movie is not historically accurate. This is also a stupid argument for one reason: it's a movie. If there were a disclaimer in the beginning saying, ""This film is meant to educate you about actual events,"" then the whining might be better understood. But, 300 takes something that happened a long time ago and puts a unique spin on it and adds a few interesting characters and plot lines to create a 2 hour feature film - just like Tombstone, Braveheart, and Ten Commandments. Who cares if things actually happened the way they are depicted in the movie? I can't imagine anyone expecting this movie to accurately depict history.<br/><br/>The next argument is that this movie is politically based and represents America's war on terror against Arabs. They were really digging from the bottom of the barrel to make this argument. No one thought that about Alexander, so why do they think that about this movie? It's ridiculous.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a spectacular movie. I can't wait for the behind the scenes footage."
"kyron40k3","9","4","9","11 March 2007"," ...with chopped limbs, spilled blood, and a total disregard for realism, by God it's a story well told.
","Review: 300 - Directed by Zack Snyder Rated R for graphic battle sequences throughout, some sexuality and nudity.<br/><br/>In the world of graphic novels, few are as revered or critically acclaimed as Frank Miller and Lynn Varley's 300. Epic, beautiful, and brutal, it's 88 pages of pure machismo drenched in blood and sweat and presented in the larger than life boldness of sickly earth-tones and deep crimson. Where it counts, director Zack Snyder (Dawn of the Dead remake) translates this unique look to his big screen adaptation of Frank Miller's masterpiece. However, as is often the case with comic to movie attempts, some things work best only on paper.<br/><br/>In 300, Spartan King Leonidas (Gerard Butler) leads (surprise) 300 of his finest warriors into battle against the vast Persian armies of King Xerxes. Outnumbered beyond reason, Leonidas chooses to make his stand at the 'Hot Gates', a twisted mountain path facing the sea where the vastness of the Persian army will be of no use. Meanwhile, on the home front, Queen Gorgo (Lena Headey) struggles with the corrupt and complacent Greek senate to send reinforcements to aid in the King's battle.<br/><br/>What I enjoyed so greatly about Frank Miller's 300 graphic novel was the relentless pacing of the story. Fairly short by graphic novel standards, there was nary a page that went by without stunning imagery of violent combat. The focus was placed firmly on the heroism and intractability of Leonidas and his men, with brief flashbacks filling in the less important buildup to the battle. But although the battle sequences in the 300 film were an almost frame-per-frame copy of the graphic novel, the movie as a whole takes on a different feel than its source.<br/><br/>Quite unlike the fierce compactness of the novel, more than a few parts of Snyder's 300 felt like unwarranted filler. Don't get me wrong, the primary focus is still on Spartan bravery in gloriously gory clashes, but the added story of Queen Gorgo and Theron seemed tacked on. Breaking up the pace of the action, these scenes do little but increase 300's runtime.<br/><br/>Although much of the acting in 300 involved little else then looking beefy and being able to recite your lines whilst shouting, Gerard Butler and crew do an admirable job humanizing the godlike Spartan warriors. Likewise, Rodrigo Santoro's portrayal of King Xerxes is, at the very least, unsettling.<br/><br/>Overly dramatic and unnecessarily deep at times, 300 is still the story of one of the most epic battles in human history. And with chopped limbs, spilled blood, and a total disregard for realism, by God it's a story well told. With ear-shatteringly powerful sound effects and dazzling visual flair, 300 is guaranteed to blow you to the back of your seat. This is one movie that you will not soon forget.<br/><br/>Rating: 4.5 / 5"
"liufrancesca","7","4","9","11 March 2007"," a little vulgar
","I'm not sure this movie was as good as all the hype is making it out to be. I think yes visually it is very strong. I thought it was animated when I first say the preview; I didn't realize it was real people until I was watching the film. I think it captured the epic sentiment it was going for. The speeches made by the characters were powerful, and the acting was good. But, there were parts of the film that dragged; I found my mind wandering a little bit. Another problem I had were the graphic sex scenes. I really didn't think they were necessary. A lot of younger kids were in my theater and it just didn't seem appropriate or needed to show the strength in the relationship between the king and queen.<br/><br/>I liked that the queen is a strong character. It is good to see strong female characters especially since they are often overlooked in history. I like that the king really respected her opinion and looked to her for advice. I think this movie is definitely worth watching, but I don't think it will be one of the best films of the year."
"eternal-bmf","8","4","9","10 March 2007"," Holy Crap! (in a good way)
","I went in with high expectations considering who was in on this (Frank Miller of Sin City and Comic Book fame). That usually results in me leaving upset at having wasted time and money on some piece of crap. Not in this case! Visually I haven't seen a movie this sweet looking since the first Matrix. The difference; where Matrix was subtle with its green colors inside the matrix and other less than obvious effects to keep us guessing, 300 is just beautiful to watch, look at, and very in your face! There is one GLARING flaw in the cinematography though. Despite the obvious amount of time, money, and effort that was spent making this production appear a certain way they at some point decided to save money on the blood effects. It is so obviously a crude c.g.i. effect that is very poorly done and acts nothing at all what I would think blood would act like. And believe me, there are buckets of blood spewn in this epic. There was also little to no character development. We pretty much get a few minutes of intro into the situation before we start into the ""We are Spartans and bow to no man"" scenario. The movie could have EASILY benefited from another half hour of screen time in which they introduced and developed some of the characters in more detail. While the movie is in the same vein as Braveheart or Gladiator you just don't care as much for the actors as you would in those movies. Other than the action side there is a chance to develop some political issues as the empire faces impending war. They are torn between whether or not to support the 300 without provocation, or even whether or not to do so at all. Yet this side is hardly delved into despite it being a very big part of the situation. The fact they spent just a bit of time on this side of the story aggravated me as this explained in more detail what was going on than the fights did. Expect some creative license to be taken in this movie. Despite the fact they claim it is based on actual events there are some unbelievable characters, actions, situations. While this is a bit of a negative when someone bases something on reality the movie never comes off as being anything more than a good story, and is even presented as such. Because of this I am not sure if this is a valid complaint but something that stuck with me none the less.<br/><br/>Despite these MINOR issues this was one of the few times I was more than happy to spend $4 for a soda and sit amongst a bunch of strangers (not to mention my brother's driving). This movie was just plain f'ing great and I am going to buy the DVD the second it hits shelves. Spend the few bucks and go see it if you are into these types of movies. Hell...check it out even if you aren't, you won't be disappointed!"
"TexasGhirl","10","4","9","10 March 2007"," WOW - Just WOW
","Just an FYI, I'm a 50+ Grandmother. I don't watch gory movies. I thought ""Alexander"" and ""Troy"" were boring. However, I discovered Frank Miller in ""Sin City"" and was hooked. Yes, I liked the gory stuff in ""Sin City."" I thought the way it was filmed was innovative.<br/><br/>So, I have waited for ""300"" for an entire year and watched all of the trailers. And listened to all the pre-hype.<br/><br/>Still, you wonder if you will be disappointed in the actual movie. I wasn't.<br/><br/>Even though I had watched the trailers and knew a lot of the dialogue, it still has a WOW factor. Unlike Sin City, the bloody parts weren't gruesome. The fight scenes were like a ballet. I liked the slo-mo so that you can tell what's actually happening. The rest of the audience responded the same way I did. Just an awesome movie. And, unlike some of the so-called ""critics,"" I thought the acting was very well done. Not tooooo over the top. Just enough. And I didn't mind the modern comments (""We're in for one wild night."" ""You obviously don't know our women"").<br/><br/>Lena Headley IS a Spartan Woman. Not a huge part, but a HUGE part of the story. She speaks very fluently just with her facial expressions. Lena in the love scene was strictly ""For The Boys."" But the Gerard Butler moonlight scene was eye-candy for the girls! Yes, I'm a big Gerard Butler fan, but I don't think all of his movies are Oscar-worthy. This one, however, is the changing point for him. He IS King Leonides. I don't think anyone else would have done as good a job as he did. This one will make Hollywood sit up and take note.<br/><br/>I WILL go to see this one again. And I hope it stays in the theaters for awhile and not to DVD too soon. I think it needs the big screen to handle the big scenes. Guess I'll have to buy a 50"" TV for home!"
"razvanu","8","4","9","9 March 2007"," Worth the money
","I just saw this in theaters 3 hours ago. I was looking forward to it, and it paid off. It's a good movie to see in theaters. I cannot be very sure about the historical accuracy (I forgot the details of the Battle f Thermopylae) but I am pretty sure this is not bent towards accuracy, but towards entertainment. That said, it is indeed good entertainment. The battle scenes are not a random amalgamation of blood and gore, and the rest of the scenes are pretty meaningful.<br/><br/>If I were to compare it to something like Gladiator, I would say that 300 has more of the ""cool"" factor, if you will. It is made to make you go ""wow"", whereas Gladiator is made to be more intricate.<br/><br/>Overall, it is worth the money. If the trailer caught your eye, go for it! You will probably not be disappointed. But If you are a history keener, maybe try saving the 10$."
"alpha3760","9","4","9","8 March 2007"," Perfect Payback movie
","The first few minutes of the film were slow, but necessarily slow, as you were given background information you needed on Sparta to know why these people were the people they were. But once it kicked into the actual story it was awesome.<br/><br/>The action was solid, the acting was excellent except that someone needs to explain to Gerard Butler that louder doesn't always mean more powerful. But then again this is a ""comic book"" movie with a ""larger than life"" feel to it. This is quite a contradiction of a film in that it is both grotesque and beautiful. It is gory and shows the raw brutality of the life and war even more forcefully by showing the beauty of it as well. This combined with the dry, deadpan humor and testosterone dripping banter between the men throughout, provided the necessary moments for the audience to take a deep breath between the horrors.<br/><br/>I saw it on a regular screen, but it screams to be on IMAX. But be prepared, sometimes the cheering of the audience drowned out the actors."

","I saw this movie much later than I probably should have. The only reason I knew about this movie was because of the once ubiquitous ""this is Sparta"" meme. I noticed that it was about to start playing on TV, so I decided to check it out. I found that the movie really only has one redeeming quality which keeps it interesting: its epic battle sequences. I have two main complaints about this movie. <br/><br/>First, the green screen effects are just not convincing. They came off as being exceptionally low quality for a big-budget film of the time. Secondly, the plot is nearly impossible to follow. I couldn't figure out for the life of me why the Spartans were at war. I had so many other questions, too. How did this war come to be? Why were there only 300 warriors? What is the relationship between Sparta and the nation they are at war with? I feel like so much context is missing.<br/><br/>It is for these reasons that I have decided to give the movie a 6/10."

"ironhorse_iv","8","3","6","20 July 2013"," 300 is testosterone full over the top movie! Still, it's a good watch.
","300 is an awesome film from Director Zack Snyder. Before this movie is over, the world will know, that free men stood against a tyrant, that few stood against many, and that even a god king can bleed. While it's not historic accurate, it still was a great film. Still, I wasn't looking for something historically accurate because I knew that it was based off of the graphic novel by Frank Miller. As an interpretation of a graphic novel, it's works. Most of the film was shot in blue screen, so that later on, the comic book graphics lighting visual effects could be added on. The film is full of slow motion and bullet time that gives the film, its graphic novel action feel. It can be a bit annoying at time, as nothing in the film seem real to history. The film is a shot-for-shot adaptation of the comic book that it become less a live action movie, and more like a looking into a CGI orgy animation movie. The film makes the real life harsh Battle of Thermopylae seem like a woman and gay man wet dream fantasy. While it's clear that the movie mock homosexual and other sexual acts by making the Persian King, Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro), the villain monstrosity and play Spartan King Leonida (Gerald Butler) as the protector of heterosexual norms. In real life, Spartans were known for their homosexual. The Spartans actually had no problem with homosexual activities and would have been unlikely to use this as a reason to look down among someone. The movie wants to be this non apologetic celebration of masculinity, but it only semi works. One thing I found odd about the film is the lack of clothes the Spartans are wearing. I know in the graphic novel, they fought in the nude. I can understand not fighting in anything, most likely because they didn't want to show fear, but in real life fact, I think a real Spartan would have worn body armor, like leg and chest plates, and at the very least would have had crests on their helmets to protect themselves. The film is about 300 Spartan warriors that help protect Greece against the invading Persian army during the Persian-Greco War. Spartan King Leonida's army was deeply outnumber by the larger Persian force lead by King Xerxes and force to do one last stand at Thermopylae as a last ditch attempt to save his country. The Battle of Thermopylae also known as the Hot Gates was not the same as its view on this film. For one thing, there wasn't only 300 soldiers there. According to Herodotus, 5,200 Greeks held the pass for three days against 2,600,000 Persians This battle actually happened, it's just the movie was so ridiculously inaccurate that it makes it look like it like Greek was going to war with 300, ripped, Chippendale dancers. The character of Ephialtes (Andrew Tiernan) is another instance of inaccuracy in the historical movie 300. He was a pretty normal man, however, in the movie he is shown as being severely disfigured and an outcast among the people. It is insinuated that his life should have been ended when he was a baby because of his hump back and that he was undeserving of life. This is pretty harsh. The film felt anti-disability. The movie tries too hard to make the Sparta society seem like it's a country that represent freedom and way of life. In truth, the Spartans were less democracy, and more like a caste system or fascism where few were truly free, and others were in slave. This is Sparta! In no way was Sparta life any better than the Persian life. Athens were more democracy then Sparta. There was a lot of controversial about the whole Middle East VS Western Culture feel of the film. A lot of Iranians got offended by the film. Still, it's a very entertaining adaption of a real life battle of tens of thousands against 300 soldiers using superior tactics to upset the battlefield. The Spartans fought primarily defensively only once in a way breaking formation. In the film, I think they broke formation way too much to be taken serious. I enjoyed every actor's performances. Still, I didn't see much of the supporting cast in Leonida's army standing out. The only other actors besides Butler, Tiernan and Santoro that stood out was Lena Headey's Queen Gorgo. I do find David Wenham narrating great as Dilinos. I liked the unique visual style the movie had going on, the action scenes were pretty kickass too. I think everybody love 'This is Sparta' kick scene. The soundtrack by Tyler Bates was boundless intense. The violence might be gory, and outrageous, still the movie is so popular, that a sequel was created. If you like 300, also check out the book ""Gates of Fire"", it's a good read. So prepare for glory and get dinner ready for the movie because tonight, we dine in glorious hell."
"Boromir28","10","3","6","21 July 2012"," Close to perfection
","The movie 300 is a magnificent cinematic feat. The pacing, the acting, the action and not to mention the cinematography. The look and feel of this movie surpasses other comic book movies where the source material is actually the storyboards. Movies like Sin City and Watchmen are good movies, but 300 manages to take it to another level. It's tight and lean. <br/><br/>The plot of the movie is that the Persian army under the self-proclaimed god Xerxes is on the march to world domination. Their plan is to reach the European continent after taking over all of Asia Minor. But the Spartan King Leonidas refuses to be ruled as the entire Spartan code is derived from the notion of free will, and the Spartans way of maintaining that freedom is by being the best soldiers in the entire world. From infancy the male children are weighed and measured and if found wanting hurled to the wild animals. There is simply no room for weakness in the Spartan world. <br/><br/>Leonidas marches off with 300 of his best men, under strong objections from the counsel and the in direct contradiction of the will of the gods, to stop the oncoming Persian hoards. He bottle necks them into a narrow mountain passage known to this day as the Hot Gates and the fiercest battles ensue. <br/><br/>This movie thrives by its action sequences and taking at a glance you would think there is nothing more to this movie. You would, however, be cheating yourself to a fantastic piece of cinema. The acting equals in my opinion the visual side, helped a great deal by a tight and funny script. The characters are of course over the top but in this sort of movie they have to be. The Spartans live by the sword and all they crave for in life is a good death. Therefore their moral code has to be far and above what we today would find reasonable. <br/><br/>Three characters who illustrate this is Leonidas played by Gerard Butler, Stelios played by Michael Fassbender and the Captain played by Vincent Regan. Butler and Fassbender are by now the most famous of the three mentioned, but the character that is best fleshed out is the Captain. Vincent Regan brings a sadness to the role that makes the Captain the most believable character of the bunch. Joining the 300 is his son so you know that he more than the rest of them, has emotions tied up in this even though they all are tough guys. He doesn't have that much screen time but his presence in the scenes lends a kind of voice of reason to the small army. He and the King are the only ones in the army who seem to understand that there is no way 300 men over time can stand their ground against a million Persians, they know this but still don't care. Fassbender plays the young soldier who is incredibly ""gung ho"". He and the Captain's son form a striking friendship and together they are a menacing force able to take on 30 men all by themselves, because they understand each other and know how they both move on the battlefield. Even though he is young there is nothing he craves more than ""a good death"" as he explains to an Athenian soldier (the Athenians have joined forces with the Spartans to overthrow the yoke of tyranny), and he seeks it in every battle relentlessly. <br/><br/>Everything in this movie is perfect: the acting, the story, the action, the cinematography, the costumes, the makeup, the score everything comes together so incredibly well in this movie. <br/><br/>If you are a fan of movies than this is a must see movie. Nothing in this movie is out of place, pace or sync. It works on all levels."

","""300"" is a lousy movie, just another stylized crap: heavy on style, light on substance. Lack of characterization, detailed back story and necessary sub-plots, the film eventually fails to deliver true drama or tension, and turns out to be a kinda flick, only teenage computer-game nerds and avid Frank Miller fans will really love.<br/><br/>For me, the film is just 15-minutes long exercise, that's all. Its most interesting sequence comes at the very beginning: Leonidas' hardcore childhood, where we learn that the Spartan babies were examined at birth for any deformity or failure. Unfit and maimed babies were thrown to a pile of infant bones below the hill. If they survived after nine days, they were considered strong enough to remain in Sparta. Actually, nothing that follows and from that point the film wastes no time getting into the virtual bloodfest, where a bunch of hyped and sinewy Spartan bunnies with oiled torsos and leather nappies start going berserk, severing heads and spraying blood. Even half-assed political intrigues can not save the day.<br/><br/>This is not a documentary, so don't expect any historical accuracy. Fearless, valiant and admirable Greeks are pitted against freakish, tricksy and evil Persians. Let's say the truth: manly Westerners v.s. effeminate Orientals. From Scottish-accented Spartan King Leonidas to flamboyantly bejeweled and androgynous Persian Godking Xerxes, all characters are less than one-dimensional and none is more believable than the other.<br/><br/>It seems that the biggest problem of ""300"" is the slavish, frame-to-frame devotion to Miller's material, relying entirely on CGI to bring Miller's imagery to the big screen. Creating gorgeously saturated synthetic backgrounds and pasting stereotypical characters into these surreal world is not a big deal in today's CGI technology unless you can bring those images to life. In that sense ""300"" needs more story, sub-plots, depth and proper character development."

","After skipping this movie in the theater, I rented it on the recommendation of some friends who thought it a fun action flick.<br/><br/>I don't know what to say to them.<br/><br/>Sweet lord, this is an awful movie! Ten minutes into it, I was praying for someone to spear the narrator, who spoiling what little plausible drama there was by constantly spouting overwrought, simple-minded blowhard macho declarations that would not have been out of place in an old Ed Wood flick like ""Plan 8 From Outer Space"". Gerard Butler and Lena Headly do their best to sell their characters, but every scene is undercut by the ridiculous jockey shorts and long red cloaks the Spartans wear by way of costumes. More so when, in several non-combat scenes, the actors seem to be treading carefully to avoid tripping over their cloaks.<br/><br/>The number of perfectly sculpted, shaved, and oiled male bodies constantly on display suggests that what the director really wanted to make was a gay porn version of ""Spartacus"". From the clips I'd seen before, I harkened back to the bad old days of Italian body-builder films about Hercules and various gladiators. Actually looking at the film, this comparison didn't work. In the old, cheesy Italian movies, the actors where sculpted and stiff above and below their necklines. In ""300"", there are some good actors at work, but their realistic, emotive faces look like they were pasted on their pale, polished chests.<br/><br/>There are any number of things weirdly wrong with this movie. In spite of all the money and CGI expended on it, the battle scenes look underpopulated and cheap. At no point was I ever convinced that there were actually a full 300 Spartans following Leonidas around. Fifty, tops, in the wheat field shot, where they are walking down an immaculately mowed lane between the stalks of grain. Don't believe for a minute the director's claim the movie is ""90% accurate"" historically. There is virtually nothing here other than a few scenes on Spartan culture that ever existed in anything but the writer or director's sculpted and well-oiled imaginations.<br/><br/>I suppose than anyone who can suspend their disbelief enough to enjoy pro wrestling can enjoy ""300"" at that level, and apparently enough people did to make it a box office success. However, for anyone else, the ghastly, fake, macho high school locker dialog is more insulting than the silly Spartan costumes or the parade of implausible monsters the Spartans fight.<br/><br/>So, fun if you can ignore pretty much every factor that usually makes a movie more interesting than a hack 'n slash video game. Other than that, try ""Gladiator"" or, if you're desperate, ""Troy"" for your ancient warfare fix."

","I must have watched thousands of movies, and this is one of only two I've not been able to finish. After an hour of the most ludicrously overdone CGI cartoon characters we gave up. I might as well have played a computer game. The lack of character development was only accentuated by this paucity of 'real' filmic development. Characters pop up out of nowhere, or are mysteriously transported with no effort across miles of landscape without so much as breaking sweat, or, indeed, eating anything (clearly the Director had never heard of Napoleon's adage about an army marching on its stomach). The whole texture of the is one of a computer game, rather than the genre of film in which we are invited to enter a world which is 'real' to humanity. The film is gibberish."
"robram60","2","3","6","17 August 2007"," more cartoon than movie
","Watching ""300"" was like reading a comic book or watching a video game -- visually entertaining with often impressive production values, but ultimately distancing itself from its subject matter. If you were looking for compelling drama or narrative, it wasn't to be found here.<br/><br/>With its cartoonish conception and often overblown dialogue, it generated little sympathy or empathy for any of its characters, and gave little opportunity for some of its fine actors to create more than one-dimensional cutout portrayals. This robbed the film of any substantive depth, and reduced it to mostly eye candy for moviegoers who enjoy CGI effects and/or multiple scenes of gore and slow motion decapitations.<br/><br/>I suppose the whole action/fantasy genre of movie-making is more motivated to entertain and excite than move its viewers, but this film should have offered more, as it drew its material from historical accounts. What could have potentially been a well told story enhanced by the amazing computer technology of today to provide grandeur and sweep, instead became something more akin to a Power Station game."

Unfortunately there are people who aren't blessed with any logic who say: 1) this is a right-wing propaganda movie (meanwhile the entire news industry has been loaded with left-wingers, and most of Hollywood is all liberal, but that's OK) 2) this movie is about freedom vs darkness and tyranny - and these people are against freedom? They are all hypocrites and have no logic.

The biggest negative however was that the whole movie was too CGI'd for me, and a movie that's supposed to be bloody wasn't bloody but digitalized so it was utter crap.<br/><br/>I'm glad I didn't actually spend money on this in the theater or by rental."
"Buddy-51","7","3","6","16 April 2007"," an advancement or a regression? You decide
","I guess it's true that everything old is eventually new again.<br/><br/>In the early days of movie-making - thanks primarily to budgetary restraints and the logistical problems raised by having to work with primitive sound equipment - directors rarely ventured outdoors to film even their most epic-type adventures. Instead, they were forced to do their filming mainly on a soundstage, shooting their actors in front of a painted backdrop or - when it became available - a more technologically advanced ""blue screen,"" which allowed them to add an array of previously impossible special effects to the picture as well. Then, in the 1950's and 1960's, facing stiff competition from a burgeoning new medium known as television, filmmakers turned to ""on-location"" shooting as a means of both increasing the realism of their pictures and drawing people back to the theaters. This was seen as a great leap forward for the movies both as an art form and as a business. <br/><br/>Now, in 2007, Hollywood would appear to have come full circle with ""300,"" a rousing sword-and-sandal epic that has been filmed entirely in a studio, using only CGI effects to recreate its ancient Mediterranean setting. Ironically, this is being hailed as a great ""innovation"" by the very youngsters who would be yelling ""That looks so fake"" at all the similar themed movies from the 1930's and 1940's. Go figure.<br/><br/>If ""300"" has the look and feel of a comic book or video game, that is clearly no accident, for it comes from the highly acclaimed graphic novel by Frank Miller and Lynn Varley. The story is based on the Battle of Thermopylae, which took place in 480 B.C. between the Persians, with a fighting force estimated at between 60,000 to 300,000 soldiers, and the Spartans, with a force of a mere 300 (plus around 700 Thespian volunteers). The Spartans, trained from childhood to be professional fighters, ended up losing the battle but not before inflicting heavy losses on the Persian army and becoming a symbol and a source of inspiration for all those unafraid to march into battle despite tremendous odds against them.<br/><br/>If it weren't for its unique look, there wouldn't be much to distinguish ""300"" from a hundred other action films. The characters are wafer-thin and stereotypical, and the movie evinces a kind of xenophobia that is more than a trifle disconcerting in a world in which relations between the East and West are none too friendly in the first place. All the Spartans, including their leader, King Leonidas, are light-skinned, noble warriors, while the Persians are dark-skinned, ignoble barbarians, whose general, King Xerxes, comes across as a lisping, mincing, make-up-wearing drag queen. The dialogue and narration, provided by Kurt Johnstad, Michael Gordon, and director Zack Snyder, is invariably cheesy, corny and insufferably self-important, while the actors Gerald Butler, Rodrigo Santoro and Lena Headey pretty much fade into the obscurity of the computer-generated background.<br/><br/>But trying to evaluate ""300"" apart from its visuals would be as meaningless as judging ""Jurassic Park"" without its dinosaurs. For the look of the picture is what ""300"" is clearly all about, and on that level, the movie succeeds spectacularly. The sepia-toned images of roiling land- and sky-scapes, massing armies, and storm-tossed oceans are indeed something to behold and give the film an otherworldly quality that goes a long way towards mitigating the weaknesses in the acting and writing. Even the ultra-violent, blood-soaked battle scenes, though a trifle redundant after awhile, take on a legendary quality thanks to the unreal aura of the scene.<br/><br/>""300"" is an interesting enough experience as a one-time thing, but I hope it doesn't signal a long term trend in movie-making. Personally, I rather like the great outdoors."
"adinutzza2001","3","3","6","14 April 2007"," Movie or video game??
","I'm not exactly a fan of action movies, but I am not against violent scenes and fights as long as there is a good plot with them. That's what I was expecting from this movie: an interesting storyline together with great film graphics. I only got the second part: the ultimate movie graphics of gratuitous violence, which in itself can't really make a movie worth watching for me.<br/><br/>During the whole movie I felt that everything was overly dramatized and over the top, which actually prevented one from caring for those characters. No character depth, all was black or white, the handsome brave Spartans and the evil Persian monsters. No real history reference to make the movie the least realistic: good and evil were simply hyperbolised up to the point the scenes became comic or grotesque. The movie had a great potential to build a good story over the historical background of the Spartans, but ended up totally predictable and with basically no plot. From the very start when including those monsters, it seemed this movie wasn't trying to portray any historical or human reality, but just shock and impress through its graphics. And apparently most of the people fell for it. Just as much a video game could do, but this is not what I am expecting from a movie.<br/><br/>Not to mention the sexual scenes (since this sells best and is in line with the good plot), the first one ridiculous in slow motion, the one with the hunchback simply gross. Then the very witty ending, when all 298 die (since basically we had only seen one dying through the whole slaughter until then, while another is gone to let spartans know the tragedy).<br/><br/>This film leaves one so totally numb to all the human suffering and so distant to the historical reality and the characters, that it equals playing a video game. If this is what people want to see: men slaughtered, blood and flesh to exclaim after it ""That was really cool"", why bother and make a film of it and not the ultimate playstation game?"

The first battle scene was pretty cool, but after that it was all the same. Even though the movie through in war elephants, rhinoceroses and hand grenades, (all of which were very inaccurate for the time period) it still didn't make up for its overall lack of story, acting, and character development. being so bored by the end of the film, I was pointing out things I didn't not like, particularly Xerses being 8 feet tall and and bald.

I have never played a violent video game, so I do not know whether this is true or not, but irrespective of that the movie stands on its own feet with no overt resemblance to a video game, until told by someone.<br/><br/>The story is simple. In 480 BC, Sparta ¬ñ a small kingdom in Greece defends the attack by Persian might with 300 soldiers called Spartarians; who die but unite Greece to fight the Persians. It is based on a graphic novel by Frank Miller.<br/><br/>Zack Snyder the director of the movie has successfully created a graphical canvass suitable to the novel and maintains a painting look with high contrast ¬ñ blue and brown colors and hue that create a feeling of every scene being a piece of art. Zack has also co-written the screenplay and there he has failed to recreate the historical context of the time. There are several drawbacks to the film, namely; the dialogues lack punch (and are sometimes laughable), the softer scenes even though having the silence lack depth, and the most jarring one is the contemporary and political context hinted in the movie that disturbs and stands out as a sore thumb.<br/><br/>Gerard Butler plays the role of the King Leonidas of Sparta with perfection. The remaining casts are okay and no special mention is required. The battle scenes are shot amazingly but are violently graphic. Astonishingly with all the blood splattering around in the battle the bodies of warriors and the ground always remain without a drop of blood on them. Zack should had noticed and painted this detail inside.<br/><br/>Overall a good experience to see a different type of visual movie; the director could have made it much more better than it is now with a better adaptation.<br/><br/>(Stars 5.5 out of 10)"
"edodin","4","3","6","24 March 2007"," Great choreography in a astonishing piece of propaganda
","From the point of view of images this movie definitely follows the path open by ""Sin City"", another movie from Frank Miller's comics. It is very well made with an amazing use of contrast between brilliant colors and shades of darkness. The sets are very suggestive and the photography really impresses the viewer. The acting is not bad at all especially in the person of King Leonidas (by the way Spartans always had two kings at the same time. In fact while Leonidas was fighting, Pausanias, his brother, was ruling the city). But the best part of the movie id definitely the choreography of the battle scenes. A lot of scenes are filmed in slow time but the action moves, apart from the goriness, are very impressive and convey the absolute mastery of war of the Spartan warriors. The qualities of the movie stop here. The rest of it is really an annoying piece of historical errors but above all a disturbing example of propaganda for the current war that US is waging against the evil in the world. Let's first address the claim that the Spartans are fighting for the freedom of the people in Greece. Nothing more far from the truth. Sparta was one of the most totalitarian society in ancient history. The dominance of the warrior class was possible due to the diminished condition of a much larger chunk of the population (Perioeci) that was devoted to cultivate the land and do menial jobs, and to slaves (Helots) owned by the state. This people were treated like an inferior class for the only benefit of the dominating warrior cast. Not what you would call a democracy. So why Leonidas claims, in the movie, more than once that he is fighting for freedom? Is the movie trying to set an example of sacrifice for the better freedom of all? Well, if that is the case sorry you got the wrong example. And what about the Persians? Well actually, at that historical time, the Persian empire was the most civilized and ancient society existing (if one excludes the Egyptians). Besides that, is there any reason to make Persian soldiers (the immortals in particular) look deformed and so blatantly evil? Moreover they obey this King, Xerses I, that proclaims himself a god and make them kill in his name. Aren't there too many analogies? Persia is pretty much the Iran-Iraq of today, people killing in the name of god sound too much like some Muslim fanatics, soldiers looking like monsters (the so called immortals) give a sense of absolute evil. This is all too much. I was expecting a good action movie, an inspiration to the strength of few against the sheer power of the many and it all ended up as a pure propaganda for the current state of war. This movie, from this point of view is not only disappointing but insulting to the intelligence of the viewer."
"socrates99","9","3","6","11 March 2007"," The only real flaw in this movie is that it follows Frank Miller's story TOO closely
","It would have been better to have made different, grander, artistic choices in several places in this very impressive movie. As it is, it's as if someone had challenged the director to animate Frank Miller's graphic novel, and the director decided to make his overwhelming skill and ability indisputable by doing just that, almost as if by sheer magic. <br/><br/>For example, Gerard Butler, who in my opinion turns in a perfect performance as King Leonidas, in several places is indistinguishable with the comic's image, an image which, though arresting, I would have bet my next child was pure fantasy and impossible to find in the flesh. I was so wrong, I'm a little rattled. But why deny the fear that must have been his last emotion before setting out for the Hot Gates? Forget the comic book, his real courage would have been his overcoming that fear for the greater good.<br/><br/>And Lena Headey as Queen Gorgo positively exudes passion and loyalty, and sensuality too. It's hard to believe anyone other than a King would try to be her match. But what woman truly thinks her husband's glorious death is preferable to his presence, no matter what the stakes?<br/><br/>No, someone should have challenged Zack Snyder to base his movie on the novel, but to improve it anyway he thought fit. This movie could have been so much more, and I feel the loss. Still, as it is, it's going to be impossible for any male, at least, to forget. I knew the story before, and it's more complicated than shown here, but where the ancient narratives are sketchy, Miller and Snyder have filled in beautiful scenarios that evoke what the reality must have been. That took real love for the event and the people who lived it in real life."

The scenes are delivered with a rote performance more worthy of a B-movie without the fun.<br/><br/>The camera work in this film is intriguing but out of place. The movie is shot almost as a series of still images between pulses of action or dialog, kind of a heart-beat affect on the motion of the film. The problem is this is basically an action and those slow pulses do nothing but grind it to a halt and kill scenes that were otherwise flowing well.<br/><br/>Every battle sequence in this movie is filmed as if a group of gamers were playing a turn-based game and wanted to illustrate on film how a turn-based war game works. This is not however anything remotely similar to real combat thus giving the battle scenes a complete staged feel and taking away any possibility of being engrossed in them. You will not find the quality fight choreography of Lord of the Rings here though you will find many of its elements stolen and reused. Simple advice to whoever choreographed the fight scenes: Yes, gamers know and understand what a phalanx maneuver is but for the most part your audience neither knows nor cares. It was not necessary to spend thirty minutes illustrating and explaining this maneuver.<br/><br/>The special effects were par for the course, you will find nothing noteworthy here. The special effects may have actually been better than I give them credit for being but the entire film was shot using so many dark filters you can barely see the backdrops. The camera work seemed to randomly jump from close up framed shots to long zooms.<br/><br/>In summation, I would consider this film's initial success to a very good marketing campaign. I hope no one is dumb enough to pay to see this movie twice. Wait until it comes out on cable and then watch something else.<br/><br/>P.S. Question to the makers of this film: What the hell was with the Kabuki Ninjas and gargantuan elephants? Do you even understand the concept of making a period movie?"

Also, there is no historical account that there were any African Persians. If it wasn't for the arabs burning all the libraries we could prove this; but yet we still embrace their ideals today & take pride by turning our backs at the past pagan monarchs.

The villain (Xerxes) has a similar look except he's got painted eyebrows, soft trembling lips and wants men to kneel before him. <br/><br/>This is a film of cheap sentiment, clich√© visuals, a badly mixed-up soundtrack, and an ambiguous position on homosexuality."

","This Movie is a disgrace to the true history of the Persian Empire. The very first human rights (Cyrus Cylinder) was written 2500 years ago in Persia (Iran), where people in other part of the world specially west were living like savage tribes. The Cyrus Cylinder, also known as the 'Cyrus the Great Cylinder', is an artifact of the Persian Empire, consisting of a declaration issued by the emperor Cyrus the Great inscribed in Babylonian (Akkadian) cuneiform on a clay cylinder. The movie has insulted Persians, and history of Persia by showing that Iranians are uncivilized and uncultured people. Therefore, in my view, this movie has no historical credit and it is just a Hollywood movie."

"dewolftom10","5","11","36","21 March 2007"," Disappointing Movie
","I didn't read anything about 300 before seeing it, only heard it was an enormous success in the States. So I went to the cinema without prejudice and with some expectation... At first, I want to say some positive things: the graphics are fine, the battles are nice, and the views from time to time impressive. I like the music, which is an important part of every film and definitely of an epic story. The acting was quite OK. BUT... As the film is clearly not historically correct (e.g. the armour of the soldiers, the monsters (they irritated me, the film could have done easily without 'em),...), I hoped to see an enjoyable story of brave man fighting epic battles which are graphically fantastic, and to feel some kind of bond with the main character... Nevertheless the graphics weren't as overwhelming as some tend to pretend. Besides the nice grim/costumes of the monsters, I didn't discover any special camera twists or anything innovative seen from the graphical point of view. The acting was OK, but definitely not of a price-winning standard. If I compare this with e.g. Gladiator, the acting of Russell Crowe as Maximus was much more impressive. There are similar scenes with wife and child(ren) in the wheat fields, but the ones in 300 never touched me as the scenes in Gladiator did. I consider an actor/actress talented if he/she can move me, if I can identify myself with him or her to some extent. I didn't had this feeling with 300. Some pretend this is a non-moralizing story. I think it is, in a way. The movie shows the Persians (Iranians), and other Asian tribes with them, are not untouchable, and from an Amerikan point of view, everyone can translate this to the present. Considering humour, the film was funny from time to time, not in the first place because of some kind of joke, but because some scenes are predictable/far-fetched or just ridiculous to some extent, and, hearing the comments and grins in the audience, I wasn't the only one with this opinion. Concluding: 300 is an overrated historically incorrect story of brave men fighting epic battles against a monstrous enemy, who outnumber them several times. The graphics are OK, but not innovating. The music is nice. The acting is moderate. A 'must see'? I don't think so. A deserved place in the top 250? As far as I'm concerned: No thanks. Voting this movie into the top is an offence towards great directors (such as Kubrick, Spielberg, Scorcese, Polanski...) who made masterpieces that deserve the spot 300 is taking at this moment."

","Let's see - for culture warriors, the west is represented by one-dimensional, pederast, baby-killing slave owners, while the Persians are a multi-ethnic, culturally and religiously diverse society where women and men are equals and slavery has been abolished for fair wages. Personally I'm going to have to go with the Persians on this one.<br/><br/>BTW, Iranians - your ancestors murdered or converted the Zoroastrians of the real Persian empire so you can stop whining about their portrayal any time now.<br/><br/>As far as this movie goes, it was incredibly boring. The trailer was the best part (and is still really good). But in the movie, I had no interest in any of the characters, though Xerxes seemed like a pretty fun guy to party with. I was happy to see the Spartans finally killed off just so they would stop shouting ridiculous clich√©s.<br/><br/>One thing about its accuracy though - Herodotus' original story probably wasn't very accurate to the actual battle - he would have endowed all sorts of noble traits upon the Spartans and many ignoble ones on the Persians. Herodotus wrote war porn for the Greeks. Modern historians accept this war porn as history, thus a modern movie becomes modern war porn.<br/><br/>Overall, the fact that Victor Davis Moron Hanson had anything to do with this movie should be a flashing red light that what you are about to see completely sucks."

","After seeing this film last night one has to ask ones self if it was called '300' because it felt like you were in the cinema for 5 hours (300 mins)? It has to rank as one of the most pointless and worst films I have ever seen. When the director saw the final cut did he not say to himself ""what the hell have I done"". It was more like 'Gladiator' meets the 'Chippendale's' but without the quality, depth and entertainment the Chippendales brought to the stage... not to mention that it will not be fit to be displayed on the same shelf as 'Gladiator' when it is released on DVD. But it is not all bad. some of the battle scenes were quite ground breaking (a-la the matrix) but few and far between and to be honest once one battle scene was over the movie did little to expand on the experience other than 'more of the same' - no doubt to keep the '13 year old' Alfa male 'game playing' contingency content. As for the CGI... well, the preceding adverts for the 'Sony Playstation 3' were a good contender to compete with the often 'cartoon like' backgrounds. <br/><br/>So onto the story... 300 Spartans fight a bunch of Persians....Hmm, that is about it... no wait..thrown in are a couple sex secnes and irrelevant plot lines which fail miserably to ignite any interest in this movie. No doubt some women will find he sight of most of the cast draped in red capes exposing their six-packs arousing.. but one has to ask if the actors were picked for their acting ability or their physical appearance?... I think the latter applies. It is scary to think that even the bulging muscles on these actors looked like they had had a little CGI touch up... did I say 'a little'.... well, maybe a tad more than that? .. and if so how did they get the gig.. the mind boggles!<br/><br/>The dialogue was laughable at best and the narration was embarrassing. Every character spoke like that guy who does the action movie trailer voice over's.... you know the one!<br/><br/>CGI has certainly come a long way in 10 years but still lacks the presence and feel of real sets and actors. It has been more than a decade since T2 got the audience to sit up and take notice of what can be achieved with CGI. Little has changed since then apart from one or two movies like 'Jurassic Park' and 'Titanic' ...and in computer terms 10 years is like a millennium... <br/><br/>CGI maketh not the move. We still rely on good old fashioned acting, plot lines, direction, camera work and editing... this movie has none of this and should be avoided at all costs."
"finalfist","7","5","13","25 March 2007"," a beautious action orgy like no other
","Two years ago the cinemagoing audience got a taste of all things Frank Miller with Robert Rodriguez's seminal adaptation of Sin City,which remains to this day one of the most seminal comic book/graphic novel adaptations of recent years - it also helps that Quentin Tarantino lent his directing panache, earning himself and the film even more kudos - truly the floodgates to all thing's Miller-related had opened.<br/><br/>Knowing this would have put any future director of Miller's work under the spotlight, especially one Zack Snyder. Despite proving the naysayers wrong with his crack of George Romero's legendary Dawn of the Dead in 2004,many could argue that he is still an unproven director. 300 should and will remedy that. The original Frank Miller/Lynn Varley work remains a graphic novel spectacular and so this adap will be as well in film.<br/><br/>Let's clear a few things up; anyone expecting a historical epic in similar vein to Gladiator may walk away disappointed.The sole reason to stump up the cash for this is to bear witness to its violent excess. With copious amounts of CGI claret spilled, the appetite of gorehounds will be satiated. The Spartan 300 are nigh-on invincible cleaving through the Persian hordes like the cannon fodder that they truly are. With the 300 trained in the art of war, seeing them clashing blades is as gratifying as it is bloody. Even with the arrival of various dark beasts, they are truly gods of war until an unexpected development rears its ugly head. The acting from all involved is sub-standard throughout, but Gerard Butler's portrayal of Spartan King Leonidas - even though verging on campiness- shines through with gusto and is also gifted with several witty resorts. Visually, the film is stunning with every frame being a work of art in its own right due to some splendid CGI. The skirmishes that play out are gifted with an aesthetic quality that is gratuitously bloody and alluring all at the same time. The visuals are sumptuous and are backed up with SFX of equal standing. So, one can surmise that though light on actual plot, the battles that ensue more than rectify this niggle. Here's hoping that Zach Snyder rightfully gets the recognition he deserves, because this is one heck of a calling card to Hollywood if there was one and shows he has what it takes to propel SFX-heavy action forward. One can only imagine what treats a Snyder-directed adap on Alan Moore's Watchmen can bring us. 4/5"

For me, the movie itself was better than the comic. There was in fact more character development in the movie than there was in the book.A few of the characters were ""meated"" out to fit the 2 hours. The movie itself deals with the idea of hopeless odds and fighting still for what you believe in, not as much as dramatic characters. If you are looking for a thought provoking film, this might not be it( given the images of gore and two women kissing in the trailer, that should have given the movie's theme away).<br/><br/>Gerard Butler gave a great performance as Leonidas, the matured, yet battle-drunk leader of the Spartans. The Queen, Lena Headley, took the role with such strength and conviction, that it shows in a scene where she proves to a sadistic Spartan senator what she would do for ""Her Sparta"". <br/><br/>Like any film, there will always be people that will not like it.I'll leave the other ""faults"" to your opinion.<br/><br/>I think it was a great film.

","300 is based on the ancient legend of 300 spartan warriors defending the honour of Greece against an insurmountable Persian foe. a handful of Spartans who held out against the invading Persian forces until the Greek army arrived, hence, their gallantry passing into myth and legend. the film 300 is based on a comic reading by famed author frank miller. i have not read the comic, therefore cannot comment. the film itself was no doubt made with the current occupation of Iraq in mind. hence, it will play incredibly well in the American mid-west. to the rest of the world, sadly, it plays out as the few in Europe, who stand up to the many in Asia. this being mentioned time after time in one of the many gallant spartan speeches. the sacrifice of the few for the 'freedom' of the many. all the Spartans look like buff models, the archetypal bronze male of Greek mythology, with a six pack to a man. yet, the Persians are all faceless. where they are lucky to show physical attributes, be they negroid, oriental or plain semitic, they are hideously deformed, to a man. even their leader, Xerxes, stands 10 feet tall and proclaims to be divine. its not a bad film if you are blind to the blatant racial undercurrents. the Spartans look so gallant as they cut down the Persian foes, and so sad when when of them falls, all done in lovely slo-mo. even the queen makes a last ditch speech to the senate for a final 'upsurge'. but it is all just so terribly one sided, not to mention totally unbelievable. the ultimate in right wing fascist fantasy."

Gerard Butler's heroic shouts are already enough to get my adrenaline pumping.<br/><br/>Few films can capture my complete attention right from the start and maintain it to the end. The stylish action certainly captures my attention. The special effects in the film are stunning. In very few other films can you see such brutal and yet stylish manoeuvres. The graphic scenes of soldiers being beheaded, and limbs flying around like confetti strips adds to the enormous tension.<br/><br/>Some say that the plot is thin. I do not agree on this. The plot is simple, as it is about the 300 soldiers' fight to defend their country until the end. However it is not a thin plot.

","I found the movie excellent for what it claimed to be. A film adaptation of the graphic novel. Keeping in mind that a director is an artist then I expect of him not to remain in a safe path set by the graphic novel. Maybe, while reading the graphic novel, he thought of some things he would like added, excluded, or better portrayed.<br/><br/>I found the movie excellent because I think that it boosted Frank Miller's intention of presenting the battle as a no win fight for the Spartans, but a necessary one because of the consequences it may trigger (Naval battle in Salamis and battle in Plataeae), against an enemy with so much different a culture who wants to force his culture and way of living on the Greeks. In that aspect I found Snyder's additions (war rhino's, beast like Immortals, a decapitator with claws as hands) a helpful tool.<br/><br/>It is common knowledge that the Persians were not beast like, with a perverted courtyard. A history film must not portray them as such, but this film is allowed to do so.

"eschetic","3","5","13","12 March 2007"," Homoerotic S&M historical distortions strictly for closeted boys
","The apparent goal of Zach Snyder's opulent, CGI enhanced filming of Frank Muller's ""graphic novel"" (a more respectable term for ""extremely expensive short comic book for the pretentious illiterate"") was to reintroduce to a new generation the classic tale of a dedicated band of Spartan warrior/lovers who held off the invading hoards from a neighboring great nation at the narrow seaside pass of Thermopylae while the city states of ancient Greece could put aside their historic differences and muster a united front to preserve their collective freedom.<br/><br/>It was a noble idea, and told *honestly*, might have made for an exciting, valuable movie. Most of the ""popular history"" we learn comes through mass entertainment from Shakesperare's RICHARD III to James Cammeron's TITANIC. All the more reason to get the FACTS right - ESPECIALLY when telling an inherently exciting story like this. RICHARD III is a terrific pot boiler, but grossly misrepresented history (the Tudors almost certainly committed most of the crimes Shakespeare attributed to the ""Son of York"" they defeated at the Battle of Bosworth Field). TITANIC weaves a fictional love story through largely factual background.<br/><br/>Sadly, the new ""300"" hews far closer to a cinematic version of the history of Shakespeare's travesty without any of Shakespeare's actual linguistic or stylistic skill.<br/><br/>It doesn't matter so much that the Spartans are depicted as steroid puppies tucking their well oiled packages into leather Speedos while their children (we only see two or three - but one of them is supposed to be the King as a child; in the first of many lies and distortions, the film implies that he became king by killing a giant wolf) are burdened with embarrassing diapers rather than the actual nudity and all purpose blanket which were an integral part of the Spartan rearing supposedly being extolled in the early dialogue. The film makers wanted to simultaneously sell tickets to closeted boys and those still in their mental teens and keep their rating to an ""R"" - nonsexual nudity is apparently a problem for red state parents while graphic blood spattered cartoon violence and gore is not.<br/><br/>It moves beyond the silly ""cleaned up"" but bloodied comic book visuals and gets offensive when intentional errors and lies are imposed on the film in a cynical appeal to the illiterate right wing (more on the politics of the film in a moment) - like having Spartan leaders denigrate their Athenian neighbors as ""boy lovers"" (in Sparta it was state policy, with marriage a mere obligation to perpetuate the state! The 300 were literally an army of lovers), the erasure of Spartan slaves from the picture (it wasn't just ""the 300"" who fought and fell at Thermopylae, but an equal number of their slaves and servants who fell fighting at their sides - what happened to those slaves and servants dying their masters' black Greecian hair RED for battle? - is died hair somehow ""gayer"" than blue-painted bodies in BRAVEHEART?!) or when a supposedly powerful political opposition within Sparta is painted as rapists and traitors.<br/><br/>This last has little to do with film makers' gay panic or ancient Sparta which was a strict oligarchy with little or no respect for the ""democracy"" of their other state neighbors and the MOVIE tries to imply is an essential part of their ""freedom."" What it HAS to do with is pandering to the Bush ""presidency"" and its foreign policy by trying to identify with the Spartan defenders rather than (as would be more historically accurate) the Persian ""superpower"" invaders - led ironically by a ""Xerxes"" who in wimpy pampered visage and command style bears a greater resemblance to our unelected ""President"" than any of the Spartan heroes. The Persians were - or so they said in the hole filled screenplay by Snyder, Kurt Johnstad and Michael Gordon - trying to impose peace and prosperity on the area to be conquered and occupied. Sound familiar? Maybe the screenwriters were trying for subversive subtext - but if so, Snyder's freak show of fighting villains and traitors prevent anyone from entertaining a balanced view of (or even catching more than the most fleeting of glances at) the actual history.<br/><br/>Ultimately, while a few closeted teens were standing and applauding at the screening I saw over the not too surprisingly prosperous opening weekend it enjoyed, this homoerotic CGI bonanza is really fit only to be shown (sans sound) over the bar at gay bars or S&M clubs - where it will inevitably turn up once it goes to DVD in the near future - for the sort of success and longevity it deserves. Parents and the educated be warned."

We escape from ourselves for a moment, become more like them. With comic-book heroes we explore broad brush-stroke ideas of heroism, romance. Cinema has been used throughout its history to raise morale or for more overt politics. Comic-book adaptations span many genres from Batman stories to examinations of existentialism (Ghost World) or reinventing neo-noir (Sin City). Based on a comic based on a film based on ancient history, 300 explodes onto screens with stark adult images of bare-chested warriors and overtly sexual Oracles. It sweeps us into a world of fantasy, but with intense bloody violence like Tarantino movies, and ""Freedom"" battle-cries reminiscent of Braveheart. It tells of 300 heroic, highly trained warriors that pitch themselves against an army numbering one million. If they die, they don't die in vain. They will inspire. They will stand for liberty. They will be the catalyst for ultimate victory and the establishment of a far-reaching moral order.<br/><br/>King Leonidas of Ancient Sparta receives an emissary from the Persian Empire. Earth and Water, if you please, the Spartans are told, else we'll kick you to a kingdom near you where you don't wanna go. Leonidas responds to this bit of diplomacy by unceremoniously kicking emissary and entourage down a big pit.<br/><br/>Before Leonidas can whop these aliens from Asia for being so damn cheeky, he has to ask the Oracle, a beautiful, writhing, naked young blossom being letched over by particularly ugly, deformed mystics (called Ephors - think Orcs with sex drives). Xerxes, the Persian ruler, knows well the oracles will tell Leonidas to back off as there's a religious festival due, which they do. Guessing the cunning plan, but unable to go directly against holy Ephors, Leonidas ""goes for a walk"" - together with his personal bodyguard of 300 crack soldiers.<br/><br/>Leonidas' wife, Queen Gorgo, stays behind. Although women can open their mouths at formal events, she's still regarded as pretty second class by the all male politicians. Gorgo shows she's a Sparta woman through and through. Brave, intelligent, willing to sacrifice herself as forcefully as any male warrior, she gives a speech that would out-Maggie Thatcher. And unlike most women leaders, she's sexy and feminine.<br/><br/>Leonidas' men, helped by woosey Athenians, acquit themselves in a manner that to put CGIs to shame (if they weren't so awesome). Like Mel Gibson in Braveheart, he has learnt to shout words like 'freedom' and 'democracy' until his men go into a hypnotic rage of murderous joy. And he has his wife to thank for it. What's a king to do, faced with the choice between religious law and a threat to his country? She tells him to ask, ""What should a free man do?"" Gorgo made no mistake in taking his mind off the 18-year old slut down the temple.<br/><br/>""A new age has come, an age of freedom!"" echoes through the film. ""We rescue a world from mysticism and tyranny."" But although historians are already arguing over the historical accuracy or lack of it, it seems palpable that much was invented or changed to make the story, visuals, and moral imperatives 'more cool' than they ever were in ancient times. The shred of historicity seems a mere device to assist suspension of disbelief. Landscapes have the menacing simplicity of Sin City. Unlike Sin City, they are more seamlessly lifelike, yet still retain an air of fantasy. It's almost like Lord of the Rings for grown-ups.<br/><br/>Acting is gritty throughout. Special effects could send you into Exorcist mode if you've just had lunch. Cinematography is consistently atmospheric. It feels like a two-hour descent into Mordor that makes Gladiator look gay. But if this movie can effectively get your rocks off, no review is entirely complete without acknowledging the political upheavals even as it is released.<br/><br/>""Hollywood declares war on Iranians,"" read a headline in Iran's independent Ayende-No newspaper. A Persian journalist (born of Iranian parents in Greece) wrote, ""There has been no agenda on the part of the original novelist, movie director, cast and crew to promote an anti-Iranian agenda. The movie however (no matter how sincerely it was intended as entertainment), is nevertheless purveying messages; messages most certainly unintended by Miller or the film producers."" Which is probably a bit closer to the truth. But is that wrong?<br/><br/>Decent Americans, at the time of the movie's release, are going through a period of schism and intense self-doubt over their increasing losses in Iraq. Whatever the rights and wrongs of the war, the families and friends of those who have lost men and women there need sources of succour and belief in themselves. The film provides heroic stereotypes who die for their beliefs and find ways of justifying or coming to terms with the accompanying grief. In 300, reverence for race, religion and sexual preferences are given short shrift. If the movie claimed to represent history and the peoples in it accurately, it would be offensive to common sense. But it does not. It is, feels like, and looks like, a comic-strip simplification and glorification of a battle. It will make much of its target audience feel good about itself. As propaganda, it is no worse, or rather far less harmful, than the propaganda churned out on a smaller scale by many Islamic countries for internal consumption. I did not find the depiction of Persians at all belittling. They look as glorious in their majesty and technical achievements as the Spartans look ferocious. The main audiences understand it is light entertainment, however baffling it may be to eastern minds (just as Manga can be baffling or even offensive to Western minds).<br/><br/>300 is, at a pinch, not a beacon of political correctness, but it is one hell of a movie."

Moreover,It is amazing that film shows Spartans defend the democracy when the history says they fight with Athens' people (because Spartans don't believe in democracy).

I don't know how we Americans get off on awful movies like this. I just watched Oldboy last night, and that is a great film. Korean film that could never be made in America.

","But, hell, while it's far from perfect, I'll admit that it's a lot of fun. Put it into the guilty pleasure category if you will. It goes for the title of violentest movie ever, and I think it succeeds. Much of the movie consists of the Spartan warriors hacking away at Persian fodder, with limbs flying everywhere, with an occasional head thrown in for good measure (I was slightly disappointed that there were no entrails to be found). Sick as hell, yeah, but I think most of us have a little part of our brain left over from our uncivilized ancestry. Honestly, outside of the action sequences, the film is fairly worthless. The dialogue is overwrought and often embarrassing, with a heck of a lot of narration telling us about what it's like to be a Spartan. The exposition is lame (except for maybe the prologue ¬ñ the part with the wolf was kind of cool). The trip to Thermopylae is dull, even when we find a tree with a hundred corpses impaled upon it. And, during the battle, whenever they show us what's happening in Sparta, I was always like, ""Who the *expletive deleted* gives a *expletive deleted*! Get back to the endless slaughter!"" The movie would have worked a hundred times better if it had just been 90 minutes of straight battle, with the only pauses being the tense, dark nights between them. So, really, the movie isn't all that great. But, hell, I have to give it my recommendation. Any movie that features a decapitated head spiraling through the air in slow motion has to be worth the price of admission."

","If your a moviegoer who likes bad acting, bullet time fighting, inaccurate historical events, guys in costumes and sex scenes then this is the movie for you. i gave this movie a 5 out of 10 because i actually watched this thing on the history channel about how the battle really went down and a historical movie that was suppose to show it didn't do a very god job. for example the ships were suppose to be in the artemisium straight which is NE of thermopylae and there were spartan ships that stopped them there till the storm happened. another thing that wasn't historically correct was the fact that the Persians brought in cavalry.that would have just been stupid because they were to be fighting in such close quarters of thermopylae. Next, the movie didn't really start going till about 45 minutes into the film and that was the first fight scene which i was really anticipating but after i saw it i thought it was a waste of 10-15 minutes because it was done almost completely in bullet time so the 10-15 minutes was actually about a 5 minute fight and that was also historical wrong because the Spartans broke their ranks and moved out of the pass which is something they didn't do. during the fight with the immortals the Spartans were spread out and how it was actually done was to stand in formation, a wall of shields and stab your spear over the top. plus the real immortals (givin their name because when one fell there was another to take their place) wore cloth cloths and cloth around their heads and used woven bamboo shields and spears. Lastly you could tell that the ""monsters"" were people in suits because the skin looked so cloth like. well thats the end and all in all i wouldn't waste your money on seeing this in theaters.

","300 is an adrenaline fueled fantasy classic! I cannot recommend this film enough to those of you looking for some hard-hitting eye candy and no-holds-barred battle action. I gotta admit I was totally blown away by the visuals in this. For a film shot entirely on a green screen, it's breathtaking. There were a few sequences that felt a bit too ""two dimensional"" for me but I truly believe 300 is a revolutionary film. There's really only been a handful of films out there that have been shot entirely green screen before and this is without a doubt one of the best in my opinion. I figure we'll be seeing more and more just like this as time goes on. Hopefully they learn to utilize the technology in a way that opens the environments up a bit more. Don't take this as whining or anything but the film occasionally felt claustrophobic.<br/><br/>The acting in 300 was fantastically over-the-top and why the hell shouldn't it be?!! This is war baby! We get all manner of grunts, screams, roars, hissing and whispering. Without a doubt, Gerard Butler takes the cake for being the baddest bad ass from Bangor to Bangladesh! His intensity could melt a Hyundai! The second runner up for coolest mother-trucker would definitely go to Rodrigo Santoro's terrifyingly creepy turn as transvestite-ish warrior king, Xerxes.<br/><br/>Folks, I won't bog the review down by nitpicking the he-man dialog or gay-bashing hypocrisy of the Spartans¬Öplain and simple¬Öthis is mantertainment. This should, no MUST, be watched with only one thing in mind¬ÖENTERTAINMENT. It won't raise your I.Q. and it may even offend some viewers' sensibilities. That happens. You know what I did while watching this? I guzzled down a 6-pack of Mojo India Pale Ale, kicked my feet up and hollered my head off. I can't remember the last time I had so much fun watching fantasy.<br/><br/>If you've already seen this film and haven't purchased it yet¬Ögrab the 2-disc special edition. If you haven't seen this yet and you're planning on purchasing be sure to spend a few extra bones and go for the gusto. The one disc release is bare bones aside from an audio commentary. Bare bones just doesn't do this film justice. Unfortunately, I'm reviewing the single disc release as a rental so I was forced to give it a lesser overall rating. otherwise this would have received five stars all across the board."

","The good...<br/><br/>So I went to the Cinerama in Seattle to watch this and was impressed with the visual effects, the combat scenes and the overall visual feel of the movie. The grainy, almost washed out quality of the film is pretty cool and really worked for me. It helped to make the very gory battle scenes much easier to take and did create some very startling images, especially the ship wreck scene.<br/><br/>The combat scenes were exceptionally well done, kudos to the stunt folks, the CGI artists and the actors for a lot of hard work. And as I mentioned before, the grainy quality of the film really helped make the combat scenes look like they were pulled right from a graphic novel.<br/><br/>The bad...<br/><br/>Dialog/writing/script was terrible...I would rather have put on my Blue Oyster Cult album and listened to it than listen to the horrible dialog in this movie. With the combat scenes Veteran of the Psychic Wars or Cities on Flame would have been way cooler! I swear, if I had to hear the main character yell, ""Spartans blah blah blah!"", one more time I was going to ""...dine in hell"" myself.<br/><br/>Story, well...what can you say here? We should all know the story of Thermopylae, or at least some version of it. Historical accuracy? Do not look for it here, this presents the Persians as a bunch of freaks led by a freak against a group of muscular white Greeks with Scottish accents. How that worked out in casting I am not sure but it did, and there you are. All I can say is that at least they did have the 300 Spartans actually die, it kinda surprised me with the way the movie was going :-) <br/><br/>Soundtrack, as I mentioned previously, I would liked to have completely replaced the dialog, and maybe cut out everything but the combat scenes, add some hard rock as the soundtrack and I think it would have improved this movie. Seriously, the soundtrack was unremarkable.<br/><br/>The ugly <br/><br/>Practically EVERY Persian in the film is some kind of deformed freak! Then there is the traitor Greek, he is a deformed hunchback Spartan. Not much guesswork here :-) <br/><br/>Overall: 5 stars, only because of the really cool battle scenes! <br/><br/>If you are looking for a popcorn put your brain on hold enjoy CGI and combat then this is the movie for you. If you are looking for something with a script, good acting and with a story that might surprise and interest you then look elsewhere. Lastly, IMHO this is a very obvious propaganda movie, especially the last few minutes. I mean, come on..."

As for the rest - it would be better if the movie were pure fantasy, without any reference to a historical event. As it is now, the movie is ahistorical, racist, sexist, and ethnocentric. Somebody should have looked through some reputable sources. Sparta was the least civilized Greek city-state at the moment (throwing their weak and deformed babies off the cliff - nice!), so presenting it as an example of Western civilization would be unfair to that civilization. Persians did not include rhinoceroses in their cavalry and Africans in their state and military bureaucracy (remember, this is not a globalized world yet!), and Persian kings ABSOLUTELY COULD NOT BE BEARDLESS! It was actually a religious requirement. The practice of ""loving boys"" was widespread throughout Mediterranian, as much in Sparta (actually more, because they spent so much time in military training away from their families and female companionship) as in Athens or in Persia. All the allusions to Freedom (with the capital F) in a slaveholder society are quite ridiculous. But beyond all the silliness, there are some disturbing parallels. Non-whites, homosexuals and handicapped as ""undermensch"", women allowed to speak only from the point of ""kitchen- church-cradle"" principle, masculinity, war-proneness and unthinking loyalty to one's military leader as virtues... Wasn't it already happening at some point? Why do I have this feeling that Dr Gebbels, the minister of propaganda of the Third Reich, would be very proud of this movie? Of course, he would object to the fine English accent of the Spartan heroes..."

Now, lets have a look at it.<br/><br/>Story; Story is simple and yet brilliant, a tale of sacrifice and honour, a pure story of true greatness.Inspired, not based, on similar occurrences from an old age, this is war to the max, as overblown and cartoonish as possible, and yet brilliant.<br/><br/>The Scenery; we all know they used CGI, pretty obvious, hard not to notice it. Everyone has a go at it. I say, who cares???? It just gives it an interesting realism look similar to that you expect in a art-piece, and to some degrees, this is art redefined, and looks brilliant, it looks like a Dreamesque world as the Golden and Red sands and creations blow over you, pure brilliance.<br/><br/>Gerard Butler; Supposedly he just shouts a bit and walks around topless. The truth is, he has charisma in abundance that breaks through and has you believing in him as a KIng. He battles hard for his men, and treats them as equals, and due to this, makes him a King your willing to follow, he is the bets bit of the show.<br/><br/>The Queen; beautiful, and yet a true feminist, she leads the Spartan army alongside her husband and is treated as an equal to her husband in a world of men. Women are just as tough as the men, and at times, more vicious, and she demonstrates her power over the men. Good actress.<br/><br/>Characterisation; I wont lie, the characterisation isn't great, it ain't the main subject for the directors. But who is surprised? You learn these people as you go along, you bond with them on the battlefield and learn about them in the heat of battle, which is how this movie works. Characterisation is enough to pass-by, but your here for the battle-scenes.<br/><br/>Graphic Violence; The women are naked, tits are shown, and blood is a necessity. Violent? yes. Worth it? Definitely!!!! <br/><br/>The Battlescenes; What you came to see, and my god, ain't they worth it?? You have fights against wolves, against Rhinos and Elephants, against magicians, against Ninja types, and against monsters. Its like fighting against a real 7 Nation Army, you have different styles of mies you face on the battlefield, which makes it oh so much better. The blood flies, the dirt grains, the body parts slash and dice, this is a war, and looks f****** amazing, you have to see it to appreciate it.<br/><br/>If I have missed out any bits, i will come back and redo this again, so don't worry.

I will however, admit that i think that some of this movie's brilliance was accidental.

Would any of us be willing to have the courage to do that? In a country were we are constantly bombarded with how evil we are, Im guessing it would be a hard thing for many of us too understand why 300 men would willingly die without question for their homeland.<br/><br/>So how do you portray men willing to do this to an audience that does not relate?? You give them mystical bright red capes, giant shields and unlimited stamina. You make them uncompromisingly brave. You make them god like in the art of war. You do all of this to create a feeling of iron clad immortality. This movie was mystical, artistic, emotional and to be quite frank beautiful. This movie wasn't about the men with the ""total gym abs"" it was about what they represented, a mystical, immortal feat in history. A feat that will never be forgotten. But there are enough holes in the history of this battle to create a imaginative shroud of make believe story telling. Like i said, the people responsible for this movie may have come onto some of this by accident. I am willing to give them the credit since it is they who pocketed my three trips to this movie. <br/><br/>""You there, Ephialtes. . . . may you live forever.""

For the hardcore Miller and comic book fiends, this film I'm sure is right up their alley with its edgy clich√©'s and filtered photography but most likely this movie will end up in the large crap-pile of movies that couldn't make the step from comic book to big screen because it had nothing to offer other than blood, bronze, hard bodies and firm nipples - of course for many film goers - that's enough. However its a shame that the actors who played the Spartans had to spend so much time in the weight room only to see their efforts wasted on a film that will be forgotten in a few years."

","This film looks amazing, unfortunately this is about all that it has going for it. I know that this film is a comic book epic, but this is no excuse for the cringe worthy dialogue, bad acting and banal plot.<br/><br/>The circumstances of the Battle of Thermopylae alone should have been enough to at least convey some sense of sorrow and doom, but the video-game graphics circumvent even this. The Spartans fight as if the perfection of their bodies is enough to overcome even the most impossible of odds. The death of the 300 seems to be something of an afterthought, as if Frank Miller realised too late that these indestructible supermen actually had to die to maintain any semblance of historical accuracy.<br/><br/>This glorification of battle and the body beautiful feels scarily like one of Leni Riefenstahl's efforts. The perfect, white warriors bravely battling the hordes of deformed, dark skinned monsters from the east. One is frankly amazed at the openness of the conflation between the proud heroes of Sparta and the War on Terror, and amused at how ridiculous such a suggestion is to the rational mind.<br/><br/>For all the major flaws of this film, it deserves three stars just for the quality of its design."

","Watched this in a local cinema last week, I have to say its a poor movie that tries hard to have the heart of Gladiator fused with the battle scenes of LOTR whilst employing the stop motion CGI of The Matrix, but failing miserably on all counts.<br/><br/>Set in sunny Greece yet not a single glimpse of a natural looking light, sea, sky or landscape its more like a synthetic animated canvass, but devoid of color. You soon tire of the 2 dimensional characters and the Spartans continuous chant of ""Aruba Aruba"" and the roaring outbursts from King Leonidas. But there's a stale, synthetic airlessness about it. There is no ""shock and awe"" of the LOTR here. My advice, don't waste your money on this over-hyped piece of celluloid,"

"canyoufeelthefear","7","4","10","23 March 2007"," A movie on the edge of greatness (SPOILERS)
","I went to see this movie the day it came out in my local cinema, today, after seeing the trailer. The trailer for the film made me think that the story line would be quite clich√© as a small army battling ridiculous numbers is a very common concept, yet the fact it was connected to Frank Miiler was enough to grab my interest and the style looked good enough to win this over.<br/><br/>Anyway, about the film. There were many great aspects of this film which simply weren't used to their full potential. I shall start with the cons so as to get them out the way. I did not like the wolf story which matched the battle strategy of the war a little too much for my liking. One thing that struck me about this film was the rating of this film, which is a ""15"" here in the UK. I do know certain conditions that can be met for this certificate such you can normally get away with a flash of breasts or a particularly saucy sex scene that doesn't show everything. However, at points in this film I did start to think that this was going to become a porno. The oracle's nudity was understandable if not over-elaborate but the the amount of time overall with nudity did seem excessive. The only other real criticism was the use of slow-motion. Each individual incident with slow-motion was used rather well and at just the right time. On the other hand, I believe that it was used far more than necessary. The wave of the first few Persians is the worse part where there is what seemed like at least 5 minutes of normal speed to a slow death to another, to another, to another, etc....<br/><br/>Now for the good points which won back the film for me. I found that the musical score was brilliant and suited the genre and the scenes very well. When we needed to feel the rush of the battle, thats what it delivered and when we had to feel a sense of despair and loss, we got that too. Graphics and all the cgi in this film were fantastic. Absolutely state of the art and really convincing. Apart from the Persian ruler being enlarged, the graphical deaths and beautiful creatures looked really natural and in sync with the rest of the scene. The story, which as I mentioned before seemed clich√© at first glance, work really well for me as it was compelling and kept you thinking about how it will really end. And I am glad that there was a moral rather than physical victory.<br/><br/>Finally I would like to say this film is well worth a watch if you like action films and don't mind a little excessive violence. Probably one of the best films out so far this year. I am looking forward to seeing more form Snyder."
"come2whereimfrom","7","4","10","23 March 2007"," Glorious and epic comic book adaptation.
","From the makers of 'Sin City' comes Spartan battle epic 300, a lush extraordinary tale of the battle of Thermopylae. Based loosely on facts but with a liberal dash of fantasy thrown in for good measure, after all it is a comic book adaptation from the pen of Frank Miller; it is a tour de force. What this film lacks in substance it way makes up for in how it looks, the colours, the textures and the style. Gerard Butler is utterly convincing as king Leonidas leading his 300 super-warriors in to battle clad in nothing but sandals, blood red capes and leather thongs. The story is that he and his men held off a million of the Persian army, fact states about 200,000 but a million makes for a much better film. And it is in the films exaggerations that it shines, it never pretends to be exact or real, even the blood (and there is lots of it) flies around like its straight out of a computer game, disappearing before its even hit the ground. The action pieces use slow motion and a kind of bullet time to speed up and slow down the mighty soldiers actions and give every spear throw and sword swing real weight. Anyone moaning about accuracy doesn't get the whole premise that this is a movie there to entertain; if you want cold hard facts then may I point you in the way of the discovery channel. There are war rhinos, ogres with sword hands and a crazy eight-foot berserker all of which despite not actually being there are present here to full effect. There is a small storyline that runs through the film but really it is all about the action, piles of bodies, skies black with arrows, strange phantom elite ninja types and the muscle bound Spartans themselves, the last time I saw that many six packs was in the booze isle at Asda. The music adds to the atmosphere by being at times all high pitched like a dreamy choir before juxtaposing into heavy metal for some of the more rigorous fights. Sure its going to get comparisons to 'Gladiator' and 'Troy' but when you see the Persian fleet at sea its pure Wolfgang Peterson but it also comes across as a modern day epic, a 'Spartacus' or 'Ben Hur' for the video gamers and the matrix generation. It has it flaws and it has its brilliant moments that have your jaw literally on the floor. But in the end it's a bloodthirsty no-brainer that is a feast for the eyes and an exercise in what cinema is capable of with a little bit of imagination. Lots of the scenes, the final shot in particularly, are reminiscent of the kind of lavish oil paintings that hang in galleries around the world depicting these momentous battles. It is not a history lesson but nether the less it's a rip roaring ride through a war that built a legend. Far fetched and far outreaching anything else you'll see for a while it is well worth fighting to see this movie."
"meako1973","8","4","10","22 March 2007"," Visually stunning
","Drawn from the pages of the 300 comic book by Frank Miller, this film is directed by Dawn of the Dead (remake) director Zack Snyder. The film utilises a similar process to another Miller inspired film, Sin City, in which the cast acted against a green screen and everything else was digitally put in afterwards. So much CGI could have made the film a mess of the Van Helsing degree, but instead it works really well, and actually looks much better than, say, Ghost Rider (which had twice the budget and much less CGI).<br/><br/>Set in the time of ancient Greece, the Persian empire is slowly advancing across the known world, absorbing all it encounters. Anyone who refuses to join them are killed. However the thousands upon thousands of the Persian army find their hardest battle against a mere 300 soldiers of Sparta. The King of Sparta, Leonidas, defies the will of the oracle and the council by taking his small force with him to head off the Persians. His stand against the invaders stirs up talk of revolt in Sparta, and whilst he risks his life, conspirators plot to usurp his rule back home.<br/><br/>This is a film that wears its comic book origins proudly, and the lensing of each shot seems to come right out of the pages of the book. The sepia toning of the film gives it that 'ancient' feel, and makes the striking red of the Spartan cloaks, and indeed the blood, stand out so much more. Coupled with some beautiful choreography in the fights, which contain a great deal of slow motion to allow us to truly absorb the grace and skill of the Spartan combatants, it makes the battles looks so fantastic.<br/><br/>The dialogue is perhaps the weakest element of the film, something that Sin City also suffered from. What works on the page doesn't quite work when spoken. However this is a minor quibble as the visuals more than make up for it all."
"freaky_dave","8","4","10","20 March 2007"," Fantastic visuals and stunning battle sequences
","300 is based on history and deals with the Battle of Thermopylae which took place in 480 B.C. During this battle the King of Sparta led an army of 300 against over 100,000 Persians led by Xerxes. It was a battle that was said to have inspired all of Greece to band together against the Persians and defeat them. Enough with the history lesson. Lets talk about the movie shall we.<br/><br/>The story comes from the graphic novel by Frank Miller (Sin City fame) and is filled with violence and fueled by testosterone. Gerard Butler plays the King of Sparta and leads 300 of his best into battle against the Persians whose overwhelming odds were stopped for three days and probably more if not for a betrayal which led to the death of all 300 Spartans, including King Leonidas himself. There is no real spoiler here because everybody knows how it turned out, after all it is based on history.<br/><br/>The story is not as memorable as the visuals and battle sequences though which show limbs being hacked off and blood spraying. Most of the violence is done by computer graphics though, so it is not too horrific. It is the action and gore which kept me glued to my seat the whole entire 2 hour run. It also proves that an R rated movie can still raked in the millions as this movie has done for the past two weeks.<br/><br/>The film is not great, but it was entertaining and kept your interest. I'm not sure this movie will be one of those that sticks with you for years, but it sure was gruesomely entertaining."

","I was reading some comments on this movie, and I was not surprised to see all the Iranians and Muslims in general being upset. Venting their frustrations over a movie based on a comic book, is not surprising. This movie was not made as a documentary for the History channel, or as reference for history students. It was a movie, based on a graphic novel, from one of todays best. The acting, and the dialog could have been better, but overall, as a visual experience, it was pretty good. As far as the historical fact are concerned that some people are talking about, and crying like little children, let me say this. Though this movie doesn't portray the events accurately, the Persian empire WAS an empire constantly looking to expand AND take over other countries. This is how they became so big. They ALWAYS had their eyes on the Mediterranean coast because it was the ""Prime Realestate"" of the time. I mean they lived in deserts. The Mediterranean was like paradise for them. One problem though. They never made it through. They tried many times, but their efforts always came to a bloody end, the moment they reached Greece. The movie (though loosely) is based on only one of those battles. Their navy got obliterated in many occasions, as did their armies. This is a Movie. As such, and as the countless movies made based on battles, you will see exaggerations. Personally, I would have preferred the movie to be longer, allowing for some better character development, maybe even a bit darker without the ""tacky"" humorous one liners. And for all you people thinking it should portray your culture in a better way, let me say this. YOU should make your culture look better. Not a movie.<br/><br/>Thank you for your time.."

It's interesting visually, the fight choreography, while not revolutionary, was entertaining, and the pacing of the movie was fast enough to keep my butt from ever getting numb.<br/><br/>But noooooooooooooooooo. They had to try to inject some idiotic story in there about freedom and free men and free men fighting for freedom. Oh, and there's some throw away back story that takes place back in Sparta involving politics and the Queen, and blah, blah, blah.<br/><br/>THAT stuff was boring. Mind numbingly so. The previews promised me blood and guts and that's all I wanted to see and all of this politics crap is like lettuce on a burger - a feeble attempt to inject some wholesomeness into a completely, irredeemably unhealthy bundle of fun. I didn't give a rat's rear about the queen, about the politicking she and her Abraham Lincoln-looking ally had to engage in, or any of that and if they'd cut it out wholesale they might have stuffed in another fight scene or two.<br/><br/>It's worth seeing on the big screen but might be a more enjoyable experience on DVD since you would be able to skip all those stupid, talking bits.<br/><br/>8/10"

","I've heard of Sin City but have not seen it. But after seeing this, I'll try my best to get a copy of Sin City. What a breath-taking movie 300 is. This is what a movie is supposed to be -- it should move you, entertain and suck you in for the whole 90 minutes or more you are in the cinema. Never mind if its historically incorrect. Movies are never meant to represent real life. For real life, go read the news -- which are at times even stranger than fiction! I was totally bowled over by the visuals, the sound and the actors. The grainy and out of worldly color of the movie, helped in placating the faint hearted, to the scenes of decapitations, limbs flying off in different directions. The soundtrack was most apt. The rock music weaved seamlessly into the ancient setting of the movie quite magically. I've seen movies where they tried to weave modern music into period drama movies and the results were most horrible it made you cringe (one movie that comes to mind is the utter waste-of-time, inappropriate and highly embarrassing Keith Ledger vehicle, A Knight's Tale). The transformation of the actors in this movie is quite amazing. After watching Gerard Butler in Phantom of the Opera last weekend, his appearance in this movie reflected how hard he must have worked to transform it-- his buffed up body (even his nose looked totally buffed up -- like a boxer's nose) made him barely recognizable as the actor who had sung his way through the whole musical. Watch out for Stephen McHattie, the underrated blonde actor who once acted as James Dean in a telemovie, a goatish looking loyalist who helps the queen gain access to the Council. David Wenham (who was the gentle yet brave Faramir in the Lord of the Rings trilogy) is the storyteller here. Pretty boy (i.e. drop-dead gorgeous) Rodrigo Santoro is transformed into the gigantic and totally corrupt Xerxes (plus body piercings, khol lined eyes, and painted eyebrows -- who looks suspiciously like Kumar, a comedian who's a household name in Singapore). What can I say?? I love this movie. Good job! Highly recommended."

An event that occurred many years ago. You know you are looking at a fantasy oriented movie from the very first few moments. Maybe the queen angle seemed to dull out the action for a few moments. But I don't see anyone complaining about the lack of gore. There was plenty to keep you riveted. An it did not seem as long as 2 hours. So, yes. I liked the movie for movies sake."

","Having read articles about how racist the film was against Persians, I was hesitant to see the movie. When I did go with a friend from out of town, I was not only stunned by the cinematography, but I was surprised to find that it didn't seem that racist at all. While it wasn't 100% historically accurate, it worked as a movie. I don't think many people really expect historical fiction films to be all that accurate these days, so that seems like a moot point to me. I will agree that the Persians are not shown in a great light, but it's also a film glorifying the 300 Spartans... like any film that has an unlikely victor, the enemy is made very unlikeable (I know that Ancient Persia was very civilized though it is true that Xerxes was more brutal than his predecessors). Whether that means that people who like the movie are racist is something very different. I know I'm not (my best friend is half-Iranian and my parents used to live in Iran). Perhaps because I haven't heard a single person actually interpret the film to justify racism other than people arguing against it for being racist in the first place, I don't find it to be a compelling point."

Director Zack Snyder....Screenplay Zack Snyder, Michael Gordon, Kurt Johnstad.<br/><br/>Director Zack Snyder's ""300"" may appear to breaking new ground as far as cinema, but in truth it owes its current popularity and box-office success to similar ""ancient times/war dramas"" as Wolfgang Petersen's ""Troy"" and even ""Gladiator"". It is somewhat new stuff, however, in the fact it's superior, brilliant cinematography is strongly influenced by the comic book/graphic novel by Frank Miller, and even this is nothing new to film. ""Sin City"" was also based on a graphic novel. It may be that the look of the film and its style, which is also dependent on computer graphics, is the only thing that makes this film a winner. Otherwise, it's the prototypical war drama about an oppressed people who fight to the death against their oppressors. Gerard Butler, best known for portraying the Phantom of the Opera in Joel Schumacher's 2004 film, dons a new mask - that of the warrior king Leonidas of Sparta. Gerard Butler's performance is amazingly intense, nuanced, human and soulful. This is so far his greatest role. He committed himself to building the Sparton warrior body as well as spirit. Nonetheless, one can also argue that his powerful voice, raised in anger or triumph, is the key to his strength in this film. Funny to think this same ""voice"" was also essential to his Phantom role. We follow the last stage of his life as he takes 300 of his men to fight against the threatening advances of the Persian armies of King Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro). Lena Headey portrays his loyal and headstrong wife, the Queen. She, too, delivers a fine performance. But despite the talented cast of principals, the script suffers of melodrama and overuse of narration. The narrator voice is heard throughout the film to the point of excess, but one supposes this is to keep the spirit of the comic book alive on film. The use of some sharply dark comedy, especially in the dialog, is fine but also appears too unrealistic. In fact, this film does not presume to be a history lesson. The Frank Miller comic is pure historical fantasy. We see the small 300 fighting against enormous armies and monsters, none of it being true to the actual battle of Thermopolae. In this respect, 300 could even owe its success to war fantasies like Lord of the Rings. So, here's the bottom line. This film is good, not great and you'll love it if you enjoy war dramas with an extra punch of violence. Keep in mind this is a movie for adults and rated R for violence, nudity and graphic sex. The costumes by Michael Wilkinson remain faithful to the comic book and are impressive, though it's also in keeping with fantasy, like when we see Xerxes first entering the scene in a huge metallic platform with staircase. The music by Tyler Bates does not make up it's mind whether it's powerful orchestra and chorus or modern music with dissonant chords and elements of rock music. But the biggest winner is the cinematography by Larry Fong, a combination of The Matrix and Sin City. The plot is easy to follow (it's not based on a James Joyce novel or anything) and the film has an overall feel-goodness, root for the good guy kinda mood. The ending is powerfully dramatic and ultimately heroic-tragic, but it also happens without warning because there is no evidence that the Spartans are going to meet a tragic end, having been undefeated. It is also a movie that often feels rushed and we don't quite feel for any of the characters. I loved this film only because of Gerard Butler's magnificent performance and the inspirational new look."

Although I did enjoy seeing the lack of armor on the men, save for the helmets and shields, and the six- and twelve-packs being paraded around! The movie is about courage in the face of overwhelming odds. Both the characters of King Leonidas and Queen Gorgo were admirable and appealing.

","When was it that style became a genre? Was it The Matrix? Was it Kill Bill or Sky Captain? Or was it 300? From the trailers, I wasn't expecting much from 300. It looked like a CGI testosterone-heavy bloodfest. And it was, but even so I expected more than what I got. 300 comes across like it was made by 17-year-old boys for 17-year-old boys. I'd say that there was a romantic angle thrown in for the women, but actually it was just a sex scene. This is one of those films where I hear people say ""it's good for what it is supposed to be."" And they're right - if you like pretty crap, this is some of the best. But I'm tired of qualifiers. If it's a movie about zombies, I want a good movie about zombies If it's a movie about dancing CG penguins, give me a good movie about dancing CG penguins. And if it's a movie about 300 Spartans vs a million Persians¬Öwell, you know. Give me some good acting. Give me a character I can identify with (any character! PLEASE! Don't make me root for the hunchback because he evokes the most pathos). Give me some character development (don't show me a boy fighting a CGI wolf and then have a voice-over telling me ""this boy is fighting a wolf""). A bit of clever or meaningful dialogue and a story with more than one layer would be an added bonus.<br/><br/>Here's my problem with 300 in a nutshell: those elephants are way too big. Don't give me Lord of the Rings and tell me it's Greek history. I've seen enough elves surfing down castle stairs on shields while firing volleys of arrows. In 300, everything is a cartoonish parody of itself. And if you're going to make everything a cartoon, why not just animate the whole movie? The Samurai Jack episode that tackles this same subject is much better, and has just as much style.<br/><br/>Sometimes less is more. And sometimes more is less. A lot less. At least The Matrix for all it's flair had a human element to it.<br/><br/>I will give it one thing: they didn't use the often-used and never-should-be-used shaky, blurry, quick-cut action scene style. They showed me everything and everywhere that the swords were going, and I applaud that.<br/><br/>They could have done so much better by making it more human.

And, I saw the movie twice and will see it again before it leaves the theaters. Gerard Butler is King Leonidas and, as usual, even when he's not on screen his presence is felt. 300 is an engrossing movie. The time went by so quickly and not for a moment was I bored or wishing it would hurry to the next scene. Zack Snyder is an imaginative director, who was obviously in total command of what was happening in this film.

The film is exhilarating and intense, and does not have a single dull moment. It is pure and perfect escapism; the plot and dialog might be simplistic, but it draws you into a world that never really was, when a man could be sure of his place in the world and the purpose of his life and when you could be confident of the righteousness of your cause and the evil of your enemies.<br/><br/>Let's not hold 300 to any misguided expectations, as many reviewers seem to, this film makes no pretension at being historically accurate. 300 is much closer to fantasy than a documentary, and its bias is clear from the start: the Spartans are ""good"" and the Persians are ""evil."" The film's Xerxes is completely different (in just about every possible way) from the historical figure, but again: this is NOT a historical film. The only part of 300 that really bothered me was the continuous invocation of the American meta-narrative of an outmatched team fighting a tyrant for the sake of freedom; the battle between Sparta and Persia had nothing to do with this, and Sparta was most certainly not free.<br/><br/>For all of those who have complained that the film is not intellectually stimulating, I have to ask, ""was there anything in its trailer that suggested it would be?"" If you want to be intellectually stimulated or learn about the actual historical battle of Thermopylaes, pick up a book; there are plenty of good ones out there. Or if you are like me and can't help but think rationally during a movie, here is a suggestion: the film 300 glorifies a culture that worships warfare and rejects mercy, while all the while pursuing excellence in its craft. Instead of simply rejecting their culture out of hand for differing from our own and ignoring our present notion of ""human rights"", you ask yourself why what they do (in any given situation that you have a visceral reaction to, such as one Leonidas eats an apple as his soldiers kill the wounded) is wrong; and all the while ask yourself what we can learn from them."

","Perhaps best known up until now for his underwhelming portrayal of the Phantom in Phantom of the Opera in which he did his own singing, Gerard Butler finally gets a chance to show what he can do. And he is definitely not underwhelming. Quite the opposite. Much like Russell Crowe in Gladiator - Mr. Butler carries the day & quite convincingly brings an old time sword and sandal flick to life. While he is assisted by an awesome supporting cast including Lena Headley as Queen Gorgo and Rodrigo Santoro as Xerxes - it is upon Mr. Butler's broad shoulders that the success of the 300 rests. Well done! It's too bad there isn't room for a sequel. Now that this film is in the same category as Star Wars & Lord of the Rings - the temptation to make some more money is definitely there."
"RunningD","9","4","10","12 March 2007"," Truly enjoyable
","This was a movie I went into hoping it would be good, thinking it would be marginal. I could not have been more pleased with the outcome. I realize that this movie was not historically accurate, but the premise is true to the spirit of the soldiers involved. The honor and bond that develops with people put in tough situations and working together to accomplish something, in this case defending their homes and freedoms.<br/><br/>As the movie started it gave a background to the lives of the Spartans and their background. Once the movie got moving it was a great story of men standing up to a tyrant, doing the right thing even though treachery put them at a great disadvantage. King Leonidas is played larger than life by Gerard Butler but not so over the top that it is unbelievable. He was leading great men in a great battle; he had to be their larger than life figure.<br/><br/>The sub plot of his wife and Queen, played beautifully by Leona Headey, having to work her way through the treasonous traps set by the politicians several people in our theater could be heard cheering for her when she finally got to speak to the senators. Her line that Freedom isn't free will rankle some who will think this is a political statement. If so well that is their problem, this is a well crafted film that is a great epic on the screen. The battle scenes are well done, and are multi layered so that the figure in the foreground is not the only one fighting. When the Spartans gave their cheer at the end 10,000 strong it was inspired. All in all a great movie with great scenery painted across the screen visually stunning. I would highly recommend it."
"Rathko","9","4","10","12 March 2007"," Pulp-Mythology at its Finest
","A brilliant, old-fashioned sword-and-sandal epic that in unashamedly embracing its graphic novel origins, seems to evoke the spirit of Steve Reeves' spaghetti-mythology of the 1950s and '60s. Of course, the production values are far superior to anything Pietro Francisci et al were every able to conjure, and there's considerably more blood and guts flying, but in essence, and despite the blanket use of CGI and a multi-million dollar ad campaign, '300' successfully evokes a kind of Saturday matin√©e innocence that is refreshing.<br/><br/>Everything is painted with a very broad brush that relishes in high-camp and scenery-chewing theatrics. The good guys, led by Butler's Leonidas, are all images of stoic pride and honor; the bad guys, in the form of Xerxes and Theron, are all devilishly cruel and inhuman monsters. There's no moral ambiguity. No subtlety. Just a thrilling, testosterone fueled, popcorn action movie, the likes of which we really haven't seen since Ray Harryhausen put down his modeling tools.<br/><br/>An excellent movie that manages to rise above the accusation of style-over-substance by being built upon the foundation of a solidly structured narrative and, through Zack Snyder, a clear and singular artistic vision that is backed up with genuine talent. All the performances manage to strike a very difficult balance ¬ñ being suitably over-the-top while retaining enough humanity to never really descend in to tedious caricature. My only gripe about the entire movie is that editor William Hoy seems out of his depth at times, particularly in the battles, seemingly unable to wrangle things in to coherent scenes. But it is a minor flaw in what is a genuinely fun and exhilarating movie that, given the sheer number of instantly iconic images, is sure to become something of a minor-classic."
"Crush726","9","4","10","12 March 2007"," Prepare for Glory
","300 is an epic movie along the lines of Braveheart, Gladiator, or even any of the Lord of the Rings films¬Ö except on steroids. It offers what Sin City (also written by Frank Miller) offered: blood, broads, and battle.<br/><br/>Don't go in expecting a historically accurate depiction of the events that transpired at the Battle of Thermopylae lead by King Leonidis. This is a history movie for action buffs.<br/><br/>Set around 480 B.C., 300 tells the tale of King Leonidis' (Gerard Butler) fight against an entire Persian army (lead by King Xerxes, played by Rodrigo Santoro). This isn't an ordinary battle¬Ö it's 300 Spartans against thousands of Persians. With his faithful Captain (Vincent Regan), the strong Dilios (David Wenham), and the sometimes arrogant Stelios (Michael Fassbender), it is evident that this is no ordinary army. The Spartans are a breed of mankind born to be warriors. They've been trained since the day they learned to walk to be ruthless and fierce soldiers.<br/><br/>I'm sure everyone already knows that it's a big war movie of sorts, but why are they going to war? The conflict begins when a Persian messenger is sent to speak with Leonidis and the beautiful Queen Gorgo (Lena Headey). He offers them peace through means of submission to the Persian king. ""Earth and water."" This doesn't settle well with Leonidis as he handles the situation¬Ö accordingly.<br/><br/>Leonidis wishes to put Sparta at war with the Persians, but it doesn't settle well with the Spartan council, mainly Theron (Dominic West) who has an agenda of his own. Against the wishes of the council, Leonidis ventures out with 300 of Sparta's best men to confront the Persians. While they're away, the Queen faces conflict with Theron and the council, wishing to send reinforcements to aid the 300.<br/><br/>The film is visually arresting - kudos to Zack Snyder (fingers crossed for Watchmen). Astounding effects and gorgeous scenery (all CGI) make for some of the most breathtaking images in modern cinema. The slightly saturated look of the film is very welcome. The soundtrack was quite impressive, amazing choral selections as well as brutal percussion fit the mood of each scene (however, isn't the ""Moaning Woman"" a bit overdone?). The acting was fine for this type of movie, certainly not Academy worthy, but not detracting from the experience.<br/><br/>But you don't see the film for the acting. You see it for the action, and it's top notch. Brutal at times, yet very flowing, almost like a dance. There was one particular sequence which I found supremely badass in which the Captain's son and Stelios do this awesome thing back to back, playing off each other and kicking butt along the way. Very very cool.<br/><br/>The Queen's subplot adds some political intrigue, but really offers nothing needed to the overall narrative of the film. My only gripe with the film would have to be that it wasn't long enough, falling short of two hours. But that's really minute.<br/><br/>300 brings new meaning to the word ""epic."" The grandeur of the film makes for one enjoyable ride."
"isabelle1955","Null","4","10","12 March 2007"," I'm Off to Take a Cold Shower¬Ö..
","I love this movie ¬ñ but certainly for all the wrong reasons! <br/><br/>My first suggestion is that Snyder and Warner Brothers fire the entire marketing department. This is definitely not, as they may think, a movie for the impressionable 18-30 male demographic, with its fairly obvious homophobic overtones and clich√©d, war-like call to arms (did the US Marine Corps put up the money?) <br/><br/>No, no. This, my friends, is a movie for the 40+ female demographic, with acres of lush male flesh on display and muscles so tight you could hear them rippling if the soundtrack weren't so loud. (I recommend you turn your hearing aids down ladies. You won't gain much insight from listening to the dialogue anyway.) I haven't seen this many well toned abs since my Opthalmologist gave me a tricky new prescription for bi-focals, and I wandered by accident into the wrong locker room at the gym! If I hadn't taken my husband and son with me, the theatre staff might well have had to scrape me off the floor at the end of the show. Did the ancient Spartans really fight in Speedos? <br/><br/>Seriously, I guess I have to say something intellectual about the actual movie, not just the natural wonder of Messrs. Butler, Santoro and Wenham's physical attributes, which are very much on display here. This movie was interesting on several levels - not least because it's the first film I've seen in a long time where the men had bigger chests than most of the women, although, gratifyingly, the women appeared to have more gray matter between their ears than the fellas ¬ñ and I really don't quite know what to make of the suggestions that it's really a Neo-fascist call to make war on Iran. I mean, are the American public really that gullible? If so, I'm handing back my Green Card and heading back to Europe faster than a quarter would bounce off Vincent Regan's pecs. This movie must have been 5 years in the making, from the first glimmer of an idea in Zack Snyder's heated brain to its display on the Santa Cruz cinema screen. Is the guy really that prescient? Personally I find it hard to believe. Some of the critics of 300 need a sense of humour infusion.<br/><br/>I think I'm just going to settle for being totally disingenuous, and take 300 entirely at face value, as a re-creation of a comic book, and leave it at that. And as a re-creation of a comic book (sorry but nothing on earth is going to induce me to call them ""Graphic Novels"" even though I know that's the politically correct thing to do. I know a comic book when I see one. Fanny Hill is a ""Graphic Novel"". It's a novel and it's graphic.) it works pretty well. It's certainly a fine display of technical movie making, very stylized and a bit thin on plot but very well edited, and if you want depth and complexity, go and see The Departed instead (which I did a couple of weeks ago, and it's terrific.) Neither should you expect too much historical accuracy, but then this IS Hollywood. This movie is unapologetically gory and violent, but in a cartoonish way, has a multitude of nipples on display of both genders, and no one, but no one, can possibly not know what they are letting themselves in for when they shell out their 10 bucks and buy a ticket.<br/><br/>Gerard Butler gives an honest, engaging performance as King Leonides, a man who clearly loves his wife, as we see during a mildly erotic interlude where they trot briskly through a variety of positions for our, and I hope their, pleasure. Lena Headey plays a strong Queen Gordo; I'd forgotten just how good she is, although there were moments I thought she might be channeling Queen Amidala. David Wenham, clad in slightly more costume than he wore in Better than Sex (but only just), remains firm-jawed after losing an eye in battle (""Never mind ¬ñ I've got a spare!"") although I found his delivery of the narration ever-so-slightly irritating. He does a great cockney accent but his ""Queen's English"" is less convincing (to a Brit, anyway.)<br/><br/>This may well become a cult classic. Personally I think I'll buy the DVD and keep it on a permanent loop on the screen of my laptop with the sound turned off. It could enliven many a dull moment at our quarterly management meetings! Definitely one for the girls."
"moviewizguy","7","4","10","11 March 2007"," A Visually Violent Fantastic Film!
","Based on Frank Miller's graphic novel, ""300"" concerns the 480 B.C. Battle of Thermopylae, where the King of Sparta led his army against the advancing Persians; the battle is said to have inspired all of Greece to band together against the Persians, and helped usher in the world's first democracy.<br/><br/>Visually, the movie is obviously one of the greatest in movie history, in the vein of Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow. The action scenes are very well done with the camera-work and has decent special effects. One very good visualized scene is of a woman doing this ritual with smoke and see-through clothes. I got to say, it was pretty very beautiful and mesmerizing.<br/><br/>Even better is the storytelling. The story and script of the film is fantastic! The acting by Gerard Butler and Lena Headey are very good. This is actually my first epic film I've ever seen. I still want to watch others like Gladiator, King Arthur, Kingdom of Heaven, Troy, Alexander, and so on. I was pleasantly surprised that the film was very good, one of the year's best so far!<br/><br/>I got to admit that the beginning starts off a bit slow. All the action the trailer promises are seen later in the film but you'll get used to it. I thought this was already overrated before seeing this movie but it's not. One thing I was annoyed by were the constant creatures getting larger scene after scene, like a snowball effect. One small creature gets killed and then there are two slightly bigger creatures and then so on and so on.<br/><br/>At the end of the film, I wanted to applaud but I didn't want to cause disturbance, especially this one guy who clapped every one or two scenes as people laugh at him. This is an amazing film to watch. Of course the breathtaking CGI and camera-work would worth your ticket to see this movie but the great storytelling is just a great deal!"
"jdkraus","9","4","10","10 March 2007"," Quite satisfying: Great action and visuals without the real history
","Based off of Frank Miller's graphic novel, 300 is about the spartan warriors who fought and gave their lives at the battle of Thermapolye against impossible odds of the 1,000,000 man Perisan army. For starters, this is not, I repeat not a documentary or historically correct to the battle, for it is based off a comic book.<br/><br/>Now, after saying that, the film gives a very bizarre, but creative new look of movie-making. Having not seeing Sin City, (which was the creators of this), I was both flabbergasted and impressed by its unusual feat of movie-making. Instead of just having regular color and a realistic look, the picture has a high quality of tinting, especially of the background scenery. For instance if the film was st nighttime the colorization of the film had dark colors flooding the screen, and when it was bright in the day, the coloring was bright. The color also had this affect in the buildings and landscape as well throughout the film. Personally, this gave a very godlike and mythical look of the film. It was amazing to even look at! Also added to this amazement, the film has some of the best CGI and animation I have seen since The Return of the King. The visuals were great in both the battle sequences and in other places, throughout the film. Along with some great make-up jobs of the variety of creatures (which were many), to the artsy production design. Even more exciting was the battles.<br/><br/>It took about a half hour for them to arrive, but when they come, there is no end to the action-oriented gallons of blood and maimed bodies that filled the screen (sorry for the squeamish). Although there is much slaughter in the film, it maybe exciting to the blood and gore fans, but the violence is depicted rather unrealistically like a video game, for each Spartan seems to kill hundreds and hundreds of Persians without even receiving a single injury. It is rather cartoonish and stylized, but at least holds a hint of reality to it. Basically, expect much blood, that doesn't even look real, its more computer generated blood splatters and hacked off limbs flying around in slow-motion, like Kill Bill rather than the horror of Braveheart or Gladiator. It is action oriented, and not too painful to watch, but rather long lasting.<br/><br/>The acting was very good. Gerald Butler, once again proves to be a talented actor as the courageous and bloodthirsty, but humane and moral King Leonardis. There weren't too many other recognizable faces, but they all did equally as well, bringing forth likable and believable characters that fight and face their doom without fear.<br/><br/>However, its flaw was the story. It was a simple story of war, courage, and destiny, but it did not broaden too much, nor did have a strong, emotional effect like Braveheart. It still held some emotion to it, but not much. Besides, there isn't too much dialog to the film and it also holds some hokey elements that drifted from it anyway. It's an action flick with great effects/cinematography and amazing battle sequences with a pounding a hard core rock soundtrack. There's no heavy history to it like Alexander, nor it has a heavy moral tale like Gladiator.<br/><br/>It's a great diversion that left me satisfied. ***1/2 out of **** When you want an action film that satisfies the need of a diversion, I highly suggest 300!"

"scheisskopf","7","4","10","10 March 2007"," Don't go for the dialog
","This movie is one of the most visually stunning films I've ever seen. Seeing it on an Imax screen certainly heightened this effect. I'm also pretty sure that almost every line from the graphic novel has been included in the film; the part of the movie already penned by Miller and Varly is exceptional. A difference between this movie and Sin City is that the stories adapted to make Sin City into a movie were chopped down a bit, as there was a surplus of material already written. For 300, the material had to be beefed up by adding a political aspect to the film and fleshing out the character of Sparta's queen. This new material is very clich√© and usually accompanied by an obnoxious score that's meant to highlight the emotional content of the current monologue. That said, I hope no one goes to this movie for the dialog. The reason to go and see 300 is to see glorious and bloody battles, beautifully shot and portrayed. If you find yourself reveling in the slaughter, don't be alarmed. That's where all the fun is."

","Well I expected that the story would be a bit off and I expected that it would be a living comic book so in those matters I was correct. I found that many of the ""pictures"" presented were truly beautiful. Now the rest of what I felt is not quite that positive. The use of ""mutants"" was just dumb and certainly one was enough. Additionally if you ""must"" use mutants maybe you should improve on the makeup job so that it looks better than the Lon Chaney Sr. silent version of Hunchback of Notre Dame, which sadly it did not. Perhaps spending more than 6 dollars on a scriptwriter would have helped as well as I can't imagine how the actors were able to keep a straight face during the utterance of some of these lines.The audience that I sat with openly laughed at some of the lines and the acting was - well - you can't make a silk purse out of a sow's ear so is cardboardian an word? Xerxes as a Huh-sexual? pierced Giant. I have always admired the Greek Culture and the bravery of the men in this battle but if I see one more shot of greased up six packed posed hoplites I may become physically ill, after the 12th one I was impressed enough.

Nice try in equaling Peter Jackson epic thingy things, but totally overdone on the wrong aspects.

","A few days ago I bought the blu-ray of 300 and naturally I wanted to revisit the film that was a favourite of mine since I have seen it in the cinema. Well, younger me clearly loved it a whole lot more than older me. Read here what the thoughts of younger me were:<br/><br/>""300"" is one of the most beautiful movies I have ever seen! This story based on the graphic novel is simply wonderful. The visuals are stunning. The music is great. The acting is superb. The drama is more than excellent. The action is epic. It is difficult to describe the feeling you get when you see this movie. When you look at the screen you know some things can't happen. But the way it is edited and filmed gives the impression that it is all real. ""300"" never gets boring! I never wanted this movie to end. It is a movie you can watch over and over again and enjoy every minute of it. This is a movie that should be playing in the theaters all the time. (Are you still here? Go rent or buy the movie already!). <br/><br/>While I admire younger me's enthusiasm, older me is a little more reserved. For one thing 300 does lose strength after several viewings. It is therefore not a movie you can watch over and over again without getting bored. Perhaps it is the fact that we are spoiled even more spectacle wise and that we gotten used to bigger and better. Although I have to say that some of the visuals still hold up and look mesmerizing. Especially in HD. But to be honest it is not exactly the spectacle that I am critical of. For what it offers it's solid to grand. It's more the non action scenes that pop out more than before. Of course it is understandable that the surprise factor of many of those plot related moments is diminished. However I do distinctly remember being more involved and immersed with the main characters and the odds they had to go against. A lot of the dramatic scenes now were lacking intensity. And I think it is because the films misses some memorable dialogue and stronger dynamics. Apart from the iconic quotes: <br/><br/>""This is Sparta!"", ""Tonight we dine in hell."", ""A thousand nations of the Persian empire will descend upon you. Our arrows will blot out the sun! Reply from Stelios: Then we will fight in the shade.""<br/><br/>The excellent cast hide the fact they don't have that much to say or to express. Instead of showing us we are told by narrator Dilios (played by David Wenham) what the emotions are and where our sympathies should lie. Highly effective the first few times. But now after having watched the film a couple of times the cracks are beginning to show. Is this is a bad thing? No, I don't think so. Although I had wished that 300 had a little more to offer next to the action and nice visuals. Still if you haven't seen this film yet then you will have a blast since the first time watching is splendid fun."

It's a visual wonder and would be worth watching just for that (the scene with the Oracle is particularly memorable). The acting is fair, sometimes even rather good, and the narrative style really gives the movie that comic book feel.<br/><br/>With that said, however, 300 can be found lacking in just about everything else. The content was less than appealing and some nasty political parallels pop up here and there, even if one isn't looking for them.<br/><br/>300 may be a feast for the eyes, but that's about it.

","I'll make it concise and short.<br/><br/>If you're ugly, dark-skinned, gay, lesbian, black, tall like a basketball player, middle-eastern, Asian (yes, I saw the Chinese guy with the Fu Manchu mustache), crippled, deformed, mistreated, enslaved, a prostitute, an endangered animal like a rhino or an elephant: you deserve to be killed.<br/><br/>If you're a corrupt, sexual degenerate politician (Democrats I presume, I assume), a potter, a sculptor (basically artists, you know the liberal elite) or a syphillitic child-molesting priest (I think they mean Catholics here), a leader who believes in negotiation (Xerxes wanted to deal but that ain't good enough, plus Xerxes kept on saying how ""kind"" he was): you deserve to be killed.<br/><br/>Oh and if you have body piercings, you deserve to die too because obviously you don't respect your body enough.<br/><br/>However, if you're white, blue-eyed, go to the gym, like to poke other guys with phallic-shaped instruments, love war, and wear leather diapers just for kicks: you deserve to kill everybody else.<br/><br/>Other observations: Allies are kinda useless, you don't really need them because they'll make a mess of things or just turn tail when the going gets tough.<br/><br/>You can only beat the good guys with trickery (in this case, somebody betrayed them!).<br/><br/>Strong women are glorious too, as long as they manipulate other men with sex, or murder in vengeance because obviously they're too dumb to use their brains to outsmart the guys!!! When fighting, all you need is a ""heart filled with hate""! Hate's a good thing, so let's all give hate and war a chance!!! I loved the movie, I really did. And you gotta admit, the timing of this movie is perfect!"
"toytrainbob","9","5","14","15 March 2007"," Although flawed, a most powerful and totally entertaining film
","This film takes the epic film to a new level. The best battle scenes since Braveheart. The power of the film is its simple theme of duty, loyalty and honor. But it takes it further, it defines the essence of being the male of the species. The male bonding and sacrifice that makes men men, Yes violent but with a certain honor uniquely male. This is not to lessen the role of women for Queen Gorgo is a complete and compelling character that complements her husband near perfectly. Certainly not a politically correct film because the film clearly defines the basic differences between the sexes. One is not better than the other, just different. And there were obvious political overtones to today's world that should make every democrat cringe just a bit. <br/><br/>It has a few flaws in the dialogue and the heavy use of digitized filming, although artsy, does get tiresome. Still a must see movie!!!"
"dik_2k3","10","5","14","15 March 2007"," OK ,OK, OK... enough already
","I can't stand all the whining anymore about this film. First off, this movie was awesome. Perhaps one of the most masculine film I've ever seen without it having a hint of stupidity.<br/><br/>Now, for all of those people who are whining about sticking to the original plot of the graphic novel (yes people, this was made from a comic, hence the dramatic heroism aspect), shut up. Movies are meant to just be an interpretation of what they're based from. Of course it has to stay within some limits or else it ends up like another ""Prisoner of Azkaban"". But I don't think it really was that far off the mark. Anyway, if you want the original plot without any corruptions, read it.<br/><br/>I seen someone wrote that there wasn't much character development and a bit of bad acting. Honestly, I don't see how you could put much development into a movie about a battle. It's not like they're gonna stop fighting and bleed there hearts out to each other. Plus, this was a movie about men who were tempered not to show emotions. On the other hand, I think they did pretty good with Leonidas' dilemma of what to do at the beginning. The other good one was the son wanting to earn the respect of his father and then after the son had been killed, the father regretting never telling his son how much he loved him. Oh, and about the acting... the killing was pretty frickin convincing to me. The dialog had its profound moments throughout the movie as well.<br/><br/>Oh man, first the Iranians, now the ""concerned mothers"" of the states. OK, this movie is NOT racist. It's just historically accurate whenever it comes to that part. Wait a second before you blow a colon, OK? Now, the Spartans were all about breeding the best when it came to their children. I know it sounds like horses, but deal with it. They weren't exactly nurturing souls. Anyway, I don't really think they fornicated with outside ethnicities that much because that would've contaminated their superior genes (think Nazi, OK?). Therefore, the Spartans were white (Greek, whatever you want to call it). On to the Persians... they conquered a lot of kingdoms and absorbed those citizens into their army a slaves and such. So naturally, they would be comprised of a lot of different ethnicities. Such as black, Asian, and middle eastern. I'm pretty sure there were some white guys in that mess too. So you see... no intentional racism. As for the Iranians... well, we can't really help the fact that your ancestors went on a empirical, murderous rampage a few thousand years ago. Now can we? Hopefully this cleared up a few things. If not, shut up.<br/><br/>P.S. I'm not a redneck Bush supporter. The Iran thing, just happened to be something I heard about in the news. Apparently they didn't enjoy the evil Persian look that ""300"" portrayed, so they decided to make positive movies about the Persians. I say, as long as it's entertaining and doesn't turn out to be something horrible, like ""Facing the Giants"", I'm game."
"moutonbear25","6","5","14","11 March 2007"," Style v Substance
","Have you ever heard of a little argument called, ""Style vs. Substance?"" If you haven't, I'm afraid I cannot help you. You must stop reading now. No, seriously, of course you know the debate. In a visual world, what holds more relevance, the way something looks or what is ultimately being said? When related to film, some would argue that style can and should exist without the burden of having to show meaning, that a provocative, effective aesthetic can stand alone. Others would argue that beauty is only skin deep and that without meaning or attention placed on other areas of focus, one is left with an empty experience. In this review, this argument will be applied to Zack Snyder's 300, a film that is drawing mass hordes of people to the theatre to feast upon its blood soaked violence, based on the Frank Miller (SIN CITY) graphic novel. Included amidst these masses are my roommate, Trevor Adams, and myself. Trevor will argue for style and I will argue for substance. Trevor has a background in animation and special effects and carries with him a childhood love for comic books and video games. All of these influences lent weight to his enjoyment of 300. If you're a regular reader and you know me at all, you know that I am most satisfied by well- strung words that are given even more meaning by appropriate and innovate visuals. Trevor and I are two people with often similar views that left the theatre entirely polarized. Whereas he saw art, I saw a failed attempt.<br/><br/>TREVOR: Truthfully, I'm not so much a fan of blue/green-screen film-making. If the recent STAR WARS films are examples of using this technology to create an entire feature, why would I be interested at all in seeing this 300 film? 300 Spartans acting in front of a screen that would later be replaced by computer graphics just didn't appeal to me as a concept. I blame the trailer for convincing me of otherwise. In its 2 minutes, I knew that this was going to become an important art film that would have to fight to assert its value. The frames are painted in a way that they create an astoundingly beautiful, living comic book. I've treated myself to reading a number of comics in the last few weeks and although the stories and dialogue make my eyes roll in a way that sometimes gets me dizzy, the drawings, color and composition keep me heavily interested and eagerly turning to the next page. 300 is no different. A single film frame can be worth a thousand words of script. The fight sequences are so strikingly rendered, I found myself at points begging for the director to slow down so I could absorb more of each and every frame ¬Ö and in fact, at times, that was exactly what he did. My appreciation of this film lies not within the 300 naked Spartans or the violence they promote that brought on the comic book geeks and raving macho WWE crowd, but rather within the frames of perfection that I was given. I was so filled with love for what my eyes were witnessing, the style became the substance of this film. <br/><br/>JOE: It's not that I cannot applaud 300 for its innovation and effort. The framing at times approaches a higher level of art and the tonality and quality of the film are engrossing, despite the obvious GLADIATOR influence. What GLADIATOR had that 300 does not is depth, a more personal sense of urgency and purpose. Spartan King Leonides fights with passion and love for his empire but his almost entirely faceless army fights blindly alongside him. 300 spends little time establishing itself historically and even less time developing its cast past their drone status so what you are left with is a bunch of boys in battle. It is violence for its own sake and its energy is not enough to overlook the banalities of their dialogue or the ridiculous fashion in which that dialogue is delivered. Even the look wears thin. As one fight leads to another with little to no other development taking place in between, the cheaper elements of the design unveil themselves. Gimmicky monsters appear to attempt new levels of excitement and the skimpy outfits and painted-on abs of the Spartans draw attention to the film's thinly veiled intentions. 300 is nothing more than a stylized masturbatory fantasy of violence, blood and misogyny. In other words, it is pure Frank Miller.<br/><br/>TREVOR: The story is simple in 300. It doesn't try to hide itself under any complicated military strategies, nor does it weave in any intricate politics within the Spartan government. Zack Snyder simply connects the simple dots of Frank Miller's story and then beautifully paints his colors within and around those lines. It's not that I couldn't go on and on about the elements that bothered me in this film (i.e. the Golem-like ogre character; the horribly- acted Xerxes; or the simple fact that this was based on a Frank Miller comic book), but I'd rather take the same approach I did in exiting the cinema: Focus on what I loved. No film is perfect, but there can be perfect moments. This film had about 300 of them.<br/><br/>JOE: There are certainly a select group of film and graphic geeks, like Trevor, who will see this film with the sole purpose of devouring its visual extravagance. It is their art and I do not begrudge them of it. As far as I am concerned though, when a filmmaker spends all of his focus on one element of style and allows for so many other formal aspects to just get by on their own, you are left with a hollow shell. 300 is beautiful but beauty fades fast when there is nothing underneath."
"oneloveall","6","5","14","7 March 2007"," Noteworthy aesthetics beg to compensate for everything else
","Thrillingly visceral although noticeably repetitious, this fictionalization details some of the more rock-star moments which occurred during Greece's legendary Battle of Thermopylae. With acute precision, director Zack Snyder brings comic Frank Miller's dark adaptation of this epic war to the screen with a stunning vibrancy and attention to detail that rivals any artistic endeavorers to capture the heat of primitive battle prior. In these sequences of bloody beauty, all but the most estrogen-laden souls should marvel at the technical superiority and arresting direction caught up into capturing heated moments of blood-lust, distinguishing the creatively ambitious battle movie from similar, less splashy fare.<br/><br/>Against longer living aspirations, the insistence on elevating all fighting to such artistic excess simply overwhelms the majority of the movie's plot-forwarding and character-developing instincts, almost making dialog seem superfluous when viewed in succession. Clearly we have a movie here that wishes to balance the dramatic significance these Spartans faced on those fateful days with an accessibility and wow factor just dying to appeal to the young male demographic. The fights remain vibrantly captivating throughout, though retrospect seems to undermine any emotional substance lingering due to the inordinate amount of adolescent pandering found during these artistically excessive sword fights. Likewise, much of the screenplay absolutely pales in comparison to any on-screen fighting, often clumsily filling in silences with repetitious, empty narrative reiterations on notions of pride, warrior spirit, respect, and any other empty sentiment tacked on to give the eye candy a little more supposed relevance.<br/><br/>Still, anyone with a pulse should at least remain mildly engaged throughout the hyper-kinetic, ultra-stylish battle scenes, at least during the first few attacks while the presentation remains fresh. The film tends to devolve further and further into some monster-based fantasy as we go along, but anyone coming into 300 expecting a serious piece of factual storytelling should have already realized they are in the wrong theater. Everyone else, have fun!"

","I think this movie is a less than mediocre commercial film. OK, the graphic effects are good, and the action is not bad, but all the plot is good only for the silly macho-men without an instruction.. (It is a good example of these the scene in which the more cultured Athenians are derided by Spartans because of their warmongerness) I have seen an exaggerate and aberrant division between Good and Evil, where arrogance, fine appearance, absence of pity and mercy, etc. = Good, physical deformity, colored skin = Evil And the separation between good and evil is totally stereotyped. There's no human complexity in the characters: Spartans are all fearless, incorruptible and first of all... have prominent abdominal. Their enemies must be at least: deform, ambiguous, subhuman or perverted. All here is radical and fanatic... it makes me think to some Right's propaganda."
"claudio_carvalho","7","8","27","8 April 2007"," A Cartoonist and Violent Remake
","When the ambitious King Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro) of Persia invades Greece with his huge army to extend his vast slave empire, the brave Ling Leonidas (Gerard Butler) brings his personal body guard army composed of three hundred warriors to defend the passage of Thermopylae, the only way by land to reach Greece. Using courage and the great battle skill of his men, he defends Thermopylae until a treacherous Greek citizen tells King Xerxes a secret goat passage leading to the back of Leonidas's army. Meanwhile, his wife Queen Gorgo (Lena Headley) of Sparta tries to convince the council to send the Spartan army to fight against the Persians.<br/><br/>The epic ""The 300 Spartans"" is a great tale of courage, heroism and idealism. This remake is more cartoonist and violent, with monsters and giants as if it were a video game. The Brazilian actor Rodrigo Santoro is unrecognizable in the role of the King Xerxes. I usually do not like remakes, but this one gives a different approach to the heroic King Leonidas and the three hundred Spartans that defended their country in 480 BC. My vote is seven.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""300"""
"defeatdisease","8","3","7","30 May 2017"," tremendous experience
","Every scene is beautifully crafted. I found the slowdown to be stylistic and much of the dialogue, which is apparently cheesy and fascist to everyone else, to be at least somewhat inspiring, and certainly engaging. These Spartans were trained their entire lives to be warriors, their entire culture is built around success in battle, and you don't expect them to be quite skilled, much more so than a slave army, and quite patriotic? Also, this movie was from the point of view of the Spartans. How would this army have appeared to the Spartans? Wouldn't their stories now be over- exaggerated, over-simplified, almost legendary? There isn't a great amount of character development because this movie is about a battle, ONE battle, THE battle for the continuance of the Western world, and yes, IF the Spartans had been simply overwhelmed from the start, and if their Athenian allies hadn't completely CRUSHED the much larger Persian navy at sea, the West simply could not have existed in any similar manner as it has. And yes, the Western world is guilty of arrogance, overextending it's boundaries to the point of imperialism, however, it has given our world a plethora of all-too-important philosophical ideals that are simply irreplaceable if we want to live in a free society.<br/><br/>I realize I spent a great deal of my time being critical of other reviews, so I would like to take the time to apologize for perhaps wasting the time of someone who was simply searching for a detailed point of view on the film. I can assure you that the film is action-packed. The scenes are absolutely beautiful, every one of them. The film is gory, but artistically gory, if that makes any sense. You'll know what I mean. The story is simple, direct, and inspiring. The acting is excellent. The movie, overall, was a tremendous experience. I give it a 9."
"son_of_cheese_messiah","1","3","7","7 March 2014"," Go tell the Spartans they suck
","It is not surprising that this film gave rise to a large number of spoofs. It is indeed very spoof-worthy being itself at times close to being unintentionally funny although this is mitigated by the endless scenes of sadistically horrifying but unrealistic violence. Lots of slow-mo beheadings but not a great deal of blood spurting.<br/><br/>300 is based on a comic book (sorry I mean 'graphic novel', this is meant to be taken seriously) and it shows. Not that I have anything against comic books or adaptations of them but on the strength of this one (I've not read the original) it must have been bad indeed. A lack of historical accuracy and one dimensional characters betray the superficiality of the source. These are men who scorn armour in battle (unlike the real and more sensible Spartans) choosing instead to stride about in loin cloths and capes showing off their buff physiques. While the 300 are physically perfect it is troubling that their opponents are shown as being deformed or ugly. Equally troubling is why the Persians are shown as being black. This film (and its source comic?) is pushing a race purity line.<br/><br/>Perhaps I would be more troubled by it if I could take it seriously. In addition to the superficial source material, the director has added some gimmicky MTV-style effects himself. Endless slow-mo shots, some sexual titillation and an odd use of martial arts for ancient Greece. The whole thing is shot is an affected sepia shade.<br/><br/>In short, this is rubbish."
"SnoopyStyle","8","3","7","20 February 2014"," Zack Snyder's brilliant vision
","It's 480 BC and the Greek city states are faced with a massive invading Persian army. The Spartan King Leonidas (Gerard Butler) and a force of 300 men march to the Hot Gates at Thermopylae to face King Xerxes and his army. The cliff narrows to a small opening to negate Xerxes' numerical advantage. They would hold the pass until they are betrayed.<br/><br/>This is all about director Zack Snyder's vision to adapt this Frank Miller graphic novel. It is a cinematic full screen representation of a comic book. He's taken the beauty and essence of a 2-dimensional artform onto the big screen. He has taken the successful 'Sin City' style to the next level.<br/><br/>The story is fairly basic. It's a lot of machismo and lots of abs.

Overall, the movie portrayed everyone terribly, had the worst development, and only made up for the torture of seeing it with a few good action scenes. Oh yeah, it was RIDICULOUSLY unrealistic too. Moreover, the Persian King, Xerxes, is almost hilarious in the absurd presentation of him; his deep voice is hilarious too. The real story hardly occurred that way, and the movie is probably the worst historical movie ever, especially considering it was historical fiction.

Made in the same comic book / movie style of Sin City (which was a good film), this is the bastardized version of a true ancient battle. It was not meant to be historically realistic, but more like a sailor's tale of sea monsters and whirlpools on the edge of the world. Sadly, this story filmed completely on green screen with echoing studio recording, tend to appear cheap to produce. Though it probably was not. The eliminated coloring and slowed graphic realism was probably emphasize to give the emotional air of war, combat and carnage.

"culmo80","9","3","7","6 August 2007"," Great movie
","I've always loved history and I study it constantly. I did not watch 300 with any notion that I'd be seeing a movie that was historically accurate. With that in mind, I was surprised at some of the little details that were accurate, (of course much of it is still inaccurate but hey it's a movie).<br/><br/>This movie is also not right-wing propaganda. If you think so, then perhaps you should re-examine your own outlook and see just how far to the left you have gone. You might as well claim that Braveheart and Gladiator are also right-wing propaganda. Of course, any film that promotes strength would be considered right wing to the Daily Kos readers that are on here. Okay, for the facts, here we go:<br/><br/>Fact, King Leonidas did lead about 300 Spartans into the Hot Gates...with about another 4,000 Greeks or so. This was in junction with a Greek Naval action that held off the Persian navy and forced Xerxes to land further to the North, thus forcing him to confront the Greeks.<br/><br/>Fact, the Persian Empire covered parts of Africa, The Middle East, and yes, Persia (modern-day Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan etc). Thus, there were Africans, Egyptians, Arabs and surprisingly, Persians in the Persian army. Another small fact is that the Spartans and other Greek city-states were in fact Greek, thus they would appear white, kinda like they did in the film. Yes I know we're all used to seeing every possible ethnic makeup on screen to appease the race-baiters, but it wouldn't make sense to have a Greek Phalanx made up for anyone but white guys, right? Kinda like how the film Zulu had black men play the Zulu forces...<br/><br/>As for the dialog...again, if you think this is right-wing, then perhaps you're just that far to the left. <br/><br/>Now as for the film itself. It is very entertaining. You'll get the general gist of the historical action but do not take the film as an accurate portrayal of how the events really happened. There is no record that Xerxes used Rhinos or elephants in his invasion of Greece. That's just an example but you get the point.<br/><br/>The film is violent but it's not incredibly bloody. There's nudity but it's not pointless nudity. <br/><br/>Hopefully, you'll watch this film and want to know more about the time and the events."

The lighting effects and general direction is bang on and makes the film a non-stop adrenaline filled film.<br/><br/>Another thing I liked is the film never tried to make any one Spartan look like a hero. Yes we had King Leionidas but for every shot of him throwing a spear through the eyes of Persian, we saw a parallel shot of say Captain or Dilios cutting a mans face down the centre to which a pool of blood erupted. In life the Spartans were always about the man by your side and this film pulled that point across to absolute perfection.<br/><br/>I also liked the banter between Stelios and Captains son. It lightened the mood of the movie and reminded me of the banter between Gimli and Legolas in LotR. Whats more their friendly banter made the death of Captains Son for myself that little harder to watch.<br/><br/>The action and fights were awesome, with blood, decapitations, merciless warriors truly lighting the screen up. I loved how the directors made Xerxes so much taller, as if to make us think Xerxes was that little bit mightier which made the eventual downfall of so many Persians all the more sweeter to watch.<br/><br/>The constant narration by Dilios was again perfect, he came in and spoke when needed and the writing was sublime.<br/><br/>I want to give it a 10 but that 0.0000000001 is because I wanted the movie to go on for hour's on end. They could have made this movie 5, 10, 24 hours long and not one person would want to leave that cinema before the movie finished.<br/><br/>and whats with the fat dude with two blades for hands. Xerxes must have been like 'i don't want to use axes for executions, I know lets cut this fat dudes arms off *cuts arms off* right now strap on some axes, *axes strapped on* see perfect, you wanna drink mate, oh right forgot you have no hands anymore'"

","Reguardless of some comments this is in fact an excellent film I first saw with my girlfriend who enjoyed it as much as I showing appeal to both genders. However as this is being trounced on grounds of historical inaccuracy I ask did you honestly go to see a film where trailers clearly show nine feet tall physically deformed naked warriors in chains to have its historical facts down to the letter. This film was based on a fictional piece written about a non fictional battle and was never intended to truly portray the actual happenings of the Battle Of Thermopylae. It was intended to entertain, not to educate. As for a political undertone, it may well but at the same time this film could have easily portrayed the Persians in an excellent light as was truly the case and the 300 Spartans each as war hungry monsters who cast defective children from the cliff-tops and in either case its not as though by watching this film you are inciting a war by doing so. Your spending your hours wage to watch two hours of an excellent movie. <br/><br/>If you haven't had the chance to watch this film yet I would definitely put it on your list of things to do in life."

","What buffoon seriously believes ""300"" represents real history, or real people? It's astounding that there are people so mind-numbingly dense as to feel the need to spout ill-conceived, poorly researched, knee-jerk reactions about how the movie misrepresents Persians.<br/><br/>Understand this, people: Yes, it misrepresents them. Also understand this: It's a movie. It's fantasy. Get over it.<br/><br/>Yeah, the ""Persians"" in the film come out looking pretty bad, I'll certainly give you that. Consider that the British often appear equally poorly in movies about the U.S. Revolutionary War. And the French come out looking bad in movies about Algerian independence, and so on and so on. I'm certain Americans come out looking pretty horrific in plenty of films. But accept that it just happens, and unless a film purports to be a documentary, it's not worth getting steamed about -- or feeling the need to come up with ""reactions"".<br/><br/>Indeed, ""300"" is so laden with the unreal and imaginary that I can't believe people think it represents actual historical Persians. Seriously: who could possibly confuse ""300"" with actual history? Here's some help for the confused: What army ever fielded legions of horribly disfigured mutants? Or was led by a nine-foot bald colossus who spoke in deafening Surround Sound? Answer: only an imaginary one.<br/><br/>What's wrong with the people who take real offense when the movie is so wholly a comic-book-style fantasy? I will clarify one accurately depicted concept in the movie, however: the Greeks' determination to not live as ""slaves"" doesn't refer to slavery, as such. Instead, it means they refuse to submit to a foreign power. Thus, the reference to Xerxes' army being comprised of slaves was true, according to the Greeks' point of view: the Persian army was comprised largely of conquered peoples. For example, the Medes were the first foes the Greeks fought at Thermopylae, and were the most recently conquered by the Persians.<br/><br/>One need only read any amount of actual history to know the difference; I suggest the complainers start doing just that. And then relax.<br/><br/>Finally, to the unfortunate buffoon who posits that ""Persia started civilization"": That's only about as true as the statement ""Columbus discovered America."" Who do you think the Seleucids were trading with along the Silk Road? Answer: China, which we know enjoyed a rich cultural and scientific heritage beginning thousands of years earlier.<br/><br/>Read a history book, and don't take fantasy so personally."
"Baldrick44","9","3","7","17 April 2007"," Stylised history
","OK, firstly, as a historian I recognized the various inaccuracies in the movie. However since I am also a comic book nerd I was more than willing to move beyond them and see what they did to a great graphic novel which is artistically based on the Battle of Thermopylae. For this to work, they would really have to do something different. And they have. The atmosphere that they have created for this film is nothing short of breathtaking. It's not the actors nor the effects, nor the camera work, nor the soundtrack but all of it coming together to make a feeling that is incredibly involving. 300 is a movie that has done for history what Sin City did for Film Noir. It doesn't take it past a point of no return, but it takes elements of a genre and mixes them with a magic ingredient- Frank Miller's mind."
"pelowell","8","3","7","7 April 2007"," Well crafted
","You shouldn't go to this movie expecting a great historical telling of the Battle of Thermopylae, and I think most who make it to the theatre pretty much know what they are in for. And that is simply a stunning recreation of Frank Millers graphic, testosterone fueled vision of what it might have been like to be a Spartan at the time, facing those insurmountable odds yet willing to lay it all out for your family, your nation, your world.<br/><br/>I was pleasantly surprised with this movie. I knew it would be entertaining, action packed, and full of great visuals much like Miller's stunning Sin City. What I wasn't prepared for was the solid acting. Characters were real and dimensional, and well played by all.<br/><br/>We spent the extra few dollars and caught the IMAX version, which was well worth it. Surprised to see almost as many women at the showing as men, and judging by the comments as the credits rolled, this movie will appeal to the ladies as much as the guys. The strong portrayal of Queen Gorgo, by Lena Headey, is one of the reasons. And I'm sure the leather loin clothes on the guys, and all the bare pectoral real estate, might be another.<br/><br/>The violence is brutal, yet fantastical in typical comic book fashion. I found movies like Braveheart, or The Departed, to be much gorier. 300 is not a family movie by any stretch, yet it is neither a blood soaked slash and gash picture. It is more jagged and raw, within that logical, rigid Spartan ideal, which fits in perfectly with the visual and thematic tones director Zack Snyder went for with this picture.<br/><br/>I would watch this movie again, and probably enjoy it just as much.<br/><br/>Guys, don't be afraid to take the ladies to this one. Trade her for a chick flick and you'll both be glad you did."

","This movie has awesome fighting and scenery. Some of the dialog was semi-campy but still acceptable.<br/><br/>The coloring and shading used in the film are so surreal. There is so much detail to examine in every scene that you'll need to watch the movie several times to take it all in.<br/><br/>The fight scenes are pretty visual, with exaggerated blood spurts as people are hacked up and their limbs go flying. The slow motion technique used for the fight scenes were awesome. This movie has some of the coolest fighting sequencing I have ever scene. Sort of reminded me of the game killer instinct where you could load up a combo attack. There were several scenes were multiple Spartans fought together in very cool corriographed routines. One in particular with two Spartans was very symbiotic when you could obviously tell that they relied on each other to stay alive on the battle filed while hacking their enemy to pieces. I just wish there could have been more of these scenes in the movie.<br/><br/>Just remember that this movie is based on a graphic novel. Don't try to analyze the historical accuracy.<br/><br/>Just enjoy the show!!!!!"

","I've gotten a little tired of hearing some of the same complaints about '300' over and over. I don't think people have really thought this through. I personally thought it was a wonderful adventure full of everything I wanted to see at the theater. I'm a fan of all sorts of movies and I could tell from the previews that this was not one that was going to make me think, that's what movies like 'Children of Men' are there for. This movie was made to entertain and certainly pulled it off. It was exactly the kind of story that the old Greek fathers would tell their sons about their descendents; emphasizing every triumph, making the enemy look worse and worse, creating the idea of 'heroes' in the minds of all Greeks. I noticed that a lot of people were angry at the fact that the movie stressed patriotism so much. Now, if you look at it from the context of out current situation in the Middle East, yes, I can see that you may consider this kind of a subliminal message. But if you ever read 'The Iliad' or 'The Odyssey' you'd know that heroism, patriotism, and death on the battle field were some of the most honored and glorified things in Greek culture. This movie wasn't made to make people think ""Hmm, maybe I should fight in Iraq,"" or ""Hey, what are my morals?"" It was made to make people say ""That was awesome, I'm going back to see it again."""

From the moment we're introduced to what means to be a Spartan towards the very end when we get to feel the greatness of dying as a warrior to be remembered, this motion picture deserves big and loud applause's.<br/><br/>Going back to 2000 I recall a movie called ""The Gladiator"" which is another fine example of quality cinema. I'm not comparing them but they sure have a similar basis.

"mario_c","7","3","7","5 April 2007"," ""Hey, you, what is your profession?""
","First of all I must start saying this is NOT a Historic movie but an Inspired in History Epic movie! It is, as we all shall know, an adaptation of a Frank Miller's graphic novel inspired in the Greek legend of the 300 men who fought until death, under King Leonidas' orders, against thousands of Persians. So, as the movie is an adaptation of a graphic novel based on courage and bravery it acts like that, meaning by other words, it's just an epic movie that illustrates bravery, courage and glory. That's nothing else. It's inspired in historic happenings, but it doesn't follow them faithfully, it's not its intention/purpose. <br/><br/>If we see the film by this point of view, we will find it pretty good, in spite of not being the best epic movie I've ever seen¬Ö In fact, I think there are a great number of epic movies, based in history, that are better than this one. I can remember BREAVEHEART¬Ö In my opinion was better than this 300¬Ö Anyway, 300 is definitely a good quality epic movie. <br/><br/>On the other hand, what annoyed me the most ‚Äì and it has nothing to do with the movie ‚Äì was some comments, here on IMDb, saying this movie is Fascist, based on propaganda, racist, that terrorists and Hitler would appreciate it¬Ö OH MY GOD! From WHERE came out these people who keep saying such silly crap?! <br/><br/>Let me just ask you something:<br/><br/>Is it a violent movie that praises violence, rage, and hate? YES, it is. <br/><br/>Is it a movie that discriminates the strong people from the weak, suggesting that the weaker and the disable ones should die to let the strong live? YES, it is. <br/><br/>Is it a movie that proposes us to fight for a cause and die, if necessary, to defend it? YES, it is. <br/><br/>Is it a movie that worships war instead of peace, ignoring the loss of 300 lives, just to claim an ideal of glory and pride? YES, it is. <br/><br/>It's ALL TRUE! but HEY you BLIND people just LOOK into HISTORY and search for yourselves:<br/><br/>if in the Ancient Sparta the children were not educated and military trained like the movie describes; <br/><br/>if they didn't kill the weakest and disable ones to just maintain the stronger in order to create the best soldiers; <br/><br/>If they weren't trained in the worst possible conditions and weren't ready to die for their land! <br/><br/>These men were just professional soldiers, born and trained to do just one thing in their lives: fight! They had no other professions like blacksmith, farmer, pastor ‚Äì like one scene of the movie clearly portrays! No, they were warriors, just that! <br/><br/>This film is just portraying realistically the ancient Sparta nation, so all those comparisons are absolutely absurd and without any sense. We can't look to the Ancient world with the same moral standards of our modern societies. We can't say this film is fascist just because it portrays a social behaviour (truth at that time) that nowadays we consider absolutely barbaric and salvage! The History is like that, we cannot change it! If we want to do something with historic sense we must be faithful to it, and not change it just because nowadays it's morally incorrect!<br/><br/>About the terrorist propaganda¬Ö another one that makes me laugh! This ""western world"" in going out crazy about the terrorist issue! If this film was shot just 15 years ago nobody would say it has a terrorist message! You all are PARANOID with terrorism! Just because it shows us glory becoming from death and suffering, just because it praises the death for a cause, it's terrorist propaganda! So did BREAVEHEART, and nobody said it had a terrorist message! <br/><br/>Other people say it's propaganda to the US army, because it shows us a gigantic force (Persians) crushing a small group of rebellions (the Spartans), and those would be the ""terrorists"" crushed by the military power of the bigger force¬Ö What they forgot is that either in History as in the movie, that Persian gigantic force (the invaders, just like the US army!) was defeated by the Greeks (the defenders of their land) ‚Äì not those 300, but the complete army ‚Äì so even here the comparisons are absolutely ridiculous!<br/><br/>Now, back to the movie, after all is what really matters! I just loved the characterization, especially of the Persians! The King Xerxes (played by Brazilian actor Rodrigo Santoro) and the Persian Immortals are simply fantastic! They may not be faithful to real history but they are amazing! As I said in the beginning the characterization mixes the ""real"" world with a world of fantasy and mysticism used in the graphic novels¬Ö I think the movie was improved by this type of characterization and fantasy. <br/><br/>Definitely, not a brilliant, but a pretty good epic movie!"
"cameron_thursday","7","3","7","5 April 2007"," Inspiring for its Uniqueness
","I must start off by saying it was rather different from what I was expecting. I've seen many movies with the same positive and negative features.<br/><br/>The positive features included the filming techniques, music and acting. The filming techniques were excellent, picking good camera angles and focusing was as best as could be hoped for. The positioning of the camera for certain angles during fight scenes made the action very spectacular. The music was very appropriate at each scene. The theme music was very dramatic, setting the mood within the audience. The acting was great, Gerard Butler was very inspiring, throughout the whole movie he wanted to achieve glory at every instant This tendency reflected the glory of Sparta well. I must commend the fighting scenes as well, they just made me want to applaud the Spartan's success for the warriors who after years of hardship to become so powerful and dominating.<br/><br/>Before you think I have no idea where the information of the movie came from, which is the graphic novel, I believe some historical and realistic facts should have been included.<br/><br/>The negative features did not wreck the film but they could have been prevented in my belief. Firstly, the story line was to narrow. It seems that the director tried to put a lot of the action into the 2 hours. Although the director set the context at the start, he needed to make the audience more compassionate for Sparta. This could have been done by showing them gaining a victory a moral victory during the First Persian War, portraying them as the protectors of good. Secondly, I believe the director was a bit too grotesque with his selection of certain mutant characters. Each time one of these characters appeared the audience laughed. I don't believe the director was attempting to achieve this and should have been more realistic in character selection. Finally, the story could have been more lengthy. I acknowledge the fact that the movie was portraying the greatest resistance in history, but the greatest movies are that of which the life surrounding the movie of the ""good guys / hometown"" becomes greater and more peaceful through hardship. This may seem harsh, but I did not say this was damming to the movie's excellence. The story line was still acceptable.<br/><br/>Overall, I would give this film 7 out of 10 (on the basis movies like Return of the King are 9.5). It's an awe inspiring film, which captivated the audience through its wondrous filmography and stunning battle scenes. The drama the director incorporated was excellent. There was minor criticism which in my belief made the film more unique.<br/><br/>For all those war and/or history genre fans, this is one movie you can't miss with it's heart rushing drama and inspiring battle scenes.<br/><br/>And yes, I used the word inspiring a lot, only because the film is just that.<br/><br/>By C Macdonald of Australia"

","While exiting the cinema I noticed several people saying such things as ""...best film ever"" and ""...epic..."", alternatively I also heard ""...appalling..."" etc.<br/><br/>Firstly, I do not think this is even remotely close to being called 'the best film ever', but neither is it a -bad- film. People are complaining that it is historically inaccurate. Well, yes, there are inaccuracies but really, most forms of entertainment require a suspension of belief. Overall, I've heard it isn't -that- inaccurate anyway.<br/><br/>Moving on, I think the film fulfils what it intends to do perfectly. I.e. be a faithful adaption from the comic 300, being memorable, but overall enjoyable. This is a typical blockbuster, not big on brains, but more on brawn.<br/><br/>However, there are things that are new and refreshing so that it's not the same-old same-old. The new digitalised background I think is beautiful, you can create some truly stunning scenery from it. Some people say it appears detached and unrealistic, but it's supposed to be like that to keep that comic book feel. They could easily have made it more realistic.<br/><br/>Next, the character development is minimal on all sides, which is slightly disappointing. The Spartans are glorified as a wonderful race, (although I think that ironic since they used to kill deformed children and mentally handicapped) the Persians are demonised and made to appear consistently deformed also to make killing them seem fair.<br/><br/>I think the character of Ephialtes is designed deliberately so he can be easily hated, which I dislike.<br/><br/>Overall, this film may have been over-hyped, but I think its a decent and faithful adaption of a comic book, and a decent enough blockbuster. It doesn't make you think, but the effects and choreography mean that you don't have to.<br/><br/>NeonBlue."

","Weren't the trailers amazing? This was what I was hoping for from 'Gladiator' - fun. Sorry, I meant to say FUN (and elephants in armour)! This is as close as anybody's going to get to a return to the beautiful heyday of eighties actioners.<br/><br/>There's sex, and you get to see a (gasp!) nipple or two. What happened to movie sex? Pansied away by nay-sayers, moralistic bigots and religious zealots, 300 shows that it's still okay for a film aimed at the 18-30 male demographic to have sex, violence and sweaty men. Oh, and some more violence. And a bit just then. And another slo-mo, flying camera massacre...<br/><br/>Towards the end, excitement starts to wane as you realise you've already seen arms, legs and heads chopped off (all very prettily of-course). Forgivable in a movie that means for you to say ""Hey, i've seen so much gore i'm numb to it now - Wow, the film-maker's must've meant for me to feel this way"", but a little more like overkill in this film. Whilst I was in this fugue, I considered something else that had been bugging me.<br/><br/>This film wriggles. Wriggles all over the place - allow me to explain. The digital process that pretty much all of the shots have gone through has affected the movie as a whole (IMHO), in a bad way. Imagine a filter over every scene that tries to mask/blend the combination of VFX and live-action. Now imagine that that filter is digital, and can behave in any way the producers like. To try to replicate the effect of 'coarse' film stock, giving the film a grittier feel, blocks of colour in the background have a constant live (I prefer the term 'wriggling') pixel effect that draws your eye away from the foreground. Per the title of this comment, I imagine it might have something to do with the massive saleability of a digitally produced film in the new HD formats - with any luck, this will look amazing on a smaller Hi-Def screen.<br/><br/>Technicalities aside, 300 is exactly what it looks like. A film about sweaty, washboard bellied men fighting heroically. The film-makers don't care about historical accuracy, appropriate languages, or political correctness in this film, and neither do I. The handsome men fight and die. The beautiful women have sex. The deformed outcast... well, you'll see."

"monk_e_fish","5","3","7","28 March 2007"," Visually dazzling but very shallow
","You get the impression that, were they able to take time from their busy schedule of brutal training and massive slaughter, the Spartans would enjoy Frank Miller's vision of their most legendary moment, the last stand of 300 Spartan warriors against the vast Persian army at Thermopylae. Cinema going audiences were introduced to Miller's world view in the phenomenally successful if insubstantial Sin City and little has changed here despite the dramatic change of scenery from dark shadowy Basin City to the bright cornfields of ancient Sparta. In fact, the classical world setting allows for an even more extreme version of Miller's preoccupations, tough, physical, brutal men, beautiful women and loathsome, deformed, depraved and ugly villains. This certainly tallies with the philosophy of a proto-fascist people who prized strength and physical prowess above all else exposed and abandoned any child to display the slightest deformity and trained their children in the ways of violent combat from a young age. Director Zack Snyder, already hard at work appeasing the fanboys for his next adaptation of a beloved comic book property, Alan Moore's Watchmen, stays very close to the source material, not just Miller's graphic novel but also the histories of Herodotus, the original chronicler of the Battle of Thermopylae and Miller's major source. Of course, Herodotus makes little mention of the Spartans fighting in leather codpieces rather than armour (a curious decision on the part of the filmmakers which just looks ridiculous in places), or the Persians bringing giants, war rhinos and goat headed minstrels, but these are mere trappings, the storyline of the course of the battle, the tactics, each wave of assault and the Spartans betrayal, all draw directly on historical sources. Indeed, even the dialogue quotes the mythic speech given in early histories to the Spartans such as the famous comeback to the Persian threat to blot out the sun with their arrows, ""then we will fight in the shade"" and the Spartans final epitaph"". In their desire to tell their story of Spartan heroics, however, Miller and Snyder do sideline the role played by other Greek states at Thermopylae and the Persian Wars as a whole, reducing them to a group of unskilled and cowardly Arcadians. The lack of an accurate portrayal of various Greek states is pretty irrelevant in itself but it does highlight a wider issue, namely whether we really need Miller's authentically Spartan version of this story. The Spartan philosophy is perhaps a little simple and superficial to make an interesting and complex film. Sparta is a soldier state and it is difficult to relate to their code of honour in which they must return from battle with their shield or on it, such a desire for war and honour scuppered the earlier Troy as modern audiences struggled to grasp these ancient motivations. While the Persian enemies are faceless villains, literally in the case of the masked ninja style Immortals, the Spartan soldiers fare little better. The 300, a group of hardass Scots for the most part, are two dimensional clich√©s (the ageing captain who has seen many years of service with his king and friend, and the captain's eager, callow young son being obvious examples) devoid of any emotional arc, in fact it is often difficult to discern much emotion at all in them. Gerard Butler as Leonidas, the Spartans' pointy bearded King, at least gets a little more opportunity for moments of complexity, such as in his relationship with his wife Lena Headey, the film's most deep character and one developed greatly from Miller's original, but spends much of the film shouting in his curious accent, his natural Scottish slipping through quite often. The script is appallingly clunky in places, curiously mixing the grandstanding posturing of classical heroes with the laddish banter of modern war films. As is often the case with comic book dialogue, the actors sometimes struggle to say it with any realism and conviction, Dominic West as the Spartan senator in league with the Persians being particularly poor. Fortunately, Snyder's directing is considerably better than his writing and 300's visual style creates a unique and beautiful epic (despite a slight excess of sub-Gladiator scenes of golden cornfields). Like it's predecessor Sin City, 300 uses real actors in front of computer generated backdrops to recreate the style of the graphic novel and any shot of the film could be a brilliantly realised rendition of a frame of graphic novel or even a painting. For once, the dumb audience in an action movie clich√© of wanting to cut through the boring talky bits to get straight to the blood and violence is true here as when people are not talking this film really takes off. Moments like the wreck of the Persian fleet in a storm or the Spartans in their crimson cloaks rolling the Immortals off their shields and hacking them down or athletically throwing their spears are stunning looking. Some of the violence including decapitations and the removal of legs is very impressive. Meanwhile, the first assault as the Persians crash against the shields of the Spartan phalanx is as exciting and visceral a realisation of the loud, violent confusion of classical warfare as in any epic. However, these moments are too few and far between and the superficiality of the film is too apparent when the excitement of battle is not going on around the uninteresting characters. It would be possible to greatly enjoy the film in a beer fuelled testosterone heavy group of other men and certainly fans of Sin City and Miller's work in general will love it, but 300 is a silly and shallow film whose exciting visuals don't make up for its many faults. Yes, Spartans may love this film but many 21st century viewers may be left a little cold and possibly even bored."

","Over a year ago, I saw the clip for ""300"" and showed the actors working out and getting in shape for their roles. I was so pumped about this film (being a history minor and all). It really delivered wonderful fighting scenes and the only thing that was wanting was the script. It was a little weak at times, but still had some good lines. The best part of the film is the transition from normal speed fighting to slow motion. It makes the film. Everyone should know that this is a hugely violent film. It is likely the most violent I have ever seen.<br/><br/>This is a testosterone filled movie. The first half hour is describing how the Spartans came to be and then the last 3/4's of the film is nothing but pure fighting with small breaks in between. Don't be surprised if you walk out of the movie sweating!!!! Exciting and Fun!!"
"ExpendableMan","7","3","7","24 March 2007"," The most macho film ever made
","Loads of people are talking about 300 right now. Having grossed over $70 million, it's already an instant smash and needless to say, I'm sure most of you good people reading this will have seen it already and made your minds up, so my review isn't going to sway your opinion one way or the other. For those who haven't captured it yet however, ignore all that talk about beautiful cinematography, crimson spattered violence and latent homo-eroticism, because what 300 more than any other film has done in the past decade or so, is play up a blood and thunder triumph as the most testosterone laden frenzy you will ever see.<br/><br/>Yes folks, once upon a time the likes of Predator were considered tough guy movies revelling in their own machismo. Not any more. Now, thanks to Frank Miller, Zack Snyder, Gerard Butler and a bunch of buff and ripped Americans pretending to be Greeks, there is nothing more manly than 300. Not boxing, not fighting, not driving sports cars, not making love to a woman, just this. And thats all you really need to know. The likes of King Leonidas, Vincent Regan's Captain and David Wenham's Dilios are not so much characters as they are brute force driven to such an extent that it almost feels like a parody; they show no fear, slaughter their enemies with reckless abandon, long only for warrior's deaths and when crouching under their shields as a thousand arrows rain down from the heavens, they laugh with derision at their foe's pathetic humanity.<br/><br/>As such, it would be easy to suggest that 300's audience will most likely be 14-28 year old males but in all honesty, its difficult to imagine anyone not liking this movie. The battle scenes are energetic crowd pleasing spectacles, even if Snyder overuses the slow motion a tad and with its pantheon of armoured beasts, mutant warriors with swords for fists and Persian elites who resemble the Uruk Hai more than men, the visual appeal cannot be underpinned. As these creatures suggest, 300 isn't the most historically accurate movie ever made but its certainly a lot more enjoyable to watch than the majority of historical epics I could name.<br/><br/>In short then, a highly enjoyable piece of fiction that purists will be pleased to find mirrors the source material quite accurately. With its collection of oddball warriors, CGI blood and a soundtrack comprised of heavy metal guitar riffs, it may date badly and ten years from now be laughable, but right now its an absolute blast. Snyder may be a white, middle class geek with a camera, but having made this and the white-hot Dawn of the Dead remake, he sure knows how to deliver the goods on screen. And as for all that talk of homo-erotic subtexts, I fail to see what they're getting at. I mean, what could honestly be at all gay about 300 scantily clad men getting riled up and penetrating each other with the shiny heads of their elongated spears?"

You may answer ""Because it's only black messengers getting killed"" That is stupid, if you went to war, wouldn't you use slaves instead of your own people to do the work? I have read that several Iranians said that the Persians did not have Slaves, well think again because Persia had a lot of slaves from their Conquered provinces.

"piggy-7","Null","3","7","23 March 2007"," Acting is the number one casualty in this battle!
","Magnificently filmed, form wins hands down over content in ""300"" and proves that while you can pour bucks into creating the look of a graphic novel, sticking to the same style of writing only causes a knock-on effect that results in acting that at best is cardboard-cutout, at worst (and mainly) excruciatingly campy. The very unfortunate, painful voice over only underlines it all. Personally I had to block out everything but the visuals and the real hero of the film is the Cinematographer, the Hair, Makeup and Art Department. Gerrard Butler's intense gaze holds it somewhat together, but even then one is more impressed by his massive pectorals than his mostly hidden, massive talent. Once again, Hollywood has created a nice-looking, high production-value D-movie. Perhaps if, following in the footsteps of ""The Passion of the Christ"" and ""Apocalypto"", the producers and director had chosen to have everyone speak in ancient Greek, it might have been bearable, but in English, one can only cringe and bear it whenever one of the actors has to utter a line. The superbly gifted Rodrigo Santoro, as Xerxes, is especially ludicrous. Buried within his makeup, the fact that you can't recognize him becomes a plus: at least he might live to act another day."

","Never have i been so excited by a trailer for a movie. I must have watched it 20 or 30 times in the run up to this movie. I counted the days until it was released. And after having watched it last night i find myself a little disappointed.<br/><br/>Its a classic example of brilliant trailer editing. Good music skillfully edited with the best scenes from the movie.<br/><br/>I just had my hopes pinned on this movie being different from all the previous letdowns because the trailer was so damn good. Once again I was wrong.<br/><br/>Its not that the movie is bad (I enjoyed it) its just that it wasn't the nerve jangling experience (likr the trailer) I had expected it to be. I had seen all the best bits already so there was no surprises. And the best bits as i just called them looked ridiculous in the context of the movie.<br/><br/>I read the frank miller comic a few years back (not my favourite) and thought it would make a great film. It probably would have. Why the director felt the need to fill it will elephants, giants, mutants, rhinos and bare-chested he-men i'll never know. To me the sole single story arc of a small number of men using battle tactics to slow down a larger enemy should be enough for a brilliant war film anyway.<br/><br/>It almost seems that the ""true"" story did not have enough for the scriptwriters/directors to make a full length modern music video with and so they added a menagerie of baddies (including grenade clowns).<br/><br/>To cut a long review short I enjoyed this movie, but nowhere near as much as I should have done. I wanted so much more after watching the trailer. I consider myself a little let down.<br/><br/>One friend of mine was lucky enough to see it at an IMAX cinema and he said ""I've never seen a movie with more nerve jangling moments and my girlfriend cried for the last ten minutes.""<br/><br/>Clearly his girlfriend was closer to the truth than him as she, in the last ten minutes she actually realised what twelve quid could have bought instead of this bastardised, cinematic, gay friendly, bruckheimer, cock adventure."

","I'm sure this has already been said, however, I will reiterate the point. THE MOVIE IS BASED ON A COMIC BOOK.<br/><br/>No one sane would believe that Persians were ACTUALLY the way they were depicted in the movie. It's like Cartman on South Park attempting to prove that the Jews were evil based upon the depiction in that horrible movie about Jesus. I personally believed it was wonderful that the movie depicted the diversity of the Persian empire, which included several races and continents. Frank Miller has a taste for the grotesque and the gory. Note the prevalence of misshapen and mutated characters (mentally and physically) in all of his comic books and movies.<br/><br/>Of course it's not historically accurate. If it was, the Spartans would be fighting nude or in loincloths.<br/><br/>The character of Leonidas is very sympathetic. He loves his wife and son and would do anything to protect his people. You can see the tenderness behind the granite that composes his character. David Wenham was brilliant. The cinematography was wonderful. The action sequences flowed like water. Gory, yes. But obviously fake gore.<br/><br/>The movie wasn't perfect - it was overly melodramatic at times. Some of the antagonists were a bit too evil. And of course, nudity and sex unnecessary to the plot. But I walked out of the theater with that ""wow"" feeling deep in my chest, wishing that Leonidas didn't have to die."
"MosBoyRbi","6","3","7","21 March 2007"," Too similar to the graphic novel
","--contains major spoiler-- I want to state first that this is a great film. An awesome film.<br/><br/>Every scene is done like a painting; and throughout the film you get the feeling as if you're really watching Frank Miller's page leaps out to the big screen.<br/><br/>Most of the dialogs are cool (as almost all of them are taken directly from Miller's book, and Miller created many great lines in it), the story is a little bit fleshed out (the captain's son, Theron, the council, queen gorgo, the spartan way of raising kids, etc), and the combination of gorgeous art direction and stunning visual fx keeps your eyes nailed to the screen for the entire film.<br/><br/>There are many great things to say about this film. You can read them in other reviews available in the review's page. Yet, sadly, there's that thing that always bugs me when I watched this film on opening night here in Indonesia.<br/><br/>It is this: this film resembles the graphic novel too closely. Almost all (if not all) of the war tactics and plot points from the graphic novel appears in this film. From the death of the captain's son (and the captain's rampage), the Arcadians making a 'wondrous mess of things', the wall made of dead Persians (and later pushing all of them towards the Immortals), the elephants and the slippery dead Persian armies, to Leonidas's surrendering tactics at the end only to have Stelios attacking from behind him.<br/><br/>Sure, there are also awesome scenes that were not featured in comic, like Stelios and Astinos backing each other against the surrounding enemies, the captain's rampage is shown more, the Persian rhino.<br/><br/>But, as a whole, this film resembles the comic book in about just every single plot points! As a result, I felt like I already know everything that's going to happen. I was like, ""Oh, so this is the capt's son, he's going to die later"", ""OK, now Leonidas is with the Ephors, and then they're gonna deny him the chance to engage a full war with the entire army, and then someone from Persia will visit the Ephors, then we'll know that they're corrupt"", ""Oh, so this is where the capt's son dies"", ""OK, Leonidas, drop your shield..., now your helmet..., and then..., and then..., there you go, your spear. Now, kneel..., kneel, yes, that's it. Now where's Stelios? Ah, there you are, leaping from behind..."" almost all the time. <br/><br/>And when all of my thoughts are done exactly like I thought they'd be done, I was, well..., a little bit disappointed...<br/><br/>Now, maybe you'll say, ""Well, duh! It's from Frank Miller's book! It's supposed to resemble the book!"" Wait a second there. I happen to be an avid novel / graphic novel reader. Yet, when I watched films like the LOTR trilogy, Harry Potter films, and V For Vendetta, I was still amazed. When I watch Harry screams ""EXPECTO PATRONUM!!!"" at the end of azkaban, or when I watch that film's quidditch match, or when I see the quidditch world cup scene of Goblet of Fire, or when Gandalf marched down the hills of Helm's Deep to engage the Orcs in Two Towers, or when Sam says ""I cannot carry it for you, Mr Frodo! But I can carry you!!"" in Return of the King, or when I watch the ""domino effect"" scene in V for Vendetta, I am still amazed.<br/><br/>Yet, when I saw 300, I felt like I've seen it all, only on a different medium. And, well, I'm a little bit disappointed. Because, usually, I measure a greatness of film by remembering if there is a scene in the film which results as if time stands still, and your eyes, your ears, and your entire emotions are all poured into the scene, and your heart screams a silent amazement. Sadly, there are no such scene in 300.<br/><br/>I have great expectations of Zack Snyder. I loved his Dawn of the Dead remake. Yet, when I watch 300, I'm not so sure he'll be able to handle the adaptation of Watchmen, which has been hailed as one of the greatest achievements in comic world..."

","When a massive army of Persians threatens to attack Sparta its noble King throws himself and a small army of 300 into the fray, hoping to withstand the attacks or at least delay it long enough for the city to defend itself. Outnumbered by far he decides to seek his defense in a narrow mountain pass to make sure the difference in number of warriors can't be exploited by the attackers. This is the story of that battle and what happened just before and after.<br/><br/>Based on a graphic novel the one thing that makes this film different from other films based around the same stories, tales, factual legends is the fact that it is made so that it looks half like a normal film, half like a series of drawn pictures. It also uses a lot of stop - motion sequences, slowing down the sequences of shots to an almost full stop and then picks up to full speed again, effectively accentuating the middle of the scene.<br/><br/>This trickery works out -very- well. The film is a work of art to watch. The choice of coloring feels radiant yet chilly, and dangerous as the actual battle fray. Choice of music is done well too - really adding to the film.<br/><br/>Still, there's a negative end to it all. The film stretches itself too long every now and then. Wild action sequences alternate with slow sequences and in effect I find this film to be pretty boring.

","I had to write in response to all the straight fanboys are who raving about 300. Like them, I love this film too, but I love it without having to resort to denying its breathtaking homoeroticism or mocking Xerxes for his supposed effeminacy. (Xerxes is not just androgynous, he is commanding and imposing; he is a match and worthy adversary for Leonidas; their scene together, when Xerxes nearly swoons with desire and then walks up behind Leonidas to put his big paws on Leonidas' shoulders, is stunning.) I love this film for the way the camera caresses the bodies of the Spartan warriors; for its resplendent and transcendent acting, direction, cinematography, screenplay, sound, music, art direction, and special effects; for the tender way it presents Leonidas' profile before he is cut down. This is the best and most handsome film since Brokeback Mountain. Astounding. Never before has male beauty been so lovingly presented on the screen."

","From an action standpoint, this movie is excellent. It is filled with slow-motion stabs and complex, computer-animated battle scenes. I enjoyed the violence and fantastic battles. Also, I thought that the cuts throughout the movie were epic. As 300 is an epic adventure, many shots focused in slow motion on a soldier's facial expressions. These shots provided a change of pace in the action sequences, and I felt that the combat scenes stayed true to a graphic novel form while still being entertaining in a movie.<br/><br/>This movie has strong action, but action only takes up so much of the movie. Instead, there are drawn-out, poor dialogs to fill the rest of the movie. I began to laugh after the lines ""It's not your arm anymore,"" and ""Traitor!"" Really, many people near me in the theater either laughed or smiled. I think this film focuses more on the emotions of characters than the audience wants or feels able to accept.<br/><br/>I watched 300 in an IMAX theater--the best venue to see it. I left with my friends, and we talked about our enjoyment of the action. We discussed which characters ""beasted"" and which Persian soldiers looked the coolest. We all recognized that while we found the movie fun, it lacked the full dialog and emotion that a truly great movie requires. Is 300 worth seeing? Yes. Is it a great movie? No."

"cultfilmfan","8","3","7","17 March 2007"," 300
","300 is based on the graphic novel of the same name by Frank Miller and Lynn Varley. The film takes place in 5th century B.C. and is about the battle of Thermopylae in which 300 Spartan soldiers lead by King Leonidas fought Xerxes and the Persian army. The film shows us several of the battles until one side finally won. The film uses real actors, but was filmed in front of a blank screen and then the background was made digitally and many of what you end up seeing is digital including some of the animals in the movie, the background as I already mentioned and right down to the gore from the battle scenes. Having really liked the film Sin City which was based on graphic novels by Frank Miller and was also a film he co-directed I was waiting in a lot of anticipation for 300. Overall, I was fairly impressed, but I did have a few problems with the film that would have otherwise probably lead me to give it a higher rating. I will start off with my few negatives about the film. First of all the dialogue in the film was not very good. There is not a lot of conversations in this film seeing as most of it is battles, but when the characters did talk their vocabulary consisted of lines that you would only find in a non very well written comic book. I realize comic books or graphic novels aren't known for having great dialogue and conversations, but having also read the Sin City graphic novels I felt that they often had very good conversations and in the stories that required narration I thought it worked quite well. Maybe I'm being a little hard on the film for this seeing as it does take place in the 5th century and a film about battles isn't supposed to sound like a Shakespeare play, so maybe I should cut it a little bit of slack, but still I thought the characters could have talked a little better and said things that would not later be considered something that would later turn into some sort of catchphrase for wrestling or something in the same vain. The only other complaint I had about the film was the pacing. At times the film moved really well and I was really getting into it which was great, but there were a few scenes that kind of dragged on for me and had they been edited or arranged a little differently I thought it could have had a bigger impact on me and would have drawn me closer into the film. Those being my only flaws of the film I will get to the positives of it. I will start by saying that the way they digitally made this film makes it look gorgeous and I really liked the style of the film that was really enhanced by this look. Except for a few scenes the movie moved fairly well and at one point I was surprised the movie was already done by the time it was over. Also for a movie that relied heavily on stylized battle scenes for the most of it's running time the film did manage to entertain for most of that time whereas in other films it could have become tiresome and tedious. For being a great looking and action packed and entertaining film I will recommend 300, but don't go in looking for anything remotely historically accurate or to be blown away by acting and dialogue because you won't find that here. On the other hand what you may find may just be what you are looking for in a movie anyways."
"thatguy450","5","3","7","13 March 2007"," Wait and Rent It
","When I went to watch 300, I expected the next huge action flick, but found only disappointment. My biggest problem with this film is the acting. The characters just weren't all there in their roles, and they weren't as rounded out as I would like. I think the writers tried to hard for the memorable battle speeches at several points, and at others times I felt they could have used more monologue. I will credit the film, however, on it's interesting style used for the combat scenes, but even those slow motion sequences became less interesting the more they were overused. Another minor detail I noticed was that even though their enemies were spewing blood with every stab and slice, the Spartans seemed to remain relatively clean through most of the movie, showing little to no signs of blood spatter from their opponents.<br/><br/>My advice is to wait for this one to come to Blockbuster and save the trip to the theater for another day."
"mega_mike","10","3","7","7 March 2007"," ...wow...
","I honestly have not seen a movie that left my jaw open like this in a long time. In comparison to Sin City, 300 blows it away.<br/><br/>Don't go expecting a history channel re-enactment. This is based on a graphic novel and style wise it stays very true to that look. The warriors are bare chested and while silly in reality, it meshes beautifully with the stylized graphic novel world this movie is based on. The art style and effects are absolutely amazing in this movie as is the acting, narration and score.<br/><br/>If you can suspend belief and immerse yourself in this almost comic book like world you will absolutely love this movie. A must see in my opinion, and also a must own on DVD when it comes out.<br/><br/>Also, for the parents out there. 300 is NOT for the kiddies.

"aharmas","9","3","7","11 March 2007"," Isn't It Ironic?
","Good things happen when there are good actors in the main roles. It took several weeks before I changed my mind about even considering going to see this film. The preview just didn't seem to draw me because of its look, and yet, I'm glad I saw it. Ironically, of all the ""period pieces"" we've been getting lately, this is the one that works the best. Unlike ""Alexander"" and ""Troy"", the portrayal of the hero is flawless and quite believable. Here is a military genius, whose hubris, along with other excellent qualifications anchor the film in a more believable way than Farrell or Pitt could. Butler's king is more than a grunt or a figure head. He is a man who truly believes in his mission, is determined to take to its inevitable conclusion, regardless of whatever unsurmountable obstacle might be on the way. It doesn't help that the cast looks terrific, and everyone of the soldiers appears capable of handling the superhuman expectations the audience and Leonidas has of them. This time, even the fact that we know the adaptation is based on a graphic novel, is not a problem. Maybe it even fulfills the audience's wish when the illustrations come alive in a satisfying manner. For example, with the help of the production team, and some interesting editing and camera work, the soldiers look both real and fantastic. Their physiques, obviously, the result of some interesting collaboration, help us almost believe that we are seeing an epic battle.<br/><br/>""300"" benefits from having a very strong female supporting character. As Leonidas' queen, Lena Headley, is both royal and strong, the type that we rarely see in period pieces. She deserves her rank and is a powerful figure in her own circles, with definite and decisive say on her husband's decisions. She is supportive, sexy, and intelligent, and she manages to steal a few of her scenes. Connie Nielsen came close in ""Gladiator"", but the writers didn't give her enough material to explore the possibility of her character being more than eye candy.<br/><br/>Finally, here is a film that evokes a long gone era, a period where real men fought in an almost feral way to protect what they thought was worth defending. Losing the character of Butler at the end is not something to bemoan. He goes in a very dramatic and sensational way, and who says that he can't be brought back. He is a superhero of sorts, a man who lives for posterity through history, legend, and a touch of marvel."

It's everything that a mythology-based movie should be like. This movie will inevitably blow any other historical crap off the map.<br/><br/>The movie begins with the history of King Leonidas. Ever since he was a child, he was exposed to such unusual cruelty. Now, he is a king, and is bringing an army of 300 Spartans against Persians. He climbs to a mountaintop, and finds a woman, who does a dance for him, and foretells that an army amongst them is ready to attack. Now, it's up to him and his army of 300 brave men.<br/><br/>This is ultimately an epic story told on a SWEEPING scale. The visuals are cool, the cinematography is amazing, and the story is apocryphal with an ending with King Leonidas' self-sacrifice that had me hanging on the edge of my seat.<br/><br/>Now I would NOT recommend this for the young ones, as it is INCREDIBLY violent and gory.

","I found 300 to be startling in its graphic portrayal of a battle of 300 against thousands. While it was reminiscent of both Helm's Deep and the battle on Pelennor Plains, it still retained a feeling all its own. Some critics have compared this work against Jackson's, but I don't think that's appropriate. This film stood alone and stood without assistance. I don't see any reason to make the comparison.<br/><br/>This was a brilliant work of cinematic art...it was a visually stunning, beautifully written bloodbath. <br/><br/>If you like loads of brilliant action, good writing, beautiful acting, and lots of gore, you not only could do worse than 300, but you probably already have, and loved it.<br/><br/>But beneath all that, the timing for this movie seems political. Here, you have 300 Spartans standing against hundreds of thousands of terrifying invaders led by Xerxes who believes himself a God, while the Spartan senate refuses to send in the Spartan army to assist these brave warriors in their stand to defend all of Sparta. This clearly parallels the current Congressional position wherein they refuse to send in more troops or allocate appropriate funding to assist our soldiers already in the field. <br/><br/>I think this is the most compelling draw this work has for American audiences, today. I also admire the marketing of this work, as a fine example of marketing genius.<br/><br/>300 is a must see.<br/><br/>It rates a 9.8/10 from...<br/><br/>the Fiend :."

"moimoichan6","8","5","15","30 March 2007"," Paths of glory
","Today, a war film has to be an anti-war film, in order to avoid any criticisms. ""Letters from Iwo Jima"" is the perfect example of this kind of anti-war movie (a genre magisterially inaugurated in 1957 by Kubrick's ""Paths of Glory"") : the atrocity and absurdity of the war is denounced everywhere, the battles are very realistic and barely bearable, the historical context is so exact that you have the feeling to watch a documentary, and the movie is a humanist one, where it doesn't matter who you fight with, you always fight men. ""300"" is not an anti-war movie, it's a war movie, and it's the absolute opposite of Eastwood last movie. The war is glorified for its beauty and its goals : it's needed because it's the only way to protect freedom and liberty from mysticism and tyranny. The battle sequences are grandiose and aesthetically filmed with beautiful slow motions. The historical context is just a pretext to tell a story that belongs to an ancient age, and doesn't have any reality or realism. The movie is so Manichean, that the enemy, the ""Persans"", are not human at all, they're beasts from the darkness, monsters from hell, demoniac figures that stand for evil, whereas the Spartans are perfect and fearless blond heroes, from the mythological world. Some might call it fascist, some might find this approach stupid and childish: and in a way, they're partly right, but on the other hand, I never saw a so epic, fun and grandiose movie since... since, heu, since I can't even remember when. <br/><br/>480 BC, Leonidas refuses to make a gift to Xerces, the god emperor of Persia, the leader of the most impressive and powerful army of the world. In the name of liberty, reason and freedom, he kills all the Persian's men send by Xerxes in Spartes, and goes for war against the powerful Persian army with a fearless spartan army of 300 men, in order to convince the all Greece to fallow his example (Athens, this nation of ""philosophs and young boy's lovers"" have already stand up against Xerxes...). And then they fight, kill, and died in the fury of the battle, shouting definitive sentences like ""Spartans, tonight we dine in hell"" and laughing in front of the face of death. And, well, that's about it for the story. But does anyone need a real story if in the gigantic and impressive battle scenes are introduced well enough ? Simple stories make great tales, and that's what's the movie's all about : this is just a myth. Of course, it's simple, violent and Manichean, but, for we're in a mythical world, it's nor racist nor a propaganda movie. The all movie is nothing less than than a speech from Dilos to the Grecs, and is nothing objective and realistic. That's clear in the movie : Dilos tells us the great tale of Leonidas and the 300 Spartans, in his own, subjective and partial point of view : he doesn't tell History, he tells a story. And in his vision, the Persans are all bad and monsters. This is not the reality of the Termopyle battle : this is the Spartan's point of view on it and they exaggerated to transform it in a legend : all we have here is the legend. And this movie has absolutely nothing to see with our contemporary world or with our reality. It's just a dream, a bloody, violent, graphic, dream for little boys, who dream to be a Spartan soldier and to fight the evil Persian army. There's no message here, no morality to find, no American propaganda, and certainly no political point of view : this is just a children's dream. <br/><br/>In fact, all this elements already (including this vision of the Persian empire) were in the wonderful 1998 comic-book by Frank Miller, except for the sub plot with Leonidas' wife (but the all morality of this sequences fits very well the Miller's universe, with its strong women an its rotten politicians). Like ""Sin City"", the movie totally looks like the comics, from its tone to its colors and photography. The method is also the same : the genre of the peplum, like the ""film noir"" for ""Sin City"", is push to its paroxysm. But it adds to ""Sin City"", which was a little too static, movement, action, and a great sens of epic. The first battle scene is absolutely amazing : it's a sort of peplumesk remake of the ""Old Boy"" scene, where you see the hero fighting endlessly against ten opponents in a video game traveling. Only that in ""300"", you see Leonidas fighting against hundreds, and you also watch the others Spartans fighting in the same sequence. I think I never saw something that impressive in a movie. <br/><br/>Zack Snyder really becomes one of the most promising American director with this movie. And if his style isn't perfect yet (some of the scenes still reminds me of an perfume advertising, like the oracle one), ""300"" is a great movie, important both for the war movie and the epic genre, as well as for the history of comic books adaptations (the use of the slow motions, which recreates the drawings of the comics in motion, and fits the rhythm of a comic-book reading is unseen and totally original). The only thing to determine is how much does the genius of this movie really belongs to Snyder, for if ""300"" is great, Frank Miller is also responsible of it. And Snyder's first movie, ""Dawn of the dead"", was a Romero's remake. So, I impatiently wait for Znyder's own projects to see if he's really a talented artist. And if I'm pretty sure his future adaptation of ""Watchmen"" will be good (even if I'm convinced than only someone like Kubrick could have done it the masterpiece it's meant to be), it won't answer this question."
"wgeddings","10","5","15","25 March 2007"," Great movie and exactly what it claims to be
","I do not think this is a spoiler but, shock of shocks, this movie is not intended to educate viewers as to the reality of Ancient Greece, Persia, the real Xerxes, real Spartans, real battle outfits and tactics or darn near anything else. The list of historical inaccuracies are legion (to coin the phrase) but the big point that critics and others seem to miss is that this movie is not intended to be a historical documentary. If you wish to see this movie for its historical value and commentary, you should really reconsider your approach to movies. Seriously.<br/><br/>What this movie is a movie adaption of a comic book (aka graphic novel). That is what it wants to be and, as far as I am concerned, what it achieves in spades. I felt like I was reading a comic book. There was minimal character development and background because you do not need such. This is the Queen. She is married to the King. Nuff Said. No need for an exposition on her upbringing or heritage or motivations or anything else. She is the Queen, now on with the story.<br/><br/>I have read reviews where people try to equate parts of this movie with the Irag situation or with many other modern day events but, again, they are missing the point. This is not a movie intended to an allegory for modern time or to comment on society. It is a COMIC BOOK movie. It is meant for the toughest purpose of all (in my opinion), to entertain. To make you relax, thrill and enjoy the story, scenes and images for a time. To throw other thoughts away and, for a time, become part of the fictional Sparta facing a fictional Horde. No lessons, no deep morals, just relax and enjoy the ride.<br/><br/>When you do that, you will love this movie. There are tons of inaccuracies and tons of politically incorrect ideas in the movie but why are you looking for such in a COMIC BOOK movie? My 15 year old son loved it and says it is his favorite movie. Maybe partly because of the semi-naked women (who are not important to the movie but will surely draw more teen boys) but because it was simple and fun. You want history and knowledge, avoid this movie. You want to relax, enjoy a good story and just have fun, do not miss this movie."
"vmtwriter","10","5","15","25 March 2007"," Intense, Passionate, Magnificent
","I saw 300 last night. What an absolutely awesome movie. Overall, it was incredible. The movie is based on Frank Miller's graphic novel about the Battle of Thermopylae in 480 B.C.<br/><br/>Historical accuracies are scattered throughout the movie. From the moment we see them examining the child king and determining if he meets their standards or he would be thrown over a cliff onto a mound of lost souls to the training and fighting style of the Spartan soldier.<br/><br/>Zack Snyder directed the movie and he must have been divinely inspired. The movie is that magnificent. The use of narration to tell the story, along with the actual scenes made the realism more clear. You truly believe this was how the battle developed and how King Leonidas ruled.<br/><br/>Speaking of King Leonidas, the casting for this character was perfect. Gerald Butler was King Leonidas. Right down to the most minute detail. From the braid that hung from the back of his head, to his stoic glare, to his commanding presence among his men. I do not believe any other man could have done a better job.<br/><br/>All of the casting seemed to fit the characters very well. Each actor melded with their character and made us believe they were Spartans, Persians, and man made gods.<br/><br/>While the movie does portray a brutal battle, I don't believe there was any gratuitous violence. The images of men fighting with all their heart, body, and soul to protect what they truly believe in - Sparta - transcends the actual acts of intense violence. The images may linger, but so will the depth of passion they invoked.<br/><br/>The Spartans weren't without their sense of humor. The occasional remark made by King Leonidas only made him more human. I found his method of negotiation amusing and just.<br/><br/>I love a good movie soundtrack, and 300 didn't disappoint. The scenes and music together pulled you into the moment, suspending your belief, engulfing your senses, making you forget for a while that you're sitting in a movie theater with dozens of other people.<br/><br/>Give yourself a treat. Go see 300. Hurry before it finishes its run in the theater. It's a must for the big screen. Lose yourself in Greek history."
"Danusha_Goska","8","5","15","14 March 2007"," Leonidas for President!
","""300"" is a fast, fun, exhilarating, inspirational movie. It's sexy and sick, graphically violent, and a feast of heavily weighted political and religious symbols.<br/><br/>Gerard Butler is stunning to look at -- his body is bulked up and sculpted, and he is completely believable as an ancient Spartan king who happens to have a Scottish accent. In turns Butler looks determined -- when in battle -- loving -- toward his wife -- and amused -- when confronting Xerxes of the excessively tweezed eyebrows.<br/><br/>Yes, the movie is violent -- its name, ""300,"" is made to look as if written in splattering blood, after all. But the bad guys are really, really bad, the good guys are preeeetty good, and the fate of Western Civilization hangs in the balance, so the violence is meant to be in service to a larger, worthy cause.<br/><br/>""300""'s actors performed before green screens, not on three-dimensional sets. The sets were added by computer. Some say that this process results in a fake-looking movie that doesn't engage the emotions. My emotions were so engaged I cried twice.<br/><br/>I had fun at this movie. So much fun I wish I could give it a ten. Instead, I'm tempting to give it a seven.<br/><br/>For all it has going for it, the movie never rises above its comic book roots.<br/><br/>Women? The movie makes a couple of flamboyant gestures toward women: Queen Gorgo gets to say ""Only Spartan women give birth to real men,"" but the movie, in two scenes, panders to the worst in the worst male imagination. There are two scenes where women are violated on camera. It's made clear that there are little boys in Sparta, as well as men, but the movie doesn't say enough about how Spartan women got to be the truly exceptional women they were.<br/><br/>Plutarch reported that the men of Sparta always obeyed their wives. Spartan women married later than other women, in order to ensure healthy births. They could own property, wore clothing that allowed them freedom of movement, and could have more than one husband.<br/><br/>Why, then, does ""300,"" while depicting Spartan men heroically, depict a Spartan girl not so much as swatting away an ephor who abuses her, never mind the ugly fate the film hands its best female character? The movie's dismissal of women is just part of how it refuses to be a full film, rather than just a comic book. That's why it's not a ten.<br/><br/>And then there is the political subtext.<br/><br/>Look, you'd have to be Rip van Winkle not to get the political subtext here, intended or not.<br/><br/>The Greek wars against Persians have long been depicted as an essential battle between Western freedom, democracy, and reason and Eastern tyranny, despotism, slavery, submission, and obscurantism. Leonidas and Xerxes faced off long before the birth of Christ, Mohammed, or Osama bin Laden, but they were laying down the foundation of epochal narratives, narratives we still use to define our lives.<br/><br/>Again, whether intended or not, various features of ""300"" will be read as part of this millenia-old battle between West and East. Examples: Xerxes and his minions are festooned with chains. The chains echo slavery, the presumed condition against which the Greeks were fighting, and which they repeatedly name as their enemy. Slavery is associated with submission, and submission is the English word for ""Islam."" Xerxes' troops wear turbans and face veils that are similar to costumes donned by the Taliban today.<br/><br/>Persia is the ancient word for what is today Iran.<br/><br/>Xerxes entertains himself with belly dancers, associated with Muslim countries.<br/><br/>The ephors are made out to be Politically Correct traitors and equivocators, sort of like creepy old college profs.<br/><br/>Etc.<br/><br/>You may not read the film that way, Frank Miller and/or Zack Snyder may not have intended any of the film's imagery that way, but that's how many viewers will read it.<br/><br/>Whatever.<br/><br/>""300"" is beautiful to look at, and it's a good time."

As well as the last Frank Miller-Adaption ""Sin City"" ""300"" convinces with its special visual effects, which highlight the specific character of a comic.

I am actually amused at how people are freaking out over this movie. It is fiction. And this tale is told from a Greek's perspective and they were notorious for taking a little creative license in their story telling...especially when it came to battles. I'm sure if this was told from the Persian perspective it would be completely different, yet still embellished. Also, it is retold by Frank Miller - a graphic novelist...again, a little creative embellishment is to be expected.<br/><br/>This is NOT a factual representation as would be told on the history channel. If you can walk into this movie with an open mind towards creativity and fiction and realize that it is very stylized and artistic, you will enjoy this movie. I loved it. The style was very Frank Miller and the tale was entertaining. Yes, there were a couple of times I had to laugh because it was clear that some things were ridiculous, but it made it just a little more entertaining.<br/><br/>So, despite all it's flaws, this is a great movie to watch...and women will enjoy it too...Queen Gorgos' move towards the politician who takes advantage of her is completely priceless."

","I must admit I went into the film with very high expectations, and having seen it's average rating on this site I thought it was gonna be great. Wrong! The film no doubt looks fantastic but that was it, the dialogue was awful, mainly just shouting and snarling, and probably lifted directly from the comics. Also the director's insistence on putting most of the fighting in slow-mo just to re-emphasise the effects and show us again and again tiny beads of blood spattering, frustrated me.<br/><br/>I appreciate that this is based on Miller's graphic novel and this could explain it's over-emphasis on its looks. However, Sin City is also a beautiful looking film, where it differs is having a better story, director, dialogue and actors.<br/><br/>No chance is this film worthy of its current 8+ rating, it is very entertaining though and I'd go with a 6."
"hakusuru","5","4","11","30 March 2007"," Hype strikes again
","It seems that any film with the correct mix of marketing and media hype can be a great box office success. In truth, congratulations are in order, as a lot of money has been made through a very average film that has been well sold.<br/><br/>Taken in by the hype and seemingly good reviews, I was eager to see what this film had to offer, it also boasts a fairly high average rating.<br/><br/>The film starts in a reasonable manor and the plot begins to develop nicely. At the half way point, I was thinking that this has the potential to be a good film and that was what I was expecting.<br/><br/>However, it is at this point at which we are first introduced to the mongaloid brigade; they are both numerous in quantity and humorous in appearance. Firstly, we see a Quasimodoesque spartan who has been unfortunate enough to develop a tumour of some sort as if he is giving a piggy-back to a walrus. Not happy with hunch-backed hump-backs, we are then introduced to a pig-man that had cunningly been able to morph his hands into samurai swords. However, this character only features in the film at one, seemingly irrelevant point. What were they thinking? - 'Lets give a pig man with machetes for arms a cameo role in this blockbuster.' There were other appearances but I won't go into detail. This, for me, took away all credibility from the film as it made it fairly ridiculous and as I heard one person mutter in the cinema, 'pathetic'.<br/><br/>**Spoilers Ahead** <br/><br/>One of the main aims of the Spartans was to eliminate the Persian leader who fancied himself as a god, however, after watching this film for two hours, he doesn't get killed. What was the point of the whole film then???! It was clear, they were not going to win the whole war there and then or within the span of the film but because they failed to kill this enemy the whole film seems somewhat pointless.<br/><br/>**Spoilers Over** <br/><br/>The film had some good points, there were some good parts of dialogue and the action sequences were very good. However, the latter became very repetitive by the end of the film and the former could be often described as tedious. The special effects were well done which was good but this alone cannot make a film.<br/><br/>Overall, its not an entirely bad film, it has its moments, however, it does not live up to the expectations assumed by the hype and the lacklustre ending and unrealistic nature is very disappointing."
"mjscarface","7","4","11","30 March 2007"," Visually stunning, completely shallow but solid entertainment!
","'300' is one of the most famous underdog stories (next to Rocky) ever told, recounting the Battle of Thermopylae where 300 Spartans held off the entire Persian Empire.<br/><br/>First off, let's just put things into perspective. This film is based on the graphic novel, which itself was based on the film 'The 300 Spartans' which was then based on the event. In other words, 300 is very much removed from historical accuracy and should not be approached if thats what you're expecting.<br/><br/>Told from the perspective of Dilios, a Spartan soldier/messenger, the film is given the freedom to embellish and exaggerate as much as possible. Therefore, as the battles go on, each one is more and more OTT featuring everything from chained-mutant-giants to bomb-throwing magicians. In fact, you get the feeling that the film is constantly trying to out-do the last set-piece. As a result, the pace rarely lets up until the last 20 minutes or so where political aspects take over.<br/><br/>On a technical level, the film is a masterpiece and a real assault on the senses. From the booming opening logos, to the epic-choral soundtrack, the film sets out to impress. And it does. Just about every shot in 300 could be framed and put up on your wall, it looks that good. The film is a series of iconic images that range from a tree covered in dead bodies to fleets of Persian ships being smashed in a storm.<br/><br/>Finally, while most of the dialogue is pretty dodgy and there is very little depth to 300, the film is carried well by Gerard Butler as King Leonidas who's performance convinces as a man who you wouldn't wanna cross, but would follow to certain death.<br/><br/>There are plenty of flaws to 300, but I think it comes down to what you expect from a film that was quite clearly advertised as a visual spectacle more than anything."

"fyrwurxx","6","4","11","26 March 2007"," Visually stunning, artistically lacking
","A fan of the earlier film adaptation of Frank Miller's work, Sin City, I held rather optimistic expectations for the highly-touted bloodbath ""300."" As nearly anyone who's seen it will attest, 300 is a stupendously stunning visual accomplishment. The visual effects, color themes, sets and most props and costumes blended seamlessly to create an awe-inspiring spectacle of war portrayed candidly.<br/><br/>But my accolades cease here.<br/><br/>Beyond its gritty, ultra-violent visual appeal, 300 leaves much to be desired in nearly every other relevant category. Chiefly, its portrayal of the Battle of Thermopylae does not hold true with many historical facts of the real battle. Leonidas fights alongside a larger, albeit less skilled, horde of Arcadians in the film, when in actuality King Leonidas rallied his Spartans alongside hundreds of very capable Mantineans, Thebans, Phocians, Corinthians and Phlians, just to name a few.<br/><br/>Secondly, the thematic element which attempted to establish identity with the viewer, that of ""patriotism"" and ""freedom at all costs,"" defeats itself and leaves a hollow void, severely detracting from the film's emotional appeal. I reason thusly: the writer goes to great pains to illustrate the disciplined, war-driven Spartan way of life: that of constant training for battle and absolutely no room for emotion; a culture utterly devoted to the study of warfare and the art of killing. According to 300, Spartans live to kill, and for no other reason (this ""fact"" is further reinforced by the scene where Leonidas and his detachment encounters the Arcadians for the first time).<br/><br/>Yet contrast this thematic element to the aforementioned theme of raging patriotism and the rallying cry of a free people to resist tyranny and subjugation at all costs, and we're left with all the emotionally moving effect of a paralyzed dog trying to chase a dead cat. Why should I feel sympathetic to the freedom and independence of a nation that prides itself *solely* on the destruction of others? I paraphrase Leonidas' rallying cry to his troops, and the moral underpinning of 300: ""Let's fight and die for our right to fight and die!"" Theme aside, 300 suffers from almost total lack of character development or compelling developments to the plot. The audience breaks from the incessant, gratuitous, utterly unrealistic portrayal of spraying blood only to witness a thin subplot involving Leonidas' wife and a treacherous member of the Spartan senate. All else barely qualifies as mere story-building or plain filler. The audience does not leave the theater with any meaningful understanding of actual tradition or culture from ancient Greece, yet leaves quite reassured that all ancient Persians were incompetent, foolhardy and inhuman.<br/><br/>Summarily, 300 offers quite a scrumptious treat for those expecting 117 minutes of brutal human slaughter captured in Matrix-like slow-mo camera style drenched in copious amounts of computer-generated blood. But to those who enjoy depth, historical accuracy, plot variation and emotional prowess in their films, 300 will certainly not impress you."

All in all, a very superficial script, bad dialogue and a lot of bloodspilling, mostly show with what I like to refer to as 'more frames than usual', causing virtually everything to be displayed in slow-motion, making the movie extremely slow, and, if you ask me, an awful bore. The voice-over explains everything we see, simply because someone apparently felt that the actors weren't capable of portraying the emotions properly. Moreover, there are no characters at all to care about, so this is no more than a meager attempt to treat us at visuals - accompanied by very loud, and clich√©-ridden music - which are extremely repetitive and hardly - if at all - worth taking too much time out of you life, when you really could be doing something useful.

"simonparker1990","8","4","11","23 March 2007"," Beautiful, Gory just lacking in soul
","I am a big fan of the epic genre, when Ridley Scott gave life back into a long believed dead genre with Gladiator all those years ago I was very excited. Due to the financial and Oscar success loads more of those flicks were made. We had Troy, Kingdom of Heaven and Alexander. However out of those three only one of which I found any good, that surprisingly is the critically mauled Troy. Kingdom of Heaven and Alexander were overlong dull pieces of work that took themselves way too seriously. Now you see the faults I listed there, they've basically took those faults, corrected them, added loads more gore and loads more cheesy dialogue and that is pretty much what 300 is. Now that makes it out to be a bad movie, but 300 really isn't a bad movie. You see, what it lacks in heart and soul it more than makes up for in sheer bloodlust and sheer coolness. This is a movie that never even comes close to taking itself seriously, in fact when limbs and heads aren't being cut off you usually find this movie has a good sense of humour. My personal favourite scene involves King Leonidas calmly eating an apple during the battle. Its a small moment but its also a fairly funny moment as well. However, this is not to say that 300 is without its faults. With a clear focus on entertainment rather than being a good movie the faults become very clear. Matters aren't helped either by the fact that the beginning, while looking gorgeous verges on boring.<br/><br/>Lets talk about the action then, as that's what 300 is truly about and when the action does eventually kick in 300 becomes one of the best movies in a long while. Most epic movies fights look beautiful, but none of their beauty comes close to the beauty of this movie. While all the backgrounds and a lot of other things are special effects that doesn't prevent them from looking both startlingly real and being beautiful. Its clearly taken ideas from Sin City (apart from the story which was also done by Frank Miller), and these ideas pay off much better in this movie in terms of visual treats. The actual action itself is pretty violent and pretty intense, but it also has a strange beauty to it all. No matter how many heads you see cut off it never affects you, in fact seeing the blood splash across the battleground is all part of the sheer enjoyment. This isn't a movie for the faint of heart and if you're not a big fan of violence its probably best to avoid this movie.<br/><br/>Next thing I will mention is the performances. Now I suppose most of them are pretty average, clunky dialogue just adding to already clunky characters. However amongst some of the dull mannequins of characters there are a few that do stand out. Most noticeable is Gerad Butler as King Leonidas. Butler has had his fair share of pretty rubbish roles, Tomb Raider 2 and Phantom of the Opera are two of many of the bad movies he's featured in. But here he seems perfectly at home, sure he's not likely to win Oscars like Russel Crowe did for Gladiator, but he does a damn good job and makes his character both likable and also semi-believable. The other two performances of not have to be Lena Headey as Leonidas' wife having her own problems back in Sparta, and David Wenham as Dilios.<br/><br/>Now then I have to mention the faults I suppose. Unfortunately the are many. The beginning as I have mentioned is a huge fault, and in my eyes the thing that nearly made this movies rating a bit lower. You see despite the beauty of it all, and the good narration, not a lot really happens, and it seems more of a dull way to set up what is to follow than anything else. It was in the beginning that my disappointment kicked in, and admittedly 20mins into the movie I thought I was in for a bitter disappointment. Thankfully it grew on me to the extent I adored the movie by the end. The other moan has to be that apart from the general battle and the fact that Spartans are really hard, there's not much else on display here. The side story in Sparta feels more put together at the last minute than anything else and it never really gels with the rest of the movie. Still 300 is an exhilarating piece of cinema, that while never living up to expectations manages to thrill in its run time."
"dannyinformal","8","4","11","21 March 2007"," An embellished, yet artful depiction of history
","After having read some pretty ignorant comments I felt obliged to clarify some important points;<br/><br/>First of all, the persian empire of 500 BC has absolutely NOTHING to do with Iran or iranian people. Presuming that it does, one can also say that grand part of the world is Roman, that's how far the Roman Empire stretched out. Ludicrous assumption isn't it?<br/><br/>Second of all, I would advice people to go to school, read a book and take some history lessons. Frank Miller's 300 and its soliloquies are absolutely based on historical facts. Remember, it's a film and not a documentary, therefore it's natural that the characters, fight-scenes and storyline are embellished.<br/><br/>Third of all, propaganda for racism? Propaganda against Muslims? Dear people, persians weren't Islamic till the Arab invasion which was in the year 650, more than 1000 years after the Greco-persian war. Racism? There's is nothing racist about the film, if you read the actual story you will be shocked by some of Leonidas' utterances. Furthermore, it's not the film that has such controversial thoughts or messages regarding race and sexuality, but it's HISTORY.<br/><br/>For the people whining about the exultations containing the words 'Sparta' and 'Glory': It's a film about the valorous Spartan 300, what else did you expect!?<br/><br/>About the film:<br/><br/>Everything is extremely well presented; the story line, which is actually true and very close to the known historical facts, the way it is filmed, the cast and the music. Everything is in perfect harmony to give the viewers an incredible, unforgettable and exciting experience.<br/><br/>As for the Spartans, yes they were built well and strong, this to motivate their compatriots to fight at their sides. Some thought they didn't need any armour, for they said to be the seed of Hercules himself. They had heavy and strong armour which required strong backs and shoulders.<br/><br/>The persians outnumbered them, as they were forced by their ruler they didn't fight with their hearts and souls. History tells us that over 60.000 persians died at the hands of the valorous and brave '300' Spartans. xerxes cowardly watching from a distance, stood up from his throne 3 times in disbelief of how these few valorous Spartans slaughtered his numerous enslaved soldiers.<br/><br/>Frank Miller's 300 is an impressive film, which is bound to entertain you from start to end."

","This is the third time that I've left a negative review of 300. It is a very racist, sexist and homophobic film. I feel that it represents everything that is wrong with the US and it's international relations. No wonder it is causing chaos in the middle east for it's negative portrayal of their ancestors as heartless monsters. In that sense it is a cultural landmark and should be seen for that reason alone, but unfortunately people have hailed its morale. The recent success of the film is in no doubt related to the amount of publicity it has received. Seeing the fact that all negative reviews of the film are systematically deleted from this site, the proponents of this film are forcing their story on people for purely financial reasons. If the makers of this film treated the story with an open mind then they should also be open for criticism."

","You may have noted that the movie ""300!"" is clobbering all competitors at the box office, seen varying reviews, and wondered if it was worth it. In a word, absolutely! <br/><br/>The plot is true, and well-known. In the Battle of Thermopylae of 480 BC an alliance of Greek city-states fought the invading Persian army in the mountain pass of Thermopylae. Vastly outnumbered, the Greeks held back the enemy in one of the most famous last stands of history. Persian King Xerxes led an Army of well over 300,000 men to Greece and was confronted by King Leonidas of Sparta and 300 Spartans (plus some Athenians). He offers them terms/promises/bribes to stand aside and join his empire, and they choose to fight, knowing they will all die, while the folks back home debate about whether to send reinforcements..<br/><br/>Thar's the bare bones of it, but doesn't cover the truly glorious film that is 300! The photography, enhanced by computer graphics, is shockingly beautiful. The dialogue and acting is terrific. Gerrad Butler's King Leonidas makes Russell Crowe's Maximus (Gladiator) look like a choir boy in comparison. Can't see how you could do better short of Richard Burton. There is an excellent extensive female part, and it would be a mistake to think of this as just a ""guy's' movie"". There is even some definite humor. My wife loved it. You WILL be drawn in and emotionally involved. Quite a few audiences seem to applaud at the end. They should.<br/><br/>You may have heard this is violent. Well,sort of. It is a genuine epic with many fight scenes. The film editor never uses the same camera angle twice, and the combination of color and shading makes for an absolute beautiful vision. Much thought had also been put into the music, and sound effects chosen by the director. But there really is little blood and no spilled innards, though there are antiseptic severed limbs and heads.<br/><br/>You may have heard that this is a ""political'"" movie, and it is true the the Iranians are not fond of it. I didn't see it that way. Greece WAS the foundation of Democracy and Western Civilization, and the invading army WAS Persian. Can't change reality.<br/><br/>In sum, the movie really is the words that are over-used. Spectacular. Epic. Glorious. Beautiful. Heroic.<br/><br/>A ""10"". For sure. Go see it. And don't wait for the DVD."

"CelluloidRehab","7","4","11","17 March 2007"," ""Sin City""-like Miller adaptation. Relatively close to source material. It's nice.....
","I saw 300 last night. I could have written something last night, but I wanted to let my limbic system soak all of what I had seen. This morning, while watching a rather swashbuckling maneuver performed by a certain young Jedi on a desert barge, I realized something. There is a condition present in most homo sapien males. I like to call it ""Pretty Woman syndrome"". I do not know the correct medical term, but it is present. Pretty woman syndrome can be defined by the subconscious desire to reconcile the ""life partner"" as both a friend, confidant, mother,etc. and the sexually aggressive and insatiability of the ""whore"". How does one reconcile these two ideas, without having one or the other, but both? Hollywood and the movies have perpetuated such ideas and fantasies. In Pretty Woman, a man ""rescues"" a prostitute with a heart of gold and turns her into a lady. Star Wars reconciles the princess to slave girl back to princess, in a strange turn of movie moral and symbolism. I know what you are thinking and yes I know it's his sister and thats the symbolism.<br/><br/>I also just realized that Pretty Woman was geared toward females, so there must be some cultural/feminine aspects to my theory as well. The idea of ultimate redemption and cleansing. Past sins can be erased. This isn't just a male fantasy. I also realized that the ultimate realization of said fantasy for males is having two partners, each with their respective sexual role. <br/><br/>You are probably wondering what that has to do with this movie. It is simply the first thing that resonated immediately after letting 300 soak into my subconscious and sleeping mind. It is the idea that movies provide, project and proliferate desires. 300 serves as the carnal blood lust that ""modern living"" tries to suppress and diminish (i.e. - Fight Club logic). It stimulates that desire. <br/><br/>The story is the aboriginal template of a few-against-many scenario in a no-win-situation (Gladiator, Conan and the Kobayashi Maru). It is based on the 5 part Dark Horse comic series in which Frank Miller adapts the historical Battle of Thermopylae. To be quite fair even back in 1998, I felt the story was not the greatest. I wasn't knocked down by the story and its execution. The dialog and interactions are a bit peppered and melodramatic. Unlike most movies that work from a terrible source and then bury it (or the occasional great material being stifled), this movie was working with an average source and elevated it to the highest it can achieve. It is stunted by the source. What it does well is that it does the interpretation by the book, literally almost. The only exception would have to be the lapse of the failed suicide attempt of Ephialtes. Also the director takes some artistic licensing with the ""exoticism"" of the Persians. There are units and situations completely fabricated by the movie itself. Their inclusion is simply for the visceral effect. It increases the campiness, while decreasing the realism. Maybe that will change on the DVD. It will probably include the all nude, unedited and extended version of the movie - a.k.a the ""Spartan Version"".<br/><br/>Director, Zack Snyder (who did a great job of re-imagining Romero's Dawn of the Dead), should get kudos for creating a visually stunning and faithful to the source movie. The problem lies with Frank Miller. I believe he might be better at writing noir and noir-like material then sword and sandal epics. I mean lets not forget what Miller did to his futuristic, female protagonist , Martha Washington. He stranded her in space. The movie overdid the use of the action speed ""effects"". They were quite good, just overused. The other major problem was with the dialog. Though accurate to the comic, when done by actors it seemed quite melodramatic. The sheer number of speeches and over narration, gave the movie a comical aspect at times. We've all heard the ""freedom""/""revenge"" speech right before a do-or-die battle. Here it didn't do much but give me the chuckles. Even though there is action in the movie, it is not a typical action movie. It does have a political agenda, but it is hard to discern exactly what that is at times. All I know is that after watching V for Vendetta, I felt like blowing stuff up (at least in a game environment). This movie makes we want to do the same with a sword or maybe a spear.<br/><br/>I recommend watching this movie without the dialog. Just watch it with the soundtrack or maybe even substitute your own music tracks. Watch it in silence. It seems quite spartan that way. The advantage of the book is that the dialog can be skipped. The comic retains the ""cave man painting on the wall"" type communication. You don't need the dialog. It is art. It has a message. By proxy, if the movie is a faithful adaptation, then it also retains that same message.<br/><br/>The trailers are starting to hurt the movies. At this point it seems like trailers have become bullet points for the content. This is far from the 21st Soul Music Awards. It is good. It has value and it should be repeatedly watched. I wish that I hadn't seen the trailer. Anyone know a bald Hatian mutant I can consult with ?"

","First of all anyone who hasn't watched this beauty of a movie would better do so right away. It is at least spectacular as a profusion of stylized action (maybe even violence)flashes before your eyes.in the cinema there was a mother with her 7-year old son. BIG mistake! The movie is absolutely worth the R-rating! As for the movie now. The acting was superb especially Gerard Butler and his queen, Lena Heady. The scene where the Dying King shouts to his wife goodbye an myriads of arrows fly to deliver the killing stroke gave me the chills.As for mister Miller he performed a miracle once again writing that comic book not to mention the magnificently haunting music of Tyler Bates. It is simply a flawless film. Now the historical content of the movie.I come from Greece so it is only natural that I have studied Spartan history and the Persian Wars rather well. MALE SPARTANS NEVER SLEPT WITH EACH OTHER(as I read to a comment)!!!It's true homosexuality was not a taboo these days but not for the Spartans. The did take a great pride in their bodies killed the misshaped children by throwing them into Caeadas, a river. The only slight inaccuracy is that Spartan warriors never grew a beard so the enemy could not yank their head forward. The Persians were not like that and NEITHER was Xerxes like a transsexual!! He looked like an average attractive man as I've read.But the movie tries to picture his hybris and the overwhelming luxury in Persia these days that made Persians idle."
"gregsrants","8","4","11","14 March 2007"," Most fun you'll have this year
","As a young boy, Frank Miller watched the 1962 film ""The 300 Spartans"" and was inspired in the story about 300 Spartans fighting against an army of Persians in The Battle of Thermopylae. As history tells us, 300 Greek soldiers lead by Spartan King Leonidas took on an army 20 times their number and held off the encroaching army long enough so that Greece was able to amass an army that fought off the encroaching Persians in 480 B.C.<br/><br/>Miller then took the historical event and gruesome outcome as his muse to pen 300 in 1998 with collaborator and wife Lynn Varley. It was a graphic novel resembling Sin City that pulled no punches and had the pages soaked with blood and carnage.<br/><br/>Years later, writer/director Zack Snyder who was coming off the wildly fun and successful Dawn of the Dead (2004) adapted a screenplay based on Miller's mini-series of novels on the battle and churned it into adrenaline pumping glory with the film simply titled 300.<br/><br/>The story for the film is simple in structure. 300 soldiers stand ground in a mountain pass against hordes of Persians. The result was blood, decapitations, blood, dismemberments, blood, gore and just a little more blood thrown in for good measure.<br/><br/>Sure, there is some backstory that never claims to be historically accurate. We are introduced in the beginning to the Spartan culture where their young children are taken from their families and taught to fight and become tolerant to pain and to the land (all of which are true). It is not long before we are introduced to King Leonidas (Gerard Butler) and Queen Gorgo (Lena Headey) whose love for their country comes a close second to the love they have for each other.<br/><br/>But when a Persian messenger brings word of an army of over 7,000 which will destroy the Greek towns and culture unless they are given land and water, Leonidas stands firm and declares war on the trespassing army. Well, sort of. First, Leonidas tries to get approval from the five Ephors who were Spartas high officials. They refuse Leonidas' suggestion of war (even though there is no history to support their nay vote), but Leonidas still amasses 300 of his personal guards to stand firm in the mountains to protect the women and children that remained behind.<br/><br/>So while away at war, Queen Gorgo tries to convince the council to send the entire Greek army to her husbands side in aide of his efforts. Her attempts would prove futile, but what the hell do we care? As bellowed by Leonidas, ""We're in for one wild night."". 300 does not disappoint.<br/><br/>If you've seen the trailers or the television spots, you know that violence is the call to order in 300 and Zach Snyder (God Bless Him!) fought off studio pressure to make the film PG-13 and went straight for the heart of the R-rating. We watch as the Spartans repel hundreds and hundreds of Persians led by baddie Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro) who is a cross between something on Stargate and Boy George. Their opposing armies leave enough CG blood splatter on the screen to titillate the warrior in all of us.<br/><br/>300 is all about the violence, and Zach Snyder does a fantastic job of mixing just the right amount of blood, sweat and tears (all to a rocking score) with scantly clad buffed hunks to keep both genders of the date smiling with delight. There is enough spear chucking, arrow shooting and bone crunching for two or three movies. And when Leonidas stands on the battlefield of fallen Persians and eats an apple while making a speech about being civilized, it is a scene that will resonate long after the drive back home.<br/><br/>There is so many good things about 300 that I don't know where to start. The way it was filmed in fast and slow motion video game style, the color scheme which is just dull enough to give a feel of rust, the acting lead by Butler who does a fantastic job of pulling off a role where he needs to be sensitive, intelligent, valiant, suicidal and at times, even humorous.<br/><br/>The only thing that bothered me was the inordinate amount of Braveheart type rousing speeches that were shouted in our face before each new onslaught. There is only so much ""Give them nothing! But take from them everything!"" and ""Spartans! Enjoy your breakfast, for tonight we dine in Hell!"" before a ""We Spartans have descended from Hercules himself. Taught never to retreat, never to surrender. Taught that death in the battlefield is the greatest glory he could achieve in his life. Spartans: the finest soldiers the world has ever known"" before even the most engrossed of viewers begin to roll their eyes.<br/><br/>But aside from this small drawback, 300 proved to be what I hoped it would when I started to see clips and trailers. It is a rocking ride and so far, the most fun you are going to have at the movies this year.<br/><br/>www.robertsreviews.com"
"macgyvers_apprentice","10","4","11","14 March 2007"," First great non pre packaged new action movie I have seen in a while.
","I have forever been a fan of mindless action movies it seems. When I go into a movie theater to catch the latest action film, I do so without the expectation of elaborate plot twists, historical accuracy, or even spectacular special effects. I pay for that movie ticket expecting cheap thrills, though I'll pleasantly welcome anything better.<br/><br/>Now, 300 is one fantastic action film that delivered on cheap thrills without being cheap at all. There was enough sex, violence, explosions, shouting, and blood for this film to compete with any of my favorite action films but 300 has done it best. Never, while watching, did I think there was too much of any of it.<br/><br/>Most action movies lately tend to cut to about 20 different camera angles during action sequences to give the illusion of intense action. Movies like Troy and Batman Begins fool me into believing a punch landed hard or sword struck true. Each battle shot in 300 was pulled back enough to not only see a single Spartan hacking limbs from single Persian, but I could also see clearly the battle going on behind, in front, and in the foreground and background of the Spartan. There was so much action shown in each frame, I doubt I would have been disappointed in any of the other sides of the big screen I missed. 300 also did not make me cringe in anticipation of the horribly-clich√©d one-liners most action heroes of late spew out.<br/><br/>Not only would I recommend any people I know to go see 300, I would ask to go see it again and again with them. Do not miss this movie on the big screen."
"Ata-2","1","4","11","13 March 2007"," Excellent movie
","Definitely worth the money for a change. There are lots of great action scenes and amazing costumes and design work at every level. There is even some acting. Whether this movie is historically accurate or not is irrelevant. In brief, 300 muscular six-packed oiled-up Spartans whose society was based around war meet the evil hordes from Lord of the Rings aka the Persians. The battle that lasted 3 days took place in Thermopylae in Greece. There was a bottle-neck at which the Spartans made their stand and the 600K Persians tried to force their way through. What ensued was one of the greatest battles in human history that basically saved democracy.<br/><br/>This movie did come across a tiny minuscule little bit like an advert for white supremacy but I am sure that was not the intention. Case in point I was very proud to see Peter Mensah as a Persian. He was as always magnificent. The best thing about this movie was Kelly Craig who is the incredibly sexy Oracle girl. Ms. Craig seems to be an Internet ghost in that there are virtually no photos of her anywhere. Her agent should be taken out at dawn and shot with a disposable camera.<br/><br/>As a Persian I was of course not surprised that we were portrayed as evil hordes. I would have liked to have seen some Persians eating roasted babies (like we do) but well you can't have everything. Its not any kind of propaganda just historical fact really. After all my name is Evil. Axis of Evil. Oh yes and I drive a Ford Insurgent."

","300: **1/2 out of **** <br/><br/>300 is the tale of the 300 Spartans who stood up to and defied the grand army of the Persians. This is about all the story you get for the film but I'll touch on that a little later. First lets start of with the good. This is a gorgeous film. The nicely polished green/blue screen effects are wondrous. They make the film look like the graphic novel has come right off the page and onto the big screen (it takes a true director to make film look like paper). The acting in this film is very good. I loved Gerard Butler's commanding performance as the Spartan king. He elevates the movie by leaps and bounds. In fact the film has no real weak performances at all. Everyone in the film looks absolutely of the time. The Oracle was amazing, and I loved the character of the hunchback, though I do not recall his name. Therein lies the first problem I had with this film. There was no strong character development. Beyond the hunchback and maybe one or two of the other characters they were all cardboard cut outs with biceps.<br/><br/>I loved the opening of the first battle where they are running at each other and they collide into mass chaos, but then it swiftly transferred into one overly stylized battle scene after another. The slow motion fighting was cool the first time you saw it but wore thin very quickly. If all the action had been sped up to real time the film would have been substantially shorter.<br/><br/>I also couldn't stand the digital blood. I found it distracting and cheesy. And what was with that random sex scene? It served no purpose to the story. But it was the monsters that really slammed the nail into the coffin. I just couldn't buy into the time period and the peril of the story when you had the Immortals running around looking like Dracula. I also didn't like that they introduced that giant globular looking beast who came in and decapitated on of the Spartans and you never see him again. i'm sure he's somewhere on the cutting room floor but it would have still been nice to see something happen to him. I'm also not sure why they increased the size of the Elephants. For some reason they are like three times as big. Same thing with the rhino.<br/><br/>I also thought that the two times that the heroes get attacked with arrows was right out of the film Hero, and they were put to better effect in that movie. My biggest problem had to be that I didn't find the film engaging in any way. The action didn't even grip me. I was bored and couldn't help feel I'd seen it all done before. Pretty much everything I liked about the movie I had already seen in the trailer. But a movie with a goat-man can't be all bad. It is worth taking a look due to, mainly, the look of the film but I'd definitely wait for DVD!"

It should have stayed like that, but I was coaxed into watching it after all. I've since had a chance to take a look at the comic book and must say that if the intention of the filmmakers was to capture the comic's style they succeeded admirably. The story contains nothing that hasn't been told before. I won't even go into issues of warmongering and political correctness. Many pop-cultural events have been called ""the ultimate triumph of style over substance"". This movie takes the crown for now."

Yes most of the film is animated, what isn't these days, but the breath taking scenes of slow motion and enormous weapon filled structure of the film tales you back to were there was no animation. This is just entertainment at its best. This is what we go to the movies for. When I first saw previews for this movie I knew that I absolutely had to see it, and I think that's how most people felt.

","So I was really excited to see the movie and enjoy the battle of Thermopylae having read extensively on the battle and having knowledge of the Spartans. However, I must say that I was very displeased when I left the theater, not just because of the mindless gore that was dominant throughout the movie, but because of the piling historical inaccuracies that just buried the movie for me.<br/><br/>Besides the obvious almost supernatural beings that were prevalent, the movie makers screwed up the fundamental strategies of the Spartans: the phalanx. The phalanx was their machine in domination and the reason they did so well in this battle; no man could get close to their seemingly unstoppable barrier that reached out with long Dory spears and reflected anyone who got close. The front Spartans would fight under their shields, deflecting the enemy, with men behind them using their spears to kill the oncoming souls. The Spartans would fight until the dories broke in which case they would switch to the sword. In the film, the Spartans hardly held a phalanx for more than a few seconds before carelessly chucking their spears through some worthless Persian's head and then pulling out their swords and decapitating heads and severing limbs. One of the greatest feats of the Spartans was the phalanx, it was their unstoppable strategy. The movie screwed this up royally and I could hardly sit through the movie that didn't even use the fundamentals, but rather relied on gore for entertainment. There was little-to-none character development, and in the end when Leonidas dies (Not a spoiler, it's history!), a woman was bawling uncontrollably next to me, leading me to question why? There's no emotional attachment to the characters who show little emotion themselves: the movie convoluted them into being dumb brutes (but great dumb brutes nonetheless). Seemingly all of the Immortals were portrayed as disfigured ninjas, which is obviously not accurate at all. I was also saddened at the choice to completely leave out the heroic doings of Themistocles, in the naval battles where he was outnumbered 6 ships to one and managed to hold the Persians off, preventing the navy from landing troops behind the Spartans. The film also made it seem as though the 300 were the only Greeks fighting in the battle (besides the dozen men who were blacksmiths and masons), whereas an estimated 7,000 men aided the Spartans in their tumultuous clash with the Persians.<br/><br/>All in all, I would not take this movie as a piece of history, but another blockbuster that's aimed at making money and killing off thousands of characters that we don't care about- which it is good at."

Now, back to the film. 300 had some really great lines, most of which can be seen on the main page of the IMDb site. If the film was shot in color and had ninety per cent less CG, it would have been a clear 10, maybe even 11. There was way too much of the speed it up and slow it down effects in the battle scenes to the point of being cartoonish. Can you say, ""boring"". I had a problem with Xerxes being portrayed as being somewhat, how shall I say it, delicate. Now, let's take the Queen of the Spartans - I wish we had more moms like that in the U.S. Still, I'm a sucker for what Patton termed 'desperate struggle' situations, and 300 was one of those.

","This was the most random and clich√©' movie I have seen in a while. This movie took a true story about warriors and turned it into a sappy drama that made absolutely no sense. In the middle of battle scenes we see random animals like rhinoceroses and elephants trying to fight, then we have some weird ""secret weapon"" guy chained up like a lame copycat from Mortal Kombat or something. Then, on top of this, the director just had to throw pointless sex into the mix so all the men could have something to get their jollies off to. I'm nothing even close to a prude but it was ridiculous. Then there was the slow motion every five seconds. BORING. The story of the Spartans did not need this lame movie to tell their story, someone else needed to sit in the director's chair."

Just when you think it couldn't get better, it steps its game up more.<br/><br/>Lots of historical movies are hard to follow, require a full history lesson before you watch it and drags out their battle scenes, which of course have already lost you in the confusion of it all. 300 does none of any of that. I could fully understand what was going on and I never once took my eyes off the fighting.<br/><br/>It's safe to say that I can watch this movie three hundred times and still think it's just as awesome as the first time I watched it.

","First off, this movie is loosely based on a graphic novel that was loosely based on oral history. This movie is not meant to be realistic. It is not meant to be much more than entertaining and absolutely beautiful to look at. That it was. To those that complain about lack of plot, there was plot, the battle, and subplot, the council's deciding to supply more men for the battle. Admittedly, these were relatively simple, but this movie wasn't supposed to have an intricate plot. The writing was spotty at points, but the acting more than made up for it. Sometimes it was over the top, but it was sincere, and being that it was supposed to be an oral tale, the whole thing was EXAGGERATED. That is the point. Elephants and rhinos tower over men. Deformities cover the entire body of a man. This movie was not made to be an accurate retelling of the Battle of Thermopylae. That said, it was highly entertaining and very well made. It is solidly the first ""all-blue-screen"" movie I've seen that I have truly liked. Know about a movie before you see it, so you don't complain about it on reviews, please."

","300 is the epitome of a comic book brought to life. And while that's not a bad thing, it's not necessarily good either.<br/><br/>On the plus side, 300 (based on what I've read since I haven't seen the graphic novel its based on), authentically captures Frank Miller and Lynn Varley's visuals. Some panels from the book that I've seen testify to director Zack Snyder's success in reenacting 300 for the big screen. But even taken on its own, 300 is undoubtedly visually striking.<br/><br/>On the other hand, Snyder's fealty also ensures that 300 is as one-dimensional and emotionally hollow as a comic book page. It's hard to take the proceedings entirely seriously when your actors have impossibly ripped and defined chests and your lead actress is shown with nipples as large as pencil erasers.<br/><br/>As a result, the film is never as emotionally engaging as other movies it is sure to be compared with, such as the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Even a climactic scene in which Leonidas faces down a virtual cloud of Persian arrows while declaring his love for Queen Gorgo, which he could never tell her in person, fails to move the audience. In fact, the target audience of this film, like Gladiator, might well be wrestling fans, particularly given its homo-erotic undertones.<br/><br/>Given Snyder's obvious focus on the visuals, the actors are left on their own to cope as well as they can, with mixed results. Lena Headley gives dignity to Queen Gorgo but Gerard Butler has the unhappy task of bringing to life King Leonidas, who seems to have to scream every other line of dialog once he leaves Sparta.<br/><br/>Overall, as comic book adaptations go, 300 is way above such clunkers as Ghost Rider and Daredevil but not in the same league as Spider-man, X-Men and Batman Begins."

","A lot of people seem to miss the main point with 300. The framing device of the whole film is Dilios (David Wenham) telling the story of the 300 spartans around a campfire to fellow soldiers. Hence why the film features exaggerated, over the top depictions of the Spartans, Persian empire, and Ephialtes the betrayer.<br/><br/>Did the persian empire really have legions of demon-like super soldiers with sharp teeth? Of course not. But to an ancient Greek in 480 BC the Persians probably seemed like a scary evil empire fueled by dark forces. Its from the Greek point of view.<br/><br/>Was Ephialtes actually a deformed hunchback? No, but to a Greek telling the story, he was an ugly traitor. So the exaggeration fits. Of course a Spartan telling the story would use hyperbole, to make the victory of his country sound that much more great.<br/><br/>Did Leonidas really kill a 6 foot long dire wolf with just a wooden spear? I think you get the point by now.<br/><br/>Re watch with this in mind and it becomes such a fun film. Its just like being around the campfire with some Spartans, listening to the exaggerated claims of a glorious battle.<br/><br/>The build up and pacing was executed perfectly. The looming threat of Persia can be really be felt. Although I will say, the scene with the child whos village was burned down was a bit cheesy.<br/><br/>The blue screen shots create a surreal, dream like atmosphere, even though it tends to get overused now a days. The special effects were amazing, especially for 2006. Great action and all around story telling. Will always be a favorite of mine."

"jay-adams53","8","2","4","30 January 2012"," A great movie
","It seems that everyone who hated this movie must have written a review, so I thought I'd throw in my two cents to even things up a bit. First, if you assume every movie is made simply to uppercut some sort of ideology into the audience's chest, then yes, it does seem very racist, xenophobic, and the like. However, this film is based on a freakin' comic book! The Spartans were some of the most skilled, nastiest, nationalistic fighters out there, and certainly had reason to be more driven and nationalistic than Persia's, which was not an army of individuals fighting for their land and families. Should they have been portrayed differently simply to satisfy the current political climate? Are you mad? The cheesy one-liners are also evidence that this movie IS BASED ON A COMIC BOOK. The exaggerated characters is further evidence that this movie IS BASED ON A COMIC BOOK. This is not a historical movie, it is a movie which seeks to put a rockstar, no-holds-barred spin on a particular historical event. It isn't attempting to be accurate, or balanced, or anything of the sort, and it SHOULDN'T, because that isn't it's purpose. It shouldn't be obligated to do anything of the sort. It's ENTERTAINMENT. Nothing more. And it's damn good entertainment, in my opinion.<br/><br/>Every scene is beautifully crafted. I found the slowdown to be stylistic and much of the dialogue, which is apparently cheesy and fascist to everyone else, to be at least somewhat inspiring, and certainly engaging. These Spartans were trained their entire lives to be warriors, their entire culture is built around success in battle, and you don't expect them to be quite skilled, much more so than a slave army, and quite patriotic? Also, this movie was from the point of view of the Spartans. How would this army have appeared to the Spartans? Wouldn't their stories now be over-exaggerated, over-simplified, almost legendary? There isn't a great amount of character development because this movie is about a battle, ONE battle, THE battle for the continuance of the Western world, and yes, IF the Spartans had been simply overwhelmed from the start, and if their Athenian allies hadn't completely CRUSHED the much larger Persian navy at sea, the West simply could not have existed in any similar manner as it has. And yes, the Western world is guilty of arrogance, overextending it's boundaries to the point of imperialism, however, it has given our world a plethora of all-too-important philosophical ideals that are simply irreplaceable if we want to live in a free society.<br/><br/>I realize I spent a great deal of my time being critical of other reviews, so I would like to take the time to apologize for perhaps wasting the time of someone who was simply searching for a detailed point of view on the film. I can assure you that the film is action-packed. The scenes are absolutely beautiful, every one of them. The film is gory, but artistically gory, if that makes any sense. You'll know what I mean. The story is simple, direct, and inspiring. The acting is excellent. The movie, overall, was a tremendous experience. I give it a 9."

","Zack Snyder seems like an enlightened version of Michael Bay. He's come up through commercials to fun action movies movies.

Snyder by contrast has had Sarah Polley in Dawn Of The Dead, Silk Spectre in Watchmen, and the chicks galore in the upcoming Suckerpunch. In between DOTD and WM came 300, with Lena Headey, as the posh hot iron woman Queen Gorgo, who gives the messenger cheek and reams the traitor with a sword.<br/><br/>This movie is also great fun. the story is easy enough to follow, the Spartans sympathetic, the blood flows, plenty of action, and good momentum. I just sat back and watched the movie go, nothing hard to think about, but not the crap you get on TV. The movie's also got moments of reprieve, where you can take a breath, and then dive back into the next slaughter, unlike Sin City which was non-stop, too much, and thought misogyny and violence against women are okay.<br/><br/>The special effects do the movie justice. They create the atmosphere of the flick, immerse you in the world the Spartans, and makes great escapism.<br/><br/>The music score is good to, epic and dark, sometimes together, sometimes on their own.<br/><br/>And the really good thing is the entertainment, let your brain switch off, go for the ride, and have a good time, at the movies or on DVD, on any night. It's great escapism, forget the political debates, financial news, sport and celebrity gossip, this helps one forget it all. No political agenda, no melodrama/temper tantrums/mental breakdowns/drugs/domestic disputes/corrupt cops.

"ZombieMcQueen","9","2","4","16 January 2010"," Machismo at an apex.
","wow. just wow. with all movies, I try my best to be as balanced in my judgment as possible. I always look for the best features in movies as well as the worst drawbacks, while still noticing the little things. as I write this review of 300, I fail to think of anything negative to say about this film. there have been very few cases where I have found myself nigh-speechless because of the greatness of a movie, and this was one of them. seriously, I cannot express how much I love this film. I almost never say this after seeing a movie for the first time, but this is one of the best films I've ever seen.<br/><br/>300 is an adaptation of the superb graphic novel from Frank Miller and Lynn Varley. if you've read it, then you realize that the visuals are some of the most unique and well done one could hope to see in the medium and the story is well written and engrossing. for those who haven't, nothing has prepared you for this (to borrow the tag-line from the Mortal Kombat movie). in the film, the writers Kurt Johnstad, Michael Gordon, and Zack Snyder (who also directed the film) copies wonderfully the lines from the novel, with some extra depth added to it for cinematic purposes. Snyder's direction is pretty much flawless here. to be totally honest, the only other movie i'm sure i've seen with his direction was the fantastic remake of Dawn Of The Dead, so I have little to compare his past work to 300 with. with this endeavor, though, he's obviously shown he can hang with the greatest directors. I must also gives mad props (yeah, I just said that) to the photography crew, for they are the unsung heroes of this picture.<br/><br/>the story follows The Battle of Thermopylae, which took place in 480 B.C. Greece. it's not so much a historically accurate telling, but rather an almost exact depiction of the source material. King Leonidas of Sparta marches to his destiny with a handful of loyal men to face against the overwhelming Persian armies of Xerxes, and his wife Queen Gorga desperately tries to assist her love in any way she can. admittedly, more of the movie's focus in on Leonidas' side of the tale, yet it never feels as if Gorga's story is pushed aside. there are various subplots as well, which are all very well done (a welcome surprise, indeed). the drama is never overdone or undercooked, and it works practically seamlessly with the ridiculously incredible action pieces. the acting here is top notch, and rather unique in it's own way.<br/><br/>first off, let me say that I cannot imagine anyone else doing as good a job as Leonidas as Gerald Butler did. if you've seen the most recent film version of The Phantom Of The Opera, you know that he gives a commanding presence. he has the gripping ability to fill his voice full of passion, rage, courage, and you cannot help but shut your mouth and listen up (imagine Lee Ermey in Full Metal Jacket, but 10 times louder). this could not be any truer with his performance in 300. he is perfectly cast as the Spartan king who leads his people for the defense of their future. also as well chosen is Lena Headey as Queen Gorga, who captivates the audience with her strength and resolve, the likes of which we've often seen in movies. she, however gives the role her all, and it shows here. Rodrigo Santoro is fantastic as King Xerxes, the cruel ruler who believes himself a god while conquering countless enemies. with a height that even dwarfs Leonidas and a voice almost as forceful, we cannot help but realize that, had we been in the place of the Spartans, we would s**t our pants at the sight of him standing before us with armies ready at a whim. there are also many other fine performances from slightly more minor characters, but overall there is something interesting about the acting. in 300 there is no single outstanding performance, despite how well done some are. instead, all the performances equally join together to form one cohesive group of strength through numbers...much like the way of the Spartan army, really.<br/><br/>arguably, the greatest appeal of 300 is the visual mastery all throughout ever single piece of celluloid. the contrast between darkness and light is perfectly matched. camera angles are used strategically to give us the most of every shot, and the slow motion switch battle takes your attention hostage. it perfectly shows you the intricate detail of the fighting, while never letting you forget the intensity of the battle. I really cannot say as much about the eye-candy (not referring to the topless women or muscular men) as I want, you just have to experience it for yourself. just as well-realized as the imagery of Sin City, if not more.<br/><br/>simply put, this movie is an amazing, well crafted, and hugely memorable example of load-blowing cinematic awesomeness. it's indeed rare to see cinema done so violently, graphically, and unflinchingly while still standing above as a form of art. I recommend this to anyone who wants to have a great movie-going experience, to anyone who admires visual excellency, and to anyone enjoys some good ass-kicking fun."
"mafioso67","4","2","4","30 November 2008"," A work of art? Come on, really?
","As aforementioned by other reviewers,there is quite a polarisation between the responses of viewers, taking the two sides of either loving 300 or despising it. Unfortunately I am of the latter breed, however, irrespective of this, i must protest against those who advocate this as a piece of art. Granted, the fight scenes are epic, and the cinematography is unique if nothing else, producing a film of high aesthetic quality. However these elements alone can hardly qualify a modern film as being a piece of art.<br/><br/>For a start, the film bases its story around historical events, with one slight problem; in parts it is historically inaccurate. In reading the review of another, they themselves (a lover of 300) admitted this point, and stated that 'this shouldn't matter and that people are reading too much into it' if they pick on the inaccuracies. To take this line is simply ridiculous; if you are going to tell a story of history, you must do it accurately to the best of your ability. Whilst the nature of history itself does come down to the manner in which it is told, this film blatantly ignores historical fact. One major point that jumps out at me occurs early on in the film, where an ultimatum is given to the Spartans, and the Spartan King asserts that his queen has the right to speak amongst men, asserting that women have a level of equality to men in this society. This is a poor choice by the creators, where it is obvious that they are merely trying to insert modern values into a historical context, and i would argue that this lowers the quality of the film.<br/><br/>Whilst in principle this idea is not 'wrong', the problem is that the creators are trying to tell a historical story, and to do it right, they need to stick to the facts. Such an inclusion would be welcome in something of a pseudo-historical film with a post-modernist or deconstructualist flair, however 300 has no such element, and so points such as this come across as nothing more than anachronisms inserted simply to keep the female audience from being offended.<br/><br/>Furthermore the glorification of the Spartan King killing the messenger is another poor choice. Sure, he insulted the queen, but even as far back as this is set, there was a customary understanding that one does not 'shoot the messenger'. It also undermines part of the storyline, for the Persian king would not be informed of the Spartan King's response - the Persian king is left to assume, however he could just as easily assume that the messenger was killed by some wild beast along the way.<br/><br/>Another point that strikes me is the characters themselves. One reviewer mentioned the high quality of acting from the actors... are you serious? The acting is nothing spectacular, and to be honest, it appears that the creators of this film just grabbed any guy with a six-pack out of Hollywood and stripped them to their underwear. The lines of this movie are nothing but corny, and the blatant use of stereotypical characterisation demeans the responder to a position where the creator assumes they have no intelligence, simply telling them who to support and who to despise. An example of this can be seen when comparing the leader of the Persians to the leader of the Spartans. The leader of the Persiens is very feminine in his appearance, with the use of eyeliner and makeup to accentuate his rather delicate features. This combined with his wearing of excessive amounts of jewelery presents to the responder something of a woman masquerading as a man. The responder is then led to compare this to King Leonidis, leader of the Spartans, who is your stereotypical rough and tumble man-hero, with six-pack and bulging biceps, and no fear whatsoever. In juxtaposing these two characters, it is clear who the creators push the responder toward supporting. This is further seen in the nature of the Persian leader, who shows excessive pride in yearning to be seen as a 'god'; an ugly personal trait to any responder. The point I am making here is that a true work of art would implore the responder to think for themselves and come to their own conclusions - the historical legend is one of heroism, and so the responder could easily come to this conclusion upon their own accord, they do not need to be treated like idiots as this film does. To a great extent, this is probably why there there is such a spectrum of responses upon the film, because some people enjoy being told, but most prefer to think. The problem is the film does not entirely know what it wants, it either needs to be something of modern pop-culture, quickly and easily forgotten, or a work of art. The stereotypical characterisation leads the film toward being part of pop culture, however the impressive cinematography provides high aesthetic appeal worthy of some artistic commendation. With this being said however, for a film to be considered 'a work of art', it needs to be succinct and bring all of these elements together into one production, which unfortunately, 300 is not capable of. It sits on the fence, showing elements of both strength and weakness, and for this reason, a 'work of art' it simply is not."
"george_chabot","1","2","4","30 November 2008"," 300 is not much good if you're trying to learn something about what happened.
","While I love historical movies and especially the story of Leonidas and the 300 Spartans I had to call the makers of 300 on their lack of historical consciousness. The story is well documented in Herodotus (who?) and other sources and yet the gaffes continually jump out of the movie. One thing I noticed was the Spartan king said everything in a yell. I wonder if that was the comic book mentality of Frank Miller. The dialog could have used a little creativity instead of being aimed at 12 year old mentality. The Persians were grotesque and several prominent ones, including King Xerxes, were Negros. I wonder if the filmmakers know that Negros are from Africa? Maybe they don't know Persia is in Asia? Anyway, the research for 300 missed a lot of easily checked points. The Spartans wore armor, not parading naked except for a loincloth and cloak as they did in 300. The camera set ups are all framed like comic book panels without much movement. The action is CGI so I don't know why they chose to make a goofed up version of a true event when they could have made up a story completely. DC and Marvel comics do it all the time. Good for Lord of the Rings fans but not much good as a history lesson."

The colours may be a bit dull, but I find the rainbow unimaginative. You do not as much anticipate as to what would happen next inasmuch you would turn a page. Every scene is worth a thousand words, every speech is grand, every fight is bloody worthwhile, the love is true, the honour is compassionate, the evil is dark, even the six-pack abs keep you glued and wondering, the history is compelling, the myth may be a myth, the story may be surreal but you would end it with the glory itself.<br/><br/>The movie maybe marmite. You either like it or you don't. I should not describe the movie as my thoughts are not as nouveau niche as to what I had witnessed. If you have skipped the theatre and waited for the DVD instead, I suggest you start smoking and wait for cancer for a much swifter death. For all those who would appreciate the hard work involved in the movie, value it for all the right reasons. If you walk out stating that the decapitations were ""cool"" and ""awesome"", or dawdle on the political message of the movie (It's based on a comic book for God sake), I would be waiting out with Spartan spears ready to pierce your heart and soul."

","Blood porn. Gruesome, awesome, messy, blood porn.<br/><br/>That is the best way to describe the setting of 300, a graphic novel turned film based on the famous Spartan Battle of Thermopylae.<br/><br/>We are swept in to the legendary tale by a story of King Leonidas' training with the Egogi warriors. It is a tale that leaves your heart leaping to love the famous king along with the rest of the men listening on the field of Plataea. A tale that has you ready to stand up and fight alongside the Spartans.<br/><br/>King Xerxes is bearing down on the Spartans and the senate is unwilling to move to war because the Oracle of Delphi, a drugged young maiden speaking in tongues, says there will be no fighting in the time of the Carnier. King Leonidas, however, knows that this army led by the God-King Xerxes will be the end of Sparta.<br/><br/>All in all the acting was done fashionably well. (Okay, maybe fashionably is not a proper word to use when describing grown men running around in speedos and capes, nor a Greek king with a Scottish accent.) The facts about the real Battle of Thermopylae were fairly close to the Hollywood portrayal, more so than Hollywood is known for anyway. They even used actual lines taken from historical documents, such as: ""Our arrows will blot out the sun."" ""Then we shall fight in the shade!"" Still, for a two and a half hour movie about war, 300 was a fun experience. I was pleasantly surprised when I left the theater, so much so that I purchased the film as soon as it came out on DVD. For the action-adventure junkies out there, there is only one way to describe it¬Ö Blood porn. Gruesome, awesome, messy blood porn."

","This is a really awful movie. For a start, Persians were not/are not black, and the Persian empire never extended to Africa, yet the 'villains' of this movie look strikingly similar to the orcs from Lord of the Rings.<br/><br/>Secondly, the battles - which are abundant in this film - have no sense of scale, there don't appear to be any formations or tactics. They consist of lots of black orcs running around a battle field never attacking anyone, waiting for, what looks like about a dozen Spartans wearing thongs to spear them. As if this wasn't torture enough, most of the battles are filmed in slow motion, to make sure you catch all of the dismembered limbs, heads and intestines spilling all over the place.<br/><br/>Last of all, there's no plot, the story goes like this; evil Persians attack Sparta and they have a fight. Blood is spilt. The end. It's vacuous, brainless, visual tripe which probably took ten minutes to write, a week to film, and a year in post production adding all the effects. Atrocious"

With some brilliant special effects and acting 300 has proclaimed itself as a strong contender for one of the best films of 2006 and 07.

"m-dm","10","2","4","2 June 2008"," Battle choreography/photography is what makes this film special.
","What is wrong with you people? This film is brilliant alone for the stylised violence which has made ancient warfare appear like a beautiful surreal dance. Its not a gory film really; because there is no *focus* on gore. Limbs fly and blood spurts but the camera always continues moving with the actor/s as he glides through the fight scenes. Because of the cartoonish/mythological surreal atmosphere it never grossed me out once. It was like a beautififul classical painting becoming animated. The scene of the Spartans watching the storm hit the Persian fleet was another highlight. T I was disappointed with some of the camera work in Gladiator. Editing was way too rapid and very hard to keep focused on what is happening. Way too many speed ups. No such problems with 300. It was eye candy and i was mesmerised by the almost ballet like fight scenes.<br/><br/>Its not fair to criticise this film on its historical exaggerations. Clearly the Frank Miller/Homeresque epic influence should exclude that as any kind of fair comment. In fact, what is funny is this film is far more accurate in regards to its base history than most films based on historical events.<br/><br/>As for the silly negative reviews from a politically correct anal perspective.

Sorry, George--I didn't know 2006 was such a lean year for you...<br/><br/>On Entrances Of Fighting Animals: Ladies and gentlemen, Elton John! Queen! Miss Piggy! Did anyone notify Michael Jackson that some of his parade pets had escaped NeverLand? The only two missing were Kodos & Kang from the Simpsons...In face this reminded me of Bart & Milhouse trying to do their own Gladiator remake, intercut with clips from the Village Peoples' secret stash (probably snuck in there by Rod & Tod Flanders): 'OK, wheat! We need more wheat! OK, battles, some kind of speech about freedom, more blood, beheading, 'nother speech about freedom, limbs flying, push the bodies, 'nother speech about freedom...'Wait, Bart, are we doing Gladiator or Braveheart?' 'Oh man, I think we're sitting too close to this bucket of Mr Clean suds....Hey--Mr Clean! Yea! Put him in there, too!'<br/><br/>On The Villain: We can all rest easier now, because this 'film' has heralded the triumphant comeback of RuPaul!! Pierced, pumped, and sassy!! If you doubt that it was truly he/she, just think about his/her most spoken line - ""Kneal before me!"" Think about it...On second thought--don't.<br/><br/>On Token Judas Character: The bastard son of Gollum and John Merrick. And when it was led into the harem of wanton, randomly-pierced, rejected LA Lakers cheerleaders, even Caligula might have just said, ""You know what, I'm outta here, pal"".<br/><br/>On The 'Fierce Persian Army': (Cue b-sharp) We represent the Screen Actor's Guild The Screen Actor's Guild, The Screen Actor's Guild And in the name of The Screen Actor's Guiiiiiiiiiiild, We wish to welcome you to short-term contracts!<br/><br/>On Soundtrack: Nice to know Survivor's still getting work.<br/><br/>Now, some of you may be asking, 'Well, what of the story? The characters? The plot lines? (Pause for 8 minutes of uncontrollable snickering)...OK, seriously, back to it now...<br/><br/>(hee hee)Yes, I'm having fun writing this. And that brings up a very good point: Movies are meant to be fun! To be enjoyed--to entertain! So, in that sense, it served its purpose very well.

Also it could be classed as similar to Brave Heart, with its call to the brave and chivalrous.<br/><br/>But, and a strong but, when you take the story and cinematics as a whole you are given an experience that had me gripped. This is not a film as gus495 said in his comments for those who want complicated plots and twists; it is a film for those who want strong leaders showing as much courage as those they command.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, many movies today try to bring the same feeling. Troy is one that springs to mind immediately, while this shows Brad Pitt's body off, it feels like a fashion show with the whole film designed around a single actor or two.<br/><br/>300 goes beyond Hollywood's usual trip and shows that films special effects can be used as a work of art with as much impact a painting, bringing to life the feel and grit of battle.<br/><br/>If you want an experience above the norm, I would watch this film."

Gerard Butler shows he is capable of carrying a big movie like this with a totally believable performance as Leonidas, the King who gives his life to defend his country. He's totally unrecognisable hiding behind a Brian Blessed type beard, I did go through a stage of describing as a buff Brian Blessed until I saw the gorgeousness that lay beneath!

I think it's brilliant! It's entertaining, exciting, visually STUNNING, and just plain awesome! The actors do a mesmerizing job, Gerard Butler is perfect as King Leonidas. I was pretty much glued to my seat for the entire duration of the movie, and afterwords, I couldn't stop talking about it. This movie ranks as one of the best action movies EVER in my book. I think it was a fantastic adaptation of Frank Miller's original graphic novel.<br/><br/>Here we come to my main point: this movie is NOT based on the actual historic events that took place between between the Spartans and the Persians. This movie is an adaptation of the graphic novel, which is an adaptation of the actual events. So come on you negative critics!!! It's not meant to be a realistic period drama! I mean geez... <br/><br/>The action is magnificent. The acting is magnificent. THIS MOVIE ROCKS!!!! Not to mention those half-naked men are majorly drool-worthy.... So please, stop over analyzing it. It's supposed to be entertainment, and I say it's damn good entertainment. The love story between Queen Gorgo and King Leonidas is wonderful straight to the end. Even though you know from the very beginning that all the 300 men will die, you also know that they're not going down without one hell of a fight.<br/><br/>Do yourself a favor: watch it. Be prepared for some great action sequences, beautiful CGI effects and a serious amount of testosterone. <br/><br/>P.S. I highly recommend this movie to everyone, including my girlfriends by saying: 300 is the ultimate chick-flick!

","Was very disappointed in the movie.<br/><br/>Found it to be a big budget action picture with most being spent on special affects and very little of anything else. The action scenes were indeed impressive but not so original in concept. And for action films to be entertaining today, they must be accompanied by something more than a juvenile story line, mediocre screenplay and stilted acting. Give the actors an A for effort but it seemed all they were required to do was to show up on the sound stage, read a synopsis of the day's scene and improvise in front of the camera. <br/><br/>A poor remake of the 1962 screen epic ""The 300 Spartans""."

","I have just seen 300 and I have to say it is absolutely brilliant. I am not usually a fan of such an epic movies but I have enjoyed every minute of it. I didn't know much about it when I start watching, but at the end I could see Frank Miller's touch on the colours in the movie, that dark comic book kind of atmosphere and that you know throughout the whole movie that a legend is told right before your eyes: and yet the blood spatter, all so favourite of Miller. It wasn't enough blood shed in Sin city; here he is back and thirsty. Yet it is not a mindless bloodbath that aims to make you sick, it is really well presented, when you actually look at it the blood is very dark wine red colour and is more in your mind rather than your eyes. What else is in front of your eyes ladies, are 300 super physically fit men running around half naked the hole movie, it is absolutely spectacular. And you will all enjoy the steaming hot scene with the king and his queen. I have to say that them both Gerard Butler and Lena Headey give a great performance. Hats off for my new favourite actor too, Dominic West as Thereon, he is just so sweet to play a baddie-absolutely brilliant. Another thing that amazed me about this movie is that it is totally believable. You would think with all that screaming and courage all over the place, and how the heck 300 Spartans are going to defeat countless army, some of them immortal, how they are going to convince me that this is actually possible. The key is strategy. They are very wise and well coordinated in every move, they fight as one, they fight smart and tactical. It kept me with anticipation to see what is going to be their next move against enemy's next hit. If there is such a thing as beautiful warfare, this is it. I sincerely recommend this movie to everyone and anyone; you will enjoy every bit of it for it is a real piece of cinema art. Absolutely brilliant."

As has been mentioned, the passion that was put into the acting, particularly Gerard Butler, was phenomenal. The battle scenes were done well. The only real disappointment I found was Xerxes. It seemed to me that he was not nearly intimidating enough.

","Imagine an Iranian director making a movie about 300 upright Cheyenne warriors making their last stand against the invasion of the cruel American army, lead by General Custer, an 8 ft. tall Drag Queen and made up entirely of mutants. There'd be an outcry, it would be labeled evil propaganda. But '300', noooo, this one's based on a comic!<br/><br/>If you're the kind of person who can switch off your mind during a movie, then maybe it's enjoyable. You must not think about any of it, otherwise it becomes ludicrous.<br/><br/>This is the kind of movie Joseph Goebbels would've weeped seeing. It has all the right fascist ingredients. The Spartans are surprisingly Caucasian for Ancient Greece, the only upright men are warriors, they love nothing better than to die for their country, their freedom, their hypocra....democracy. The Spartans are the Chosen Ones, everyone else is a wimp, a traitor or a weasel. And Persia is in the outer rim of Mordor.<br/><br/>Zack Snyder's claim that 90% of this crap is historically accurate is shameful!<br/><br/>And the movie itself? The dialog is about the worst I have ever heard, most of it sounded like Klingons talking. One could dub every single line with random fillings of words like honor, blood, glory, etc. and it wouldn't change anything. Visually, it looks like an FHM photo spread. If you hail to the almighty Photoshop, maybe you'll like it. It has no thrill, because you'll know when the Spartans will rip through a thousand men without breaking a sweat and you'll know when it's time for them to die heroically. The action itself is non existent, because all of it happens in slow motion. Half of the movie is Spartans slaughtering the others with the tried and trusted formula: evil one runs at hero, striking a blow, missing, hero cuts his throat.<br/><br/>The rest is just hollow. Depictions of Spartan hardness, which equals all things good. This is a movie that calls out to that shifty little figment of Manliness so many people have. People who talk about blood and honor, patriots, nationalists. People who think of battlefields as places where boys become men, where men become heroes.

","I don't get it...<br/><br/>Why do so many people like this incredibly stupid and boring film? Is all the ""wooting"" and praise because of the visuals? Yeah, the movie was shot against a blue screen and had a year of post-production work done to it, but what about the production design itself? To me, the actual style of the film was lackluster. Everything was a muddy brown color, and the shadows were too dark.<br/><br/>The movie wasn't a complete waste, hence my rating. There were a couple of good visuals in the film, particularly with the 1/2 naked woman moving in slow motion through, what seemed like, water. But other than that, and a few nice punches and kicks, I saw nothing particularly special about 300. Even the fight scenes were annoying with their gratuitous use of slow motion before and after every hit.<br/><br/>If you want to see a good visual film that also has a story, I highly recommend Sin City."
"fruitbat319","2","2","4","17 August 2007"," xenophobia the movie!!!!
","So, this is a first for me: I am actually writing this review as I am watching the movie. I've never done that before. Usually, I take time to mull a movie over, to weigh its pros and cons, etc., but 300 leaves little for me to ponder. My boyfriend interprets this movie as a joke in and of itself, and I suppose he's right. You'd almost think it has to be a spoof of itself. <br/><br/>Actually, I have to give this film a lot of credit. I have never, in my life, seen a movie simultaneously insult women, homosexuals, intellectuals, genderqueer folk, people who question authority, people with dark complexions, people who don't support war, foreigners (particularly those of Middle Eastern descent), and, most bizarrely, people with facial piercings. It's really quite amazing. Almost breathtaking. As the movie progresses, I find myself adding more groups of people to the list above.<br/><br/>Now, yes, I know I can't help but take this silly movie a bit to heart, but, given the current political climate, I can't help but notice some not-particularly-subtle nationalism. I think the word ""insidious"" is probably the best way to describe it, and ""propaganda"" would not be inappropriate. Oh, but some say, it's based on a comic that was written prior to the events of today. I can't speak for the graphic novel, having never read it, but to separate this film from current events is nearly impossible. The mere presence of the phrase ""Freedom is not free"" is enough to turn the movie into something of a recruitment video, along with the decision to release this movie in 2006, when support for other Middle Eastern campaigns is faltering. Possibly the most questionable is the obvious numerous phobias that abound--the villains are foreign, of different races than our leather-Speedo-clad heroes, they wear jewelry and makeup, their war animals are ""exotic"" (elephants and rhinos), and the disfigured are continuously portrayed as evil, soulless and better off dead. Apparently, only the robustly beautiful and Caucasian are fit to be called valiant.<br/><br/>Political and social reasons aside, the movie was fairly predictable, with lots of manly yelling and glistening pectorals, ""surprise"" ambushes anyone in the audience can see a mile off, solemn intonations, and one very weird and uncomfortable blue-lit epic sex scene. The film retains its two final stars for the choreography (mildly entertaining, though not as original as I think the filmmakers hoped it to be) and some of the imagery (mostly CGI, not as good as Sin City's), and the surprisingly strong character of the Spartan queen, Gorgo (which, oddly enough, is also the name of a very cheesy English monster picture from the sixties. It was better than 300.), though that isn't to say the Gorgo character is a particularly enlightened portrayal. <br/><br/>So, if you see it, try to laugh and don't take it as seriously as it takes itself, but I don't think that's possible."
"EugeneandSasha","5","2","4","14 August 2007"," I Cant Believe So Many People Can't See Past the CGI
","300 is a very mediocre film that received so much praise and hype solely for its CGI. Yes the battle scenes use spectacular CGI and show off brutal video-game-like violence. The choreography wasn't so great because they relied on CGI and slow-motion sequences. Overall that is the only high point of the movie.<br/><br/>All the other aspects of the movie were average to bad. The plot was non-existent (all we see is a Persian come up and ask the Spartans to surrender, they get thrown into a never-ending pit, and a war starts with the Spartans and Persians). There is minor sub-plot or two but they are obvious time-fillers, since the filmmakers probably couldn't afford 2 hours of CGI filled battle scenes.<br/><br/>The acting/actors are pretty much mediocre nobodies. Gerald Butler (King Leonidas) tries to mimic great war heroes such as Maximus (Gladiator) and Wallace (Braveheart) and fails to achieve something remotely as good. As for character development there is basically none.<br/><br/>Overall this movie achieved a high rating because many people couldn't see past the CGI. Don't believe me? I can guarantee that this film will win no Oscars or even a mere nomination, just MTV awards, unlike many other Epic War Movies.<br/><br/>My Rating: 5.5/10"
"DarthVoorhees","9","2","4","3 August 2007"," A visual masterpiece
","300 is a damn near perfect film. If it weren't for it's somewhat lacking script it'd be a four star movie for sure. I feel conflicted reviewing this movie because I had a great time with it but it is extremely weak in the most crucial area of film, the script. I'm actually amazed 300 works so well because if the other aspects of the film hadn't been perfect 300 would fail.<br/><br/>300's strongest assests are the visuals and Gerald Butler. 300 is a beautiful film to look at. Cinemotographer Larry Fond should be a shoe in at this Oscars. The camera work here is absolutely outstanding. Zack Snyder is showing great potential as a director. His Dawn of the Dead remake was outstanding. Snyder works because he knows how to handle his gore. I find it great to say that Snyder adds substance to a man getting decapitated.<br/><br/>Butler deserves huge credit. Leonidas on paper is a clich√É¬© spewing hero but Butler makes this character interesting and compelling when he really shouldn't be. Butler makes the character and thus the movie work. His delivery of the lines is perfect, so perfect that we forget the lines are bad even for a lousy B movie writer.<br/><br/>300 is with all honesty the best popcorn film ever made."

","300 probably won't win any awards for depth, but it's a very strong, entertaining film. Whatever criteria you use to separate the genre Action Films from The Rest, use it, because you won't be deriving something incredibly meaningful, deep, or layered from 300. It reinforces the ideas of responsibility, honor, courage, in a very old-fashioned and perhaps anachronistic method which may have you in fits of either indignation or triumph... depending how highly you crave a movie that mythologizes a historical event into a pitched battle between good and evil.<br/><br/>Leonidas and his 300 Spartans combat the oncoming hordes of Persians who have been turned into, well, flesh-eating mutants. Actually there is a mix of barbarian, exotic cultures represented as weirdly painted, antler-donning lemmings that wilt under the mighty defence of the Spartans, but their inclusion is welcome. It serves to highlight that 300 is historical fiction as traditionally was done by the Greeks - truths intertwined with dramatic license, a method necessitated by the limited media available to ancient Greeks.<br/><br/>The Spartans go to war in very little armor. If this bothers you, don't be alarmed. You're not gay because you're watching underwear model physiques fighting. There are many more sports done by men that are a million times gayer. What is very pleasant however about the fighting is that the cuts are very few and far between, the editing preserves the integrity of the continuous fight, and it slows down so we can watch in glee as spears rend flesh, or shields smash jaws. To a hardcore action film fan, this is very important. You don't want your fight scenes edited by ADD-afflicted crackheads.<br/><br/>There's just enough sex to remind you what the demographic is, which I think is 18 to 36 year old males. The green screens, surprisingly don't interrupt the believability of the picture and don't stunt the excitement of the fighting.<br/><br/>The one thing that I do enjoy VERY much and is why I gave this movie such a high rating is that the film was adapted for the screen. Unlike Sin City, which comes from the same writer/director team if I'm not mistaken, 300 does not follow the comic word for word. Even though 300 the comic, with its mute protagonist and straightforward, undramatized historical perspective would be perfect just for that kind of film... the movie adds just enough dramatic license to make things interesting for people who've read Frank Miller's work, over and over and over. A good adaptation in its own right - one of the best to hit the screens yet."

","well I am not able to believe why this movie will be rated in top 250. The movie was a disaster and misinterepation of truth and history. If American society wants to see Persians as animals and people with no culture than it might have done a god job but sad to say the reality is far from what have been shown.<br/><br/>Persian empire was one of the most advance civilizations of that time and had culture influence over many barbarian hordes.Spartans were good but neither they were that good nor Persians that bad.<br/><br/>If you are making period movie and want to showcase the two cultures its important you connect to reality for serious movie..not a cartoon movie or joke like this one."

","300 is a great film. It is exciting, well produced, includes great and believable acting, great story, enough blood and guts to satisfy anyone....<br/><br/>BUT (there's always a but) its references to today really take away from the story and all of its great elements. Hearing ""freedom isn't free"" come out of the mouth of a Spartan is just NOT believable. Or what about freeing the world of tyranny? George Bush, you're thinking? No. Another Spartan soldier in 300. Or of course the enemy fighting for their god - ring a bell? I won't even get into the female character's role in a pre-feminist setting but with some obviously post-feminism ideals.<br/><br/>In the end, I still came out of 300 feeling like it was a good film. But I also felt like I had just seen some subliminal propaganda at the same time. Which is something really unfortunate. Rather than making a timeless war film, it turned into ""Iraq War & Terrorism -Except They're Persians Now."""
"alexx668","6","2","4","15 May 2007"," David faces Goliath, and loses, because the world is bad..
","I'll start by saying I didn't have high expectations of this. I had read the comic and it was mediocre. Frank Miller was a great comic creator in the 80s, but in decline ever since. Nevertheless this film adaptation of ""300"" is fairly decent, and a nice break from all the recent warrior borefests (""Troy"", ""Alexander"", ""Lord Of The Rings"").<br/><br/>There are good reasons for this. The heavily stylized direction gives the whole thing a distinct fairy-tale-y vibe. This is almost a cartoon, but in a good, atmospheric way. In truth there is very little to set it apart from the comic, but it works anyway.<br/><br/>Then there are the nice little touches to the plot. They play a secondary role but it's these that distinguish the film. The co-operation between the corrupted priests and politicians might be a stereotype, but still very powerful. Maybe cause it rings so true. Also the quest for perfection in ancient Sparta, but at the expense of the weak.<br/><br/>Then in perhaps the most memorable scene of the film, the traitor Efialtes is being promised undreamed of pleasures by the almost hermaphrodite-like Xerxes, surrounded by an orgy of deformed lesbians and alien rituals. For a mainstream film, this sequence is very daring.<br/><br/>But alas, we still have to go through endless battles (albeit shot in style, almost choreographed), boring demagogue about bravery and patriotism, and too much melodrama (check the scene where some soldier hands Leonidas' wife some medallion, and she in turn hands it predictably to her son). All garnished with the appropriate larger-than-life orchestral score.<br/><br/>But hey, it's watchable. Who would've thought."

Gerard Butler leads the 300 Spartans of legend as ""King Leonidas"" tasked with thwarting the ambitions of Xerxes, Emperor of Persia who is bent on a total invasion of Greece. The story is the stuff of ancient Greek myth - and this very, very heavily computer generated film is quite a difficult one to enjoy - the colours/shades are dark and ambiguous; the battle scenes suitably gory but equally fake and the script needed someone with better than A-level English to work on it. That said, it does benefit from that darkness and edginess - the characterisations combine honour and brutality in quite a plausible, if at times an almost alien fashion. If you know the legend upon which this is based, you will appreciate that this is a pretty ""loose"" adaptation of events at Thermopylae and certainly way too long; but worth a go - just about."

""Based"" is an inappropriate word, however, as scenes were specifically engineered to mirror the panels of the novel.

","This movie is a decent retelling of the battle at Thermopylae in 480 B.C. where King Leonidas and a force of 300 men fought a massive army of Persians in order to protect Greece. Director Zack Snyder for the most part gives audiences what they expect after seeing the trailer to this despite some flaws with character development and a somewhat slow beginning before the action kicks into high gear. 300 has just enough blood, brutal deaths, limps being chopped off like butter, and impressive special effects including legendary creatures and landscapes with a thunderous score by Tyler Bates which seems to fit the tone of the film. The cast are good in their roles including Gerard Butler who brings an intensity to his performance as King Leonidas, Leana Headey as his tough feisty wife Queen Gorgo, David Wenham as one of Leonidas' brave soldiers Dilios, and Dominic West as the devious corrupt traitor Theron. The rest of the cast are okay in their roles as well. The action which does really start to kick in until about 35-40 mins into the movie except for one or two brief action sequences in the beginning are well executed none the less. The special effects are definitely the highlight of the film and it helps bring to life this story about the 300 Spartans who sacrificed their lives for Greece. This movie seems to be told from the Spartans point of view because some of the creatures are a bit unrealistic but it worked adding some supernatural elements to the story that really did happen a long time ago. The slow-mo sex scene between Butler and Heady was steamy but it did feel a bit unnecessary but as a guy I'm not complaining that much. So overall despite some flaws 300 is a decent action adventure that delivers for the most part. If you're a fan of these type of movies than chances are you'll enjoy this one as well."

","Brought up to be a strong leader, King Leonidas (Butler) takes 300 Spartans into war against their rivals the Persians.<br/><br/>Based on Frank Miller's best selling novel and surrounding the war in Greece in 480 BC 300 thrives on glorious graphics, hard fought action sequences and a political plot that takes a while to set off but once established becomes exciting and any fan would and should be pleased by the combination of war and action.<br/><br/>Zack Snyder's picture is fast and flowing once the wars get going. The film begins with some muddled conformity to establish the central protagonist Leonidas. We see a young lad learning from his father and the lad, after a battle against a wolf, becomes the King of Sparta. OK so the character is established, moving on we see a Persian enter the village and demand water but based on this opening of a father telling him to stand his ground, Leonidas decides to introduce the man to the town's local black hole and soon we have ourselves facing a raging war prospect between Spartans and Persians.<br/><br/>After a muddled journey to the lake in which we see oracles, a surviving boy and a bizarrely directed war field the plot finally notches up a gear. War begins! And I not being too enthusiastic about the genre found myself entranced by some visually breathtaking action sequences as blood and bones fly across the screens for almost the whole remainder of the film. And whenever action is on the cards, Snyder does not disappoint. His slow down techniques makes Neo look foolish and the consistency juxtaposed with the action and effects almost slaughter fan winning hit Watchmen.<br/><br/>So 300 conforms to fans expectations and from research seems to have justified Frank Miller's graphic novel, so it seems perfect? Well not quite.<br/><br/>300 is visually stunning yes and the action sequences should satisfy any adrenaline junkie or war enthusiast to watch it over and over again. But beneath what we see, we feel an almost soap styled plot that mainly revolves around the King's wife. Lena Headey's Gorgo brings almost an over the top dramatic feel to the film. Her concerns over her family, her untrustworthy actions and general worries are out of place in a picture about politics and war, complete star driven waffle to conform to an unnecessary formula.<br/><br/>What is important to remember however is that 300 is completely diverse from many other war smashes. Though you may be inclined to switch off during the first half an hour it is important to hang on.

"LeroyBrown-2","7","0","0","1 February 2009"," Visually stunning and entertaining sword and sandal epic. Just don't expect the History Channel
","The sword and sandal genre has been around since the beginning of the motion picture. And why not you have incredible sources like the Bible, Mythology and, as in the case of ""300"", ancient History. The movie 300 is based on a historical event that took place in 480 B.C.E. when the mighty Persian empire was invading Greece and 300 Spartans fought them at the pass at Thermophylae. It's one of the greatest historical battles that should be told and had been before in 1961's ""The 300 Spartans"". That movie, which was made at the height of Hollywood's sword and sandal epics, benefited from the film technology of the era. It was shot in Technicolor and in Cinemascope, 300 benefits from CGI. No matter what the technology a film still depends on a good script.<br/><br/>I have to say outright that 300 is one of the most visually stunning movie I have ever seen. This is the kind of film I envisioned when I was reading about Greek Mythology in High school. To see a real historical event gets this treatment is something beyond my expectation. From the very first shot you know this is something you have never seen before and it just maintain this level throughout. It's like every frame was drawn by Boris Vallejo, it's a unique visual feast.<br/><br/>The main problem with this movie is the script. We never got a good background to the conflict between the Greeks and the Persians. We know the Persians wants to rule over the Spartans but why? We don't see the Spartans cooperating with the other Greek city states except when a token force from Athens show up to fight by their side. Hollywood movie treatment of historical events, unfortunately are incomplete and highly inaccurate and 300 is no exception once you get down to the bare bones of the script.<br/><br/>The other thing about the script is that it was written as to be recited not spoken. And the actors perform it as such. The dialog and the acting is stilted just as was the case with many of the sword and sandal epics from the 1950s and 60s. Gerard Butler's performance as King Leonidas was as expected, he gives one of those larger than life performance that Charlton Heston specialized in back in his epic days. The rest of the cast pretty much followed along the same line. The one exception was Lena Heady, who played Leonidas' wife. She gave her role a little more humanity than the others, but she really didn't have enough screen time to flesh the character out more.<br/><br/>All in all I would have to say that this movie is an entertaining and incredible visual feast but at the same time it's just another sword and sandal epic with a lot of short coming when it comes to background information and your typical stilted dialog and performance."

","I thought the movie was great. It bothered me to hear people talking about the movie being bad. Most of this seems to stem from people shouting about historical inaccuracies. I hope to clear up some of this misunderstanding. I feel that Frank Miller was drawing upon much of the writings of Herodutus. This film (and the comic book from which its based), draws on the ideas of propaganda to tell its tale.<br/><br/>The Ephors are portrayed as villains and what easier way to do this than to make them disfigured perverts. It is by this way that the audience can instantly be appalled by them and makes them all the more easier to hate.<br/><br/>The Generals of Xerxes are depicted as mutilated abominations which, again, gives the audience an easier time picking them visually/mentally as the bad guys.<br/><br/>Ephrailtes being the betrayer of the Spartans, is easier to hate when he is a hunchback. It also allows the plot to move smoothly as it explains his betrayal.<br/><br/>Xerxes deemed himself a god. What easier way to depict this than by making him 9 feet tall! <br/><br/>Many historians, especially those of the past, have been known for embellishing the facts to make the story more palatable. I honestly believe that is the case here. So, to sum, try not to think about the historical facts when viewing this film and just enjoy it for what it is, a well-told story."

","If you like lots of buff guys in very little clothing (and really, who doesn't?!) being extremely masculine in slow motion, then this is the movie for you. Also a super cool queen who gives as good as she gets and a storyteller who sets the groundwork so you understand the Spartan philosophy. Fantastic comic book violence (I got a little blood lust going) and no ""Hollywood"" ending. I was riveted and cheering on the Spartans even though we all knew how it was going to end. This is what movie making is all about. Sit back and enjoy a very watchable film and don't worry about whether it is historically accurate. It is the idea and essence of the real Spartans, made into an entertaining fantasy film. Brilliant stuff."
"berryj6","5","0","0","15 September 2008"," A stylish, gritty film that impresses the eye, but lacks the energy to pull it over the finish line
","300 is an epic story. Telling the tale of how 300 Spartan warriors fought 250,000 Persians, and lost, but also won in many ways. It was a story of honour and how each of the 300 men gave their blood and energy to protect their people. so, now Zack Synder is retelling the story, but this time, it's style over substance.<br/><br/>There is nothing wrong with style, it may be fickle, but it is one of the most powerful and compelling weapons in a director's arsenal. This is why in 300, the picture is bleak, the enemy are half-human half-monster, and the 300 Spartans have giant 6 packs drenched in oil. So, first and foremost, 300 is really a treat for women with a strong stomach. There is nothing wrong with this, the film flows well and has a fantasy element which is undeniably strong-willed. 300 is bold and is a film with some bite. But unfortunately, not even style can save 300 from being a bitter disappointment.<br/><br/>The fact is, 300 lacks energy. There are over 4 battles, each annoyingly similar; people in slow-mo, spearing various horrific creatures. I'm sorry, we're not 1999 where slow-mo could pass for entertainment (The Matrix). We're in an age where we expect inventive effects and set-ups, forcing upon the audience a variety of feelings and emotions. But during every battle scene in 300, with the exception of half of one, not even a nerve will tingle, your fists won't tighten, and you feel little emotion for the 300 homo-erotic men. The film feels like it was choreographed and directed by someone who played computer games for far too long and was level 100 on World of Warcraft. 300 wants to build up, climaxing for one strenuous battle after the next, but instead you get 2 hours of characterless men shouting. The Spartans have no honour in 300, they are loud posh french designers in a skin suit.The film has no tension, no character or shape. It relies wholly on style, grit, blood and dramatic effects shots. Not enough, sorry, not enough."

","OK. I see that a lot of people loved and loves 300 as i do. But when i look at it from the first view i saw a few thing that i don't like it. Everything was fine until the beginning of the battle. I like it the wall scenes when the Spartans start to kill as a chorus but when i saw the beginning of Leonidas killing spree i was disappointed. Why? Because even Leonidas starts to kill his enemies with his spear in beginning and with his sword in the end of the scene the blood was missing. I saw the blood explosions from the cuts but i've asked myself, Where falls that blood? Because i didn't see it on the ground. So. Can anyone tells me?. This was first. Next was, in the rhino scene. The second Persian it seems that he deliberately jumped in front of the rhino, to be killed and the third looks like, he is waiting the rhino. Why they are sitting there and are not running from there? Another bad detail. Not good. The same things i saw in the scene with Astinos and his friend. A lot of blood explosions from hands and legs and heads but nothing on the floor. A lot of blood. Where falls? So. This is what i saw at 300: Strong in general but weak at details. Who made it?"

","I remember seeing the teaser for this and got VERY excited! As a fan of graphic novels, this was a chance to transfer Frank Miller's genius to the big screen. And they didn't let us down. The graphics are superb. The fighting is brilliantly choreographed. The actors have (embarrassingly for those of us with more rounded stomachs) clearly worked hard to look the part. The deformed character who betrays them seems a little out of place. It did make me think ""they're trying to have their own version of Gollum"", but ultimately worked within the story. It's a shame that the legacy of this fine film is now tainted by the abysmal ""Meet the Spartans."

","This is not meant to be a textbook re-enactment of the Battle of Thermopylae but in all the main actions of the historical event it is actually accurate. What is interesting about the film is that it goes underneath the facts and creates a fascinating, atmospheric and claustrophobic narrative. It is a visually stunning, stylised piece of cinema. So why the vociferous critics? Well, for one thing the Spartans appeared to have forgotten their body armour and are fighting only with helmet, shield, spear and .. what appear to be loincloths. And Xerxes is portrayed as a sadistic S&M type. The style of the Spartan dress, or should I say undress, is lifted straight from ancient Greek art and while Xerxes was certainly no S&M club fan, as far as we know, his cruelty was legendary. What the film has achieved is to represent with such style the spirit of Thermopylae as well as that of the Spartans and their legendary status in the ancient world. The Persian army is, admittedly, an OTT portrayal yet, somehow works in this context. <br/><br/>This film is about feel, emotion and spirit. It is refreshing to see the cinema approaching history with the innovative eye one sees more often in the theatre. The actors all deliver good performances within the constraints of the film's style. I know that it may all sound rather weird but it works. If you want to compare this approach with a straight, earnest alternative then Hollywood made a version in the early 1960s. For me it doesn't compare with this vibrant interpretation."

","I happened to attend a history lecture (as a peer; not a student) on the day the professor was discussing this battle. He had mentioned the movie didn't exactly parallel the actual, historical battle, but I figured that's par for the course - especially when you're talking about a battle that took place this far back in history.<br/><br/>About halfway through the movie, I realized that the movie not only failed to parallel the historic battle, it wasn't even trying. I understand the movie is based more off of Frank Miller's comic book than an actual historical event, but there could have been a little substance to the movie outside of the action. Miller's ""Sin City"" at least had the appearance of a few story lines. The same cannot be said for 300.<br/><br/>That said, 300 is visually engaging and has enough effects to provide on-the-surface entertainment.

"shortyrags","5","0","0","21 July 2008"," The 300 Blows!
","I won't start out this review by borrowing one of the terrible one-liners from 300, a film based upon the graphic novel of the same name by Frank Miller. The film depicts the courageous efforts of King Leonidas and his 300 men at the Battle of Thermopylae as they attempt to halt the immense armies of the Persians. Sounds pretty good on paper and knowing it was based on Frank Miller's novel, I came in excited. I came out of the theater greatly disappointed and slightly angry. The film is of course, historically speaking, fairly inaccurate but it wasn't something I really minded. I did mind the multitude of corny and cheesy sequences and the horrible acting from Gerald Butler as King Leonidas. But the complaints just start there.<br/><br/>The film centers upon the events leading up to Battle of Thermopylae and the eventual stand-off itself. The battle sequences are actually well choreographed and highly stylized. The battles are rough and gritty, with some interesting slowdowns and speedups, and they add a little bit more to the otherwise bland, stale and predictable characters. The story is predictable and otherwise nonexistent when most of the time is spent with the Spartans yelling war cries. There are some plot holes that were particularly annoying and made it feel as if the writers had just gotten lazy or something. It didn't do justice to the novel. Moreover, I felt as if the film had been geared to a younger audience, with all of its blood and sophomoric speeches and grunts. Some of the scenes were honestly just painstaking to watch but the filmmakers obviously felt that a younger crowd might like that a little more.<br/><br/>The acting is just plain terrible. Prior to seeing the film, I was content that the cast was made up of relatively unknown actors. Well I wish that these guys would have learned to act as much as they learned to get buff. The characters created by the writers are already so dimwitted and indistinctive from one another; coupled with the acting, the film again suffers heavily. The score is forgettable and if anything, makes the battle sequences slightly better. The film, with its ghastly story and acting, offers little in substance and really ends up only having its artistic style to its name. <br/><br/>The film was undoubtedly geared toward a younger audience and consequently dumbed down. I wish they wouldn't have done that. The film could have still had its great aesthetic, graphic design without being cheesy and boring. The story, whatever there was of it, was boring and incoherent. The writers made the characters yelling and bumbling idiots, and the actors didn't do anything to improve them. This film could have been so much more, so much better. I am severely disappointed that such a great concept was handled so wrongfully and with no presumable intelligence. But as the French would say, Les Trent Cent Coups!"
"dave_wlogan","7","0","0","20 July 2008"," An epic but not quite Gladiator
","This movie is entertaining but not enlightening. It carries the weak themes of glory and duty and has a very simple plot line. To be fair to the movie it has subplots but it never really has anything deep. The characters are almost satirically muscular yet the film is meant to be a very serious one. The societies which the film glorifies are horribly flawed. Children are taught to use violence as a means of getting something they want and dieing in battle is the ultimate glory they can achieve. However the adults are never shown to use violence without reason which is completely contradictory of what we are told the society is like at the beginning of the film. The over the top violent people are the Persians and especially the antagonist Xerses. The Persians were a much more developed society than the Spartans which means the film is historically inaccurate as well as contradicting itself. However all these flaws are made up for with the John woo esquire battle scenes (instead of bullet time its spear time) and the epic like dialogue, like ""Tonight we dine in Hell!"" Many have called this a shallow film, which is as unfair to the director as it is fair. The Spartan society was a shallow society and to portray them as your average Joe wouldn't do them credit. But that being said Zack Snyder could have gone to more of an effort to demonise them.<br/><br/>The cast is as good as you can expect from this movie, just above mediocre. Butler and co. didn't seem to give their best performances ever but the acting isn't totally crap either. The CG effects are pretty good and combined with the action make for a worth while watch."

","The translation of graphic novel to film is a difficult one. The task is made all the more difficult when dealing with some of Frank Miller's less challenging works, of which 300 is one. Let's face it; Shakespeare it ain't. The original work was more about Lynn Varley's art than it was Miller's dialog, anyway, and that's what this film is about as well. Watch it, marvel at it's beauty and it's inventiveness, but don't try and delve too deeply into character studies because you will only be met with frustration and disappointment. Zack Snyder has crafted, essentially, a two-hour music video of which Leonidas and his followers happen to star. That's not a bad thing, entirely. Miller and Varley's original vision splashes to life on-screen in stunning display, with all the gore, monsters and mayhem that have become paramount to Frank Miller's stories. The only reason I walked away disappointed was because these characters had no subtext to them. I connected to them on the most visceral level. Watching soldiers die elicits the same response as watching an antelope be devoured by a lion on Wild Kingdom. It's tragedy without context, and while it's wonderful to look at, it leaves a lot more to be desired for the other senses."

","OK i don't actually bother to review movies that much on here. But after reading through some of these comments i feel i have to. As some people have stated, this movie will probably not be for everyone...but i'd say thats the case for most movies.<br/><br/>Ignore all the comments you may read about political agendas and viewpoints, racism and other nonsense from some of the reviews and remember that this film is based off a comic written before Bush came to power and before the recent war in Iraq! Yes the Spartans are portrayed as mighty warriors, all muscle and brawn...but thats how the comic showed them. Yes the Persians are portrayed as decadent, monstrous and well, plain evil...but thats what they were like in the comic. It's not some hidden racist views, just the bad guys of the movie been made to look bad! Or if you will, it's how the Spartans describe them in the retelling of the story, whichever you prefer.<br/><br/>And please don't get lost in the many comments about historical facts....it's based on a comic, which itself is only ""based"" on the event. Sure the Spartans weren't the only Greeks present, but they were the only ones, along with 700 Thespians that stayed to the end to die. And as for people complaining about blacks and Asians being present in the Persian army...do they have any idea how many different countries contributed soldiers to the Persian army??? Apparently not.<br/><br/>So on to the only things you SHOULD consider about this movie. The first thing is..are you interested in a graphic novel on the big screen??? If not, then don't bother!!! You won't get much depth, or character development, in this one at least. <br/><br/>The movie looks absolutely gorgeous, im my opinion, and matches very well with the comic. All the negative comments about the overuse of certain colours...you guessed it, it's the comics fault. The film has been created, to my mind, so that every scene feels like art from a comic!<br/><br/>The dialogue and acting?? The acting is good, and Gerald Butler portrays King Leonidas great and accurate, again to the comic version. The dialogue is minimal and banterish (i think i made that word up) but doesn't detract from the movie. And they use many of the well know sayings that came from this battle! (I can't believe someone talked about historical accuracy but then continued to slag the ""Spartans! Enjoy your breakfast, for tonight we dine in hell"" line).<br/><br/>What it all boils down to is this...THIS IS A MOVIE VERSION OF A GRAPHIC NOVEL...the novel has very little speech, it's about visuals and is being narrated. If you can suspend your belief, lock away your vast historical knowledge, and just watch this for what it is you will enjoy it. It's a film about one event, with a fictional side story. It's a film about one battle with slow motion bits in it, though different from most slow motion scenes. And thats it...nothing else to it...it's entertainment.<br/><br/>If none of this appeals to you, if you need your films to have some deep meaning, or you need all your films to run along some pretentious idea then don't watch it. Other wise enjoy a great, fun, exciting movie."

","300 is based on the graphic novel by Frank Miller about the Battle of Thermopylae. It is not a factual account but I like to think of it as the fun fantasy version of the battle.<br/><br/>The film is about a great act of bravery, about soldiers knowing that they were going to die in the battle, no matter what happened.<br/><br/>The plot of the film is that the Persian Empire is looking to expand and looks toward Greece to do this. The Greek states, including Sparta and Athens refuse to do this and prepare for war. Unforuately for the Spartans they can go to work without the Oracle's say so and the priests who control her were being bride by the Persians. King Leonidas (Gerald Butler) does the only think he can do and do to war with his personal bodyguard of 300 soldiers. On the way they join up with other Greek troops and go off to battle, seeing the atrocities of the Persian army on the way. At the time there is politicking going on in Sparta to try and get the whole army involved in the war. One factor is led up Queen Gorgo (Lena Headey) who is trying to convict the Sparta council to back the King, whilst the evil Theron (Dominic Wood) said that Leonidas is breaking the law and should be tried for treason. Theron is also bribed by the Persians.<br/><br/>What makes this film great is the visuals. The battle scenes were really well done and Zack Synder shows that he is a good visual director. The film was done in a sightly washed off look (similer to Letters of Iwo Jima) and shot in the same style as Sin City (Frank Miller also wrote those graphic novels). The film goes to extremes, it is violence and it shows monsters in the battle such as giants, rhinos, elephants and deformed men in the elite part of the Persian army (the Immoratals). The film also has some great ready made one liners like 'This is Sparta' and 'This will not be over quickly, you will not enjoy this, I am not your king'. Some critics have criticised the film for it being a right-wing fantasy and look for political meanings, some have criticised the actor but I think it is fine, it was heavily criticised by the Iranian government and for having a homo-erotic context (a fun part of the Times review was that it makes no attempt to hide its homo-erotic content).<br/><br/>It is a cross between Sin City, Gladitor and Lord of the Rings. I say sit back and enjoy the ride."

"alesmadro","6","0","0","7 March 2008"," Story, not history
","This movie is not about a historical fact, rather about a mythological version of it. There is no real historical accuracy in the depicting of persons or actual events. It is a piece of story-, not history-telling. Miller (who wrote the graphic novel the movie is based on and co-produced the movie itself) offers a personal version of a story which has already been told many times. He doesn't claim that his version is truer, on the contrary: he claims often in interviews that he's no realist. Furthermore, the story is told through the words of a Spartian soldier, who obviously is working on the myth of Leonidas and the 300 in order to move Greece to combat against the Persians. It is not only a subjective tale; it is an instrumental, manipulated and manipulative propaganda tale basing on a real heroic deed. For this reason, do not look for historical truth in this movie: you would rather find lot of factual errors (the ephors weren't a caste of inbred priests but elected magistrates who remained in charge for one year and gave the kings their advice; the oracle was in Delphi, not in Sparta; it gave a different advice as the one in the movie; etc.), even if the depiction of the education of the Spartan youth is quite reasonable. But, again, this movie is NOT about history, it is story-telling. There is a large use of computer generated special effects. This gives to it an artificial character and makes it look like a cartoon or an anime (being based on a graphic novel, this should cause no wonder). The lights are never natural, the landscape is obviously computer generated, the fight scenes are real (according to the producers), but largely enhanced. They are quite stylish and well choreographed: the Spartians move graciously through the enemy lines killing with elegant movements which resemble a dance. Again: this embellishment is typical of myth, not of a realistic depiction of actual events. As for the ""political"" debate: is this movie an apology for the Iraqi war? Did the director and the producers want to draw a parallel between Leonidas and Bush? If you really are interested in this question (but you don't have to in order to enjoy or to dislike the movie), you should consider at least the following things: 1) Miller wrote the graphic novel in 1998, well before the Bush presidency; furthermore, he claims that he has been fascinated by Leonidas since he was a boy. 2) On the other side, the decision of making a movie out of 300 came in a specific historical moment, with the US being criticized for breaking international law in order to wage war to a middle-eastern tyrant and with Bush being considered by large masses around the world to be a blood-thirsty fanatical. Some of the dialogs in the movie could be applied to this situation, with the Spartian council in the blocking position of the UN and the ephors in that of the Security Council. Leonidas is accused of having provoked Xerxes to war and to wage war against the law, but he claims to be acting to secure freedom (an ""enduring freedom""?). His fiercest political rival, Theron, is of course a traitor (and so were considered by the White House, Fox etc. those in the US who opposed the war). Xerxes is depicted as a heartless tyrant with a rather psychopathic personality, who punishes cruelly his general (does this remind you of some recent middle-eastern tyrant?). The Persians do not look like the real Persians did, but like present-day Middle-Easterners, that is: like Arabs (of course, the good guys are white, while the bad guys are brown, as in many other Hollywood movies). The Spartans' allies, the Archadian, have ""good will"" but follow Leonidas only half-hearted and eventually prefer to leave (precisely like most ""allies"" of the US in the invasion of Iraq). Leonidas claims often that Spartans are fighting for freedom and reason against tyranny and ¬ñ at one moment ¬ñ against mysticism (consider the typical arguments of neo-cons about Islam and its allegedly fanatic character). There is even an allusion to a ""crush of cultures"" √† la Huntington (and if you want to be a little bit paranoid, the final scene of the dead Leonidas in the same position as Christ on the cross is somehow disturbing). It is quite implausible that the producers and the director were not aware of such parallels. On the other side, Leonidas dies at the head of his soldiers, while most ""hawks"" in Washington revealed themselves to be ""chickens"". Furthermore he dies facing the most powerful army of the world leaded by someone who believes to be a god and has imperialistic plans. The USA are at present considered an imperialistic nation in most countries, they have the most powerful army of the world, and their commander-in-chief does not believe to be a god, but claims that he speaks to God and vice versa. So, one could even reverse the political reading I quoted above. All this shows how tricky any political interpretation of a work of fiction can be, particularly when it handles with a myth (a few brave men fighting for freedom against an apparently invincible enemy who wants to enslave them). Watch this movie, if you are looking for action, fighting and blood galore: it won't offer you much more than this, but it'll do this in a quite convincing manner."

May, some people don't like my comment but for me its 100 percent right, because what media show us is what gets into our mind and in the same way we react and the same we become. I know reality must be shown but can also be shown in a bit less violent manner. That's what I think."

","I was deeply interested in the Battle of Thermopylae long before this movie came out. History itself lends for one of the greatest stories of human courage in the face of overwhelming odds that I know of. 300 Spartans along with 700 Helots held the massive Persian army at the pass of Thermopylae for three days while the rest of Greece was able to master their forces. They could have possibly held the pass indefinitely if it were not for a local named Ephialtes who thought he could gain a profit by leading the Persians behind the Spartan lines.<br/><br/>Despite being outnumbered by more than a hundred to one by even the most conservative accounts the Spartans refused to back down and fought to the last man, taking a rather disproportionate number of Persian soldiers with them.<br/><br/>That is the Battle of Thermopylae in a nutshell. For the most part this story transfers to the big screen in what I now regard to be the best epic battle sequences in cinema. However well the fights are choreographed though, there are some historical inaccuracies that are sure to annoy the history buffs; <br/><br/>1. I am pretty sure that the Spartan hoplites fought in more than just their helmets, bracers, groves and Speedos. No soldier fighting in a battle where stabbing and slashing weapons were used would have been so dressed.<br/><br/>2. One scene showed the Persians using makeshift pottery grenades when gunpowder would not have been discovered for almost another thousand years.<br/><br/>3. No nation in history used rhinos as beasts of war.<br/><br/>4. The many bizarre ogre like Persian elite soldiers almost put this movie into the realm of fantasy. Yes, I know that's how they looked in the comics but come on! <br/><br/>One of the subplots that I particularly dislike, and one that is actually central to the movie, is that of Leonidas's wife Gorgo (unnamed in the movie) trying to rally support for her husband while a traitorous politician tries to thwart her. That made sense from a dramatic standpoint but was the single greatest event in the movie that never actually happened.<br/><br/>A particularly enjoyable part of the movie is having events narrated by David Wenhem. He has a way of theatric narration that catches your attention and the final narration he gives at the end is one of the greatest speeches ever given in cinema.<br/><br/>My one final lasting puzzlement is all the arguing over the directors portrayal of history as well as undertones of racism. It's a movie for *obscenity* sake! While this movie was clearly not meant to be a history lesson it was meant to be entertaining and does so quite well. And as for the bizarre conspiracies of inciting Americans against the middle east I'll believe that when I see it. While this move was not meant to inspire racism in its viewers it certainly does inspire a sense of valiance, patriotism, courage and honor that was a trademark of the Spartan culture but severely lacking today.<br/><br/>I gave this move a seven out of ten. I loved the styling and artistic look of the movie. It looked excellent and was solidly entertaining. I also didn't like some of the major historical inaccuracies as well as the unnecessary nudity. This movie would have gotten a nine if not for that."

","I actually didn't expect to like this movie after seeing the previews. Most previews take the best part of movies and leave a lot of flatness. This one was vice versa. The previews give an indication of the fallacies of this movie. The director tried to emulate Japanese classics too much. The easy flowing ballet like movements make the battle scenes too comical. It may work in a one on one confrontation when you're dealing with characters who are personifications instead of real people (as in THE FOUR ASSASSINS), but it is ridiculous when dealing with historical people. As far as historical accuracy, literary leeway is always given, and this film deviates as much as any film. First, the Persians in the movie were depicted as Africans. Persians (Iranians) were not black. This was probably done because the director wanted to cast certain people. Also, Xerxes was not eleven feet tall, and rhinos were not bigger than train cars. This, again, is bad film directing. Apparently, the director wants to give the impression that the Spartans saw them this way, but it really doesn't fit into the Spartan character. Another fallacy is the deformed character. The film tries to indicate that the Spartans practiced good science in knowing when a baby would grow up weak. They had no such science, and the odds of a baby being left alone to die, still surviving, and yet being weaker than the Spartans was frankly impossible. That said, the film was better than I anticipated. The characters were fairly likable and as complex as characters of that age could be. Xerxes was depicted as a rather likable despot, one who didn't have the modern day sadistic side that any other movie maker would have given him, but wouldn't have fit in an ancient world that never heard of sadism. I didn't care for the narration part, but it didn't really alter my rating. In fact, disregard most of the critiques. Many of them praise the wrong thing. The film lacked artistry and had bad action scenes, but the dramatics and characters were well defined."

","300 **<br/><br/>The movie starts off with a young Leonidus as a child preparing for manhood. The scene where the young boy fights a wolf is very magnificent. The next scene, we see an adult Leonidus preparing his son for manhood as the Persions try to overtake their land as well as many others. This sets the scene for 300.<br/><br/>300 was directed by Zack Snyder who made the terrifying remake of Dawn of the Dead and the the movie is based on the graphic novel by Frank Miller who also wrote the brilliant Sin City. Sin City had great special effects and a great story. 300 also has great special effects but the story is incredible weak. I sadly have to say it's one of the many, many, many cases where the visual effects start taking over the story.<br/><br/>It's not just the incredible visual effects that flaw the movie. The B story is boring and clich√©d. Queen Gorgo tries to convince the counsel to send more soldiers for the aid of her husband, King Leonidus. However Theron has is own agenda. Personally, I don't understand what this has anything to do with the story, it just slows the movie down. My only guess is that Lena Headey and Dominic West needed more screen time. Plus, if you've seen any movie that takes place during the Roman and/or Greek times, then it doesn't take a genius to figure out that Theron has betrayed his own people. Last but not least, I think that Gerald Butler really overacted his part as King Leonidus.<br/><br/>Even thought 300 looks more like a video game, it's still more realistic than Troy and Alexander and there are some things to enjoy here. For instance, this movie has the most gorgeous decapitation scene, but there are more decapitation scenes to follow so it doesn't really make it that fascinating. 300 is visually stunning but the story falls flat on it's face."

","King Leonidas: The world will know that free men stood against a tyrant, that few stood against many, and that before this battle is over, even a god-king can bleed.<br/><br/>300, adapted from Frank Miller's graphic novel, is best described as a visual orgasm. This may seem like a weird description, but trust me, it fits this film perfectly. '300' is one of the most visually stunning and innovative motion pictures to come along in years. The thing that makes this film actually work isn't the acting, directing or writing, but the cinematography. I've never before seen this style of film-making, and maybe that's why '300' left such an impression on me. Like an orgasm, the film takes you on a wild and unpredictably riveting romp, and one way or another, it's over far too quick.<br/><br/>'300' tells the story of the 300 Spartan soldiers who faced and army of millions of Persian soldiers, and held their own. Sure, every single one of them perished, but they took as many Persians with them to hell as they could. That's pretty much all the story there is in this movie. Zack Synder's directing here is as solid as it was for 2004's Dawn of the Dead, and perhaps even better. Synder doesn't deserve an Oscar Nomination for his work exactly, but it does gain my respect for him as an up and coming filmmaker. The acting is good as well, with no one turning in a disappointing performance. No one really turns in a ""fantastic"" performance either, because '300' isn't really concerned with it's characters as it is telling the tall tale of the 300 Spartans. I guess you could point at Gerard Butler who plays King Leonidas as giving a very good performance, as well as Dominic West (whom you probably don't know as Detective Jimmy McNulty from one of the best shows on television, 'The Wire') in a kind of slime-ball role. They both give good performances, but again, nothing to shout from the hilltops in joy over.<br/><br/>I honestly only have two complaints about the film. Number one, what was with all the monsters? Yeah, I thought the monsters were cool -- but were they really needed? The film had enough excitement without a fat giant with razors for arms decapitating Persian soldiers. They could just explain them as 'mutated freaks', but that wouldn't make sense. There is no possible way someone could be born with razors for arms -- even if their mother f__ked a shaving kit, THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE! I'm not saying the mutants were bad, they just seemed a tad unnecessary. The second complaint is the real complaint however. The only thing that sucked about '300' was the screenplay. Rittled with clich√© lines and cheesy delivery, the characters dialog was very unrealistic. There was one scene in particular that caused me to roll my eyes in embarrassment. Two young Spartans are fighting Persians and one makes a cheeky joke to the other one about covering his back. That's funny, I seem to remember paying money to see '300', not f__king 'Rush Hour'. After that I was half-expecting Chris Tucker to come out in a toga with a spear with his whiny voice exclaiming, ""Muthaf__ka, you know I don't wanna be f__king with no godd__n motherf__king mutant Persians and sh__t! Goddamn, you crazy! Sheeet!."" But thankfully, that never happened.<br/><br/>All in all, despite a few flaws I mentioned, there isn't really a reason to dislike '300' -- unless you hate screen violence. It's a fast-paced, exciting, action-packed adrenaline rush that kept me glued to the screen the entire 110 minute runtime. Needless to say I was really wound up and hyper when the film ended, and had to run around Desert Ridge slicing up random people with a sword while shouting unintelligible babble in mock-Greek in order to calm myself down.

"bloodweiser1","8","0","0","22 October 2007"," Not Taxing but Definitely Pleasing.
","OK, firstly I consider myself pretty hard to please when it comes to action movies. The normal case is that there is no intricate plot, great acting or taxing brain-work required. And then, half the time, the action is something we've all seen before and isn't really up to much. Action movies tend to be a watch and throwaway genre in my household. That said, although 300 fits the first couple of criteria, it's definitely a movie worth watching again and it's also not your typical action movie - it is ""pure"" action. By that I mean everything (and I do mean everything) else is secondary. Visually, this is one of the best movies you can see at the present time. Whether it stands the test of that time as technology moves on is another matter, but for what it's worth at the moment, there isn't a lot out there that can touch it. And that's what 300 basically is - it's a visual roller-coaster. It offers a feast for the eyes that outweighs all of the negatives that you can throw at it. People may complain that it's historically inaccurate, racist, badly acted or homo-erotic but one can answer those points without even going into great depth with two words - So What?!!!<br/><br/>But if like me, you do need a little more detail, let's address those points one by one. Historically, I'm ambiguous. The movie doesn't do a great job with factual evidence, but it also doesn't do that bad a job either. It is based on an event that occurred thousands of years ago and, although it does take liberties (which movie based on history doesn't) it's overall theme is true to the point - some of the really corny lines were actually said by the real Spartans!! With a movie such as 300, you are never going to get 100% historical accuracy as it just wouldn't sit right, but to those who say that the Spartans weren't fighting for liberty? Wrong!!! Although they weren't a particularly liberal society, they were under no illusion that Sparta would merely become a Persian satrap if Greece fell.<br/><br/>So is it racist? Well the first thing to recognise here is that this movie isn't about Christians versus Muslims, Europeans versus Asians or even Iranians versus Yanks for that matter. When Thermopylae took place, none of the above existed. I've seen people here saying that this movie is insulting to Iranians? How so if Iran didn't even exist back then and isn't even mentioned in the movie? There is such a huge difference between the country of Iran and the empire of Persia that the two can only be compared with a very tenuous geographical link. To say that the movie insults one country or another is akin to saying that Ben Hur is an insult to all Italians because it shows Roman oppression. Absolutely ridiculous. So some of the Persians are portrayed as demon-type figures - in most war movies, we have to pick sides and the enemy is never an Adonis. But in saying that, we've already decided that these aren't the historically accurate Spartans or Persians so does it really matter??!!!<br/><br/>Badly acted? Well, I'd disagree with this. The actors ARE given corny lines (some historically accurate as I've pointed out) but in general, they do carry them off OK. Having a script that doesn't meet expectations is not the same as giving a poor impression of a character.<br/><br/>Which brings us onto homo-erotic (ooer!!). Well, when you get a bunch of semi-naked men cavorting around your movie screen, someone is always going to level that accusation. In fact, homosexuality was almost certainly an accepted part of Spartan culture. If the director (or the comic book writer) truly wanted a ""gay movie"", they would only have had to appease some of the historical buffs and portray real Spartan life. They didn't do this, so really, the levels of homo-eroticism aren't really with any solid ground. That said, who cares? I'm heterosexual, but it doesn't mean to say that I can't admire an actor's biceps or 6 pack!!<br/><br/>But as I said at the beginning - So What? These criticisms are made by people who don't seem to get what this movie is about. There's no point arguing about the type of sword the real Spartans used, whether or not the bad guys are an insult to a modern-day nation or whether the actors should get a job in ""Hamlet"". 300 isn't about that. 300 is what all action movies aspire to be and it succeeds admirably. It's about tearing out your eyeballs as you look frantically at the eye-candy all over the screen. It's about making you gasp in awe at what technology can do. It's about making you wonder what feast your eyes will get to feed on next - making you impatient for it's next scene and then rewarding you with another treat. Go watch it for that alone. It's worth it."
"johnnyboyz","7","0","0","20 October 2007"," Not so much an historical epic as one long, flashy fight scene with just everything thrown into the mix.
","300 is a film that is so full of so many things that it burns the eyes to watch it and burns the mind to recall them all. The film is an adaptation of a graphic novel that depicted a true event and is also a remake of a 1960s film about the same thing; this is enough evidence from the outset to suggest 300 is going to borrow, recycle, update and generally make a nuisance of everything we think we know about the subject.<br/><br/>The film plays out, in the long run, like a multi-million dollar financed Rugby match between two sides that are allowed to include swords, shields, arrows, spears and.........elephants. The opposition are even allowed to call upon some help from some seemingly un-dead friends to aid the cause, perhaps ideas for monsters that were rejected from director Zach Snyder's first film Dawn of the Dead at risk of it becoming too much like Resident Evil and not enough like its 1978 original. The reason I say 300 burns the eyes and the mind is that it puts so much on screen in the form of actual content and visuals but also makes room for undertones, undercurrents and thus creates a massive boiling pot of genre fusion, computer generated imagery and enough cinematography to get even the most harshest of CGI critics raising an eyebrow in either awe or appreciation.<br/><br/>I don't think 300 is a film you watch for its plot. There have been many historical epics over the last few years depicting true events from centuries gone by such as Braveheart, Apocalypto and Gladiator and all of them have at their core, a story which is either heart whelming or engaging to the audience; in 300, the things we engage with the most are the battle scenes and amazing visuals we are treated to. The film tries to get us to focus on the king, his queen and their love for one another but we don't really care much about that, likewise the film tries to open up a little twist about twenty minutes to the end regarding a rouge in the kingdom and his accusations of the queen's faith or whatever but again, we don't care. Unlike the three examples I gave; 300 plays around with the setting of the film, it toys with the 'look' every film has thus contains issues of spectatorship and plagiarises (sorry, 'references') Henry V in its closing monologue and Gladiator with its shots of fields and heather, again at the end.<br/><br/>What sticks out in 300 doesn't make it a bad film more so a funny one without actually meaning to be which to some, is bad. The scene in which the 300 Spartans are lining up before any of the battle scenes and are being inspected by King Leonidas (Butler) contains strong undertones of homosexuality as captains and troops 'look' at one another; raising eyebrows and faintly smiling. There is also the issue that even when they are at home, in their village, the males still walk around bare-chested with their muscles bulging in an attempt to perhaps come across 'better equipped' than anyone else. This sort of content is the exact opposite to Laura Mulvey's argument that women are the object of the gaze since the females in this film are pretty well clothed in comparison. I also couldn't help but notice all the constant references to sadomasochistic clothing. At some point in the film; people are seen wearing leather straps around them, a group of servants are whipped, another group of servants have to kneel down as Xerxes (Santoro) walks all over them and uses them as steps; Xerxes himself is covered in chains and piercings and an entire wave of enemy troops are actually wearing masks during the battle (surely they would've struck more fear into the Spartans had they been barefaced). Like I said, this doesn't make 300 a bad film so much as it does make it interesting to read into.<br/><br/>Despite its suspension of reality in the form of mostly mutants and not humans being the bad guys, the fight scenes are still impressive and remain whatever anyone says the reason you're going to watch the film. The inclusion of dinosaurs and ninjas begs the question when the film was set but in my opinion, you can suspend belief if you figure it's set in an alternate reality of some sort although elements of science fiction was the last thing I expected to be in 300. However whatever I did expect to be there was there and it was good for what it was."

","My take: A triumph in visual style over substance. <br/><br/>Historical epics have been taken seriously with latest blockbuster hits like TROY and KINGDOM OF HEAVEN. It's just about time that Hollywood make their own material out of it. Thus, 300 is born. Matched with Frank Miller's gut-wrenching dark epic and Zack Snyder's violent touches, 300 is exactly as what pop-entertainment is when combined with history. The movie is too silly to be a film to watch during history class, yet, watching it as a pop-entertainment flick, it works in its own ways. It's a big-budget, violent and sometimes silly epic, which works as a blood-drugged eye candy.<br/><br/>The film is supposed to portray the events involving the Spartans, lead by King Leonidas (played by Gerald Butler), against the invading Persians. But, the film has a lot of over-the-top action sequences and bizarre creatures, I doubt that this i very far from what actually happened. But still, Hollywood tends to do a lot of alternations, even when it comes to reality. The film is simply fantasy, which is a good thing, because many epic movie viewers are crazy for this kind of films because we are introduced to a lot of elaborate battles, strange creatures, vivid-named (and described) characters and many other things.<br/><br/>300 offers all those things. Even if I found some of the battle sequences ridiculous, they are still very interesting to watch simply as ""Oh! It only happens in the movies"" kind of fun. The characters aren't much exercised, but the performances by the actors playing these characters are pretty good. The best thing, though, and probably the most interesting thing about this film is its resemblance to the graphic novels by Frank Miller. Indeed, it's over-the-top (perhaps way too), but this is exactly how it was envisioned in Miller's story, and Snyder, a specialist of this thing (after making the remake of DAWN OF THE DEAD), does it terrifically, giving it also an excellent video game-like experience.<br/><br/>It may be far from being the best film of its year, but it was definitely a good one. A big-budget epic that knows exactly what to give the audience.<br/><br/>Rating: *** out of 5."

","Most of my friends went to see this movie (much to my amazement) and I must say that my first preview impressions were rather flat- like come on, how many movies have there been with war, fighting, ancient soldiers, (Troy, the Gladiator) etc etc.... too many. But still, I went to see it on a cheap night and OH MY GOD was it ever good! First of all, I don't know why anyone would not like this movie: if you are a girl you get to watch all these Spartans prancing around flexing their perfect abs and thighs (wearing practically nothing) and get this: among all of their tradition and military-oriented way of life they actually treat their women with respect! Of course if you are a guy you get to see the Spartan war-machines in all their glory and might- and they don't fight to conquer or enslave= they just protect what's theirs. Now, Hollywood will embellish the story a liiiiiittle tiny bit (and add some super villains and monsters and special effects) but still, the account of their way of life and history was quite legit. But the best part of the movie is not the dialogue or perplexed storyline but the cinematography and the visuals! SO awesome and shot to perfection! At times unrealistic, but hey the emotion and acting was real (which is all that matters) and it is a movie after all.<br/><br/>I won't go too much into what it is about- let's just say that the Persians are coming and the Spartan King Leonidas must decide to stand up for his people and disobey the corrupt priests and out-dated tradition. The prophecy says if the army goes to war the King dies and if they don't clearly the Persians will enslave them and the cities will burn. Hmmm what the King decides is no brainer, but it's not the outcome that really matters but their passion and the road to their glory!"

","""300"" follows a format that resembles the Mel Gibson formula for historical films: Take historical events, adapt them so that one character that represents the fight for freedom against tyranny and hence is compelled to fight in large scale battles. Unfortunately, ""300"" is not as engaging as ""Braveheart"" (1995) or even ""The Patriot"" (2000).<br/><br/>The film's casting was fine, and Gerard Butler stood out as King Leonidas. The film's cinematography was of high quality and the soundtrack was appropriate other than the segments of rock music. The film starts off well with some details about Sparta and King Leonidas' personal history before the conflict between Spartans and Persians. However, before the conflict can proceed, the film delves into unnecessarily long sex scene.<br/><br/>As the Spartans march to conflict with the Persians, it seems that ""300"" will launch to great heights. It still seems that way as the first engagement proceeds, which introduces the well-staged battle sequences of the film. However, the film doesn't really ever soar from there.<br/><br/>The film has a tendency overuse slow motion effects and sometimes linger overly long on shots or scenes. There weren't any great story developments to retain my interest for the film's duration. There are some semi-interesting plot developments back in Sparta during the conflict and some great speeches and moments on the battlefield, but overall not much. This would be more tolerable if the developments in the battles were interesting, but the battles become ridiculous after the first few engagements. I didn't expect perfect historical accuracy from this film, but it seemed like the Spartans were fighting Sauron's forces from the ""Lord of the Rings"" movies rather than the Persians. This is because of the fantastic creatures that the Persian army manages to field. I half expected an Orc regiment to attack the Spartans as a final blow. Another odd point about the battles is that the film takes its time to iterate the importance of the phalanx, only to have a number of shots of Spartans out of formation.<br/><br/>There are films such as ""Gettysburg"" (1993) and ""Waterloo"" (1970) that effectively capture a particular historical conflict. There are films such as ""Braveheart"" (1995) or ""The Patriot"" (2000) that embellish history to create an engaging film. ""300"" disappointingly falls into neither of these categories."

","Acting in this movie was sacrificed for six-packs. The reason people love this movie so much is because of some good action scenes. The acting was okay at best.

The movie probably would have been better if the emperor had been presented differently. The way characters were portrayed in the movie went a little overboard in some respects, which made the movie worse at least to me.

Before it, sure, there was Sin City but after the gargantuan box office earnings this recent movie has brought in, well¬Ö Probably all of his comic-books are getting adapted the hell out of them. Which of course is good for the comic-book industry who is slowly, but surely, climbing its way from the hole the economic fiasco of the nineties left it in. So, as you read on this review, you have to keep in mind that 300 is not without any accomplishments.<br/><br/>In fact, let's list them.<br/><br/>What it does is entertain. The whole movie is based around the glamorous fight scenes, and splendid cinematography. Even at the beginning of the story: the horse riding in the horizon, the cold cuts, and slow motion of the love scene, and the soldier's constant narration ¬ñfull of pompousness, and rhetoric- already prepare us for the endless array of blood, choreographed fight-scenes and speeches that will follow. Endless array. That sounds as if its bad, doesn't it? And in fact, when you talk about action movies, and epic movies, people often complain about how there is too much explosions, and special effects. But the thing with 300 is that the director, Zack Synder, just does it so well. The fight scenes are the strongest aspect of the movie. Spears dripping blood slashing across the screen, men slowly falling into an abyss, suspended in the air. And then, suddenly the camera will focus on one of the soldiers, as they engage hundreds in an avalanche of pure¬Ö manliness. The audience, most of them can't help but smile. I mean, what Synder does is¬Ö He performs these fight sequences so well, that they never seem repetitive¬ó even though they actually are. He does it perhaps too well. <br/><br/>You see, after a while, the battle is all the audience cares about. So, when suddenly, the violent, and aggressive pace of those sequences are interrupted by the political intrigue of the Queen's storyline, it feels awkward. Out of place. Which, even though it is a major setback, happens not only because the audience is impatient to get back with Leonidas, and his 300, but because the Queen's scenes suffer major faults. It seems that Synder doesn't know how to handle them. The pace is slow, and the dialogue is stiff, but the director still tries to squeeze the slow motion into the scenes, as if the same rules that apply to the battlefield applied in the Senate, or the Queen's residence. In the end, the eye of the camera feels inappropriate, and the whole storyline feels like a filler. 300 can afford to be dumb. Sadly, she doesn't take that chance, and ends up paying for it. And it's not only that. You see, after seeing Xerxes' abominations and monsters, and bearing witness to the unbelievable stunts the Spartans pull, the speeches the Queen delivers¬ó The audience. They just can't take them seriously. In fact, most of them can't even listen. There is little dialogue in the battle scenes. The narrator does the talking over there, as we are shown montages of swords cutting heads off, and wounds opening. The speeches are just unbearable. Plus, they feel like propaganda.<br/><br/>It is not a lie that the movie has been under fire from a number of different fronts. The Iranian government, direct descendants of the Persian empire, has criticized it's depiction of the Persians as a monstrous, androgynous, orgy-attending, merciless individuals. Which is understandable, I guess, but in the end, hey, it's just a movie¬ó whose whole purpose relies on trying to sound as unbelievable as possible, and then thrive in the fact that it is still based on a true, historic event. Another reason of why it has been under fire is that people are drawing comparisons between Bush's ""war on terror"", to Leonidas' ""march to glory"". Is that what the movie does? Defend the war against Iraq? Subtly. It speaks of freedom, and convincing the people that striking against the impending threat is better than just waiting for them. Portrays people who oppose the war as cowards, and traitors. And it does a great job brainwashing the audience. Not by means of the speeches, as it intended, but by the essentially one-dimensional characters, who look, act, and talk like demi-gods. The audience wants to be like them. They believe the narrator when he talks about how the Spartans are direct descendants from Hercules, and about how they are the best of the best in what the human race is concerned. So, we shrug at their atrocities. Throwing ugly babies from a cliff? Sure. We'll dine in Hell! Getting killed instead of retreating? Why the hell not? Prepare for glory! We, the audience, glare at the Greeks who flee the battle, and all they want is not to get killed. We laugh at how they kill messengers.<br/><br/>So¬ó Mr. IMDb User, should I go see 300? <br/><br/>Hear me now: it is a good movie. I mean, it's not a great movie, but it is good in a way that you will enjoy it thoroughly. Sure, after the splendid opening sequence, the politics, and the five-minute long silent good-bys will seem endless, but when the bloodshed begins, you won't care. I say go see it. Yeah, it has flaws, but not enough to toss it away."

"Superunknovvn","Null","0","0","9 April 2007"," Controversial
","Zach Snyder's adaptation of Frank Miller's ""300"" is a mixed bag. On one hand it's perfect popcorn entertainment with appealing visual effects. On the other hand, it contains a very questionable subtext and promotes a fairly war-friendly attitude.<br/><br/>Some have argued that one shouldn't read too much into the story and only enjoy the movie for its entertainment value. For a political comment a blockbuster was too low-brow anyway. Well, that argument isn't really legitimate, since a movie that's addressed at such a huge audience is fodder for the masses and will have some influence on them. But before we get into the old debate of what effect movies can have on the psyche of people, let's try to take a look at the technical side of this flick.<br/><br/>""300"" is a very entertaining movie. Some have claimed that the battle sequences were too much and that the whole thing becomes tiring after a while. I disagree. I thought it was all put on very aesthetically and kinda thrilling at the same time. In this way it was superior to other movies with epic battles like ""The Lord Of The Rings"". ""300"" also outshines ""Sin City"", the other famous Frank Miller adaptation, because where Roberto Rodriguez only created intriguing visuals, this movie also has a rather intriguing story to offer. Sure, it's definitely not for everybody, but if you've seen the trailers you know what you're going to get.<br/><br/>So, the real problem with ""300"" is its message. Can the subtext be ignored? Can it all be seen as just an adventure story? Hardly. Some lines in the script and some story lines are just blatant war propaganda. Like when we're told that freedom has its price and that blood must be spilled for it. Like when the senate is depicted as a group of corrupt and inactive old people. It all just falls into place a bit too suspiciously when you take a look at the current state of affairs in the U.S.A.<br/><br/>And even if you don't want to read it as some kind of political comment, ""300"" is still glorifying violence and death on the battlefield in an alarming fashion. Violence is not as campy in this movie as it (deliberately) is in ""Sin City"" or even in a Tarantino flick.<br/><br/>Personally, I am not for any kind of restrictions in movies. I believe that it all comes down to the viewer and how much he or she is aware of subliminal messages in a movie. Can you enjoy ""300"" for its technical elegance alone or does the subtext ruin it for you? That's the question you have to ask yourself."
"Darkness767","1","14","60","20 March 2007"," A Huge Disappointment
","I saw this movie, expecting it to be great, just like Sin City was. It wasn't. It was incredibly over stylized, it seemed to drown itself in 'style'. The fight scenes were sped up and only slowed down to show a spartan disemboweling an enemy soldier. There are only like three times in the entire movie that Spartans actually die. There was no continuity at any point in the movie The movie was also borderline racist. Throughout the movie, the Spartans, using no tactics or formations whatsoever, kill thousands of Persains with ease. All of Leonidas' talk of freedom also made the movie feel like a propaganda film. All in All, this was a horrible movie, mostly because they tried to pass it off as being based on fact when it was less realistic than the entirely fictional Sin City."
"birotanker","3","13","57","23 March 2007"," Not men, but broken, desperate ghosts of men.
","A society that brutalises its young men, then literally throws them to the wolves. A primitive eugenics programme where babies are dashed against the rocks for any physical imperfection. A nihilistic suicide cult whose one ambition is to die horribly (I can only assume in an attempt to purge the effects of the aforementioned brutalisation). And those were the heroes.<br/><br/>I came into the cinema expecting to enjoy this movie - a bit of sword and sandal action, attractive people to look at, and fight scenes to get the blood pumping - but instead I spent the first half vaguely horrified.<br/><br/>The film is incredibly beautiful, just in its texture and use of light. But the plot is paper thin and the characters seem to have had all human warmth stripped from them. The light doesn't seem to touch them at all; they walk through the film desperate, unfeeling, and oblivious to their crippled emotional state. The main character's constant spitting of 'Sparta!' is obnoxious - he voices it as one would a curse - and the portrayal of the Queen boils down to a series of poorly delivered soliloquies.<br/><br/>The fight scenes were dramatic, but the writers give no reason for the struggle. How can you fight for honour when you cannot feel anything, and all you wish for is death? <br/><br/>Frankly, it is a film reminiscent of a Nazi propaganda exercise from World War Two. The Aryan perfection of the Spartans is shoved in your face. But the strength of these men does not invoke any kind of sense of safety or comfort or pride in their achievement - instead the raw, exposed state of their muscles and sinews seem to be yet another symptom of the abuse their bodies and spirits have suffered. The portrayal in the film of anyone with any kind of physical imperfection is abominable - not only are these characters held in contempt by the perfect warriors, but the plot (what there is of it) goes out of its way to justify such attitudes.<br/><br/>I will skip over the occasional asides that seem to be designed as subliminal anti-Muslim propaganda, and ask, what film was everyone else in the cinema watching? The bit of humour seemed to be just enough to draw people in to the empty moral code, and my friends revelled in the fight scenes as if a bit of athletics and a bit of blood was all that is needed to rouse the male spirit in sympathy.<br/><br/>I'm sorry, but I need more reason than that."

There shall be no one in the cinema audience who is not staring in awe as King Leonidas slaughters man after man after man.

There'll be fear in the hearts of the viewer as the 300 Spartans fight an enemy so large, their marches create earthquakes, so massive, they drink the rivers dry.<br/><br/>300 induces all the emotions the creators intended it to.<br/><br/>The use of CGI is to be triumphed over, not one creature looks fake in this movie. You may have seen in the trailer, the rhinoceros, the uber immortal, the elephants, all such convincing beasts.<br/><br/>The use of imagery in 300 is unlike any other movie, the style of every single frame is admirable. It overall amounts to a very powerful feel throughout the movie.<br/><br/>And at the end of the epic journey which is 300, you will be inspired.

","Ya know what?? Forget about historical accuracy or realism. ""300"" has little of that. But it doesn't matter. This is an amazing work of art. Yes, it's a violent work of art, but it's incredible nonetheless.<br/><br/>I found practically every shot visually stunning. The color choices, the flow of movement, the camera angles, all overlayed with majestic music, this film is one of the most fantastic visual/audible experiences I've seen on film in quite a while. This is the first western film I've seen that truly emulates the majesty of such Oriental visual classics as ""Hero"" and ""House of Flying Daggers"". It's absolutely brilliant.<br/><br/>I think that, as a society, we've completely forgotten that film is a visual medium. That's a very odd thing to say, but it's true. When one really wants to create artistry on the screen, one has to remember film is really a canvas, a bare receptacle ready for whatever one wants to throw at it.<br/><br/>Most filmmakers want to tell a story and put that story on the screen. And that's fine. But all they are really doing is putting that story into life (i.e. real actors in real settings), and simply using the camera to capture that story for show on a screen. Sure, that can work fine (witness Stephen Spielberg and other great filmmakers).<br/><br/>But what Yimou Zhang does with his fantastic films, and what Robert Rodriguez, Zack Snyder, and Frank Miller have done with ""Sin City"" and ""300"", is actually craft visual masterpieces directly for the screen itself. They aren't simply taking pictures of a story, they are actually crafting directly for the projection screen at your Googleplex Cinema.<br/><br/>This difference between capturing an image, and CRAFTING an image, is understood by world-renowned, artistic photographers, and it is my hope films such as ""300"" will help spread this understanding among filmmakers.<br/><br/>Oh, and the film has lots of beheadings. Gotta love beheadings.<br/><br/>10 out of 10."

We get so see random practically naked girls doing some weird dance supposedly to tell the future, a guy get pushed into a pit, and then a whole lot of random and pointless fighting. The battles were interesting to watch at first, but ultimately every fight scene is pretty much the same. Some enemy runs at the Spartans and the Spartans run at them, some people get stabbed, repeat. In fact, that last sentence pretty much sums up the whole movie. There was almost no characterization whatsoever. I had no investment at all in what was going on since I didn't care about the characters and didn't hate the villains. Movies that are mostly fight scenes are fine if the story is good and you actually want one side to win. This movie has no story, boring characters, and is all around a mess"
"j-lacerra","1","3","8","18 May 2010"," Dreadful
","300 is about as close to the actual story of the valiant 300 Spartans as a video game is to real life. Its incessant slo-mo and flowing robes, hair, blood, and fire is distracting from the story. But, no matter, there is no story beyond all that. We are treated to sabre-toothed wolves, a bridled charging rhinoceros, war elephants, and a giant Xerxes who is way too enrapt with piercings and chains.<br/><br/>The acting is not a problem, as there is none. Just various players posing their bulging muscles and mindless arrogant defiance. For some reason, the film places black actors in some of the more villainous roles on the Persian side, so the lily-white Spartans can slaughter them.<br/><br/>The fast-mo/slo-mo CGI encrusted battle scenes, where blood flies freely in all directions, are oddly uncompelling, even boring. The movie does play out like a video game being played by someone else (as another reviewer has said), and is not nearly as interesting. Every opportunity is taken to reveal female anatomy, apparently for tittering sake.<br/><br/>I was quite shocked as to the low threshold this movies aspires to; I would say the 'tween' boy crowd was the target. If you are over thirteen, find a book on this conflict and read the real thing. 300 will not show you anything but the lowest hip-hop history of an ancient gang fight in the dark."

","While the colorists did an amazing job, the lack of story and over-reliance on slow-motion made this movie one of the most boring I've seen in a long time. Essentially, this movie is a long battle, intercut with pointless back story that is so facile that it provides absolutely no depth to the one-dimensional characters. While the battle initially has some mild entertainment value (although it's a pale imitation of violence in the Matrix), it quickly becomes fatiguing. Unless you enjoy exaggerated blood splatter sounds and seeing limbs cut off for the sake of limbs getting cut off, there isn't much to engage the audience.<br/><br/>The director seems to think audiences don't appreciate the difficulty of fighting human foes, so it pits the Spartans against numerous monsters and hyper large beasts. Yet, with no context and an unending stream of slow-motion violence, the monsters and gigantic beasts don't provide any thrills: they're not scary or menacing. They come, they get killed, they are forgotten.<br/><br/>The movie has other problems, but I fear mentioning them will have readers discount how boring the action is."

Apart from this, the costumes were, least to say, pathetic. I can't imagine how anyone on this earth could believe that the Spartans, or Persians, or whomever in the movie would go to war with nothing more than a sword, a shield, a cape and...their underwear. No armor whatsoever.(and I must add that in --hystory-- (not comic related,I know) they are remembered for what? Their complex armor!!) The acting was mediocre to dreadful, possibly because no one could act with such a lame story and a dumb dialog. The characters were poorly to not at all psychologically characterized. (but then again, who needs to know a character when they go to war in underwear? I believe the IQ is quite obvious). And let's not forget Xerxes. What on EARTH?!?!?! He just gave me the creeps. Why did he need all those chains and earrings and...rings...and... etc? The visuals - could have been good, but not appropriate. The...monsters - or were they people? I can't say. But to me, they looked tragically like the orcs from The Lord of the Rings. People, if you must plagiarize...just plagiarize a less famous movie!

How does one go about doing something that appears different, and novel? This is exactly what Zack Snyder achieves with 300.

And, his 300 men do not disappoint in giving the impression that they really were the 300 Spartans, and it would be really unwise to make them angry.<br/><br/>The villains in this case (the Persians) are not only vast in number (which is nothing new), but they are over the top as well. So you have a mix of Alexander and Lord of the Rings, but with a greater reality.<br/><br/>The cinematography and editing deserves special mention too, and the movie shows how different elements of film-making, when put together in new and creative ways, almost always manages to do the trick - create a breath of fresh air.<br/><br/>And how!"

","When I first saw the trailer for 300 I could tell that it was going to be a good action movie, just from the short clips. But nothing can prepare you for the mind blowing experience of seeing it in the cinema. With the whole film being shot on green screen it was quite easy (even with a large budget) to make the background and scenery seem too 'gamey'. Obviously with Frank Miller's input the film was meant to have a certain 'comic-style' feel to it and it was supposed to be very bloody and 'over the top'... but its perfectly over the top. The balance between real and surreal is just right, the Spartans are fantastic fighters but they are not invincible, the scenery is encapsulating but it is not completely fictitious. In my mind a good action film has to be its best in the cinema, that is where 300 comes into its own, it blows you away with the spanning shots and the close up fight scenes. The element of 'comic book physics' means that even thought all the movements aren't realistic.. it doesn't matter because you know they're not supposed to be, giving the overall sense of 'not quite mortal'. 300 cannot be compared to most other action films, because it is in a different league, its one of a kind...well..two if you count Sin City... and its brilliant!"

The scene where she performs her speech before the elders, the speech that is meant to come from a queen, a wife and mother worried to death is so unconvincing that I considered the speed button.(Her role could be disputed as well, but the role is not the problem.) Otherwise, the cast is brilliant.

Btw comparing the Persians of that day to current day Iranians is misleading, that empire is gone and Islamic culture did not come into being till post 600AD), with fantasy and glory woven in - the result is larger and BETTER than real life could ever be. It is a heroic tale, one of sacrifice, Gerard Butler for all the operatic staging, captures the essence, the nobility, the inspiration of what a great man is perfectly.<br/><br/>However since not everyone is ready to put aside cinematic prejudices, to forgive Hollywood for making movies that the masses might enjoy in general - the analog of someone playing cricket scoffing at the rugby team nearby and thumbing their noses - I guess I will try to make a guess as to who should or should not see the movie.<br/><br/>Definitely SEE IT: Love comic books, sci-fi, fantasy, operatic or mythic tales. If visuals, style and cinematography can count quite a bit in your book - see this for sure - I don't say wow lightly and this movie was WOW WOW WOW in that book! If a strong steadfast character, with 6-pack abs running around in a codpiece and actually pulling it off is a selling point to you - by all means see it you won't be disappointed.<br/><br/>SEE IT: If you want to see a movie with some adrenaline and that celebrates the unabashedly masculine in spirit. If you like sports, war movies, strong steadfast men (of both orientations) doing noble things then you will probably really enjoy it. See it if you are inspired by the real history of Thermopylae and DON'T MIND the embellishments. (Btw. the capital Lambda on the shields is a symbol of brotherhood in the face of adversity and has been adopted by many movements and fraternities, often in both uppercase or lowercase.)<br/><br/>Don't SEE IT: If your only definition of movie is one where old ladies express regrets or which are about how horrible this world is. Don't see it if you are so politically sensitive that any suggestion that people might have to step up sometimes is likened to Bush's misguided Iraq war (Contrast a general war on terrorism versus an opportunistic war. For example take WWII - and ask is the call to stand up to atrocity or tyranny is so bad? <br/><br/>Finally let me give you a quote attributed to the real Leonidas so that you may judge if Gerard Butler might have captured the essence of the man: When leaving Sparta for Theromopylae it is written in ""phrases of Spartan men and women"" that Queen Gorgo asked Leonidas ""what should I do?"" to which he replied ""Marry a good man, and have good children.""<br/><br/>Though this was not used in the movie, I think Butler nailed this essence. (Many of the main phrases the movie uses are straight out of Herodotus' accounts btw so please do take the time to glance at them before dismissing them as corny Hollywoodisms. Even Wikipidea will suffice. :))"
"ttangod","9","3","8","6 April 2007"," Does what its supposed to do.
","Brilliant depiction of a group of soldiers, hungry for violence, does not beat about the bush, these guys love to kill and don't mind the favour returned. A lot of people were put off by the frontal nudity featured throughout the film, but I think its their sexual insecurities that disturbed them. Did not mind the cgi because it created the whole mythical atmosphere, you then do not take the superhuman feats too seriously. Good pre-workout energiser, hell if I had Leonidas as a gym instructor I'd be Mr Universe within a month. I like my cerebral films but once in a while a work art like this comes through and it makes you think, hmm, I would like some more please."
"gcoochy","9","3","8","5 April 2007"," A masterpiece
","I was a bit dubious about this film but was not disappointed at all, my conclusion was that it was up there in my top ten films of all time. The music, atmosphere, fight scenes are all first class and filmed in a surreal background which adds to the historic nature of the film. The one thing that was a bit out of place was the Scottish accent of the King, being set in ancient Greece it was a pit off putting, but non the less this film is awesome and will be put onto my ipod as soon as it is on DVD, turn up the volume and enjoy a classic when you get it. To sum up I loved this film and would recommend you go and see it asap, some scenes will take your breath away."
"imperial001","10","3","8","4 April 2007"," From bad to simply astonishing.
","I'm speechless. Throughout the movie, I was really enjoying it, up until about 20-30 minutes before the movie ended. Here, all the 300 soldiers fall to a shower of arrows, and my thoughts on the movie dropped to zero. I was really disliking it, as they had all died, and it kind of ruined the movie. So then I thought, well how's it going to end.. etc.. I really thought the movie was going to have a bad ending, but then, out of nowhere, the messenger who I totally forgot had survived, led the army, and it turned the movie into a simply grand experience. This was because those 300 were the best men Sparta had, they were inspiring, joyful and full of courage and might. I was disappointed in seeing the 300 men fall, but what I failed to notice was that actually 299 fell, and one stood firm to lead Sparta towards victory. It really left me speechless. On other terms, the movie was greatly filmed and directed, I really recommend everyone to watch it."
"wendyjbf","9","3","8","4 April 2007"," Beautifully done !
","This movie is as good as the positive comments suggest. Sure, there was some artistic license used with the movie - but - it can be attributed to the way in which the film is laid out. It starts (and finishes) as a Captain regaling the tale of King Leonidas to his troops - so it's meant to be a tale of glory and inspiration to motivate his own men into battle. After all, if 300 Spartans could stand against the Persians - surely his 1000's should have nothing to fear? As noted by someone else, ""foreign"" things to the Spartans such as the Rhino and the Elephant, the Immortals etc would appear to be different than ""we"" would expect as this is a something the Spartans have never seen before, and again - it's a tale being told by one man to motivate his troops. Would King Leonidas be so great if the tale teller were to say that he fought ""not so fierce animals that were 3 foot tall""? No.<br/><br/>I didn't know anything about the movie or the history before going to see it - and was surprised how much is actually historically accurate. The parts that weren't I put down to Dilios' rendition of the story for his men. I won't ruin the movie any further by saying what was ""fact"" but it's good to realise that the Spartans didn't actually write anything down so there isn't a lot of historical data from Sparta itself - but other nations ""took notes"". <br/><br/>Visually I thought it was awesome. I loved the look and feel of the movie. My ever-the-critic husband didn't even notice the overall finish of the movie, he was so drawn in by the story, the slow motion scenes and acknowledging the choreography. Casting I thought was great... (bien sur! I am Scottish and a girl!) ... and I thought it knocked the socks off Gladiator. A colleague of mine just argued with me - he thinks Braveheart and Gladiator were far superior movies. *sigh* Braveheart. Where do you start with that movie? And Gladiator I enjoyed, but then again it was Spartacus in sexier loin cloths without the pinnacle ""I'M SPARTACUS!!!!"" moment. ;D Finally, for me, the soundtrack added to the experience rather than take away from it. I barely noticed it as it blended in with the visuals so well, accenting the experience.<br/><br/>Great stuff. People who think it's racist etc... please. This is, literally, ancient history. Perhaps you should google ""Thermopylae"" and learn something."
"cheattila","8","3","8","4 April 2007"," One of the best action and fantasy movie I've ever seen.
","July, 2006. I saw the trailer of this movie first time, and I was kicked by lightning. I had started to wait for the full version and I was excited what could the director of the Dawn of the Dead make from the Frank Miller comic. I watched it a week ago and I'm not sorry for that! It was fantastic as I waited! The fantasy motives didn't bother me it's not a historical film. Heroic battles, heroic war cries, comic-feeling like in Sin City, ""few against many""... everything I can like in a movie. OK, there were movie stock phrases in it, but is there anyone who can show me a movie from Hollywood in which there aren't any ""I have seen it before?""-motive? It's created a statue to the three hundred, who died 2500 years ago. Yes, don't forget, there are historical basics in 300 in spite of the fantasy monsters. There great ""job"" for the Greek culture comes to us by this movie and that's the thing that makes 300 more than a ""B action film"" I think. Okay, I can say like the haters of this film: there were too much action and battle in it at the middle of the film and the story disappeared a bit. But I could have understand the main story was the battle and the events were played at Thermophylai. The pictures were well constructed too, and they gave 300 a perfect comic style. We have a feeling that we're reading Frank Miller's fine writing! <br/><br/>The only thing that was a stick in my eyes is the movie's end-game. It was too tragic and I didn't feel the heroism which was in the death of the 300 soldiers.<br/><br/>So, I think 300 has become on of my favorite movies next to Lord of the Rings and Star Wars. If I have a chance I'll buy it on DVD and I'll watch it several times! XD"

","This movie was great!...well worth the wait and the price of a ticket. Can't wait to get it on DVD! Gerard Butler is one of my favorite actors after seeing this film...he is amazing in every aspect! the movie is short in length for the type of movie it portrays and also compared to how long movies are that are of the same caliber, but who cares...it delivers! I hate to give away some of the movie, but I thought the ending was great, and sad at the same time. deeply touching...I was happy for Leonidas' wife back home though.<br/><br/>The fight scenes are quite amazing and unbelievable. the gore was excessive but necessary to reveal the onslaught of the degree to which the 300 Spartans had to go through to stand up for what they believed in...also there are some very good memorable quotes to keep in mind from this movie, they just stick in your head afterward.<br/><br/>My rating: 10/10 for the best 2 hours I've seen in a movie in a long time..."

","Honestly, when I first heard of this movie, 300, I thought to my self oh god here comes another war movie with a great deal of blood and cursing. I would watch the previews during the commercial breaks and not even pay attention because the movie was not appealing to me. But my brother dragged my friends and I to this movie and I swear I am so thankful he did. The movie 300 was astonishing, it was the total package. The story, the graphics, the acting, the scenery, the dialogue, and the characters gave breath taking performances. I really have not seen a movie like this in a very long time. Everyone has heard about troy, gladiator, and similar epic stories. But this one I have to say, beats them all. The way the director portrayed this tragedy is heartbreaking but at the same time so inspirational. To see how much loyalty, obedience, respect, and honor Spartans had during that time of age is heart warming. It was a history lesson for all who experienced this movie. I highly recommend this movie to everyone over the age of 18. The only thing I did not like and pray that they take out of this movie was the unnecessary nudity. It was too much and very disgusting for me to watch. The movie would have made millions more if they had made it PG14. But other than that I would definitely go watch the movie again. The Spartans lifestyle and triumph was portrayed in a very honest way, with out adding to much fiction. The director did a magnificent job telling this epic story. The aspect of this movie that I will never forget is the dialogue, it was flawless. I see this movie going down in history and always being remembered."

This is based on a comic book! *hint hint* The movie(comic) was shown from the Spartan view, and it's sole purpose was to make the Spartans become the heroes. And what's wrong in that? it's called fiction! If you're going to rip up EVERY thing in every movie that is controversial, you probably have issues that goes deeper than the movie itself.

It was superb, this film will be talked about for a long time to come. The cast were perfect together and the story stayed true to the original. I was glued to my seat and my eyes never left the screen, I would have to recommend that you go to see it on the big screen, it was such an experience, and the best money I have spent at the movies for a long long time. The fighting scenes has the entire audience in jaw dropping white knuckle stances. Utterly brilliant. The wonderful scenery and fabulous narration made the film all the more powerful. An epic!!"

","300 is a fantastic movie. The cinematography was totally awesome. Costume design was very believable. While my wife and I are great Gerard Butler fans, we feel this just might be his big break through role. I had heard many comments prior to going to see the movie, but did not find those that have had critical comments to have any basis for political subtext. I went to see the movie with an open mind and for the mere pleasure of entertainment. Political intrigue and betrayal have run a constant course during the history of great empires. There seemed to be no shortage of this type of behavior in 300. Go Gerry and Spartans! Abyjam"
"fung0","9","3","8","31 March 2007"," A significant work of art
","A work of art must be judged in its own terms. It's fine to say: ""300 was not my cup of tea."" Certainly! Many people will find it too violent, too loud, too long, too intense, too dark... But to criticize it 'objectively' for, say, not being historically accurate, or for not having deep characters, is to entirely miss what the movie is about. As absurd as criticizing 2001: A Space Odyssey for not being Citizen Kane. Or Lord of the Rings for having ""too many elves."" (Bravo, Richard Roeper!) Or the Mona Lisa for not having a denser plot...<br/><br/>300 is a visually-powerful allegory. It's a simple, visceral experience, with a simple, eternal message. (You can't conquer someone who has conquered fear.) Why look for anything else? This is a movie that dares to be simple, primal, focused. A film that revels in its excesses. And one that succeeds brilliantly at what it tries to do.<br/><br/>There are many pleasures along the way. The dynamic chiaroscuro observation of characters' features. The play of forms and colors, stripped of their three-dimensional, real-world complexities, reduced to vivid bas-relief. The terse dialog, filled with ironic resonance. Powerful, suitably stylized performances that work synergistically with the extreme visuals, rather than being obscured by them.<br/><br/>Is 300 'realistic'? Of course not! But is it a valid reflection of reality? A distillation of certain very basic truths? An aesthetically pleasing crystallization of archetypal images? Most definitely. Is it a much-needed reminder of something we've all forgotten? Alas, yes. That at some times, in some places (or was it only in fantasy?), men have chosen NOT to submit to tyranny, even when submission seemed like the only 'reasonable' choice. That there IS a higher ideal than today's pragmatic ""take the money and run.""<br/><br/>Oddly enough, this feels like art that an ancient Greek, transported to the 21st Century, might find both familiar and admirable. In short, a grand and glorious film."

","I was like dying to watch the movie 300 before its release and after the first time I watched the trailers, believe me or not, I watched the trailers again and again and for at least 50 times in the next 3 days. Reason? Adrenaline, Music, Dialogs & Cinematography. And I was reading all the reviews on the movie in the coming weeks and I became a fan of this movie even before watching it because of the hype & expectations.<br/><br/>And the time came atlast and I watched the movie in the theater. By the time half of the movie was over, I was like, hmmmmm.. something is missing!!! The movie really didn't live upto my expectations.<br/><br/>The MUSIC was not what I expected (actually the music in the trailers was of some number from ""Nine inch Nails"" which I earlier didn't know, but had a huge impact on my mind). But the score was decent anyway.<br/><br/>DIALOGS were reasonably good & some were mind blowing for which the audience in the theater were like clapping & whistling.<br/><br/>And, CINEMATOGRAPHY and DIRECTION, I should say I really enjoyed that aspect of the movie.<br/><br/>But what was the missing link? The answer is, Story! No matter what the mythology says, this movie doesn't have a very strong plot. Its just 300 Spartans die, in glory, for their Sparta!! What else? Nothing.<br/><br/>And then, I saw the IMDb rating going down day after day. I knew why and I hope, by now, you know why.<br/><br/>For all the hard work the actors put in, all new cinematography style, decend original score, powerful dialogs and stylish direction, this movie deserves 8/10."

","This film is not a piece of art as some may say... it is well constructed, beautifully filmed, and will grab your attention! The imagery is amazing, as through-out the film i never once looked towards a background or back drop and thought 'thats just a green screen or cgi effect' even though i knew it was! I also have read people, namely first viewers and critics, walked out of the cinema angry and shouting things about the film on a political scale, comparing to our present world and events with Iraq... etc. I feel they have missed the point entirely on this one (unless the director or Mr Miller had other ideas in which i will kindly step back on). This is made for just damn right fun! To me, this is a type of film i have been missing in my life for a while now in my local cinema... a good old fashioned 'blokey movie'!!! In the eighties and nighties we had Arnie, Stallone, Van Damme creations! General films in which we would get one main genre... action! These films would be cool, but cheesy, with cool, but cheesy one liners, and have a cool, but generally cheesy, one man army or against the odds type of plot. Really nothing that springs to my mind in this decade of cinema has filled this void. (but do let me know if i've forgotten any.... the matrix was 1999 and the sequels were, lets face it, money hungry let downs, just in case anyones thinks of that one!!!) This has violence, action, and nudity in a nice tidy bundle of fun and joy!... no swearing that i can remember though now thinking about it, or nothing that struck out to me (does 'whore' count?!)! This is for a male audience mainly, and why not? we get to take the ladies to something that isn't a 'chick flick' or 'girlie friendly'. They can look at big musclely dudes while we (the guys) watch the musclely dudes chop each others arms, legs,and heads off! 'Come on luv, Who needs wimpy, well spoken Orlando when you can enjoy this bunch of bloodthirsty beefcakes!!!! WAAAARRRRR!!!' The director impresses me, i enjoyed 'Dawn of the running around Dead' and i enjoyed this film even more. He's managed to use Frank Miller and place him into his own possible genre of 'Miller Time!'(please don't sue) Anything this guy creates through graphic novel must be filmed in this style, namely green screen! (Thank you Robert, good shout!) This is a nice and enjoyable touch of epic fun, ignore history fact and give us the basic idea fiction! I'm not here to learn much, i just want to enjoy the ride and cheer the underdogs! The only major problem with this film is that it may insight rioting once you leave the cinema...

","This is truly a work of art, the acting, the direction, the story, everything is put in place just right. Gerard Butler stars as Sparta King Leonidas. Spartans were supposedly the strongest soldiers in the world (Descended from Hercules himself) .He is put in a very difficult situation when Persian messengers come and tell them that they have to surrender or be enslaved and die. King Leonidas consults the Oracle about going to war but the Oracle forbids it. Leonidas plans to go to war anyway and gathers a 300 strong army captained by, well captain lol. Leonidas, Captain and the army travel north to the hot gates. Along the way they are joined by the Arcadions, who want to help the Spartans. When they arrive at the hot gates they see the Persian army in all of its glory (Commanded by ""God King"" Xerxes) and the battle ensues. I won't go any further than that as i will probably spoil it for you. 10/10. He done it with Sin City and Frank Miller has done it again. One more thing to say... Madness! THIS IS SPARTA!"

I also don't get why the Iranians are objecting to this movie............i mean didn't it was the Muslim invaders(the ancestors of the modern day Iranians who have complains with the movie) drove out the real Persian from Iran?<br/><br/>Seriously guys this is not a propaganda movie. anyways its an awesome movie with great effects and the acting is great."

At one or 2 points in the movie the lead character reminded me of Sylvester Stallone when he shouted Something (no, not ""Yo, Adrian!""). In fact, this would have been a good vehicle for Stallone when he was in his prime.<br/><br/>I give this movie ""7"" stars which makes it only one star shy of a MUST SEE movie which in my opinion is 8-9-or 10.

"Shinobu_Sensui","10","3","8","24 March 2007"," Best film yet this year!
","300 is an epic tale of war, pride, determination, and spirit. Set several centuries before the birth of Christ, in a time were Modern Greece was divided into many tiny countries called ''city states'', it tells the story of one of those states-Sparta.<br/><br/>Sparta is a powerful military state, it's warriors are Iron hard in their personalities as a result of a tough training program in youth, which molded them, into the fineist soldiers on the ancient Greek continent, as a result they stand out as an exceptionally powerful kingdom, led by none other than the great warrior king, Leonidas.<br/><br/>But that is changing, a MASSIVE army is invading Greece, it is the army of the huge and terrible Persian Empire, ruled by the cruel, and much feared King Zerkzeez, who has set his sights on conquering the Greek states.<br/><br/>King Zerkzees sends a messenger with a small part of his army to demand that Sparts surrender to him and as proof of their obedience, give him an offering of Earth, and water. In a demonstration of Spartan spirit and warrior ship, King Leonidas and his bodyguards kill the Persian messenger and his troops, setting off a war.<br/><br/>King Zerkzees leads his army to Sparta, intent on conquering it and the other Greek states. Leonidas meanwhile, seeks permission from a group of Supernatural beings who are the guardians of Sparta to battle the Persians, the guardians decline, but Leonidas brings 300 troops to fight the Persians anyway. But no one, not even the king is above the law in Sparta, and thus King Leonidas is breaking it.<br/><br/>King Zerkzees sends one of his generals with a legion of his troops, to demand a surrender. The Persian generals troops are useless, but he is armed with a huge whip, which he badly injures several Spartan's with, before being defeated, and held at the point of a Spartan sword, they let him go, ordering him to tell king Zerkzeez that the Spartans are not slaves. The Persian general replies before leaving that their civilians will be slaves but by noon they will be dead men.<br/><br/>A deformed Spartan asks king Leonidas for permission to fight to redeem himself(the disabled are killed shortly after birth in Sparta, but this one's parents fled with him). Due to his deformity, Leonidas decides he cant fight. Heartbroken, the soldier betrays and joins the Persians.<br/><br/>King Zerkzees, and king Leonidas meet, and Leonidas is once again offered a chance to surrender, being offered anything he wishes. Leonidas refuses, saying even Zerkzeez can bleed, and leaves.<br/><br/>The Spartan's and Persians begin battling, and the Spartans are defeating the invaders, which is surprising as King Zerkzees. The Persians have in their army such terrors as captured rhinoceroses, gigantic elephants with Persian troops riding them into battle to do damage with them, a huge hulk of a man who is big enough to send troops flyng with blows, and survive a wound threw the eye, a similes hulking brute slightly smaller and with sword/claw like hands, and an army of elite troops called the immortals. The Spartan army manages to defeat them all, showing that although vastly outnumbered by the Persians, the Spartan's have a spirit, and warrior ship that can challenge anything. But when most of the Sparta troops desert King Leonidas, and Sparta wont send him more, he must face the showdown of his life against Zerkzeez army with the few that remain on his side. Even with all of their spirit and Spartan ferocity, can they win when now so outnumbered? Especially when the Persians have discovered a secret path the spartan's have been using to their advantage.<br/><br/>the good- First I would like to say that this film is very visually arresting. The color scheme shows shades of dark blue in the sky, and in the mountains that really gives a feel of true dark, gruesome warfare. The color scheme is truly marvelous.<br/><br/>Second The battle scenes are spectacular. Better than those in troy. It's very gory with several severed heads etc..., which adds to the entertainment, and epic feel of the battles.<br/><br/>Third some of the performances are magnificent such as the Spartan Queen, and King Zerkzeez.<br/><br/>Fourth the sets really take you back to ancient times. The costumes are marvelous, and the general feel of the whole thing is awesome!<br/><br/>the bad-King Leonidas makes a less than inspiring protagonist, and some of the acto0rs are weak in their performances.<br/><br/>What I didn't understand was what the two strange monster men were. This movie is also very derivative, some Lord of the Rings, some gladiator, some troy, some star wars, Brave Heart etc... but it is the good kind of derivative where all of the best elements of the greats are brought together in a stylish way.<br/><br/>Overall I would recommend this to fans of Lord of the Rings, Gladiator, Troy, and Braveheart, people who like movies like those should like this two."

This is a man-film, OK? From start to finish, women? Do not feel neglected, you have all of your stuff, it's just that it was about time they remembered there are GUYS out here...<br/><br/>300 is a pure testosterone rush from beginning to end - when the film is over you feel like hunting something down with your bare hands for the hell of it.<br/><br/>I understand Iranian-Americans are protesting the portrayal of themselves in the film; if it is for the dress used in the flick then that is fine but if for the deed? That is recorded historical fact! As for the Persian attire, I must admit I was taken off-guard... It was my only knock against the film - in reality, Persians almost looked like groomed Rastafarians in that day and age, their beards were tightly rolled and oiled in rows! Other than that this movie tends to follow the history of Thermopylae or the Hot Gates very closely and is relatively true - even down to selecting babies and educating Spartan women! The last was important as they wanted to ensure they gave birth to strong and smart children, their life was pure war - men were not allowed to farm or handle money... There were slaves or helots for that purpose! This film has many memorable quotes - ""THEN WE WILL HAVE TO FIGHT IN THE SHADE"" when told Persian arrows would blot out the sun, as for the photography and cinematography - this is very true to the spirit and style of Frank Miller's illustration technique's... He is the man who redefined Daredevil in the 80's, not the wuss that Ben Affleck loused up recently! The actors were well-cast, many of them for me are unfamiliar, but while I do not know Rodrigo Santoro as Xerxes? I could tell his voice was altered and I did not agree with this - if his character was like an original historical Persian then I could understand the deepening of his voice; otherwise, Xerxes looked a bit drag-queen kind of gay...<br/><br/>Was the picture a subtle push for Bush's surge in Iraq? I doubt it, even with the Marine like ""HAAaa-OOooh!"" cry from the 300, since essentially this is backfiring in emphasising the exact reverse of Bush's view and what is happening.<br/><br/>In other words it is Bush who is Xerxes, and Muqtada Al-Sadr who is like Leonidas - Bush is the invader with the multi-national horde who is encroaching on the small Najaf... So how can this picture relate to such Hawkish policies? Nah, this is just a guy-flick... Women if you wanna make your man feel like Tarzan for a few days and he will kill or die to do anything for you in that period? RUN and drag him to 300!

"gamecubicle","10","3","8","24 March 2007"," 117 minutes of pure testosterone
","I saw this movie in Imax the day after the Holland release, after being kicked out of the cinema on the day of the release. Why was I kicked out? Well... apparently they wanted to keep the 4 rows in the back empty, and didn't tell us that until the whole cinema, apart from the front row's were full... So we could either sit in front... or leave and get our money back... no one wanted to leave... they called the police, so eventually everybody in the back 4 rows left or went to front row.<br/><br/>AND THIS IS NOT A MOVIE TO SEE IN FRONT ROW No ladies and gentleman, this is a movie, so incredibly amazing. You should see this in all it's glory, on the 5 row from behind, where I sat the next day when I saw it.<br/><br/>The movie starts kind of slow, with a person telling how King Leonidas became king of the Spartans. And after that the action basically starts... and doesn't end until the movie is over. Apart from some tiny story parts in between.<br/><br/>But the action itself is so amazing... It blows you off of your seat. You want to go in a killing frenzy yourself... you start screaming KILL KILL KILL throughout the whole movie, until someone punches you and you are quite again... It is... 117 minutes of pure testosterone<br/><br/>The fighting choreography is done great. And the fighting combines all sorts of things you might have seen in other movies in a way it feels completely new. Slowmotion, Video starting to play faster, things like that.<br/><br/>About the visuals: They are stunning. Apart from some downsides (The rocks Leonidas climbed on weren't convincing, i think they build those by hand to be honest, instead of CG) But the overall visuals were so cool<br/><br/>Also the blood they did. I read about how they do it before. And in fact it is not 3d blood, but 2d. They did that to let the movie keep the feel of the comic... and it just looks.... so.. AMAZING<br/><br/>I guess I can just go on about this movie for ages. It is indeed one of the greatest movies I have EVER seen.<br/><br/>The people who are complaining about it not being historically correct just have to shut up. What is the point about that really? IT IS BASED ON A COMIC YOU MORONS.<br/><br/>Well, great movie. I'm pretty sure I want to go see this again in the cinema. And I can't wait until it is being released on DVD (I so want to see the making of, being into animation, and CG myself as a hobby)<br/><br/>Amazing movie. Must see!<br/><br/>10/10"
"cfn_halliwell","10","3","8","24 March 2007"," Immense
","Frank Miller said all the way along that it was not historically accurate...therefore it is only fair that we allow him the poetic license that has been used throughout. By having Ephialtes as a deformed Spartan made you sympathise with him, by having the Persians forced back wave after wave of assault to the Phalanx and by showing that the Spartans had some brilliant one liners! The main part is where the Persians finish off the Spartan contingent with arrows as they were too afraid to face them again, which by all accounts is true. A brilliant ""tribute"" to the 300 Spartans in which the whole cast and crew have done them proud with this amazing motion picture."
"pigmentia","2","3","8","23 March 2007"," Good visuals, but the script is for the brain-dead
","I'm beginning to wonder if guys make themselves believe that they like this movie because they are supposed to like it. Come on!!! It is completely impractical to fight semi-naked like that. Were their fighting attire designed by Jean-Paul Gaultier? Even though I'm a woman, I happen to like war films -- even submarine films like Das Boot and K19 the Widow Maker. I just saw Flags of Our Fathers and Letters from Iwo Jima recently and liked both films very much. But 300 is mostly hype. I admit that the visuals were good, but they're hardly original. 300 tries to bring in elements that made Gladiator and Sin City work, but it's missing something... dynamic characters with whom you empathize and who think intelligent thoughts. I winced each time I heard the narrator's voice. It was way too heavy-handed -- an utter insult to the audience's intelligence."
"davidabooth","10","3","8","23 March 2007"," Awesome
","Loved this movie. Based (loosely) on the historic battle of Thermopylae where 300 Spartans (and their allies) held the vastly superior force of the Persian army (2 million if you believe Heroditus - though few modern historians do) until the rest of the Greek army could gather and defeat the Persians at the later battle of Platea. Gerard Butler as Leonidas blew me away - far more than a one dimensional leader who shouts a lot (although he does this too!) - and his queen was equally strong. Not for the faint hearted - there is blood aplenty and severed limbs everywhere. All in all a thoroughly enjoyable movie - and a fitting tribute to those fallen Greek heroes!"
"charity_williams","10","3","8","23 March 2007"," Brilliant both historically and entertaining.
","In Response to someone's silly comment titles ""So stupid-- something something"" I would like to say that as a History major I found the film very factual and very historically accurate. It showed the social structure of that culture and how the males at age seven were taken for training in battle and how fierce they were trained to be very accurately. Also, geographically it was pretty well accurate thought they were supposed to be in a slightly more swampy area and there were geysers and hot springs in the area at the actual time. The only thing that was in question was the Persians as they were always the enemy of Greece and Sparta, bu tat that time in history, they were not of a dark complexion. That is Hollywood showing some political statement perhaps and making them more scary and antagonistic I suppose. To say that the film was worthless and a waste of time and to take your own time to write such an attack does not make sense. I loved it and look forward to owning my own copy as soon as it is out on DVD."

","I found this to be an extraordinary film. Extremely artistic, something to leave me feeling inspired and ""wow-ed"". I've read people complaining about the movie being awful and I disagree. There are plenty of movies with a better storyline or better actors, but I don't think that was the whole idea of 300. I believe this movie is the key to movie makers to expand their horizons and take that extra step to make a film that blows you away. The CGI was awesome, not necessarily realistic at all times, but it will leave you breathless and staring. I think it was about time that a movie has taken advantage of the technology we are plenty capable of in this generation. Do not come to see this movie expecting the usual sappy or war movie. This movie has a feel between the Matrix, Lord of the Rings, and Gladiator, but don't let that fool you. It has elements from the 3 movies, but it is a movie that stands alone."

","While I like action movies fine (and even own a few) I have never been as impressed with one as I have been by 300. I have seen it three times already and I rarely watch movies in the theater. I have to admit that the IMAX makes a huge difference... Again, the IMAX is something I've never really been into.<br/><br/>300 runs the gamut; Comedy, Action, Drama and Romance.<br/><br/>While the bodies of the actors are getting a lot of press (and are quite amazing) it is the story that really reached out, took hold and shook me. I knew within the first eight minutes that this movie would be added to my collection without hesitation."
"jjsegura","10","3","8","22 March 2007"," Another Timeless Masterpiece!!!
","What an excellent piece of cinema. The visual is stunning, the actors are great and the directing incredible. I have seen Gerard Butler in other movies, but in 300 he dominates the screen. His character, dialog and sheer power place him with the likes of Russell Crowe in Gladiator and Mel Gibson in Braveheart. The supporting cast is phenomenal. The movie is fast paced and does not contain any lulls. The battle scenes are well done. I saw myself cheering for the 300 Spartans as they faced incredible odds. Truly a stunning movie that will definitely become a classic. I know it is only March, but this definitely has to contend for a few Oscars, including Best Actor for Gerard Butler."
"mattour97","10","3","8","21 March 2007"," Wow come'n, honestly, Iranian people took this movie too seriously.
","IT'S NOT A HISTORICAL STATEMENT OF ANY KIND ABOUT THE IRANIANS.<br/><br/>The movie creators just needed to make the ""bad guys"" to look really evil and the ""good guys"" extremely heroic, so it will be good enough for a Hollywood film.<br/><br/>Think about it, if it was a movie about 1 million Persians beating 300 Spartans it wouldn't be so attractive would it? If it was such a movie they would probably make the Persians look heroic and the Spartans super evil.<br/><br/>So chill and enjoy this movie like any other non-historical movie, don't try to find statements which aren't there.<br/><br/>And stop underrating it."

"sowhat1117","7","3","8","20 March 2007"," A Graphically Stunning War Movie
","This might be lost in a sea of opinions but I'll write it anyway.<br/><br/>I went to see this movie without knowing anything about it (""It's about a war,"" my friend summarized for me) or reading the graphic novel beforehand and came out positive I had gotten my money's worth...until I came here.<br/><br/>As an amateur photographer and would-be graphic designer, yeah, I was pretty impressed and in complete shock and awe the entire way through. But I assume most people agree that the stylization was unlike anything ever before seen or completely hated it.<br/><br/>As for the plot that many have told me either didn't exist or was completely lousy, I disagree with both. The plot existed, though weak at times during the battle scenes, and was compelling enough for a movie about war. In fact, I think there are some lessons to be had here: the noble king willing to die for his principles and only asks what he gives in return (complete devotion to the cause), the queen, hovering between oppression and freedom, who, despite her missteps, attempts to protect the man she loves and follow her own moral compass, and the masses though ignorant and open to deception but sometimes still capable of learning the truth. Nothing new but definitely things worth repeating. To those who think I'm reaching too far, they're not reaching far enough (or even too far those allegory-of-the-war-in-Iraq-sayers) or are being too critical to see the obvious.<br/><br/>Those who believe this is a ripoff of LotR, Braveheart, etc., I encourage you to read the Bible or at least research its impact on the entire literary world (as I'm not a religious person and would never ask an irreligious person to read the Bible in its entirety). All of those 'original' movies and books you hold so dear to your heart take metaphors, allegories, and even their entire plots from the Bible itself. The Bible does cover nearly every topic or story you can possibly think of from your standard miracles to incest and fathers murdering their own daughters and reduces all those 'compelling' and 'interesting' plots to a few simple verses or short chapters.<br/><br/>This is a war movie, complete with battle scenes of unnecessary goriness, that covers the same morals and principles of any other movie promoting freedom and self-sacrifice to get it. This one's just so much prettier to look at."

"Sparrowmaniac","10","3","8","18 March 2007"," Frank Miller's best till date
","To be true to myself, I was a bit worried if 300 was worth the 100 bucks that I spent to get a balcony ticket at the theaters. 10 minutes into the movies and I realized that I had more of my money's worth already. The movie not only depicts the great struggle of the 300 Spartans but also the indomitable courage of King Leonidas.<br/><br/>The movie similarly shot as Sin City, is mostly on a B/W basis, with traces of red(blood). It features mind boggling visual effects completely of a different scale. Heads getting chopped off, and every specks of blood flying away, is clearly visible. The scene where the Spartans witness the Persians ships getting shipwrecked in the fiery storm, you could see the rain splattering on the shields so clearly it would seem that the persons are standing right in front of you.<br/><br/>Now getting into the story...<br/><br/>We all know of the tales of Leonidas, courtesy of poems and folk tales. But the adaptation of Frank Miller's comic takes the story to another level. Right from the first scene of Leonidas being trained by his father, till the scene he dies, the movie will keep you breathless, be it the magic of the special effects or the superb dialogs. Gerard Butler and Lena Headley as the Spartan King and Queen are fabulous. Both contrast each other perfectly. Vincent Regan as the Captain is awesome, and the scene where he watches his son die helplessly is so superbly done, every frame of that scene wants you to leap into the movie and help them.<br/><br/>Onto the technical details...<br/><br/>What to say ?? Direction has been superb, the screenplay awesome, casting top notch,acting marvelous. Special mention must be made of the background score,it really reflected the mood of the movie in every possible angle. The cinematography and costume designing were out of the world. And lastly, the visual effects. I already harped on it at the beginning, and I really have to mention it again. Ladies and gents, all who are reading this review, let me tell you, the visual effects shown here are totally out of this world, and I can assure you that you haven't seen any movie with this much quality before. Me thinks they manually edited every frame to put in those effects...<br/><br/>Finally a word for all those who are thinking this movie to be crap. Let me assure you guys and gals, that this is one movie which is a must see. Spend some of your cash and go watch this. Believe me you wont want to miss this.<br/><br/>A well deserving 9/10 !!! (I could give more but I stuck to 9. LOL !!!)"
"RamirBorja","8","3","8","18 March 2007"," Very faithful to Frank Miller's material
","I've been greatly anticipating this movie ever since they show the trailer for the first time last year. The very stylized cinematography really caught my attention. Also it is based on the graphic novel by Frank Miller, author of my favorite movie - Sin City.<br/><br/>After viewing the movie, I'm not disappointed. Forget about the story, it's so simple anybody can get it even without hearing the dialogue. It's about the valiant defense in Thermopylae of 300 Spartans against the rampaging Persian army.<br/><br/>This is epic battle movie at its finest. The battle scenes is so engrossing, It's on par with LOTR's. The beautifully rendered CGI backgrounds and well choreographed actors blends well that it really looked sweet. It's like a painting in motion. I checked the graphic novel where it's based on, and I'm pleasantly surprised that the movie meticulously captured the look and feel of the material, sometimes by frame.<br/><br/>Kudos to Gerard Butler, who played the brave Spartan King Leonidas, and Rodrigo Santoro who played the androgynous Persian King Xerxes. It's entertaining to watch those two whenever they're on a scene.<br/><br/>I have to say this film is so bloody, it will surely turn off those who are sensitive to those things. Also this movie mostly focus on battle scenes and eye candy, so if you're looking for a profound story, please avoid this movie.<br/><br/>Don't wait for this on the DVD. This is one movie I recommend watching in the cinemas. There are details that will be lost if viewed on even a widescreen television. If this ever be featured on IMAX, I'm going to watch this again... it's that good."
"briangcb","Null","3","8","18 March 2007"," In defense of the negative press
","I will start by addressing the negative reviews on this film. I'm sure you've heard by now, how upset Iranians are over the portrayal of Persians in the film. I won't be able to convince them otherwise, their minds have been made up, but if what they say about it turns you off of the movie, or you are of Iranian background, etc....PLEASE read this then make up your mind; First off, the MOVIE is based on a GRAPHIC NOVEL/COMIC BOOK. It is not based on actual historical fact. I don't know much about the actual battle, but I know that this movie doesn't adhere to much fact, I mean if you've seen the commercials, I doubt the Persians actually had giant zombie-like mutant soldiers to unleash. That alone should show you that the film is not done as real life. Like all comic books or war movies, there are at least two enemies. Generally speaking, one is focused as the good guys, the other as the villains. 95% of the time this is done because the film is shown from the point of view of one side. If there was an opposite version of 300 showing the Persians side, I'm sure the Persians wouldn't have an ounce of complaint of them vilifying the Spartans. How many times has this happened before? Saving Private Ryan? practically every war movie showing the side of the Allies, shows the Germans as bad guys. Now that's just the point of view from the allied soldiers. But the German army was just fighting for their country, the only true villains were Hitler, The SS, and the Nazis. Braveheart showed the English as cruel tyrants, every single man, woman, and child. But that doesn't mean they actually were. So keep all these things in mind when watching 300. Remember, it isn't a FACTUAL movie. (Also take into account how many comic books in the 40's showed superheroes kicking hell out of the 'evil' German soldiers.)<br/><br/>Now onto the good stuff; There are outstanding movies in every genre, and this is probably the greatest film in it's genre of epic war films. It stands alone due to its unique qualities, the comic book edge allows for things that haven't been done in battle movies of the same sort, the sound of the film is probably the best ever made for a movie. Every sound has an effect, it penetrates through you, whether it be the Spartan's war cry, Leonidas' giving one of his many welcome speeches, to something as simple as sticking a spear in the ground. You feel it. I have seen this movie twice already, and most likely a third by the time you are reading this. Let me say that I NEVER go see a movie more than once in the theater, no matter how much I am looking forward to it. the only other films I've gone to see more than once was Star wars Episode I, which I saw 4 times...when I was 12. Which is tied with Star Wars: A New Hope when it was re-released, I think I was about 10 for that one.<br/><br/>This has already become my favorite war movie. I am sure many will agree with me, and few won't. But if you haven't seen it yet, I can't tell you not to build it up in your mind so you'd be disappointed, simply because you can't be disappointed! If you think it looks good from the commercial, it is 300x better (no pun intended)."

","The epic is back. The use of symbolism reminds me of some attempts to revitalize the epic in constructivist art in the mid 20th century. The story is wonderfully told and romanticized (and this is done amazingly well). I would give this film a 10, but the storyline is only deserving of maybe a 6 if I'm being generous...but a 9 because of what this film could have catalyzed...And for your visual pleasure, the effects are magnificent...definitely a good film to see in theaters (yet another reason that this film will likely catalyze more of its nature). I don't really have much more to say...now I'm just filling up my ten line minimum requirement for this review. It's a completely different theater experience...even in comparison to Sin City and I'd just recommend for you to go see it to understand what I mean."

I highly recommend seeing this movie, even before it comes out on DVD because it was a very intense movie that most people would enjoy. 300 kept me on the edge of my seat, just waiting to see what would happen next. You could never tell what was going to happen or when the next country was going to attack. Honestly, I thought this movie would just be another ""tough guy"" movie full of gory and blood filled scenes, but there were parts that were very moving. The cast was very well chosen and I think each actor/actress played their parts very well, especially Queen Gorgo, played by Lena Headey.

","This is absolutely the greatest movie of its kind since The Lord Of The Rings. I went into this movie with very high expectations and was still blown away. The biggest question that I had going into it was: How did they film the battle scenes in such a way that it was different, and better, than any other film of its genre? The answer is lots and lots of perfectly executed slow motion. There are many scenes where the camera will simply follow a single spartan as he charges through a wall of Persians, capturing every kill with stunning perfection. The only disappointment I had was the fact that there was some excessive nudity during the opening scenes of the film, I do not believe that this is appropriate for anyone, regardless of age. The reason that I still give this film a perfect 10 despite said nudity is because although the writers made some mistakes in adding that content, the movie is still perfect from a filmmakers standpoint. If you haven't seen 300, see it a.s.a.p, if possible, see it in IMAX. Just use discretion, this is not something I would bring a kid to."
"galahad58","8","3","8","17 March 2007"," Decent Telling -- but inaccurate
","I hope that this movie inspires people to read about the history of the Spartans and the Greek cities that fought bravely against the Persians. I offer this link http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/300_Spartans for those interested to give a brief background and history about the battle. For those not interested in reading, I would suggest renting/buying the 1962 movie ""300 Spartans"" to get a better feel for the historical part of this tale. First, this is a super bastardization of the tale. There is very little historical value whatsoever in this movie or in the graphic novel. If you are looking for historic accounts, do not go to this film. This is pure entertainment--plain and simple. The visualizations are wonderful, the movie is nicely paced and it is highly entertaining. Acting is not at a premium though. Butler just constantly screams into the camera, rather than talking, and he plays his character more like a WWF wrestler than a Greek hero. Most of the dialog came straight out of the historical (see link) quotes or from the 1962 movie. I enjoyed this movie and I could accept 90% of the Hollywood/graphic novel liberties that took the place of historic accuracy. The one thing that I found highly amusing was that the Greeks were not armored clad (as they would have been). As I stated earlier, WWF was more the feel of the movie--muscled men wearing only helmets, but no body armor. Only an idiot soldier would wear just his helmet and history shows that the Spartans did wear beautifully crafted leather armor. I give this movie an 8 for it's entertainment value and it's nicely shot battle scenes. Had there been a little more historical accuracy, and a little better acting, this could have been a 10."
"lastliberal","8","3","8","10 March 2007"," Made for the Big Screen
","I kick myself frequently for missing Frank Miller's Sin City on the big screen. I wish they would bring films like that back occasionally.<br/><br/>Well, I wasn't going to miss this one and I am glad I didn't. It was a beautiful and impressive film. It was no Sin City, but it was an enjoyable way to spend two hours on a Saturday morning.<br/><br/>One is tempted to start reading something into the film. Maybe an allegory about freedom fighters sacrificing their lives against an imperialist machine with their coalition of the bought and paid for and impressive and fearsome weapons, but I will not get drawn into that. I will say that the story of the Spartans at Thermopylae was as exciting as the story of William Wallace in Braveheart.<br/><br/>The scenes with the Oracle were stunning and sensuous and one wants to see more of Kelly Craig. The dialog was typical Hoo Rah and seriously detracted from my enjoyment. I really didn't think the blood and gore was anything you wouldn't find in a video game rated M. It was certainly a lot less than Saving Private Ryan.<br/><br/>All-in-all a good film and nothing that teens couldn't see. It was really a PG13."
"christopherfordm","9","3","8","9 March 2007"," We go backwards in time to go forward in time
","Flat out AMAZING. When I had a moment to think, to make ANY level of comparison to this beautiful achievement - I realized that 300 was to this new technically auspicious century what Flash Gordon must have been to audiences of the 1930's; and then there is the epic Japanese film 'RAN', and then, of course, there is Fritz Lang's 'Metropolis'. The allure of illusion, sumptuously presented. This Sparta, this Greece, is nuanced through an almost Maxfield Parrish setting of pastoral idyll, and mountains of bodies. And what bodies! - although I felt that for the Spartans three body-type versions were synchronized to supposed flesh in post-production, it really didn't matter. While I understand some would have us read into this contemporary war morality issues - I couldn't have cared less (and as for contemporary war morality issues - I care a LOT). This film brought out the wondrous boy in me, and the astounded aesthete. THAT hasn't happened in a very long time. This isn't Leslie Neilson's ('Airplane') gladiator movie.

","This movie was amazing. It was beautiful. But to all you people who are turned off because this movie is not historically accurate, you have to remember that it's not about history, it's about action. The Persians were supposed to be the bad guys, and that is why they were portrayed the way they were. There are some parts that follow history, such as the 300 Spartans fighting off the Persians. Also the Greeks were fighting for freedom, and the Persians did intend to enslave them. The thing that wasn't good about the movie was the sex scene between Leonidas and the queen, it was completely unnecessary and did nothing for the movie. It was like watching soft-core porn, sorry if that offends anybody, but it is true. Overall it is a good movie for over the top action. But if you are looking for a more historically accurate view of the subject, go rent the 1960's film ""The 300 Spartans."" So if it is over the top action and violence you are looking for, go see this movie."
"prayin_for_rain","10","3","8","9 March 2007"," I can not be swayed....
","Running a video store, I see a lot of movies.<br/><br/>Being a total nerd, and lacking a social life, I pride myself on my knowledge of movies, actors, and general things of the like.<br/><br/>I have my favorite movies, and movies that I think are ""The best movie ever."" Well, since I have a lot of time to sit and think about stuff, and since one of my far off dreams is to be a movie critic, I had come to the conclusion that...even though these are my ""favorite"" movies, and the ""best"" movies ever made...all of them have some sort of flaw. There are plot holes, there is filler where it's not needed, movies drag on, and sometimes acting lacks.<br/><br/>This is normal, it's going to happen...in every movie. At least that's how I felt until roughly 2:15a.m.<br/><br/>(Prepare for corny movie ass kissing) I went to see the midnight showing of 300. I could almost end it at that and leaving you guessing as to if the movie contradicts my prior reservations on all movies, even the best of my favorites.<br/><br/>Basically, I went into it having only seen previews, obviously. EVERYONE wants to see this movie based on the previews...in showing how the movie was shot as far as lens filters, and the fact that Frank Miller wrote the graphic novel and directed. Frank Miller also did Sin City, and so people know it's going to be awesome just from that. Although, even though Sin City is one of the coolest movies ever....it follows the guidelines of: Plot holes, Bad Acting, and a general lack of what it needed to actually be a GREAT movie.<br/><br/>Basically, everyone expects that 300 is going to be awesome. Oooh, random chaotic violence and a lot of unheeded gore and bloodshed. That was my assumption at least. And, strange enough, I like movies like that. I'm not a typical girl in that sense.<br/><br/>Getting the point and steering away from droning: In going over it in my head, over and over, pretty much all night (consider my lack of a social life), I can not think of a single thing I did not like about this movie.<br/><br/>The story was there, the plot was full. Those are the key things.<br/><br/>It didn't take it's time to get to the point of the movie by adding agonizing explanation. It explained enough to where you understand what's going on, and what's going to happen. It got to the exciting part of the movie very quickly, and stayed exciting throughout. Oh, and it was definitely the most violent and gruesome movie to ever be put out for public viewing.<br/><br/>Acting? Yeah, there was the presumption that there would be bad actors. There was one: Rodrigo Santora played self assumed God Xerxes...and his acting was MISERABLE...and I wouldn't have wanted it any other way. His acting was made to be OBVIOUSLY terrible...and it fits for the character...Xerxes. He was a man, a mortal who decided himself to be a God of men and therefore immortal. He's meant not to be taken seriously, and therein made to do a bad ""acting"" job for the movie...and therefore the acting was AMAZING on all ends.<br/><br/>The cinematography is just completely unbelievable. You think you can tell from the previews? No way dude. It will blow your mind. This movie could have sucked on all ends but still been tolerable to watch based on the way it was filmed alone. (much like Sin City) And finally...one thing that I can't stand, and it's really not because I'm a girl...it's not, is when there's a lot of random pointless nudity in a movie that is basically only there to draw guys in to see the movie. This movie had it's fair share of nudity, but all of it in good taste and not enough to base the movie's appeal around it. As a matter of fact, I would find this movie more UNappealing for a guy because of how much male exposure there is. No, not full frontal, but my god...if every single one of the 300 did not have a full and solid ripped 8-10 pack. Again, I'm not a typical girl in most senses, but had the movie been terrible...I could have tolerated it based on that alone.<br/><br/>Ending this rant: 300 has most assuredly become the best movie I have ever seen. No, you can not sway me on that. It was perfect. Every aspect. No plot holes, no filler, no real bad acting, and it was appealing to all senses. You leave the movie feeling more powerful...standing an inch or two taller...and it will provide good conversation for a long time to come. Go see it. Go see it twice, it deserves your hard earned dollar.<br/><br/>As for me, the Imax is my next destination to see it again."
"themovieclub","8","3","8","6 March 2007"," A visual spectacle! A graphic adapation! A male movie!
","There are probably 300 reasons why you should watch 300. Based on a graphic novel by Frank Miller, it is loosely based on the Battle of Thermopylae where 300 Spartans fought against the Persians. The odds are against them: A million to 300. Yet the strength, courage, determination and intelligence of the Spartans proved that in war, it isn't always about numbers.<br/><br/>300 will appeal to many. Comic fans should be blown away by the stylish cinematic visual effects, seen previously in Sin City. It stays true to the novel, matched picture by picture. A background of desaturated with high contrast tones of red, visuals filmed almost completely on blue screen, gave a surreal yet bloody look. Look out for a sensual scene between King Leonidas (Gerard Butler) and Queen (Lena Headey), a combination of cartoon-meets-sex.<br/><br/>Its 'epicness' has been compared to the likes of Troy and Lord of the Ring. While perhaps so in magnitude and special effects, it could have been lacking in terms of the story element and a slightly weak screenplay.<br/><br/>People may also find 300 reasons to hate it. The female audience may find 300 to be a violent exhibition with mutilated body parts and chopped hairs. Like a period Saw or Hostel, it may be seen as a display of 'meal market', sadistic and overly-exaggerated.<br/><br/>Before you dismiss it as being unbelievable, the battle did take place in 400 BC with 300 Spartans and 700 Thespian volunteers. The 300 warriors were in fact made up of 150 pairs of 'male-lovers', the king believing that they would fight harder for survival with their loved ones right beside them. This aspect was hinted throughout the film, from a pair of 'male-friends', the androgynous Persian King, and the queen's sacrifice towards the end.<br/><br/>The female's role in the movie was really quite minimal, especially when the film is marred by the queen's lack of acting classes. It can be said as a 'male movie'√¢¬Ä"" which will appeal from the young teenager who loves comic fares and the older men who craves for action, blood, and aggression.<br/><br/>In fact, this movie will inspire me to hit the gym harder right now for that 8 pec abs. This is SPARTA! <br/><br/>300 - A visual spectacle! A graphic adapation! A male movie!"

"Michael_Elliott","Null","5","17","29 May 2011"," Nice Action Film
","300 (2006) <br/><br/>** 1/2 (out of 4)<br/><br/>This adaptation of Frank Miller's graphic novel about three-hundred Spartan fighters who team up to do battle against the much larger Persians. King Leonidas (Gerard Butler) leads the Spartans as they fight to free themselves, their children and the future of their people. This film is basically a remake of the 1962 film THE 300 SPARTANS, which is probably unknown to many of the people who made this Zack Synder film a monstrous hit when it was first released. It's really pointless to compare the two films because both are going for something else so labeling this a ""remake"" might be unfair. With that said, I can certainly understand why many people would love this movie but to me there just wasn't enough of a connection to where I'd say I had a good time watching it. I'll admit that the battle scenes are full of great action and one can be impressed with their visual style but that's about all this movie was to me. Nothing but pure visual masturbating and after a while I need something more than just nice images. None of the characters are people we can care for. Why should we care for them? Because the movie tells you they're the good guys. There isn't a single character here that goes through any sort of development and even worse is that the majority of what we're looking out is just some sort of CGI creation so it's even harder to feel anything for them. Roger Ebert notes in his review a good point as it seems the bodies of the actors are all CGI so that they all feature a six pack. Is there a particular reason why the filmmakers thought all three-hundred of these men would have the same body style? I'm sure fans would say that the look is done on purpose and perhaps it was but it's just another example of why I personally couldn't connect to them. Yes, the effects are terrific but again, I just need something more than that. The performances are also fairly hard to judge because they don't have too much to work with and you also have to wonder how much is them and how much is a computer. I'm sure much of this sounds rather harsh and I'm sure it's fair to say that people aren't coming to a movie like this for a story, acting or any type of character development. That's fine but to me there's only so much a visually impressive film can do and that's what makes this a film worth viewing once but while you're going through it it's just hard to care for anything you're seeing."

","Let me first say that I had a blast watching this movie. The battles were fun, and it was a great time. But that's it. It was like watching wrestling (if I liked wrestling). There was absolutely nothing to take away from it. Sin City did the whole graphic novel thing much, much better and Peter Jackson owns, OWNS digital cinematography. 300 has nothing on the LOTR trilogy (and I am really not a big fan of the films, but I think that they are very well made).<br/><br/>The acting is sub-par and the film does drag on a bit. Like I said, it was a fun time at the movies, but when I left, I never gave it a second thought. These people who are calling it an instant classic? No way. Sorry, it just didn't bring enough to the table."

","I was interested in seeing 300. After seeing it, did I like it? Sort of. Starting with the good things, it is visually, technically and stylistically amazing with wonderful costumes and sets. The battle sequences are superbly shot and quite realistic, and the music and acting(the protagonist played by Gerard Butler is very charismatic) are decent, as is the direction. Plus there are some compelling parts in the story, and the script has its moments. However, 300 is not very well paced, in fact for me it was quite slow and pedestrian in places, while there are one two many clich√©s and stereotypes, one or two them I agree bordered on offensive. Overall, it was an okay film but it didn't wow me. 6/10 Bethany Cox"

","""300"" is a fantastic film and stays true to its graphic novel roots. Excellent performances are turned in by all the actors and actresses in the film, which clearly has brilliant directing. Still one can't quite be rid of the nagging expectation of the words ""Dolce & Gabanna"" appearing in the bottom corner of the screen. The whole film did smack slightly of a perfume advert, but this is not nessescarily a bad thing. The much advertised gore did not appear real as it simply flew through the air then disappeared before hitting the ground or physical other physical objects. On an emotional level, the film lacked conviction, almost keeping the audience at arms length, which was a shame. Overall, a rip-roaring graphic novel remake.

","300 is the first film of it's kind since about 1965! In the late 50's and early 60's, the Italian cinema was dominated by sword and sandal epics. These movies were very popular back then.<br/><br/>There have been movies made close to the genre (Alexander, Gladiator etc.) but none of them capture the feel quite like 300 does. The lighting and colors are very bleak, it contains many slow motion scenes, both of which add to the movie immensely, and holds strong to it's connection with the graphic novel. The soundtrack is very moving (good to see a movie with some heavy rock sounds) and compels the viewer put his/her popcorn down and hit the gym! It's an exciting adrenaline rush from start to finish. The acting is excellent for this type of movie, with lines screamed out of with immense passion and feeling.<br/><br/>10 is not enough of a rating for this film. If I could, I'd give it a 300!"
"mach37-2","2","4","13","13 March 2007"," I'll wait to see the last half on DVD
","This review is based on the first 30 minutes; I walked out about the time the hunchback was talking to Leonidas about wanting to fight for him. I thought this movie seemed very much like a comic book, and then found through these other IMDb reviews that it WAS based on a comic book! The sensual half-naked female dancing early on seemed out of place and almost pornographic, and the sex scene that followed struck me as totally unnecessary, at least the way it was inserted into the film. I suppose that today's young movie-goers will love it, but from my experience of watching 60+ years of movies this was the highest technical-quality B-movie I've ever seen. The closeups of nearly everyones' faces was technically excellent, but the monotone of the color (lack of color) and high contrast finally bored the hell out of me. It seemed like the sun never shone and all the lighting was from a very low angle, and then it was filtered by fog or clouds or precipitation; just too artfully stylized and contrived lighting. Overall what I saw was very much like the original ""King of Kings"" by Cecil B. DeMille, only with sharper image quality, and electronic sound track. Come to think of it, the pictorial style seemed to be modeled closely in the style of the baroque painter Caravaggio. But, again, without the use of color.<br/><br/>I will wait to see the rest of the movie when it comes out on DVD, so I can fast-forward through the tedious parts, of which there seem to be a lot according to other reviewer's accounts."

So the whole thing against mysticism and oracles is just anti-pagan propaganda. 5. Why do the immortals look like ninjas? They don't. 6. Xerxes did not talk to Leonidas.

","...I loved it. I've been waiting since November to see this movie and I finally got a chance to last night. I thought the script, and how they had the narrator, was excellent; the battle sequences were spectacularly filmed; and how they shot the movie with the backgrounds was amazing. I've read the graphic novel, and I have to say I enjoyed that they gave Gorgo more screen time, particularly a certain scene towards the end. Other than some added scenes, most was taken directly from the novel- sometimes translating exactly to on-screen scenes.<br/><br/>It didn't hurt that all the guys were ripped. ;) But honestly, I thought this movie has something for everyone: action, a love story, and some comedy.<br/><br/>As a classics major and someone who is fairly well educated in history, I can say I had no problem with this film. First, in quite a few respects it was not totally off. Where it was, it was for entertainments sake. Another thing that helped me come to terms is that they've said from the beginning that it was not attempting to be historically accurate, unlike other ""historical"" films."

","I saw this movie today, on opening day. Having seen the HBO First Look I knew what to expect visually, and I knew that the movie was not attempting to be historically accurate. With expectations set, I was ready for exactly what the film delivered: intense action, powerful characters, and a grand story with a point to make about sacrifice.<br/><br/>That's right: sacrifice. Sure, the dialog is about freedom. It's about Spartan Law. It's about standing against a tyrant as free men. But the real theme is about the kind of person or people who would intentionally sacrifice everything they had, not for glory or honor, but for the sake of everything they hold dear. Everything down to the explanation of how a phalanx works -- ""every man protects the man to his left, from knee to shoulder"" is about interdependency, being part of something bigger than yourself, and being willing to sacrifice yourself for that very thing.<br/><br/>The movie earns its ""R"" rating in just about every way (except, amusingly, the utter lack of foul language). It also earns the right to be called an excellent movie."

"the-movie-guy","10","4","13","8 March 2007"," Make the correct choice and see ""300"" - AAHOOOOO!!!
","(My Synopsis) ""300"" is based on a true event, the Battle of Thermopylae, which took place in August of 480 B.C. in Greece. King Leonidas took his personal fighting force of 300 Spartans to their certain death to fight against the invading Persian army of King Xerxes. The Persians had an army of over a million men with the intent to enslave the people of Greece and make it part of the Persian Empire. This small force of brave men along with some Greek allies blocked the Thermopylae Pass which was the only road that King Xerxes could travel to get to the major Greek cities. The Spartan's last stand showed the world their extraordinarily valor and great sacrifice against tremendous odds which united all of Greece to defeat the Persian invaders. As the Spartan Women would say, ""Come home with your shield or on it."" ""AAHOOOOO!!!"" <br/><br/>(My Comment) The story is awesome and incredible that speaks to the age-old battle between good and evil. The movie is slow at first, but the pace speeds up and before you know it, the 2 hour movie is over. There are a number of short battle scenes that are intense and keep your attention and the action moving and interesting. I actually jumped around in my seat as if I were in the battle with the Spartans. This battle is a perfect example of what our soldiers of today must have and know when fighting a war. They must have better training and equipment then the enemy, and knowledge of how to use the terrain to their advantage. This battle is exactly the same story the U.S. is facing today, when we are faced with choices between compromise and war. The entire Spartan army was not sent into battle because they were celebrating the Carneian Festival, and the rest of the Greek allies were celebrating the Olympic Festival. When you are fighting for freedom and democracy, you must make the right choice. This movie is not a factual history lesson, but I would hope that people that see the movie will go a little further and research the historic facts about the battle as I did. It was estimated that about 20,000 Persians were killed at this battle. The true facts and figures may be hard to come by since this battle happen 2,486 years ago. As with any war, there is an enormous amount of killing in this movie with severed heads and limbs being cut off with swords. The special effects are spectacular and please do not take your children to see this movie. (Warner Bros. Pictures, Run time 1:57, Rated R)(10/10)"

"imbluzclooby","3","7","28","24 March 2007"," Utterly Preposterous Hokum.
","After having seen numerous deaths, dozens of decapitations, dozens of dismembered body parts, impalings and gallons of blood spewing from bodies with the aid of CGI, my jaw dropped with anguish. This is the kind of anguish you get when you've lost hope in something that tries so hard to be grand. Do the makers of ""300"" understand anything about 'subtlety', and the effectiveness of when to show constraint on jarring violence and bloodshed? I could care less if this is adapted from a comic source, from a another story and loosely based on some historic fact. This movie in no way represents anything that is plausible, realistic or even thoughtful. We have a bunch of Shakespearean actors clad in skimpy warrior clothing fighting, blurting idiot dialogue, and behaving like brain-washed Cretans. This film is somehow capitalizing on the popularity of the technical waves of movie making in the post 2000 era. But if that is not all, it's shrouding itself in a form of pretentiousness whilst pouring on the visual effects, combining unrealistic carnage and relentlessly showing non-stop war. The music is also execrable. What this film achieves in technical merit fails in character development, story, and believable acting. You know this story is threadbare when it has to be narrated 60% of the time. The narrator's voice proves annoying after 90 minutes and the meaning of his dialogue should be presented to 3rd graders listening to a library oration. It's real stupid. I highly doubt any of the costumes were authentic. I took a class in historical costumes in college and these garments resembled something more suited for a gay costume party. Butler plays his King Leonitus big, by ranting and raving with his histrionics. This is a good talent that was put to waste in such a moronic movie. All the other actors are weak and one-dimensional which just adds to the poor storyline. My biggest peeve is that there are people who are stupid enough to believe this is respectable and dignified art, when in reality it's nothing more than a violent cartoon espousing virtues of killing, war and murder. In an age where we have attained a heightened sense of moral balance, this film ideologically takes us back to a primitive state. It's frighteningly preposterous, because it takes itself so seriously, you have to wince at it's heavy-handed boldness. It tirelessly expels its convictions without letting up. There is nothing humorous or lighthearted about ""300"". I think this movie relied solely on hype and a showy marketing trailer. As the King of Sparta leads his 300 Spartan best on a revolt against the Persian armies, we see how a cartoonist illustrates a very fantastic and overblown depiction of how wars were fought. The result is that the battle scenes are redundant with far too many slow motion sequences. None of this looks remotely realistic. The result is that everyone and everything looks ridiculous. 300 borrows shamelessly from other movies such as Braveheart, Lord of the Rings, Hunchback of Notre Dame, Sin City, Gladiator, too name a few. But that is what 300 is, a ripoff. It's a completely plagiaristic attempt to scatter every major box-office hit into one two-hour hodgepodge of a flick. I would be merciful to this disaster if it had humor, sensuality, or likable characters. Unfortunately it does not contain few redeeming qualities other than its blatant impudence to ripoff an unsuspecting public."

","If you're wanting an accurate history lesson, or a mind-boggling plot, then I would give '300' a miss, but seeing as I went along for the special effects and Gerard Butler's deep Scottish tones, I was not disappointed in the slightest. Firstly, the special effects are amazing, especially the frequent blood splatters that are flung across the screen. The soundtrack is amazing as well, really adding to the drama of the battle scenes and the tenderness of the bedroom scenes.<br/><br/>David Wenham does a brilliant job of narrating the film, but it was some of Gerard Butler's speeches that sent chills up and down my spine. The constant blood-lust is toned down slightly by the flicks back to Sparta, but the film never lingers too long.<br/><br/>In summary it is a fast-moving, special effects feast. True, the dialogue might be a bit dodgy in places, but a viewer can forgive this quite easily. And before anyone start complaining, the background to the film is meant to look like its computer-generated. That's the whole point, and it allows Zack Snyder to emphasise the contrast between the characters."
"traitor_ns","10","3","9","2 April 2007"," best movie ever
","I just returned from the cinema, and what I saw was a pure perfection. I couldn't believe how such a simple event could be so interesting. Imagination used in this movie is genius, action is flawless and you can take any scene and make a marvelous picture of it. Everything is so cool, and precise like in a very good comic book or illustration. Story is another thing. It goes so well, no better start, no better ending, I was just let breathless after the movie. Cast is also picked very good. So many muscled men that act that fine made it look best possible. Music takes movie to another level, when you hear guitar distorsion in the middle of the battle, adrenalin jumps so high, you want to battle yourself. I gotta see it again, that's for sure."
"Rooinek","9","3","9","1 April 2007"," The greatest epic movie ever made?
","I actually find it hard to believe some of the comments regarding this brilliant movie.<br/><br/>For those who feel the characters weren't developed enough, I think you're missing the point. The Spartans weren't individualists and they fought as a single unit on the battlefield. The character of the Spartans as a whole was very well developed, right from the first scene when they were ""inspected"" through to their harsh combat training and the emotional and physical sacrifices they made. Also, King Leonidas' character was very well developed to the extent that you could predict how he would react to situations . . . always with honour, conviction and courage.<br/><br/>Then there are those who complain about the historical accuracy of the movie. The movie wasn't based on historical events, it was based on Frank Miller's graphic novel. If he took a few liberties with the truth then write him a letter, don't blame the movie which portrayed his version faithfully.<br/><br/>And then there are the politically correct toadies who are whining about the ""propaganda"". Again, the movie was based on Frank Miller's graphic novel, so why weren't these same crybabies complaining about the graphic novel? Just because the movie has a far wider audience doesn't change the fact that it was based on a book written long before the war in Iraq.<br/><br/>I rated this movie a ""9"" and I'd recommend it to anyone. It has great acting, it's a great story and it is beautifully directed. My new favourite epic movie, better than Braveheart and MUCH better than the limp ""Troy""."
"bsinc","9","3","9","31 March 2007"," 300...one hell of a movie experience - If you know what to expect!
","If you know that ""300"" is based on a graphic novel, if you know that that comic book itself was directly inspired by true and truly ""inspiration-worthy"" events that took place in Greece some 2500 years ago, then you're almost certainly in for a big treat. If, however, you'll resent the sometimes imaginative touches and elements in this movie for not being hardcore historically accurate then I suggest you leave ""300"" for another day.<br/><br/>The rest, hopefully, should be history...and as incredible as the true last-stand at Thermopilae already was, the fact that this movie, as grand and epic as is, for the most part remains surprisingly faithful to the actual facts, is indeed worth a praise. After reading ""300"" graphic novel series I subjectively conclude that Frank Miller's comic served Mr. Snyder more as a guide, and not as the goal. The movie skillfully uses the rather spartanesquely scant, yet powerfully written comic but also manages to integrate novelties to even further commemorate the legacy that the military state of Sparta has left behind. There's further reading to be found in places like wikipedia and it's more than worth your time...I can only laugh at accusations regarding the movie and current political affairs, but to each his own. <br/><br/>What Zack Snyder's ""300"" managed to do is combine the absolute best of both the pure historical facts (the legacy of Spartans) and historically-inspired fiction (the ""300"" novels) to bring the mother of war stories to the big screen. He knew exactly how to do it, made the best use of every scene and moments, carefully steered away from pathetic ones, found one hell of a ""Leonidas"" and gave the most courageous last-stand in history just the right dose of magic to turn it into a unbelievable and unique tale...whoever knows what the REAL ""300"" did knows what I'm trying to say...it was them who performed the real magic.<br/><br/>A great testosterone movie that surprisingly pays true homage to bravery, honor and glory.<br/><br/>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Thermopylae"

According to the historians the battles in ancient battlefields looked like we've seen in this movie. Shield to shield, and some stab to the enemy. The characters do not develop, why should they? This is not the movie you if you want to see deep thoughts, or great characters: go to a video store and get a Lars von Trier Movie. There are good guys and bad guys, and traitors, monsters, what else do we need?<br/><br/>Many people say that the history was different: this is not the history! This is the way the Spartans wanted to see this event.

","i just came back from the theater (after waiting one hour in line though we went to the very late show) and to tell u the truth im as speechless as a baby. this movie brings you to the edge of ur seat from the very first moment till the very last, the scenes were unrelaxing, the gore is beyond bearable, the emotional drain is totally uncomfy, but those elements together is what made this movie the best i've seen since 2003...you ARE suppose to be unrelaxed and uncomfortable while watching 300 men fighting an army of a million..a true manhood standing for freedom and glory. before you go there u need to forget the true story (assuming u read it) as there was so much elements added in the movie just to bring more action and drain more blood which was fine by me and my friends. what made me smile -out of self sympathy- is that we saw the king or the leader always at the top of his army in the very first raw during the battle..not playing golf in a ""white house"" while we die somewhere else for ""him"". this movie is about honor and glory and how a man is never afraid to die for his nation and his land...its about true men, and please don't listen to those who criticize the excessive use of CGI, it was the best we've seen and it made the movie the way it is.<br/><br/>P.S. don't u dare to even think about taking ur kids to this movie..most of the scenes were way beyond disturbing."
"screenmonkey2099","7","3","9","26 March 2007"," Think people
","People, this is a fun, mindless battle flick, plain and simple. It was a good movie to see, but not a 10 (sorry thats for a true classic film in my opinion).<br/><br/>For those that are bashing it for various reasons allow me to shed some light (hopefully)....<br/><br/>1) The Narrator drove you crazy.<br/><br/>The story is being told by the one ""survivor"" that was sent back to his troops as they prepare to battle the Persian army that has entered Greece and is about to ravage the area. this is AFTER the rest of 300 folks... and he is telling the tale to his men to inspire them, hence the storytelling aspect.<br/><br/>2) As the the ""monsters"" in the Persian army.<br/><br/>Again, its being told by the lone ""survivor"" of the 300 to his men. He is demonizing the forces that battled his friends and king for three days. In times of war the enemy is often demonized to make it easier to kill them or desire to battle them.... <br/><br/>3) Not historically accurate.<br/><br/>Um... what part of based on the comic book did you not understand? <br/><br/>4) The coloring/lighting/scenery was so crappy.<br/><br/>Again, this was done to reflect the COMIC BOOK. For those that say, why didn't they put more accuracy and no fantasy elements, then it wouldn't be the concept they desired, it would be a totally different movie... the movie rights were bought based on the comic, and they wanted that comic in film form. They did a great job in this. As to the blood and gore, it was pure comic, like the blood splatters hit the pages.<br/><br/>5) Stupid things, such as, why would the traitor carry the coins with him?<br/><br/>Correct he most likely would not, he would hide them at home... but again, its a COMIC book tale. I can imagine a scene in a comic where the damning evidence spills out along with his blood in a panel very easily. You are nitpicking because you fail to grasp the concept of COMIC book adaption.<br/><br/>6) Homophobia/Homoerotiscm.<br/><br/>Hmmm yes there was none of that in Gladiator or Troy... or even Braveheart... (hell even X-men has it...)riiiiiight. Yes it is in the movie, but only to the extent you want to see it... I picked up on the jokes made about the Athenians and such, but as to the buff men and battle... well sorry, they were in great shape, the products of pure military society, thats what I saw. Did Spartans have ""boy lovers""? probably yes, but does it make a difference either way? No. The mocking of the other Greek city-states was to show that the Spartans thought they were better than all of them. Remember these city states battled each other constantly before the Persians came.<br/><br/>7) Bad dialogue.<br/><br/>What do you want? its a flick about a horrid battle that lasted 3 days... I'm sure there was lots of yelling and cheesy inspirations being shouted. Along with insults and mockery of their foes. I would rather have it this way, then like in say the movie ""The Thin Red Line"" where every g-dang soldier is waxing poetic like he is Shakespeare...<br/><br/>Yes Persia was very advanced and not comprised of demons. Yes Spartans wore breastplates (complete with abs!). Yes Xerxes was a giant and freakish in his appearance, but did he look the god king? Yeah! He was 9 ft tall and imposing. If you saw androgynous looks to be homosexual, then you fail to grasp the idea of many ""godllike"" beings being shown in this way.<br/><br/>Enjoy it for what it is folks, a fun, mindless, battle movie, that is VERY LOOSELY based on history, and very much based on a..... (wait for it)....<br/><br/>COMIC BOOK!!!!"
"badbud","10","3","9","26 March 2007"," This movie is really good
","Well to begin with the only thing that i found exxagerated is the monsters that Persians had which i found very normal for a Hollywood movie. Therefore the movie is accurate according to the history that Greek students learn at school (i am a Greek guy as u understand). In Thermopiles 300 Spartans fought against 100.000+ Persians. Not one million!!! It says that in the movie !!!! In the end, in the battle in Plataies. (Where it says that 40.000 fought in analogy 3-1 against the Persians). Also it was Efialtis that betrayed them. And yes,OK, you can find it brutal that all the problematic kids where kill. But that was Sparta. Thats why a small town was the one two biggest powers of the times. And i can add that Sparta was the only city that didn't have wall to protect it. It was a sign of their power. Also Sparta was the only city that women were so recognized and mother and wife was a holy and respected thing. Why no one comments about that? In the end the movie was great, historical accurate with really good action. People comment that how can 300 fight against so many?? Well i am telling u if a child is being raised a warrior with the idea that dying for your country is the highest honor how can he be beaten? Remember that they were fighting mostly against slaves of the Persian empire, not warriors."

"silksmooth12","10","3","9","25 March 2007"," The Bane of Liberalism
","I don't know about the rest of you comment-surfers out there, but after going through the reviews, a common golden thread was identified. Liberals HATE this movie! Every time you see a negative rant about this masterpiece, look closely; you will no doubt find some liberal talking point, or some liberal-induced paranoid hysteria about how movies like this are intentional Hollywood conservative propaganda. Wait...did I just follow ""Hollywood"" with ""conservative"" and keep a straight face? Quick, someone call the mayor so we can award Michael Moore the key to the conservative city of LaLa Land. One liberal even whines about how Karl Rove somehow has a hand in this film. Another liberal claims homophobia; which I cannot even construct a mildly testable scientific hypothesis that would support this paradigm. Yet another liberal actually starts to squirt tears about how all the women of the Persian Empire are portrayed as sex slaves. As far as anyone with a functional Prefrontal Cortex can tell, that's a step up from the modern Muslim female role of rape victim! Get a life liberals. We've had to endure plenty of your crackpot films which you actually have the audacity to pass off as the truth. No one is claiming this is anything more than entertainment and yet you are in a seething uproar.<br/><br/>On to the film, and I will make this simple: My girlfriend's favorite movie is Father of the Bride. This is a film your humble narrator just about has memorized line for line at this point. She is a tried and true girlie girl and lover of all things feminine. She laps up a steady stream of vomit from whimsical female Cosmo and Sex and the City toilet bowls. Expecting a totally different response upon leaving the theater I ask her (in vain I thought at the time) what she thought of the movie. After three heads get chopped off, on-screen boobies, no girl meets guy guy does something stupid sad montage they get back together storyline, and countless graphic stabbings; to my bewilderment she responds, ""I would go to see that again."" Case closed."
"p_pagani","10","3","9","24 March 2007"," This one's great...Trust me, I'm a historian
","Although the press has given this movie a very hard time about not being historically accurate, nothing can be further from the truth, keeping in mind the movie was based not on Herodotos but on a comic book. The Spartans are brilliantly showed in the first 20 minutes, there is a scene where a pitched battle begins, when the advancing army hits the shield wall of the phalanx with a great bang, pushing them back. Also the swiftness with which the Spartans stand to attention is striking. The fact that the chest plating is missing can be caused by the 19th century painting by Louis David, or because it just looks better. There is shot of Leonidas' but in there that looks like the sculpture of a famous Greek sculptor, who depicted Hercules. The movie contains more of these subtle but to the trained eye amusing references. It is of course silly that Persians look like Sudanese or Etheopians, and that they hurled rhino's and demons into battle, but that is the comic talking. If you keep in mind that there are a lot of obvious comic-based things in this picture, you can filter it out for yourself. But the position of Spartan women is actually quite striking, they did have almost the same rights as men. I would show students the first half hour to illustrate Spartan warfare and their laws and habits. That should count for something, the rest is provided by the magnificent lighting and adding of color to the black and white movie. To end one needs to state that Leonidas is in fact a real person, in the movie he does show feeling and intellect. After seeing the trailer I was really pleased (and relieved) to discover he did. I have always been a fan of Leonidas at Thermopylae... that's why I went to study Ancient History. So trust me on this one ;)"

"dustinguerri","2","3","9","23 March 2007"," A Failure On All Levels
","""300""'s unforgivable central flaw is its stubborn protagonization of its battle scenes to the detriment of all the other elements of the film. Not even elements as essential as plot or acting are deemed important enough in a film too self-aware of its look, and too determined to impress visually.<br/><br/>A two-hour feature film cannot be sustained solely on the occasional handsome fighting sequence. Moreover, by the time the Spartans start battling with the Persian army, the spectator knows too little of any of the characters to really invest any emotional interest in the outcome of the war. None of the warriors' backgrounds are developed, or even mentioned. Leonidas doesn't appear to have a second dimension to his personality. And the combat skills of the ""300"" are so incredible and cartoonish that it is impossible to feel for them or even begin to empathize with their experience of the war. This, together with the video-game-like, fetishistic style of violence, produces an effect of detachment and uninvolvement in the spectator with respect to the battle scenes.<br/><br/>The visual production is another element that has been pushed heavily in the film, yet it is not a unique look. We have already seen scorched skies, golden cornfields, navy-blue spectral nightscapes and crimson bloodshed in ""Troy"" and ""Gladiator"". The use of music is too obvious and manipulative, marking far too clearly what emotion is expected of the viewer at each point in the film.<br/><br/>Not even CGI has been put to good use, since you can spot precisely when it has abundant presence, instead of being used sparingly and effectively in an integrated fashion. CGI worked much more convincingly and excitingly visually in ""Sin City"" because that film, from the outset, made clear to the viewer that its story was operating in a completely different, graphic-novel based world, whereas ""300"" is assumed to take place in a more or less realistic world."

"asiwsguitar","10","3","9","18 March 2007"," Simply amazing!
","Let me first begin by addressing the criticisms that this movie has gotten. I've heard many attack the plot, saying that it is non-existent. Okay, nothing could be further from the truth. The story is there, you just have to know what to look for. 300 contains a beautifully epic story about honor, sacrifice and heroism. The characters give their lives for something greater than themselves; the fight for freedom, and the salvation of their people. This movie, by no means, possesses a plot line as well written as, say, The Shawshank Redemption, because, unlike that movie, this movie does not hinder on the story. Also, many people have attacked the historical imperfections in the film. Okay, it is based on a comic book, not the actual events. Plus, the point of the movie isn't to be historically accurate, taking all viewpoints into consideration, the point is the story of the 300 Spartans, and how they viewed everything. And what is this whole political aspect that everyone is going crazy over? Calling the film fascist and racist is absurd. The Persians were depicted as the enemy in this film, because they were the enemy! Persia, at this time, was set on world domination, and expanding their empire to the furthest corners of the world. To The Spartans, they were an invading force, and to them, the people the movie revolved around, Persia was their enemy.<br/><br/>Now, to talk directly about the film, the special effects were absolutely breath-taking. Never before have I seen such beauty in a film. Some of the scenes were so amazing it made me want to cry. If nothing else, this movie will win an Oscar for best cinematography. Also, The action scenes were absolutely brutal, I loved every second of the violence. This movie is like The Matrix on speed.<br/><br/>Basically, this was an amazing film, with an amazing storyline (whether or not you're intelligent enough to realize it), cutting-edge special effects, and enough action and violence to keep you on the edge of your seat, smiling from ear to ear.<br/><br/>300 is definitely a must-see. 11/10"

It is heavy on the blood spatter, spearing, amputations, and decapitations. The cinematography and art direction is fantastic. I really liked the use of electric guitar and slow motion to emphasize the art of killing and to intensify situations. The slow motions is what really expresses the fact that these 300 men are not only Spartans (the finest warriors of all Greece), but they are Sparta's BEST. The 300 are cut to look like Olympic athletes. Their helmets are menacing and their spears and shields are intimidating. The characters were executed very well. Each character had their own depth. The visuals are gorgeous. The filters and the clever positioning of the sun was put the right emphasis on the right things at the right moment. The story is very heroic and inspiring.

Historians would likely have a field day ripping this movie apart.<br/><br/>The story follows Frank Millars 300 comic pretty damn closely, most scenes are composed to get the greatest stylised impact possible. The characters are made bigger than life and there are some pretty ridiculous additions to the cast (disfigured immortals, man with swords for hands, giant monsters to name a few) this just further reminds you that this is a fantasy movie ""loosely"" based on true events.<br/><br/>The pace of the movie was timed perfectly and almost 2 hours rushes by without you noticing, the movies action set pieces are well executed and main characters are given just enough background for you to care about them.<br/><br/>One downside to this movie is the occasional narration by David Wenham's character, who although a great actor does not possess the worlds greatest speaking voice. His tales of heroism and self sacrifice are almost made comical by the squeaky tones of his voice.<br/><br/>If you want to enjoy a manly tale of heroics and self sacrifice then look no further, this movie is an inspiring addition to cinemas greatest."
"jmsfan","10","3","9","15 March 2007"," A great, entertaining film!
","First up, as has been stated before, if you're going for a totally accurate tale of the 300 Spartans facing off against King Xerxes' Persian army of thousands, then you may be disappointed. This movie is based on Frank Miller's fine comic/graphic novel which was based on his childhood love of a film, ""The 300 Spartans."" Okay, that aside, this is a mind-blowing film, full of beautiful visuals, thrilling battles, beautiful women and fine acting. Gerard Butler plays King Leonidas, who, in defiance of his corrupt holy men advising him not to go to war, goes anyway, saying ""He's going for a walk and taking 300 of his personal bodyguard with him."" :) Leonidas is a classic movie hero who will not back down nor give an inch. He's got his mission and he's sticking to it. A bit refreshing that we don't have to see his flaws or weaknesses like many movie heroes these days.<br/><br/>Lena Headey is stunning as Queen Gorgo, Leonidas' wife, who tries to rally the council of Sparta to her husband's cause. Not a weak, stay-behind-and-worry-about-your-man type of woman at all. A very strong character and very easy on the eyes.<br/><br/>Dominic West is slimy as the member of the council who tries to manipulate things to his advantage as he butts heads with Gorgo.<br/><br/>David Wenham, Faramir from the second and third Lord of the Rings movies is Dilios, Leonidas' good friend, soldier, and master of storytelling, who narrates the whole proceedings.<br/><br/>Rodrigo Santoro is King Xerxes of Persia, who considers himself a god on earth. The filmmakers certainly make him imposing, looking ten-feet tall up against Leonidas. He is also made, despite his giant frame, to look somewhat effeminate with his eye makeup and jewelry.<br/><br/>Okay, now down to it. The battles are fantastic, with Leonidas using his brawn AND brain to overpower the massive hordes of Persians. The wall of bodies scene is super, as is the initial use of shields to thwart Persian arrows. The visuals, with ample use of CGI, are incredible. Blood spurts, limbs fly, heads rolls, bodies are impaled, and it's all done...artfully and is not sick-inducing.<br/><br/>The movie is almost all action, some fast-paced, some slow-mo, all great. By the end of the movie I was almost cheering, particularly the final scene.<br/><br/>See this movie on the big screen. Do NOT wait for DVD. I will buy it when it's released but I won't forget the big screen experience."

","I enjoyed this movie because it was based on a great story and didn't have all the typical Hollywood fluff. Hollywood pumps out so many movies that are close to the same or just poor story lines with intense graphics. I am sick of seeing pretty people that can't act. I think this movie will make a great amount of money and then maybe we will see some competition against movies that pay 30 million to an actor for a generic performance. I would love to see some more historical, well done computer generated movies. I did not know it was all computer done till I read it on the net. The actors did a very good job. I believe they managed to find actors who they didn't have to pay millions of dollars that are just as good actors. So much of what makes actors demand high dollars is being in the right movies with the right directors. I do enjoy movies set in real life scenery but, they tricked me a few times in this maovie making me think it was actually real natural background."

The Persians had some kind of hand grenades. The Persians are presented being some kind of androgynous or homosexual freaks. No surprise that Iranians are mad about this movie. And BTW, the Spartans were the homosexuals (they used love between soldiers in order to boost morale and bravery). Oh . I forgot about the big fat monster with blades growing from his hands.

","Ever since I saw the trailer for ""300"" I couldn't wait for it to come out. I even read the comic and thought it was pretty cool but was worried about how it would translate to a two-hour movie. After seeing it, I feel let down.<br/><br/>The visuals are impressive but try to carry the movie and, in the end, cannot. They mask a weak plot that has wooden, one-dimensional characters and action that is really cartoonish and too much like a video game. Do you expect me to believe there are 250,000 Persians, but they fight the Spartans one at a time?<br/><br/>The subplot with the Queen kills the movie. It adds nothing to the story of the Battle and comes across painfully as a filler. It almost felt like ""300"" was two separate movies; one about the Battle, and a totally unrelated one about the Queen. I couldn't help but feel the movie would have been much better if they spent more time developing some of the minor characters like Dilios, Eliphates, Stelios, and the Captain to make the climax more engaging.<br/><br/>""300"" is a letdown to say the least. Save your money and watch the trailer again; it's much more entertaining than the actual movie."
"Professor_Mamba","10","3","9","13 March 2007"," Wildly Inaccurate, but...
","Beautiful. <br/><br/>This movie is about the famous last stand of the Spartans in the Thermopylae Pass, a narrow pass with a sheer cliff wall on one side, and a deadly fall into the ocean on the other. The Battle of Thermopylae is one of the most famous last-stands in history, it pits approximately 7000 Greek soldiers, led by the most brutal warriors Greece had to offer (The 300 Spartans), against an impossibly large Persian force, records and estimates of its size indicate that it was somewhere between 300,000 to 2,000,000 men. Most modern historians agree that it was likely around 400,000. The 7000 Greeks, with the Spartans at their front, fought for several days, killing an estimated 20,000-25,000 before falling themselves.<br/><br/>Now to the review:<br/><br/>This is one of the most visually stunning movies I've ever seen, it looked fantastic. It was fast-paced, exciting, and very gory. The movie didn't make me think about the deeper meanings of life, but I definitely left the theater feeling incredibly satisfied.<br/><br/>""300"" was very inaccurate to the actual battle, but it did not cast a negative light on the film. If anything, it made the movie more enjoyable. Watching trailers for this movie, I saw monsters, elephants, and rhinos, and I was scared that were destroying the actual story of Thermopylae. However, once I actually saw the movie, I realized that the use of these monsters was only to exaggerate the actual strength and might of the Persian army, and in no way negatively influenced the film. The elephants and rhinos played a very small role in the film, and I actually found myself glad that they were included.<br/><br/>This movie was very, very good. The visual effects were amazing, the battles were well choreographed, and the soundtrack was near-perfect.<br/><br/>Plot: 10/10 (Based off of a real battle)<br/><br/>Acting: 7/10<br/><br/>Dialogue: 8/10<br/><br/>Special Effects: 10/10<br/><br/>Choreography (In battle): 10/10<br/><br/>Cinematography: 10/10<br/><br/>Soundtrack: 9/10<br/><br/>""Cool"" Factor: 10/10"

"jjt6212","4","3","9","12 March 2007"," beating me over the head
","300 is a beautiful film by visual style and choreography. The plot is set up in a framed structure. We here the story from one of the 300 that was sent back to tell the tale. The weakest part of the entire film for me was the narration. His voice was perfect but a lot of what he said, in my opinion should have been cut out. It took a lot of the intensity out of the film. Epic films are epic because they take place on a large scale, tell a large story, and are about great change. 300 had all of these elements. But instead of standing still they also had to tell me it was epic. A lot of the moments in this film would have been much better if they were left to stand on their own. But every character in every scene was trying to create amazing one liners. And just because you're yelling does not mean you are dramatic. I could not get into it because i was just laughing at all the times i was told what was going on. It constantly had me saying, I KNOW I KNOW I KNOW, and my mind wandered. To make a good film you need to keep the audience looking for information. Picking up on new things. learning the plot as it develops. in 300 i had all the information i needed in the first 15 minutes. you had to be 17 to get in, and 3 to understand it."

","Great film, great photography, great from any angle you see it. That's the second chance I gave Frank Miller, as Sin City was a disappointment, and after all the advertising for the 300, I had to see it, so I can comment on it. He has done an excellent job, even this is an adaptation from comic the story is excellent as to what really happened in Sparta, with a few minor mistakes just to keep the story going (adultery was not a crime, the one that left the battle and came back was a descry for everyone in Sparta, that one did not told any story to anyone, and Efialtis was not deformed person he was one of the captains of Leonidas), and for that he is excused. True vivid colors (not like Sin City), very realistic battles, a lot of blood, and perfect directing with all the actors in main and second roles being really very good. All thumbs up 10/10!!!"
"SteveM-1","9","3","9","11 March 2007"," I was pleased.
","It's hard to describe how good this movie was without falling to the same clich√© terms that so many others have used to describe it (""blown away"" seems to be the number one description used so far). It was a truly great film and I will probably see it again in the theaters before purchasing it on DVD (the DVD release date can't come soon enough).<br/><br/>Artistically, it's a triumph. The visuals are amazing, the acting is solid and the story is utterly riveting. If I can go the entire length the first time without checking my watch to see how long I've been there, then you know it's a good film.<br/><br/>One thing for certain, this film definitely has Frank Miller's Thumbprint on it. Although I only have Sin City as a reference, the two films really have a lot in common. Both films have done a great service to Mr. Miller by translating Graphic Novel Frames to Film Shots in a flawless manner. They also both carry Frank Miller's vision of Heroes. The Heroes in both of these films are not goody-goody. They can be violent and at times a little sadistic, but they never waver from their mission and have a very cut-&-dry goal and means to achieve their goal. The Villains are also true Frank Miller creations: Vile, often physically twisted beings with a ""Might makes Right"" philosophy. You will have to see both films to understand my point.<br/><br/>Oddly though, I left the first screenings of both Sin City and 300 with very different emotions. For Sin City, I found the violence to be somewhat unsettling. I walked out thinking ""There are some really twisted people out there"". I didn't have that feeling when leaving 300, even though the level of violence and brutality is about the same. Perhaps it was the time period setting for both movies. Sin City is set more or less in the modern era, so such violence seems excessive for our so-called civilized era. With 300, you realize it's set in 480 BC, so you kind of expect it to be Brutal. You expect Swords, Spears and Shields and you know it won't be pretty. Of course there is the possibility that Sin City just desensitized me enough that I was able to stomach 300 more easily.<br/><br/>To wrap up, 300 is definitely a movie to see for pretty much anybody old enough to be admitted to an R Rated movie. I think just about any adult can find something to like about this film. More than highly recommended."
"mnwcsult","10","3","9","10 March 2007"," Never trust a critic
","I have the ""Frank Miller"" novel. I actually study history. And yes I do know details of the actual battle. The critics thought the battle scenes to be excessive. The battle pits 300 Spartans against 1,000,000 Persians in a narrow pass. The Spartans held out for 3 days inflicting massive casualties on the enemy before being annihilated to the last man. What should this battle have looked like? They were using state of the art, spears, swords, arrows and anything else you could impale the man in front of you with. In real life there would have been enough blood spilled to swim in, as for gore, how about entrails everywhere, on the weapons, the man next to you, on the ground. Back to the critics, one reviewer thought the immortals were ninjas? Another critic bowing to the politically correct crowd took issue with the reference to Athenians as ""boy lovers"" (thought it was homophobic). Greek warriors were required to take male lovers until manhood as women were thought to dull their senses. See ""TROY"" Achilles in particular. Still another thought the dialog was too minimal, did I say I have the graphic novel? The 300 is the novel brought to the big screen, some pages only have 3 words. Maybe they should quote Shakespeare. Lastly a few more had problems with the sex scene, I have seen more graphic sex in PG13 movies. So, don't take your future wimps. What are the requirements to being a critic? You should really have knowledge of what you are critiquing, ""ninjas?"", for crying out loud. So instead I went to the theater and found that there was a good time to be had for all. Guys, testosterone levels low? Get a dose of the 300. Girls, like rough sex? Then take your mate to the 300 (notice I did not specify gender). Sissies, do you like buff guys? Go to the 300. Something for everyone. See, the 300 is a family movie after all."
"inquiringminds","10","3","9","10 March 2007"," 300 Rocks!
","Although I really liked Sin City, I wasn't sure if they would be able to pull off making a good movie from Frank Miller's graphic novel about the 300 Spartans which was based on history. I was pleasantly surprised at how much of it was historically accurate, although some dramatic license was taken to make it more exciting to watch. Like the love story with his Queen & her situation with trying to convince the counsel to send more troops to aid the King in battle. As well as the gigantic, grossly adorned Xerxes & the 20 foot tall elephants & other deformed monstrosities. However, since it was supposed to be the tale of the battle told by Dilios to the rest of the Spartans & Greek armies to inspire them to fight off the Persian army later on, it does make sense that he would have embellished & exaggerated the things he witnessed. This was an excellent movie, very well made, wonderfully entertaining & I hope everyone goes to see it & give it a chance. I have already seen it 3 times on the IMAX screen, which I highly recommend for the sound as well as the imagery & will probably see it again that way several more times."

","Well, where should I begin? I'm not the kinda person to write comments for every single movie she had watched. First, the trailer, i think did not do this film justice. Well, maybe just me, but I didn't get excited at all watching the trailer...I thought it's gonna be another war/fight movie, bla blah. In the first place, I don't even wanna catch it in theaters. But yesterday, my two bff asked me out to the movies....so we're outta ideas on what movie to watch. I wanted to watch Norbit, actually, but my friends outnumbered me coz they didn't like comedy so much...lol.<br/><br/>I thought ""What the hell, this is gonna be a very boring evening! I hate this film!"" And i went into the cinema expecting less than nothing. But as soon as it starts, I'm completely wrong! I'm blown away! At first it stated very slow, with the narrator's voice...and I started to get a little bored, but that didn't last long. This movie makes me excited as hell with the fighting scene, the war and their strength and courage. It's is full of witty and funny quotes as well, despite it being a war movie and all. 300 rocks my world man! But to tell the truth, I was quite disappointed in the ending...but since it's the twist, then I just accepted it. I won't tell you what it is, as it will spoil everything. Just go and watch it! You won't be disappointed! But whatever the ending was, 300 Spartans is the Champions and wins in every possible way! Spartans are the greatest army of all time!!"

","Words cannot justify how great this film is. It is, in my opinion, the greatest comic book movie ever made, and deserves to be on the list of greatest films ever made, period.<br/><br/>If you do not see this movie because you view it as a fantasy film or that it incorrectly portrays history,then you are robbing yourself of an unforgettable experience. Some people seem to judge it based upon the things that are exaggerated in the trailer. These exaggerations exist for a reason, as you will find out when you watch this film.<br/><br/>The other major complaint I have seen about the film from people who have not seen it is that the Persians seem to be portrayed as evil. You need to remember that this movie is told from the Spartan point of view, and while Xerxes may have been an alright guy, at the end of the day he was still a foreign ruler attempting to conquer a nation. The Spartans would have viewed anyone attempting to take away their sovereignty in a similar way."
"ElijahCSkuggs","4","3","9","9 March 2007"," Blood splatter, freaks, and swords: The Holy Trinity
","300 came and went, and all in all, I was definitely satisfied. The hype was enormous, more than any other film so far this year, and though it partially lived up to it, sadly enough, it never exceeded it.<br/><br/>The plot is simple: 300 Spartans, carved from stone, defend their beloved oceanside country from thousands of marauding foreigners, all the while dual corruption by council heads deny the Spartans and their valiant leader any back-up. <br/><br/>Gerard Butler, or perhaps more fitting, Gerard ""Cut""ler, owns this film in every ab-clenching, neck-slicing, clich√©-touting, excess and aspect this film has to gorgeously cram in your eye cavities, and his 299 counterparts, bronze and brawn from every conceivable angle, holler and follow his march with gusto, brandishing scarlet capes that flow like the blood dripping from their battle spears.<br/><br/>The action is huge, the effects are great, and the acting fitting. Zach Snyder directed the film with some very nice touches, most of them involving wide shots of arrows pouring down from the heavens, and other longer sequences involving Leonidas(Butler) ripping enemies apart with an utmost ease. But a lot of the film seemed to, most likely through complete accident, copy the film that seems to be the end-all for every historical action film to come, GLADIATOR. <br/><br/>A part of the film I didn't care for was the fact that it was filled with war propaganda. Fight for your country, live for glory, and so on. In these current times, it is so easy for this usually righteous sentiment to be taken wrong, and in this movie, it's very easy....Hoo-Rah!<br/><br/>But for all it's downfalls, which aren't many, this film is really fun to watch. It's loaded with great make-up, nice cinematography from start to finish, a heard-it-all-before musical score, and 300 extremely jacked men who aren't going anywhere till every last Persian is dead. <br/><br/>It was great, in a subtle kind of way, but would've benefited most if it wasn't advertised so incessantly. Perhaps, the perfect example of over hype."

"visitourwebsite","9","3","9","6 March 2007"," 300 Kills
","300 is a visceral adaptation of legendary comic book writer Frank Miller's graphic novel loosely based on The Battle of Thermopylae in 480 B.C. when Sparta King Leonidas led 300 Spartans against insurmountable numbers in a fight to the last man. The film was produced over 60 days and shot almost entirely on a blue screen with 11 effects houses adding the visual movie magic culminating in what some are calling ""the future of film-making"".<br/><br/>When I watch a movie there's nothing that takes me out of the experience more than some really poor Computer Generated Imaging (think Gollum) and as the technology has advanced it's become more and more tolerable. 300 relies heavily on the tool as it creates floored battle sequences and astonishing visuals. But when that blood splatters a little too cartoony, don't forget; you've walked into a comic book come to life much like Robert Rodriguez' collaboration with Miller on Sin City... only there's more violence.<br/><br/>Ahead of it's time, 300 employs editing techniques that shouldn't work but are nothing short of masterful. Jarring the audience with long shots that don't cut but jump from fast forward to slow motion and back again. Somehow this results in pure poetry more than once in the film.<br/><br/>On the creative side of the film there's a solid ensemble cast led by a very strong Gerard Butler. The weak link is probably the campy narrator saved only by the fact that the voice belongs to a character classified as ""the storyteller"" brought to the screen with sincerity by David Wenham. Smartly, the filmmakers didn't waste time creating tightly woven character relationships. This movie is about a 3 day long kick-ass fight and Zach Snyder's direction doesn't let you forget it.<br/><br/>Honestly, if you don't see this movie you suck.<br/><br/>A+ Matt Watterworth http://www.theweal.com"
"DICK STEEL","10","6","24","6 March 2007"," A Nutshell Review: 300
","The trailers which have whetted the appetites of fanboys everywhere have now given way to the premiere of the movie. Fanboys, the wait is over! 300 hits our shores this week, and to action buffs, this is the moment that we're waiting for! Pure, unadulterated, violent action, true to the visuals of Frank Miller's graphic novel of the same name, based on an imaginative retelling of the ancient Battle of Thermopylae, where King Leonidas (Gerard Butler) and 300 of his Spartan warriors defended their land against the invading Persian army, led by the self proclaimed god-king Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro).<br/><br/>One of the appealing factors of this classic tale is that size does not matter, so long as you've got the right techniques. It's a classic David versus Goliath, only that David is better trained, and has more grit, honour, courage to stand up for what he believes in, and to defend all that he loves. It's akin to telling the bullies not to go too far, or face the wrath and fury of those pushed to a corner. The Spartans embody the positive traits of men who are proud warriors, led by someone whom you'll always prefer to go to war with, a leader who leads, rather than a leader like Xerxes who directs.<br/><br/>In recent times, ever since Peter Jackson unleashed his epic battles from the Lord of the Rings trilogy, we've a number of movies that hopped on the bandwagon, from Troy to Alexander, all wanting to revisit the clashing of the swords amongst gladiators. But instead of something that rings familiar (just how many fights can you sit through before they look all the same?), director Zack Snyder managed to craft very distinct looking fights, and the action choreography is something to behold, exclaiming the point that when the Spartans fight as one keen unit, they are a force to be reckoned with. You can't wait for the Spartans to use their shield-spear-sword combo, and you're rewarded soon enough. Kudos of course to the stunt team and fight choreographers in designing different battle set pieces for each incoming wave of the Persian army, and I like the bit with the oriental looking Invincibles.<br/><br/>It's not all pure action, dismembered body parts and CGI splattering of blood. The action does take a breather once in a while to content with the usual rotting of Greek politics with Lena Headey's Queen Gorgo trying to drum up support for more Spartan warriors to join her husband in the defence of the land. As usual, the expected back stabbing, dirty politicking strokes rear its ugly head, and there are scenes that probably will get you seething. Somehow, the wise councillors always get portrayed as old buffoons, and this one is no different, especially in a scene where they act like dumb sheep.<br/><br/>However, given that this is a well known tale, the inevitable is just waiting to happen, and somehow, I felt that it tapered off towards the end, in a rather anti-climatic manner, after raising your adrenaline each time with successive battles that seem to top the previous. I thought at certain points you could draw upon references from other contemporary movies. Certain plot points and shots somehow reminded me of Zhang Yimou's Hero, with its rousing army war cries and the liberal use of arrows. Not only that, Lord of the Rings was tapped upon again, in giving us a Gollum-looking like ""creature"" used in a similar mould. And Braveheart too comes to mind.<br/><br/>But those aside, I would say this has all the ingredients for box office success. Sex and violence sells, and I'm pleased that this movie survived the censors unscathed, with an M18 rating. If the Oracle brings to mind the jolly matronly like lady in the Matrix movies, this movie will attempt to shake off that memory with a writhing nymph like seer.<br/><br/>I do not know how anyone can boo at this movie, unless of course you're not an action movie lover. Sit back, relax and watch the spectacle unfold up close as if you're battling side by side with the Spartans. It doesn't get any better than that."

As the battle rages, Queen Gorgo (Lena Headey) attempts to rally support in Sparta for her husband.<br/><br/>Through this narrative technique, various fantastical creatures are introduced, placing 300 within the genre of historical fantasy.<br/><br/>The story stays true to the comic book and the script is also written by Zack Snyder and two other writers. The film is just amazing in every aspect for what this film is and it is cool. Gerard Butler proved that he was the perfect choice for Leonidas and it shows throughout his whole performance.<br/><br/>David Wenham played Dilios and he does a good job in his performance and it was an amazing performance that he pulled off and I have seen him in the Lord of the Rings trilogy, directed by Peter Jackson. Lena Headey as Queen Gorgo in this film, she is amazing and she is fantastic in that kiss scene with Gerard Butler and she was really cool.<br/><br/>The visuals and action sequences are amazingly well-done and death plays an important part in this feature film. It is spectacular and amazing. This movie stays true to it's source material and I cannot say more about this movie.<br/><br/>Tyler Bates' musical score was amazing and fantastic to hear in the film and his musical score for Watchmen (which I reviewed on IMDb and appears on my Top 10 Comic Book list and Top 10 Overrated Movies list) is just great and spectacular.<br/><br/>Overall, I love 300 and the film is just incredibly well-done and Zack Snyder and Company did a really good job in staying true to it's source material.<br/><br/>9/10"

It has every possible goof, mistake, anachronism, idiocy, stupidity, silliness or plain foolishness. If you are a history buff, avid this film at all costs. It has nothing to do with either Spartan history, or Persian military system. This movie is badly colored, dark, extremely humorless, awfully deadpan, pathetic, too far serious, too bombastic. And the dialogs! Oh, them. Imagine several too laughingly over-muscular macho men uttering high-blown words out of proportion, all of them far too pompous and huge, and you get it. All is bad here, and poor Persian king is a mere unimaginable caricature of some hilarious outlook and modern piercing galore. Oh my, history suffers here a lot too much. Even for laughs this movie will not do - Gerard Butler along with Heady, Wenham, and other actors looks funny and never convincing enough to induce any feeling of sympathy or interest. Trash this utter junk."
"stevenjlowe82","10","2","5","19 August 2014"," Snyder's epic war piece is a triumph.
","As a long term fan of Zack Snyder I found this film to be a pure triumph. War films of this genre are not normally my cup of tea but this one in particular was fast, (inspite of going on for nearly 2 hours) brutal and straight to the point. Thankfully there was a lack of long winded speeches and star crossed lovers. For a film of this length surprisingly little happens but for me this a good thing.<br/><br/>Zack is often slated for his style of movie making but again here is what makes the film stand out. To me it did not feel like watching a computer game, it was lush and enthralling to watch. <br/><br/>As far as acting goes Lena Headey made the film for me in that aspect. She took her small yet pivotal role and ran with it. No disrespect to the male ensemble, they portrayed the role of bloodthirsty warriors very well but not much else was asked of them. Lena was the heart of the film, desperately trying to hold together the kingdom in the absence of her King and in the face of the bitter misogynist Theron, very amply played by Dominic West.<br/><br/>All in all this film worked on all levels for me."

","The tragic legend of 300 brave Spartans against the Persian legions is now retold in a gorgeous live action comic book form. Possibly the best example of being faithful to a source material, 300 adapts the titular graphic novel by the famous Frank Miller. And what an adaptation it is! The muddy browns, ancient bronze and stunning crimson are painstakingly replicated in the films colors, panels are recreated in full motion shot-for-shot. Perhaps the greatest thing about this film is how it adds additional layers to the characters that were not immediately apparent in the graphic novel.<br/><br/>Our story is a epic tale of standing up for freedom, facing incredible odds for the sake of your people, and giving ones life as a symbol of hope. As the Persian empire marches through Greece, the senate is bogged down in politics and backstabbing. Unwilling to accept inaction, king Leonidas leads his 300 strong spartan army to face down the Persian troops at Thermopylae. Outnumbered at least a hundred to one, the Spartans fight on. While on the home front, Spartan queen Gorgo has to deal with Greek politics while being weary of a traitor in their midst. <br/><br/>As mentioned, 300 is every bit as visually stunning as it's source material. Director Zack Snyder, a self proclaimed comic book fan, brings a keen eye for action. The stylish way he alternates between fast cuts and extreme slow motion is a unique touch that mimics the experience of moving panel to panel in a comic book. Gory action, intense fights and awesome action is on full display, complemented by some fine acting from the great looking leads.<br/><br/>One really has to complement the actors for the tough training regime they went through to achieve the Spartans' chiseled muscular look. All of them bring their ""A"" game to the table, instilling their characters with passion and emotion. Of note is Gerald Butler, bellowing war cries as the Spartan King Leonidas. His performance not only elevates a rather one dimensionally written character but immortalised so many memorable lines which subsequently became internet memes. <br/><br/>Although the characters are not given much development, the softer moments in the script plays out a tragic story of a culture where formality and strength are law. Love, compassion, and one's emotions are suppressed in the Spartan culture as signs of weakness. Yet as we follow the Spartans, at first portrayed as misogynistic war loving maniacs, we see their tender side surface; A father who grows to respect his son as family rather than just comrade, rivals who bond in battle, and a king loves his queen much more than he shows. These softer moments as well, like the political intrigue involving queen Gorgo, adds a deeper element to the original plot; the graphic novel merely focused on the battle at Thermophylae.<br/><br/>This movie has received its fair share of criticism for its portrayal of the Persians. But since it is framed as a story told by a Spartan survivor, these creative liberties may just be the survivor sprinkling some exaggeration into the tale. Overall, it is a thoroughly enjoyable testosterone fueled action flick. Aside from Tyler Bates' generic soundtrack, the visuals and directing style alone is unique and breathtaking. The softer moments are intriguing and well woven into the narrative, adding layers to what could have been a shallow swords and sandals movie.<br/><br/>Prepare for Glory. And prepare for the sequel."

"Al_The_Strange","10","2","5","30 June 2013"," ""SPARTANS!!! Prepare for glory!!!""
","Thousands of years ago, the Persian Empire threatened to trample over ancient Greece in a series of historic battles. The first such battle was Thermopylae; it was an incredible fight in which a small band of Spartan warriors held off a massive wave of Persian invaders for three days. Ancient accounts describe a barrage of arrows that literally blocked out the sun. Through the use of brilliant strategy, superior armor and weapons, and better training, the three hundred Spartans put up a heck of a fight against insurmountable odds. This battle was popularized throughout the ages; more recent tellings of the story include the 1962 film The 300 Spartans (which I found to be rather lame), and Frank Miller's graphic novel 300, which was influenced by that film.<br/><br/>The film 300 follows the graphic novel very closely, with additional embellishments to the story. In spite of that, the film presents a highly mythologized and exaggerated take on the Battle of Thermopylae; it's a fantastic, epic, and incredible spectacle to watch the brutal Spartans take on endless waves of Persian troops (including the Immortals, shown on screen as being literally monstrous). Barrages of arrows literally block out the sun. Strange creatures, including an orc-like giant, elephants, and a rhinoceros, charge into battle. Blood flies freely across the screen frequently; with a dark and brooding tone, the film overall is one of the most hard-edged and wickedest epics committed to film. It won't appeal to everybody, especially with the film's penchant for frequent slow-motion and CGI backgrounds, but at its time it was considered one of the awesomest and most macho films ever made.<br/><br/>Since this film is based on a graphic novel, it does take liberties with the historic facts. Obviously, the Spartans never fought without wearing armor; there never was a rhino in battle; Ephialtes was never a hunchback; the Immortals were actual men, not monsters; and so on. However, the film does get a few details surprisingly right; the events actually happened, the tactics appear mostly-sound, and the portrayal of Spartan upbringing is correct. The blending of historic fact with myth may not sit well with history buffs, but it makes for fantastic storytelling.<br/><br/>The story itself is well-structured, purposefully outlining the background of the battle and showing the assembly of the armies before breaking out in bloody mayhem. Characters aren't particularly likable (King Leonidas borders on being psychotic at times), but they are as badass as they come.<br/><br/>This film is overloaded with style, using slow-motion and animations in nearly every scene. With the film's framing and editing, however, it really does look like a graphic novel brought to life, and it's really cool that way. Acting is really extreme, almost to a ridiculous degree; Gerard Butler screams and scowls in every scene, but given the hardcore nature of his character and the material overall, he really nails the role. Everybody else fulfills their roles well. Writing is generally good; a lot of it matches up with Frank Miller's book, which in turn reflects some of the historical accounts. The use of narration is especially noteworthy, for it reinforces the film as fantastic storytelling. Tyler Bates' music score is really cool too.<br/><br/>Despite its liberties with the historic events, the 300 film remains the most thrilling, most awe-inspiring, and most uncompromising account of the Battle of Thermopylae. The whole film comes off as a wicked and badass experience; I personally wish more historic and fantasy films were made this way. If you can stomach the bloodshed and the excesses, this film comes recommended.<br/><br/>5/5 (Entertainment: Perfect | Story: Very Good | Film: Very Good)"
"GTeixeira","9","2","5","23 June 2013"," Straight-forward, stylized action that truly delivers
","There aren't many action movie like '300'. In here, we follow the legendary battle between 300 spartan warriors, lead by King Leonidas, against the invading forces of thousands from the Persian Empire lead by Xerxes.<br/><br/>By now, this almost mythological story has been more than debunked (there were thousands of spartans in that battle, not just the three hundred) but, unlike what many people seem to believe, the film is actually based on a comic book and not in the actual historical facts (the comic itself was only loosely based on reality). This is mostly a fantasy-action, and trying to dismiss it for its historical inaccuracy is just stupid.<br/><br/>The movie itself is one of the strongest actioners I've seen. From what I've seen from the director, Zack Snyder ('Dawn of the Dead' remake and 'Watchmen'), I'm quite happy that he directed this; he is not the kind to shy away from the intense violence such a battle would create. The fantastic visuals of the film (a trademark of Snyder; even his dreadful 'Sucker Punch' had good visuals despite all its flaws) and the stylized way the narrative and battle choreography are done are brilliant; it brings a quasi-psychopathic satisfaction seeing the 300 fight and kill their enemies.<br/><br/>Another high point is that the movie has something akin to a brain, despite all the violence. The dialogues between Leonidas and the Persians (the messenger at the beginning, and Xerxes later on) are very interesting and intelligently done, serving to further convey how prideful/arrogant both groups are. The political side story involving Leonidas' wife's discussions with the city/state council, trying to get the rest of Sparta to join the fight against the Persians, is also unexpectedly good.<br/><br/>For the most part, the casting was very well done. The spartans truly look their part, a race of strong and prideful warriors; Gerard Butler, in special, has a very strong presence that truly makes him suitable to play the part as their leader. Lena Headey, who plays his wife, is beautiful to look at and the way she plays her character she not only looks worthy of a queen, but of the queen of a warrior nation.<br/><br/>Maybe the only thing I didn't like was the casting of Rodrigo Santoro. As a fellow Brazilian, I knew him mostly from his work on soap operas: always being the pretty boy who is just there to make women swoon in a clich√©d romance subplot. The fact he had to be digitally modified in order to make himself appear threatening (not just his height, but even his voice too) shows how much he was ideal for this role. Why not cast someone who was already menacing?"
"s-wesner1","1","2","5","13 September 2012"," A Film Review of: Though I'm sad to say it, Cleanskin
","A Film Review of: Though I'm sad to say it, Cleanskin ÔÅå This disgusting shame of a film is an extremely violent film, and, in fact, opens up promising enough, if one would like to call it that, but, like most movies, fails to deliver. The bad guys and good guys get switched up in your classic ""switcher-oo"" and viewers get confused with who is who. Good and evil, and morality, in general, get so confused in this film, that deals with the classic old playing-cards of Islam versus other depraved bad-guys made to look good, is so twisted, it shows two nice- looking-Algerian/Moroccan-type fellows (I wondered at first thought how much they got paid to do this?) who cause wanton mayhem when they follow these two thuggish-brute-looking guys who have no more morals than they. Bored yet? And, then, as if it couldn't get any worse, the film commits a big no-no when this same fat man whom the two Muslim-stereotypical men are attacking, is shown in the first scene in bed with a hooker. Now, if that isn't a ""sin"" in all ways, I don't know what is...But the hooker is Indian which complicates the racial matters of this film all the further. Indeed, I saw for a fact, amidst all the mock-images the film goes through in its intro., to make itself look legitimate, there is a flurry of crosses. Now, that is just wrong, yet, again, to coincide religion or, love (for that matter), or anything remotely positive, with violence. You can't have both (sexual imagery is often compounded with violence in movies because it apparently appeals to the testosterone in stupid males). Produced by ""e-one Films"" in 2012, as well as by Uk Film studios, it is rated R, is incredibly violent, and, stereotyped/biased. It should probably even be banned by film censors, but it, as far as one knows, currently isn't. A ""cleanskin,"" or the term, as it was used in the film, though it wasn't immediately made clear to me in the film, is someone with no prior record in crime. Apparently, too, the main-man Muslim in the film, called Ash by his friends, has struggles trying to reconnect in the movie with his British main-stream counterparts who indeed try to put him down with little jabs, but welcome him on the whole. . . Indeed, this is a frightening film, if it is indeed an accurate portrayal of our times, which I think it is, albeit with a few twists and turns (lies/misrepresentations)... In fact, Sean Bean, who is made to look (although I am not sure if they achieved it, through their efforts) much younger than he probably actually is in real life; he may have gone through some fitness training to look better in the film, I just don't know. The suspense build-ups in the film are just excuses to make certain people look better, and certain people look better, in my opinion; it is just another sick movie, designed to desensitize the public to violence so that we can persecute those who don't appear to blend into our society (Muslims in this case."

The minimal effort to build up the plot and jump right in to battle hurt the movie right from the start. From there it only got worse as they failed to show any of the tactical maneuvering and strategic importance building up to this battle and resulting from it. To further this failing they didn't bring in to play any respect or understanding of the Persians. They really missed so much of the Spartan ethos. A few attempts here and there by a narrator to build the story would be very tough to even come close, even if it had been well written. Sure they came up with a stylized movie that just ooozed watchmewatchme, but even the battle scenes lacked any feeling of depth no matter how much they tried to use The Matrix type effects. The cinematography was quite good but that's about the only redeeming factor to this movie."

"basrutten","3","2","5","2 March 2008"," A striking example of everything that is wrong with action movies these days
","""300"" sounded like a great movie. I like spectacle movies, I loved Sin City, so what could go possible wrong with this one. Well, just about everything. The only thing ""300"" has going for it, is that it looks nice and that some of the action is not a total loss. Other than that, it's a colossally hollow and obnoxious movie.<br/><br/>""300"" is a movie that takes itself fairly seriously (it's about big themes like courage and freedom, you know) and is mainly concerned with making everything looks as ""cool"" as possible, but it's so silly and overdone that it become a cross between an enormous bore and something unintentionally funny.<br/><br/>I know that action movies do not emphasize story or plot development, but ""300"" pushes the neglect for these elements to a new low. There is no character development, and what passes for a story makes no sense whatsoever (even though it's based on real events. Emphasis here on 'based on'. This has nothing to do with history or reality).<br/><br/>Well, is at least the action decent then? Not really. While it looks very nice at times and it sure is pretty bloody, it's not really all that exciting. Fights lack any kind of logic and the Spartans are so invincible that there isn't any suspense either.<br/><br/>And then, there's the yelling. When people in this movie are not fighting, they try to best each other at shouting about how courageous and manly they are. Which is all good and well, if it weren't for the fact that what they are shouting is so corny and overdone that you can't help but laugh out loud, which is quite probably not the intended effect.<br/><br/>Also, what troubles me is that much of this movie is presented as 'historically accurate' even though it has next to nothing to do with real events. It has all been simplified and twisted to get a point across (how the good, freedom-loving west overcomes the evil, tyrannic east). Of course there is artistic freedom, but portraying the Spartans (who by and large were the fascists of ancient Greece) as proponents of democracy and freedom is both laughable and sad.<br/><br/>To summarize, this movie is a joke. It looks nice and that's about it. It has no characters, no logic or coherence, and awful lot of cringe-inducing pomp and machismo, and a complete disregard of history."

It was the time of King Leonidas and his 300.<br/><br/>It is 480 B.C., and the Persian Army sends emissaries to Sparta to ask them to surrender peacefully to Persian rule. Insulted by the Persians contempt for the strength of the Spartan Army, the Spartan King Leonidas refuses to kneel before Xerxes - the King of Persia and self proclaimed God. King Leonidas chooses 300 Spartan Warriors to stop the entire Persian Empire from invading Greece. The Spartans assemble at the entrance to a narrow passage in an attempt to stop the Persian Army's advances. 300 Spartans stand fast, holding off hundreds of thousands of Persian Warriors known as the Immortals. Only when the Spartans are betrayed do the finally succumb to the Persian army. Word of their bravery and strength spreads throughout the Hellenic Empire and their story becomes a legend.<br/><br/>300 is a modern classic, a violent and beautiful tale of men who refuse to surrender to a totalitarian regime. It is a war movie with a surreal feel, it is a story that is steeped in mythos, and every chapter of this tale is lavishly brought to the screen in a movie that is as visually stunning as it is compelling.<br/><br/>In movies such as 300, which rely strongly on visual effects to ""wow"" the audience, the acting and characters usually suffer. This is not the case with 300. Gerard Butler is bold, butch and brilliant as Leonidas; Dominic West is deliciously villainous, and Lena Headey is strong, elegant and regal as Leonidas' Queen. In addition, David Wehham's narration superbly knits together epic battles, traitors and political corruption.<br/><br/>In short, 300 is a visually stunning classic that is filled with brains and brawn. It is a must see for anyone who likes tales filled with heroism, glory, loincloths and six packs."

It really is that beautiful. In some other films where the visuals are breathtaking, the story usually falls flat or is just non-existent, case in point The Cell. The Cell is visually almost at the same par as 300 (yes, there isn't as much CG, but the smooth camera work finishes the touch), but at it's core, it's just not as interesting. And enough about JLo. The characters in this film are interesting and perfectly cast. Dominic West.. who would've though? <br/><br/>The final nail on the coffin of this instant classic is the director himself, Zack Snyder. The man is the most uncompromising and talented artist behind the camera since.. since.. Spielberg. Great things can (and SHOULD) be expected from him in the years to come.

At first I thought that I had a bad copy of the film from which all the colour had been bleached out leaving a sepia tainted version. I didn't like it but was happy to let it slide in anticipation of a well crafted and and exciting retelling of a famous and remarkable historical victory. I was to be sadly disappointed. The cinematic makeover of one of the most fascistic and cruellist societies in history into some sort of American style freedom loving defenders of the faith was almost too much to take. Credibility was stretched to breaking point by their costumes dressed as they were in their leather underpants like refugees from a Gay Pride parade. This was deeply ironic considering the Spartans remarks about their Athenian allies who, perish the thought, liked art and poetry and were therefore a bunch of pansies (conveniently overlooking the fact that Athens actually defeated Sparta in real life). It soon became clear that historical accuracy was to be the first casualty of this war As the film passed only a passing resemblance to what was recorded in history and it seemed to have been filmed in some post-apocalyptic world far removed from the beautiful, sunny, Meditteranian that I remember from my holidays. The goodies and baddies were portrayed in a childishly over simplistic fashion with the Persians looking like Orc rejects from Lord of the Rings in contrast to the manly??? Spartans in their leather underpants and firm pecs. Finally the script was awful to the point of embarrassment. I feel very disappointed because I can't help thinking a really good opportunity has been wasted here, a good idea that has been ineptly executed."

Like 'The Two Towers', we saw heroic expressions from the actors and graceful gestures from actresses. But here, apart from the queen, no one can be put in that category, sorry.Everyone was rude,ferocious and clumsy. There attacks, yells everything. Even the music was gruesome and poor. U certainly can see the movie to realize that there are better movies than this one in this world, otherwise no need. Better than 'Dawn of the Dead', nothing else."
"TxMike","Null","2","5","7 August 2007"," Excellent in style, but the actual movie didn't interest me that much.
","This movie, '300', is a retelling of the 480 BC Battle of Thermopylae, where King Leonidas defends Greece with only 300 highly trained warriors. His opponent is the Persian Xerxes who has an army of thousands.<br/><br/>The movie begins with Leonidas as a young boy, and shows how boys were brought up to be warriors. Gerard Butler, of 'Phantom' fame, plays King Leonidas. Lena Headey is his queen Gorgo, and the earlier scenes contain some good interactions between them.<br/><br/>Judging from a photo of an old painting of the battle, the costumes used in this movie are fairly authentic. I like the style of the movie, which in many respects reminded me of the style of ""Sin City."" The depiction of the fighting is fierce, with heads and body parts flying as the warriors fight the enemy.<br/><br/>Overall while I enjoyed it at an entertainment level, otherwise the movie didn't touch me."
"fakedisaster21","6","2","5","3 June 2007"," A Great Popcorn Movie
","Many people have put up an argument that this is one of the best films to come out of 2007 so far. Now here's where I have to raise a hand and disagree. This was a good film, yes, with inspiring visuals and breathtaking action sequences. However, when it all boils down, this film wasn't really about changing the way you see a movie. It didn't really, how do you say, affect me as I came out of the theatre. My friend, however, couldn't shut up about it, and sighted it as one of the ""greatest films he had ever seen"". Now, not to be rude, but that's a horrible overstatement.<br/><br/>My rating, Eight out of Ten, is not rating it based on its quality as an Oscar-worthy film: rather, on its quality compared to most Hollywood films. This is not the greatest film of all time, nor will it ever *be* the greatest film of all time. It is merely a great excuse to go to the theatre, and I promise you, it is worth your money. But, just keep one thing in mind: do not walk into that theatre expecting an emotionally deep film that will run through your head, changing your point of view on mature matters. Rather, expect a great, entertaining time at the movies: one that will stick with you as a fun action film.<br/><br/>Eight out of Ten stars."
"jcal101","2","2","5","25 May 2007"," Essentially a Greek-themed Kung-Fu movie totally lacking in meaning or depth
","""300"" is one of those truly amazing films that can only be made by someone who has never seen a single second of war or combat themselves. Full of simplistic bombast, silly nationalistic speeches, and 1000 yards of black spandex jockstraps, ""300"" rates as one of the most juvenile movies releases in the past five years. Even if one can manage to suspend all knowledge of the real history of Greece and Persia (not to mention Greek geography, agriculture, weapons technology, and basic Spartan sociology), even if one knows nothing of Newtonian physics, and even if you can believe that the world is populated by freakish mutants, there is nothing to recommend this film. The soundtrack sucks (reminding me of watching Flash Gordon without the expected camp factor from watching Flash Gordon), the CG is bad (from a wolf that looks more like a wet cheetah to an amazingly poorly produced standing vertical leap made by the king on his way to the oracle (she is the only good thing in this movie- lets see more of her in the future)), the script is ludicrous (and made no better by the acting that, if called wooden, would be an insult to wooden actors the world over), and the costumes and fake facial hair are downright hilarious. The complete bastardization of the story of the battle of thermopylae, the 100s of anachronisms (I understand this is not a documentary but a work of art, well, maybe not art- fart sounds more like it), the lackluster cast, and the truly low grade writing all produce a film that ranks among the worst I've seen this year. Like most Kung-Fu movies, with heroes that fly through the air, villains that happily wait to take on the hero one-on-one despite numerical superiority, flesh wounds for heroes, mortal wounds for villains, and so on and so on, watching this movie REQUIRES the complete suspension of belief. Even then its tedious and too stylized to be any fun as a straight swords and sandals movie, more akin to Conan or Red Sonja than anything else. 2/10 stars- one for the oracle, one for pity."

","Great movie with outstanding special effects. If you want historical accuracy steer clear of this film as it is based on a comic book and can only loosely be said to have anything to do with reality.<br/><br/>Individuals who find the movie offensive because the Persians were the ""bad guys"" and find a political theme are looking too hard. Every movie needs a bad guy, and Hollywood is hardly known for reality in its villains (think Max Baer in ""Cinderella Man"". By all accounts, he was a very nice man and a far cry from the arrogant and evil Baer in the movie). <br/><br/>Watch this movie if you want to enjoy a well done, excellently choreographed, FUN movie. <br/><br/>This movie is NOT kid friendly, as it is extremely violent.

"Antagonisten","3","2","5","20 May 2007"," Sorry
","When i saw the trailer for this movie i was intrigued (as was most of the population of the western world judging by message boards and internet forums). The trailer didn't say very much about what the movie would be like though. And i had no reason to expect what this turned out to be: a porn movie...<br/><br/>""A porn movie?!"" you might ask. Yes, that's right. This is definitely a porn movie. Sure, there is no explicit sex in this movie, but that hardly has anything to do with it. In all other ways this is definitely a porn movie. Just replace all the sex with violence and the whole thing is done. And like a regular porn movie, this becomes tiresome incredibly fast. Unfortunately though there was no way to fast-forward the movie in the theater.<br/><br/>What, then, are the characteristics that this movie shares with porn? Simple: 1. We have a meager, almost completely pointless, story that works solely as an excuse for the real purpose of the movie: the porn. Here it's ""We go out to defend our freedom"" instead of ""I'm here to fix deine kabel"", but the principle remains the same. 2. We have a movie that's (at least) 70% slow-mo. Most of it with sweaty, half-naked muscled bodies moving in rhythm to music. Recognize that? 3. We have dialog that ranges between ominously pompous to exceptionally pathetic. Most of it is rather pointless though as it's more or less interludes between bloodshed.<br/><br/>Saying, and accepting, that this is porn is one thing. But the question, as always, is: is it entertaining? The answer i have to say is ""not very"". I know that a lot of people love this movie, but i can't for the life of me understand why. This is one of those cases where the trailer worked a lot better than the movie itself. Sure, the battles here are not poorly done. Mostly they look OK (although not stunning). But the fact is that after seeing people chop each other up in slow-motion for ten minute it becomes rather tedious. And then you have to consider that this movie is almost two hours long... Blood squirts, limbs are torn etc. etc.<br/><br/>I usually have a problem with movies that mess with history (i guess that's one of the problems of being somewhat of a history-buff), but in this movie it didn't bother me. The Persians could as easily be called ""The Orcs"" or something in this movie. They fight with what is obviously trolls, goblins and giants, and their famous king Xerxes is a 3-metre tall transsexual... So honestly it's impossible to take this seriously. So arguing about historical accuracy and racism feels completely moot. They haven't violated history, they have thrown it out the window. And somehow that feels better.<br/><br/>In a way, i really wanted to like this movie. I like movies that look good, i love action movies. I also like sword-play. But i didn't like this. I just can't stand this porn-type of movies. Maybe it's a sign that i'm getting older, the fact that i can't stand movies that have no story and nothing to offer except splattering blood. And even the blood-splattering has had it's bar raised in the last few years, so not even there does this movie measure up. I would rather watch ""Gladiator"" or ""Lord of the Rings"" again any day of the week. Sorry Zack Snyder, although i still loved ""Dawn of the Dead"".<br/><br/>3/10."

It is amazingly obvious that this movie is based on an historic event but due to the content of the movie no one in their right mind could call this anything but a science-fiction/adventure movie...and a great one of such! With battle scene techniques that rises above those in matrix and with great acting and AMAZING animation and makeup this is a movie that will be loved by all...especially guys, but many women has found this movie cool as well. Exspect 80% battle scenes and 20% story. In this movie this divide work out perfectly. Massive battle scenes like L.O.T.R. and effects like Matrix mixed with a good instructor, sublime clipping and great acting and you have a ""ONE TO WATCH"" movie for all that loves adventure."

The director did a wonderful job, the make-up costumes, scenery, characters, everything was well thought out and coordinated.

","There is absolutely no character development or for that matter plot line...people try to change my mind by saying that it's based on a true story. It's not. It's based on a graphic novel which is loosely based on a true story (I love comics and thought Sin City was great). The only good thing is the visuals and fight scenes (however inaccurate). Here's the basic ""plot""...boy grows up...goes and fights...talks with people...fights some more...talks some more...eats an apple...then dies. That's not storytelling (in other words the basis of film-making) that's wasting money trying to make people grow physically sick from boredom and gain bruises from uncomfortable seats while sitting through an hour and a half of garbage...<br/><br/>Lena Headey's character having a huge influence over other characters was ignorant.

"SCFletcher2000","8","2","5","20 April 2007"," Excellent movie but possibly less so without background knowledge
","As someone who's done a classics degree I have to say that I love this movie. I thought the graphic novel element worked really well. I can't stomach gore in movies but, like 'Sin City', it all seems must less bad and more artistic when done in the way they filmed it. the battle scenes were fantastic - so much tension and power, and Gerard Butler was brilliant. I can understand that it has it's flaws but I find it odd that people complain about lack of character definition and a simple plot. Personally it doesn't matter to me that a plot is simple as long as it is deep, and this one certainly is. A lack of back story possibly made it seem less so than it is though. Great back story given for the Spartans but virtually none for the Persian War itself. If something had shown how much influence Thermopylae had on the outcome of the war and eventually on the entire western world (because so much of our civilisation is influenced by the Greeks) it might have packed even more of a punch and made the Spartan sacrifice seem even more noble.<br/><br/>And as for lack of character definition, for me that was actually a good point about the film. It possibly could have been emphasised more, but the film did a good job of presenting the Spartan way of life. A life completely geared towards war and fighting, almost putting human connections second. Plus the Spartans were well known for not being the most communicative of people - the term laconic actually comes from them. Any more character definition and you might as well have been talking about a completely different race - that was just who the Spartans were.<br/><br/>So, in conclusion, very impressed but I can understand how without background knowledge I might have been less so. What people have said a negative points actually work in it's favour if you know a bit about it, and there were lots of little in-jokes that kept me happy. And for a graphic novel, wierdly accurate to the history. Which is more than can be said for films which don't have that excuse - like 'Troy'. On the other hand, background knowledge or no background knowledge it was still a tremendous battle movie, with really strong battle scenes, constant action and a powerful sense of tragedy and sacrifice. Only weak bits were the Queen Gorgo bits. They lessened the pace and tension of what, without them, could have been a top class movie."
"adrianj","6","2","5","19 April 2007"," Spectacularly, audaciously, outrageously silly!
","Apart from acres of beautifully toned male flesh, comic-book blood and guts and a graphic novel sheen I didn't really know what to expect from 300.<br/><br/>The dialogue is at best cheesy and at worst cringe-inducing. The characterisation is adolescent. The sex scene is incredibly unsexy. Realism is never given a look-in. As history it is hysterical. But, still, I enjoyed it.<br/><br/>The production design is wonderful, the colours and effects (mostly) are impressive. The costumes are fabulous, those 'Spartan' torsos are glorious, a joy to behold.

","After seen the trailers I was dying to see the movie. I guessed that this movie would topple ""troy"" and ""the gladiator"". However, it did not take me long to realize that sometimes trailers deceive the audience. First of all, there is something wrong with the pace of the movie. It looks as if many scenes have been cut! Some parts does not connect well. (especially those parts which shows different stages of the war on the pass, elephants, rhino, etc.) I think the movie should have been some 30 minutes longer. Secondly, narrations and dialogs are awfully bad. There are only couple of one liners that remain in your mind. (Spartans, tonight we dine in hell!). The final is also very weak. I expected some more one to one fighting at least before Leonidas dies. He died too easily!! Overall, the movie has many weak points which put 300 even behind ""troy""! Do not fall for the trailers!

"teh_mode","6","2","5","18 April 2007"," Romping, empty-headed fun
","Based on the Frank Miller (he of Sin City fame) graphic novel of the same name, 300 is set in ancient Greece. An army of 300 Spartans battled with a million-trillion-bajiillion Persian hoards long enough to save their modest city of Sparta from being pillaged. A cast of no-names, led by Glaswegian gladiator Gerard Butler, carry the film through the bloody battles, but it is the gory details of the film's visceral visuals that take centre stage. With lashings of baby oil, a whole vogue catalogue full of face piercings and not a single chest hair in sight, historians will bicker about both the film's blatant inaccuracies and apparent protofascist mentality. The truth is, it is neither of those things. It is a great big dumb action-adventure story, with a very annoying voice-over narrative, and lots of sweaty men in loin-cloths hitting each other (and occasionally shouting HAA-OOOHH!). None of 300 is meant to be taken seriously, as made apparent by the blatant lack of any substance to be found in the film. It is certainly true that, once the battles stop, the film stops too. But those battles are pretty sharp all the same."

We would be right now jumping in the streets and saying ""This is US do you see? We are the great ones. 300 PERSIANS against a million"" but damn, we can't even stand one movie where we are not the great ones. And this is only my opinion. Now to the movie..

","Well, well, this seems to have got the hackles up. Let's face it, it's not Citizen Caine, but nor is it Howard the Duck. It's a pretty decent slab of visually stunning untaxing entertainment which spreads the pathos a little too thickly. It seems most people leaving their opinion here would have preferred an Ibsenesque piece involving two characters emoting round a kitchen table while grappling with some contrived character arc and displaying 21st-century sensibilities.<br/><br/>Spartans were not people who believed in multi-culturalism, neither did they adopt sophisticated and nuanced philosophies, I doubt they had much time for self-reflection and in the small time frame of history dealt with in the movie, those that went into battle had little opportunity to evolve their persona. They simply went from being alive to being dead (preferably on their shields). Of course, militaristic, brutal and slave-owning Spartans banging on endlessly about freedom grates somewhat, but they were determined their city state would remain free from outside interference at least.<br/><br/>Athenians were a more thoughtful breed but then they probably wouldn't have lasted three days at Thermopylae. The original source material from Herodotus - and indeed the comic book by Frank Miller - is pretty threadbare in terms of story and the characters involved, so to crowbar personality nuances, plot devices and complex relationships into this simple and eternal story would be ludicrous and tiresome. Herodotus was also a Greek propagandist so to expect a fair depiction of Persians from Hollywood is perhaps naive. To claim the film has some kind of neo con agenda in this era of clashing civilisations is disingenuous and frankly gives the film an importance it doesn't deserve. <br/><br/>300 of course deals with unfashionable ideals - heroism, duty, sacrifice - and in a selfish and cynical age these often jar, and while historical epics are often portentous (Kingdom of Heaven), a rambling mess (Alexander) or just dull (Troy), this movie at least never takes itself too seriously - unlike many who have watched. It's a bloody, brutal pantomime and at a mere couple of hours (short for this genre) fairly rattled along."

","This is a good new type of epic film!, Zack Snyder directing is well adjusted for a type of film that needed a new fresh type of movies, this movie is almost a piece of art, stylish battles and good camera shots, along with characters well obtained and developed by actors that will surely make you feel the anger of the epic Hellenic-Persian battles. The movie is based on a graphic novel by Frank Miller, it don't try to resembles accurately the historical facts, but that's on purpose, because it can admirably put a bit of ""mythologycal characters"" in the story, that makes it more entertaining, incredible and really ""epic"". Although, if we see how the ancient stories were told to our ancestors, the mythological and fantastic facts appear in order to create a sense of admiration and fantasy that moved the patriotism of people.<br/><br/>The film, based on Miller's novel, shows the events in Greece, at the pass of the Thermopylae, when the king Leonidas of Sparta fought the Persian Empire against an army that vastly outnumbered them. Leonidas fought with 300 Spartans and 700 Thespian against an Persian army of almost 250,000 leaded by king Xerxes I, blocked them their way to reach Sparta and conquer it; the events that are presented in the movie were true (year 480 BC) and they were written by Herodotus. And show a great deploy of military strategies and combat techniques in this battlefield.<br/><br/>About the acting: Gerard Butler, great!; The Leonidas character is strong, furious, brave and shows his leadership as something admirable. Rodrigo Santoro, great also!; as king Xerxes I, he shows weakness, fear and leadership. The other Spartans character roles are great too (specially Deelios, Astinos, Steelios and Captain) 8/10!"

"gaz_uwic","7","2","5","31 March 2007"," Visually Stunning and enjoyable overall
","The film tells the story of 300 warriors from Sparta who battle thousands in order to protect their land and honour. From early on in this film the imagery and graphics are of the highest order, helping not only to enhance the battle scenes but also to add more blood, guts and all round gore to the film. Indeed, this is the main, but not the only, reason most people would see this film. The CGI is very well done and is laden on thick so the action, once the fighting starts, comes fast and frequent. The battle scenes are well choreographed and, while sometimes over the top, are often more enjoyable for it. Gerard Butler seems to relish his role and portrays the leader of the Spartans well. The other Spartans clearly enjoy their roles of being oiled up, shouting and generally letting off as much aggression and adrenalin as possible. The narration over the top of the film ensures you know what is happening (though its not hard to follow) and does add an atmosphere that sits quite well with the movie. It's not just the men that have fun, but also the leading lady - Lena Headey plays the Queen of Sparta superbly and it is a shame her character and sub plot is not developed more as she handles the role more than capably portraying an strong, yet understanding Queen. There are certain aspects of the film that do seem quite far fetched and at times laughable though. The plot lines and what's going to happen are startlingly obvious and so easy to work out that you want to shout it out, but then again having seen the trailers you're probably not coming along for a deep and meaningful film. Finally it has to be said that this film also probably contains the campest characters in recent cinema history - not least of all the leader of the enemy - Xerxes. An 8 foot tall showoff who wears more gold than you could shake a stick at and strikes the most shocking of poses! But this just all adds to the fun of the ride that is 300. Go and see it for the visual effects and the excitement the fight scenes offer as long as you leave any scruples and expectations of anything other than a popcorn eating visceral film at the till!!"
"huffdaddy","6","2","5","28 March 2007"," Great trailers do not a great movie make.....
","WARNING: CONTAINS ONE SPOILER BELOW!! Although forty is the same age as King Leonidas in this film, it also puts me outside what they call ""the target demographic"", and I guess my age has a lot to do with my lower-than-average rating.<br/><br/>I have seen too many great films to be overly impressed by films like this (and Troy) which have a stupendous amount of available back story and sizeable budgets yet still manage to fluff their lines. Yes, the film is stunning. Yes, it is faithful to the graphic novel (if not historical fact) while still applying enough of it's own ideas (including one truly memorable scene that was almost worth the overpriced IMAX admission on it's own) Yes, the male leads mostly hold their own (especially Leonidas's captain, who, funnily enough, I think played a similar character; to equally good effect, in Troy)And the script is generally okay (at it's best when lifting direct from the graphic novel - at it's worst resembles something written by a violent youth offender who has yet to lose his virginity) But the flaws had too much of an impact on this viewer's pleasure to be ignored. Though the Iranian government has probably been overly sensitive in their condemnation of the film (perhaps only the Iranian hippies and punks should be truly angered)the Persians (and every other baddie in the film) are depicted as irredeemable b*******; alternating only between the immoral states of cowardice, vindictiveness, hubris and hedonism. Why, the filmmakers even tag some of the baddies with freaky faces, lest we start to feel any sympathy towards them. Oh yes and there is a rape scene as well. It happens to the principal actress and would I suppose have been mildly emotionally involving - if only she could act. Mind you, she's better than the lone Spartan baddie, who appears to think he's in a completely different film. I can't abide films that won't trust me to make up my own mind about the bad guys. Even Troy was not so simplistic on this level. Also, would it have been too much trouble to ask actors, playing people that all COME FROM THE SAME REGION to try to keep their accents consistent? Perhaps if they had spent as much time acting as working out, this flaw wouldn't have been so prominent. Then again they could have just CGI'd the accents as they so obviously did (another flaw) with some of the actor's six-packs. But these are the minor points. Far more injurious to my enjoyment were the three ludicrous scenes which produced howling unintentional laughs from myself and other members of the packed audience. I won't describe them all, or in detail here. But a spoiler is necessary for even the outline of one scene.<br/><br/>S-P-O-I-L-E-R Suffice to say that when you are taken out of a film by the realization that the protagonist and antagonist are positioned, with the taller of the two behind and with his hands on the shoulder of the other during an exchange of unintentionally camp dialogue; it is hard to take things seriously from that point on. The people who were at the test screening of this film should never, ever be invited to see films for free again! And as for the antagonist,; what is the point of endowing Xeres with certain impressive CGI enhancements if not allowing him to use those attributes on the battlefield? He would certainly have made a more formidable and engrossing foe than the characterless drones who offered themselves up for slaughter. This is where the producers and directors highlight their most obvious flaw: a lack of imagination and risk to take this film beyond the good-very good, and into the realm of great. At time of writing it has already dropped out of the top 250. Give it a couple more years, as the novelty of the visuals and SAS recruitment style bravado wear off in say, a way that the storyline of the original Matrix won't, and it won't even be in the top 1000.<br/><br/>Before I forget: Extra kudos to the CGI team for editing out the shouty Leonidas's spittle AND to the crew operating the targeted wind machine that charmed all those shy female nipples out of hiding:-)"

","The battle of Thermopylae was one of the most significant of the ancient world, giving definition to the notion of Greek strength. It was a tale that was retold to emphasise the bravery of the 300 Spartan warriors. The film does the job of retelling the battle beautifully, and conveying its importance.<br/><br/>Each shot is beautiful and watching the film is like looking at a succession of film posters. The battle scenes were gruesomely beautiful, but more importantly very well edited, so that the narrative of the battle was easy to follow.<br/><br/>The film clearly owes a lot to recent cinema milestones, the use of the rhino and elephants and the appearance of the Persians, came straight from Lord of the Rings, and the slow motion shots follow clearly from The Matrix.<br/><br/>The film was also very funny at moments, where it intended to be. I wasn't sure why there were subtitles - perhaps people felt that the English accents would be hard to understand, but I thought everyone enunciated very well.<br/><br/>The film had the unremitting ferocity of The Passion of the Christ, and did not set out to question the morality of the protagonists, but such concerns are probably best left to documentary makers. 300 has dramatic impact and stunning imagery, it deserves to be counted as a masterpiece of film-making."

","The Joe Cool Experience: 300(2007)<br/><br/>Starring: Gerard Butler as King Leonidas Lena Headey as Queen Gorgo Dominic West as Theron Rodrigo Santoro as Xerxes<br/><br/>Plot: When it's learned that the Persians will invade Sparta and all of Greece, King Leonidas takes 300 Spartan soldiers to battle, against the governments wishes, against a million Persian soldiers.<br/><br/>As with Sin City, I hadn't actually read the graphic novel(also by Frank Miller) this was based on before seeing the movie. All I had to go on was trailer footage and so had no expectations going in except that I saw some great visuals. <br/><br/>What I got with this movie was an excellent action movie. This movie is what it is, a visually-stunning, extremely violent and bloody war movie. Let's start with the visuals. The same technology for Sin City I believe was used here, but you really can't tell. While that movie felt like a comic book/film noir, this uses it to make everything visually pleasing. The colors are bright and vivid, the action scenes are slowed down for full impact. The slowing down was stupid for some, but I found it to be a nice change of pace from the ultra fast cut-cut-cut fight scenes we're used to lately. <br/><br/>The effects also brought some otherworldly creatures to life, making this movie a combination of the true story of the Battle of Thermopylae and adding Greek mythology in there as well. We know that hunchbacks didn't exist and Xerxes probably was not that big, but it all enhances the viewing experience.<br/><br/>Secondly, this movie was ultra-violent. It's a war movie so it needed to be. Lots of blood everywhere with things like beheading, impalements, limbs lost, eye damage, arrows, blood everywhere. When this thing gets going it gets bloody and that worked just fine for me. <br/><br/>The acting, on some parts can go borderline-cheesy, so that would be one beef I had with this movie. Gerard Butler comes close to that area but manages to reign himself in to provide a solid performance as King Leonidas. The same can't be said for the majority of the other cast. In some ways the absurdity hinders it, and in other ways it helps. It makes it feel like a comic book, with over-the-top villains and lots of fight scenes.<br/><br/>I can't go a full rating for this movie, as I just feel it's not up to that standard(due to some lines spoken and acting) but I will recommend 300 because it's just a movie that every one should see. Especially the guys who want a bad-ass action flick.<br/><br/>Rating: **** of *****"

","I usually try and give immediate feedback where possible and as I have just finished watching the film, I think it's safe to say that I got exactly what I expected. In the same way that the film skirts any reasonable attempts at attention to detail, both in fact and picture, I will therefore not spend any time dressing up the experience for you.<br/><br/>This does have Sin City and Gladiator all over it, but fails to live up to either, if I'm honest. It doesn't portray it's characters well enough for you to care about them. You don't care so much as what happens to them, but those with a taste for violence will be entertained by how it happens to them.<br/><br/>This is a pretty film, dogged only by it's determination to entertain rather than inform. It could do both, but chooses not to. Nonetheless, entertaining it most certainly is. I sat through the whole thing and didn't yawn once. The fighting does get a bit repetitive after a while. After you've seen one nasty Persian knocked off a horse or get gutted by a spear, you've pretty much had the ride. Still, the ride is good enough, at least, to make you hop on a couple more times.<br/><br/>As I said, this is really all about fighting, and doing it with style. I was reminded of Troy on occasion, but the biggest nod goes to Gladiator, helplessly hoping to emulate something that, in my opinion, can't be faulted. The use of grayscale and reds is something that all Miller designed movies will no doubt be judged on in the future, but personally, after this and Sin City, I have seen enough of these already.<br/><br/>A no-brainer, truly, with delusions of grandeur, much like the Spartans themselves.

"stephenhoang","3","3","10","15 May 2007"," Singularly Tedious
","I understood from the start that ""300"" was supposed to be pure, adrenaline pumping entertainment. It wasn't trying to be intelligent, subtle, or emotionally moving. So, I approached this movie only with the expectation of seeing awesome action sequences because, quite frankly, ""300"" is simply a series of connected fight scenes. Yet, I was bored.<br/><br/>For the first twenty minutes, ""300"" is visually stunning with visceral and effective fight sequences. At first, director Zack Snyder's shifting between slow motion and fast motion, creating a stop and go effect, enhanced the action on screen. An early scene with an oracle was particularly beautiful cinematographically. However, once the second major fight sequence began, I realized that Zack Snyder didn't have any more tricks to use. By the end of the movie, after ninety more minutes of fighting, I had seen the same moves multiple times. For a film that is composed purely of action sequences, ""300"" was surprisingly uninspired and monotonous. I didn't see anything I hadn't seen before.<br/><br/>Of course, a film cannot be pure action. ""300"" makes a failed attempt at implanting story and humanity in between its many fight scenes. The queen tries to garner Spartan support for war, an outcast tries to become a Spartan soldier, a counsel-man tries to politically maneuver his way towards power. The entire story eventually cumulated in a lesson of freedom and bravery. Spartans were free and brave, and so they fought to continue their freedom and bravery. It's all very simple. However, if I was supposed to root for the valiant Spartans, I didn't know. I found myself annoyed more than anything else at the attempts of characterization. Snyder's paper-thin appeals for sympathy revealed just how one- dimensional all the characters were.<br/><br/>As a piece of pure entertainment, ""300"" barely succeeds. Its fight sequences become tedious, and its story and characters are un-satisfyingly underdeveloped. Even the cinematography, beautiful at first, looses its initial effectiveness. In the end, ""300"" is a violent and bloody bore."
"dmuel","2","3","10","30 March 2007"," Too Stupid !!
","I was heartened to see that many comments accurately described this film as the dumb piece of cinema it is. I truly enjoyed Sin City, Frank Miller's previous influence on Hollywood, even though it was a dark, perverse and brooding film. I had high hopes for ""300"". But, this was just re-hashed mayhem drawn from a slew of mainstream and B movies; even some of the dialogue was lifted from its predecessor, ""300 Spartans"". Some of the camera work and effects were truly impressive but did little to salvage the movie, sandwiched as they were between so many scenes of brawny body-builders strutting around the screen in their dark bikini briefs. The action was quite predictable at times, lacking in imagination and originality, and did little to build excitement. I wasn't looking for historical accuracy, not in a film like this. I merely wanted to be entertained, but this flick wasn't up to the task."

Truly, madly, deeply awful.<br/><br/>Save yourself some money on the cinema ticket; save yourself some money on buying or renting the DVD; save yourself some money watching it on pay TV; wait for it to come out on free-to-air TV in 3 years or so.

This film delivers on so many levels, but for me, falls just short of greatness. <br/><br/>It is visually stunning, and I don't just mean artistically - ladies, the men in this film rate a solid 10 (hot, hot, hot). I also loved Lena Heady as Queen Gorgo. I actually cheered out loud for her - this is a great modern female character. The chemistry between her and Gerard Butler was riveting and, in my opinion, carried the film. I enjoyed the pithy dialog and can't wait to replay a few scenes on DVD. <br/><br/>On the flip side, the opening of the film was a dud. The scenes of Leonidas growing up could have been cut. I understand they're trying to explain the Spartan warrior culture, but it just didn't launch me into the story. Although the violence in the film is stylized, I still had to turn away now and then. I was also annoyed by the narration - it was frivolous and distracting. I thought the acting in the film teetered between brilliance and melodrama, but my husband described it simply as ""cheesy.""<br/><br/>Overall, I liked it, but I think they made some mistakes which kept the film from reaching its potential.

The ultraviolent, heightened reality that you're (not just drawn but) sucked into demands your attention and never lets you catch a break. The story itself is fairly simple but effective and amazingly executed. The acting fits right in with the surroundings, dead serious, heavy, intense, and passionate. GERARD BUTLER delivers a performance with so much gravity that your eyes are riveted to him for every second he's on screen. He radiates authority, brutality, intelligence, power, royalty, humanity, and so much more. If he doesn't get the (long overdue) attention he deserves, I'll be forced to throw something. No amount of praise could do this film justice. Even the CREDITS are a work of artistic genius. Don't run, dive into theaters. 300 has to be seen to be believed."

","Knowing Frank Miller's graphic novels - and owning ""300"" - I was excited to sit in at a pre-screening of ""300"". I was a little reluctant, about how a 2 hour movie would keep the tension and excitement going, when the whole plot can really be told in one sentence. So, there was initial disappointment after the first 10 minutes, since some of the initial scenes seemed somewhat cheesy and not so very professional (i.e. the ""Wolf""-scene). Once the movie got rolling, the mood changed - and also the way the initial scenes were shot began to make more sense. There is a lot of action in this piece - which might seem a little surprising for a timepiece. Smart writing adds to the entertainment, as well as the very creative details; they are cruel and bloody, nonetheless creative. The imagery and soft coloring is incredible.<br/><br/>The main characters are well developed and King Leonidas (Gerard Butler) - while initially seemingly a cruel leader - turns out to be a true emperor who backs up his people with all he can give. I loved the special effects - and while I am not a huge fan of battlefield scenes, this movie really takes them to a new level. The effects aren't obvious, yet make the whole thing so much more enjoyable. Over some stretches, what is shown on the screen can be described as nothing else but a gore fest. Under normal circumstances I would not be in favor of such graphic violence, however, considering the background of what the movie is based on and also how well it is shot, I let that slide and got lost in the story.<br/><br/>Sometimes I wish that certain details were a little more believable (like some of the freaks), bottom line: ""300"" to me, is what ""Ben Hur"" must've been to our parents. Russel Crowe and ""Gladiator"" never could deliver this chill to me, but ""300"" certainly does.<br/><br/>9.5 out of 10 blood drenched battle spears"

","I had the opportunity to screen '300' last night, one night after it debuted at the Berlin Film Festival at a screening with the director; Zack Snyder. Fanboys rejoice - this is likely to be the most faithful adaptation of a graphic novel you will ever see. Each panel became a shot in the movie, and almost all of the dialogue remained the same, with the exception of some added scenes set in Sparta - scenes added, according to Snyder, to keep Sparta from being 'an abstraction' by the end of the movie.<br/><br/>For those who have not read the graphic novel; this is not an accurate retelling of the battle of Thermopylae. This is a campy action movie based on a campy graphic novel that uses a discredited version of the events surrounding the battle to tell a mythic story that will be very entertaining if you don't go in looking for a serious historical film.<br/><br/>Amusing touches added by Snyder include all of the Persians having American accents and remaining faithful to the (not really accurate) Herodotus' view of Sparta, which is true to Miller's novel, complete with gratuitous mentions of ""freedom"" as the thing they are fighting for."

"NateWatchesCoolMovies","10","3","11","18 July 2016"," Pure breathtaking adrenaline rush
","Tough. Muscular. Operatic. The very definition of epic. I remember sitting in the theatre during Zach Snyder's 300 and being just floored and knocked flat on my ass by the violence, spectacle and music on display, and that was just the first ten minutes. It's a historical war film unlike any other, and like it's sister film Sin City, it jumps right off the boldly crafted pages of Frank Miller's novel with all the movement and spirit of a motion picture, while still retaining the fluidity and distinction of a comic book. The sheer force of it will trample your senses into glorious oblivion, whisking you away for two thunderous hours of sound, fury and unrepentant battle. Like any sensation of the week, it gained haters who claim it isn't the winner everyone's says it is, or that it hasn't stood the test of time. They're either trying to go against the grain to be the 'cool minority', or they're just negative nitpicking nellies. No matter. In 300's case, they are resoundingly off key whenever I hear them bash it, and just dead wrong. It has stood the test of time, a process I measure by the ebb and flow of my desire to watch older films again and again. I often revisit this one, and marvel at it anew each time. The story follows the battle of Thermopolye, in which three hundred well trained, ridiculously combat savvy Spartan men faced off against a Persian army numbering near a million, led by their arrogent weirdo of a king, Xerxes (a very scary Rodrigo Santoro). They do this to protect their land and their people, a splinter group of sorts that takes up arms when the Spartan senate refuses to act. The battle is a relentless storm of blood, arrows, decapitated limbs, howling barbarians, wanton carnage and mass slaughter. It doesn't feel half as savage or heavy as my description sounds though, thanks to the poise and purpouse of the narration penned by Miller, and the extravagant, thought out choreography that includes a whole lot of beautifully satisfying slow motion that has become Snyder's trademark tool. Love it or hate it, I think it flairs up an action terrifically, especially ones as chaotic and hellbent as these. The Spartans are a wonder to see in action, virile death dealers with a full bore love for the heat of combat and a blatant, cavalier attitude in the very face of death. David Wenham is a force of gravity as Dilios, who provides the rousing narration and kicks ass as Butler's second in command. Butler makes a commanding Leonidas, his presence everything that you'd want to see in a king, from nobility, to necessary belligerence, to an overwhelming love for his kingdom that is present in every step, every spear throw, every furious war cry. A cheeky Michael Fassbender and Vincent Reagan round out the platoon nicely, and they all have wicked camaraderie that makes their bond in battle stronger. Lena Headey is fiercely attractive and devilishly competent as Queen Gorgo, with a love for Leonidas and their son that cuts through the brutality and gives it purpouse. Dominic West goes against type as Theron, a sniveling, traitorous bitch boy of a Senate member who aims to usurp Sparta and send everything to high hell. The cast goes on with memorable turns from Peter Mensah, Robert Maillet and the legendary Stephen Mchattie. Composer Tyler Bates churns out a score that soars, scorches and bellows forth a primal auditory symphony. This was Snyder first flexing his muscles after his visceral remake of Dawn Of The Dead that barely hinted at the wonders in his career to come. Here he presents a staggering visual aesthetic that he would go on to use in his masterful adaptation of Watchmen, the sadly misunderstood, excellent Sucker Punch, and his DC Comics films which are unbelievable. It all started here with flash and flourish, a jaw dropping sword and sandal typhoon of a film that will give your adrenal gland a workout and your sound system a good old thrashing. In a word: Epic."
"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","8","3","11","31 March 2007"," Stylized, adrenaline-filled awesomeness
","Given that this was made so soon after Sin City, one cannot deny the possibility that a reason for making it was the popularity and widespread success of the aforementioned film. Both are based on comics of Frank Miller's... both are bloody, and packed with adrenaline and style. However, regardless of what may or may not have been in the minds of the producers, this movie is entertaining and fulfilling. Whilst not as well-rounded and perfectly executed as Sin City, it has plenty of action, cool shots and intensity to go around. I have not read the original comic book, so I cannot comment on how well this tells the story that Miller(*not* the historians; don't make the mistake of confusing this film for an actual account of events!) intended, but I can say that it pulls off the comic book feel pretty darn well. The visuals are simply stunning, and the movie is filled, just about to the very brink, with gorgeous designs and camera-work that amazes. The many boxes of text found in most comic books are translated to the medium of film with a narrator, and it works remarkably well. I was worried early on that the narrator would remain for all of the film... but I found it to not only mesh with the visuals but improve the overall experience. The music is part orchestrated score, and all fits exceptionally well. The pacing was flawless. The acting I found to be masterful for just about every part. The dialog varies, but the majority is good. The grandiose speeches and the serious tone of them is lightened pleasantly through occasional wit. The battles are massive, bad-ass and often quite bloody(though there was less gore than I had expected... but I didn't mind). I would guess that big parts of the audience are comprised of people coming mainly for the battles, and I would say that most will leave the theater satisfied. The sequences of fighting are long, stylized, well-choreographed and wickedly cool. I found the rest of the movie to be interesting and engaging, and I wouldn't say that the fights are too long. One thing I really liked, and that got the movie and Frank Miller my respect, was the way the Spartan women were depicted: Strong, passionate and as full of courage and fortitude as the men. Whether or not this is historically accurate, I don't know, but that Miller and the movie would depict women that way is something I can only support and encourage. The movie was not perfect, however; some shots were less spectacular than they could or should have been, and the last battle was perhaps a little disappointing. Still, this is a movie that I urge anyone who enjoys action, macho-ism and comic book style to watch. I strongly recommend this to any fan of comic books and any man into action. 8/10"

","Frank Miller is a lucky individual. The recent adaptations from his comic books came up pretty close to the original materials. But the main difference between Sin City and 300 is obviously the understory about freedom and its depiction of democracy rather than on the the visual(and even stunning) description of violence. The underlying message of the film about the price of democracy (and how to save it, and at what price ?) is so much present those days that Miller's (and Snyder's) answer is ultimately scary and nihilistic : the price of freedom is blood and death, and is to be conveyed by the far right-wing of democracy, an almost fascist elite of fighters, ready and willing to die for it). I'm glad that the characters kept their complexity (according to the book) and that Snyder managed to inject crossed story lines invented for the motion picture (the senate scenes, which emphasize the sense of loss and failure of democracy, without making it relevant to a point where the answer could be fascism). A blockbuster, then, but an unorthodox one, a smart one, and an incredibly gifted one (special bonus for camera moves and photography)"

Gerard Butler is totally believable as King Leonidas/Leader of the Spartans (imagine if Oliver Stone had cast him as Alexander?) And the women and children characters make strong impressions as well.<br/><br/>BUT let's face it I went to see this film for its LOOK. It looks fantastic and feels it too. (Last year's X-MEN 3 sent me out of the theatre with the same sort of good charged buzz although X3 is a better pic). The ""slow parts"" are entertaining. GLADIATOR died when Russell Crowe wasn't on the screen. 300 doesn't die when Butler is off the screen which he isn't very often.<br/><br/>The violence and gore is abundant but never gratuitous. It is so stylized and over-the-top that I never winced once from watching it. James Cameron and Paul Verhoeven and Tony Scott stage such bloodletting similarly. Snyder knows how to thrill without sickening.<br/><br/>DEFINITELY NOT FOR KIDS. <br/><br/>If you bring a child into 300 then you are a SICKO (go back and wallow in your Saw and Hostel and Hills Have Eyes gorno-crap and get sterilized -- please do the human race a favor)!<br/><br/>I can't say that I loved this pic, but, WOW!, I like it lot and more than I liked THE DEPARTED.<br/><br/>Hey Zack, will this mean they'll greenlight WATCHMEN?

","This movie is an absolute joke. A friend and I saw this film for the express purpose of laughing at it's apparent overblown ridiculousness. I was literally rolling on the floor when a sequence involving a rhino and an elephant fought the Spartans. I was surprised to find that some people actually take this movie seriously. The movie was NOT historically accurate, unless you believe that the Spartans actually dressed in Superman capes and speedos and apparently had awesome ab machines. I also learned that in Ancient Greece a majority of fighting took place in slow motion. Overall, a pretty bad film and this comes from someone who loves violent films."

Messers Fong and Bissell, responsible for the production design and photography have crafted a visual masterpiece. The CGI effects are advancing by leaps and bounds..the battle sequences are stunning;easily rivaling ""The Return of The King"". There is also a deeply erotic undertone to this film...not that I am complaining speaking from a mans' point of view but everybody in the cast is in peak physical condition, even the older members of the cast look like they could kick butt.The look of the film itself gives the film a ""historical"" look about it..""historical"" being the only adjective I can honor this film with. The near sepia-toned appearance adds authenticity as if someone was there to film the action and the film was found stored in a cave in Greece somewhere. Not unlike a faded negative. Standing back from the movie you can see it is rich in color and the over-saturation with the sepia-tone works perfectly. The only reason I do not give this film a 10 is the soundtrack. I was impressed by the power of the all-male choir in the beginning of the film but less-impressed with the heavy guitar riffing later in the film. Not that the soundtrack was inappropriate,(being the anal retentive person I am), I thought more brass instruments. kettle drums and a hint of bagpipes would be a dash more stirring. A splendid piece of film-making,,,cannot wait to see it again."

","""300"" is something to get excited about, just to put that out there. Never before has the glory of battle been such a rousing and intense experience as it is here. Never mind the ho-hum acting from a cast of largely unknown supporting players and the testosterone-driven dialogue of 300 Spartan warriors battling to the death against the massive, 1000+ Persian army of Xerxes (the towering Rodrigo Santoro). The exact historical details of the Battle of Thermopylae in 648 B.C. escapes me, but The History Channel and Frank Miller's original ""300"" graphic novel do fill me in on some information. Spartan king Leonidas (Scotsman Gerard Butler) leads 299 of his fellow countrymen into the battle against the mammoth Persian army, which outnumbers them 3-1. A great leader and a motivational speaker, he is; the words ""retreat"" and ""surrender"" are not in his vocabulary. But their early skirmishes are costly for Xerxes's military forces, who underestimates the will and strategic determination of Leonidas's 300-strong force. The battles grow more and more intense and frequent, with plenty of graphic battlefield carnage to satisfy the gore-hounds of the masses. Back on the home-front, Queen Gorgo (Lena Headey) is trying to convince the Spartan council to send more reinforcements for her husband's military forces. Since ""Dawn of the Dead"" (2004) showed much promise for what it could do for his career, director Zack Snyder seems to have a firm grip on the material, even if the plot takes a backseat to the graphic battle scenes in the second half. His eye for detail is overwhelming (even as limbs are lopped off and the body count easily surpasses the thousands), since it pays close attention to Miller's original graphic novel (especially during the closing credits, with artwork lifted directly from the panels). Much of the action is CGI and filmed on sound-stages and against computer-generated backdrops, so the close-quarters combat throws you right in along side the Spartan army. ""300"" is undoubtedly a success, even if the performers are short-changed in the end. I do wish that the film could have explored more of Spartan culture (since let's face facts, a lot of Americans are not up to par on their world history - including me), instead of just catapulting us into the action with only a few passing lines of dialogue to clue us in on what's going on. The details of Sparta's 300 should live forever, though, because of this film.<br/><br/>10/10"

","OK, finally I saw it and here are my thoughts (Spoilers Ahead). <br/><br/>As soon as the earth trembles I am bracing myself to finally see Spartans in action. The way the spear fly out of nowhere and hits the hapless Persian dead, simply JAW DROPPING. That was a perfect way to start a battle then seconds later.... off goes the Persians about to be slaughtered by the mighty 300 Spartans.<br/><br/>There are no fast cut editing, shaky camera or stop motion technique, just long cut action sequences. Viewers can easily grasp all of the actions right before their eyes with normal to slow motion then back to normal speed frame technique to highlight the final blow. Complete with zoom in zoom out, PERFECT! Not a bit of an action left out. Totally satisfying.<br/><br/>The Spartan fought as a unit just like in team sport. Each spartan has its own position during battles and the technicality of doing defense using shields and attacking using their spears was perfectly executed. Such choreography was stunning like watching a beautiful ballet dance. All of these eye goodies while being blown away with surreal sound and musical scoring makes my heart stop beating.<br/><br/>This is based on the battle of Thermopylea so basically we already know the story. But then, the script was so sweet, poetic and masterfully delivered by the wonderful casts. Nothing to say about the visuals. Just refer to other reviews here and you'll get the idea. Go see it!

I sat in a stifling hot theater for two hours surrounded by a bunch of obnoxious high school kids and wished it would never end. This is not just a film, but truly an experience.<br/><br/>First off, the movie is beautiful. Every inch of every scene just radiates with beauty and magic, and it really made the movie that much better.<br/><br/>Gerard Butler shines as King Leonidas. The man obviously trained seriously to make the film and he brings so much to the table, I can't imagine him ever being able to top himself. It's too bad this kind of performance wont be remembered come awards time, because he truly had me ready to stand by his side and do battle. Not just him mind you, but everyone in this film were truly great.<br/><br/>The battle scenes were breathtaking and bold. They are not realistic like saving private ryan, but the way they are shot, slow motion to speed up, and the way the armies rip through each other is just a sight to behold. The blood splattering was definitely reminiscent of sin city, but that really does not effect it one bit.<br/><br/>My very limited negatives toward the movie are the xerxes character, whom I just thought looked like dennis rodman, and a couple of the creatures, which were not on screen for long enough to bother.<br/><br/>This movie is everything I wanted out of it and I can't wait to see it again."

","300 is the story of King Leonidas and his Spartans who made their last stand against an army of Persians. You know that it's somewhat hopeless for these guys but they knew that death was coming for them and are brave enough to face it. But before they do, they made sure that they made King Xerxes very furious by decreasing his army from millions to thousands if I'm correct.<br/><br/>Most epic films tend to be very serious and very reserved. In this film, Synder succeeds by incorporating every modern film-making technique including bullet time and choreography in every battle sequence, so as the additional rock score and some modern dialog where King Leonidas say ""We're in for a one wild night."" it's so effective that it made the film very hip and cool to watch.<br/><br/>300 is a very innovative take on period films which has never been attempted before, for it is the first of it's kind. Recommend for all young adult viewers especially the Matrix generation, Long live the Spartans...AAHOOOO!!!! AAHOOOO!!!!"

","Acting, effects, plot--hands down, it's a winner. I truly wish they had made it sooner. I thought The Lord of the Rings Trilogy set the bar far too high to be reached by any other epic movie in the coming decade, but clearly I was mistaken. 300 fulfills any cravings a person may have for excellent visuals, gripping plot, and high-grade acting. A bit fantastical in terms of the creatures and some of the characters featured, but the element of the mystic helped to enhance the plot and bring about the feel of epic Greece--as well as the beauty of the graphic novel. There was so much more art in this movie, more depth, and a presentation of patriotism, heroism, and honor that is far more moving than what we find in the earlier Greek ""epic"" movie, Troy, which is more of a Hollywood Hurrah than a nod to Homer's excellent work.<br/><br/>Go watch it immediately if you've been hankering for something as meaty as the Lord of the Rings. It's shorter, more gruesome, and for a more mature audience, but you won't regret it. Here's to hoping Frank Miller and everyone involved in this piece gets an Oscar. (~.^)"

I merely shrugged it off as an over-hyped movie (the more i noticed, the more 300 posters I saw, paraphernalia for the 300 game, etc). I was lucky enough to be presented with the honor of it being at my college for screening. The movie started off slow, and my suspicions of over hype were slowly confirmed. However, as the movie progressed, I was simply blown away by the graphic and violent smack down the army of 300 delivered. The CG was stunning way beyond comprehension, and will render the movie-goer breathless for certain scenes. Director Zack Snyder was also meticulous to detail as well, careful to portray fight scenes and blood in utmost glory. The cast was well chosen from the villains to the heroes. The sharp and witty humor integrated in the script was a compliment to the film also. Watching this movie on a big-screen is a must, as the audience cheered on the Spartans till the very end."

","Homoeroticism at its most stylish. Lumps of pure visualised muscle walking in sandals and red togas. Obnoxiously loud roars piercing the battlegrounds, asserting the Spartan masculinity to the world. Hardcore love making with thrusts in slow motion, keeping in time with the ethereal sounds of women crying. This is the ultimate ""lads"" fantasy. Incredibly simple with a bountiful of quotes to disguise the dreadful non-existent plot, fooling viewers into thinking this is a memorably excellent ordeal. It isn't. Snooze-inducing perhaps? Refusing to surrender to the God-king Xerxes, Leonidas rallies up 300 Spartan warriors to wipe out his endless army.<br/><br/>""Fascist propaganda"" harks a critic. ""An exercise in self-indulgence"" claims another. Whilst the former is a stretch too far, likening the Spartan politics to a certain Western country as they combat a variety of ""far off world"" armies (hardly Snyder's intentions...), the latter remark is definitely more appropriate. Snyder, infamous for style over substance, adapts Miller's graphic novel with a near-perfect aesthetic imitation.<br/><br/>The colour grading, the excessive CGI blood, the myriad of stylised shots that are suitable enough to fill your bedroom wall with glorious posters. The combat sequences are what make 300 the fan-favourite classic that it is today, and essentially cemented Snyder's trademark visuals for all of his upcoming films. Particularly the ab-normally amazing one take tracking shots of Leonidas decimating waves of enemies, with his abs on full display. Abs! Seriously, these abs are so defined it makes bodybuilders question their workout regime.<br/><br/>But despite the stylised ""madness"" that allows Leonidas to roar ""This. is. Sparta!"", the warriors dining in hell are actually dining in an incredibly tedious film. There's no substantial plot, and you're kidding yourself if you believe there is one. Just Butler, in all his physical prowess, exhuming testosterone to all of his fellow cast members, encouraging them to shout that tiny bit louder. Enemies arrive, enemies are slain. Rinse and repeat until the inevitable final showdown that truly shows how one-dimensional these Spartan terminators are.<br/><br/>If a specific warrior met their tragic demise early on, no emotive response was to be had. Just hollow shells, with mediocre acting abilities, allowing Snyder to focus on showcasing his visual flair. That's it. The political conspiracy back in Sparta skewed the plot's momentum and forcibly shoved female empowerment in the viewer's face, y'know, just in case watching naked men fight was too masculine. The Greek mythological fantasy elements, of diseased wizards and oracles on a mountain and stuff, were underdeveloped and shoe-horned in just to enable further narration that plagued the entire film. I've watched the Battle of Thermopylae a good three times, and have fallen asleep at some point with each viewing. The pacing is just off the charts, and not in an acceptable way!<br/><br/>Alas, despite my usual acceptance of style over substance, this swords and sandals extravaganza has never fully worked for me. There are glimpses of excellence, most prominently during the multiple combat sequences and the quotes I love shouting when cooking dinner, but is weighed down by a ""plot"" that has no actual plot. I think I fell asleep this time during the CGI rhinoceros charging? Urgh..."

Now, I've come to realize that if this movie barely had anything, than that's what my review could be: a short review of what was wrong with this movie.<br/><br/>Right off the bat, the screen is filled with extremely ugly visual effects, which is one of only two things the movie offers. The movie tries so hard to make these visuals look abstract or artistic, but they come off looking ridiculous and stupid. The only other thing the movie has to offer are artistic action sequences, which, while entertaining the first time you see them, get boring by the end. So, the two things the movie has going for it are artistic visuals and battle sequences, which are both shown within the first half of the movie so the second half is completely boring because you've seen everything the movie has to offer.<br/><br/>Now, a lot of movies show the majority of what they have to offer in the first half of the movie, but those movies still have an engaging story and characters to be invested in throughout the film. The only character you'll remember by the end of this movie is King Leonidas (Gerard Butler), which is only because of his famous line, ""This is Sparta!"" before kicking an enemy messenger into a pit. <br/><br/>What about the story? Three hundred Spartan warriors led by Leonidas go off to fight an invading Persian army. The entire movie is just them getting ready to fight and fighting. That's all there is to the story, which isn't interesting, which is mixed with uninteresting characters, so what's there to like about this movie?<br/><br/>There is almost nothing to this movie.

If you have not watched this film, watch it. You will not regret it. <br/><br/>The acting in this film pleasantly surprised me, Gerard Butler is not known for his excellent acting skills and though he desperately tried to hide his accent, I think the little hints of it worked very well in his angry monologues and spurring speeches. Michael Fassbender was great as usual, for his film debut, I can see why his career has taken off so well. Dominic West played a subtle villain very well, his calm and supposed democratic appearance was torn down in excellent form in certain scenes and he portrayed his character with great precision. Again, like a lot of his films, I wish he had a greater role in '300'. All of the other actors in this film performed well and I cannot find a specific actor who let down the film as a whole.<br/><br/>Of course the setting can be a bit unusual at first but as it goes on you get used to the almost cartoon-like definition. It's quite refreshing seeing something like '300' because you cannot help but look at some of the great CGI scenery, as well as the slow motion action scenes. <br/><br/>The script can be confusing, for example, the main villain has a tiny back story and it is very difficult to see why they are all fighting anyway. However, the dialogue is this films' greatest aspect. Forget the acting and the effects, it's the long monologues that really bring out the emotion. Particularly at the conclusion of the film, it is then when you truly realise how great this film was. Overall I would thoroughly recommend it. Even if you don't like war films or gory films you should still watch this, purely as a piece of cinema."

Suffice it to say that the genre of ""historical fantasy"" into which 300 falls is a complete oxymoron. It can be either history or fantasy, but not both. 300 is fantasy.<br/><br/>The Battle of Thermopylae is possibly the most important battle in Western history. If the Spartans and their allies had not held the Persians for as long as they did, the other Greek states may not have had time to deploy a full army at Plataea and thus could have been defeated in detail. So, the Persians conquer Greece, meaning no Hellenistic civilization, no Aristotle, and very little Greek influence in Rome. The Persians may then have gone on to conquer Italy itself, in turn meaning no Rome and no Latin influence in Italy, France, Spain, Portugal, and Britain. No Europe, and no United States of America.<br/><br/>This didn't happen, for which most of us are I'm sure quite thankful even if they have not articulated the above as I have. Our ancestors shaped the way we are by living the way they did. That being said, don't you want to know what the men who came before us were really like? Don't you want to know exactly how they fought, thought, lived and died? Wouldn't such knowledge help us to better understand who we are? And if you wish to portray the events of the past, do you not have an obligation to do so in the most accurate and truthful way possible?<br/><br/>To knowingly bend and twist and break apart history for any reason is to tarnish the memory of the dead. It is to say openly that their civilization was not important.<br/><br/>So don't shrug your shoulders and give me your good-natured ""Whassa big deal"" attitude.

Persian ruled there for 225 yrs that ""300"" is a story about that period. Before and after that 225 yrs period(this period was around 500B.C), other ethnic groups in Iran ruled there. So, neither Persian Empire's culture means Iran's culture, nor its madness belongs to others. We can't interpret events in those periods with today's mentality and culture. They just wanted more wealth, more slaves, and more area. There are lots of fictional stories about them that they were so democrat and liberal!! So funny ehh, Kings were so dictator. Even in their few discovered written materials, kings expressed how they ordered to kill people brutally. They were killing people and any opponents; but their savagery now is being shown as a positive action. Persian people can create an imaginary world for themselves and showing their ancestors were the best, but they can not hide reality forever, although they have tried it in last centuries, especially in 20 century. Lots of fakes,false,untrue stories. Even it has been attempted to make materials to show them as ancient materials!!!

","Based on Frank Miller's novel this epic masterpiece, directed by Zack Snyder, retells the Battle of Thermopylae in 480 B.C., the well known struggle of 300 Spartans and 700 Thespians (whose heroic sacrifice unfortunately is passed over, both in the novel and the film) under Spartan King Leonidas' leadership in Thermopylae, (""Hot Gates"" in English) versus the huge 1.000.000 army of Xerxes who attempted to conquer Greece. Although typically the Persians won, morally they lost. The battle became known for the bravery shown from the hopelessly outnumbered Greeks and particularly from Spartans and their king, Leonidas, who won the moral victory and glory as the eternal symbol of heroic death, because of their ""last stand"", the first known ""last stand"" in History. Frank Miller's novel was partly inspired by another 1962 film based on the Battle of Thermopylae, ""The 300 Spartans"". The fact that free men died for their country's law and honor, enthused him. <br/><br/>Movie's plot is the same as the novel, but some extra material has been added, including new villains, sex scenes between Leonidas and Gorgo, a political subplot involving new characters and a significantly expanded role for the Queen of Sparta. The film itself is an innovative cinematic achievement (graphics, special visual effects etc.). Battle scenes are simply outstanding and exhibit Spartan phalanx's fighting power. Tyler Bates' music features Azam Ali's exotic vocals.<br/><br/>Gerard Butler is brilliant as Leonidas. He's incredibly convincing, as Sparta's hero who resolved to face Persians and hold the pass of Thermopylae with 300 Spartans, where he was joined by a 7000 Greek force, despite Ephors' domestic opposition. He brings acting skill and athletic exuberance. Incontrovertibly he was the best choice as Leonidas and in my opinion he surpassed Richard Egan's great performance in the same role in 1962 version. Great performances too, from: Tom Wisdom as the young but unlucky Astinos, Vincent Regan as his brave father, the Captain, Michael Fassbender as Stelios the bravest of all ""300"" (based on historical Dienekes who quoted the famous ""we'll fight in the shade"", when threatened that Persian arrows would blot out the sunlight) and David Wenham as Dilios the story-spinner narrator (based on historical Aristodemos who suffered an eye injury, was sent away and so survived). <br/><br/>Lena Headey as Queen Gorgo, Leonidas' beloved wife is story's key character. Beautiful Gorgo is given much bigger presence in the film than in the graphic novel, with a story arc centering on her rallying the Spartan Council of the Elders to support Leonidas' choice to stand against Xerxes. She has to confront and finally kill, the corrupted from Persian gold and villain traitor Theron (a fictional character, added in the film and played by Dominic West), so as to persuade the Spartan Council to declare war on Persia. Actually, both Herodotus and Plutarch mention Gorgo for her political activity, acumen and wisdom shown at various other occasions. So, Gorgo's political struggle to help Leonidas could be historically possible, even if it didn't happen that way. <br/><br/>Although its box office success, controversy arose over 300's historical accuracy and it's depiction of Persians. Some labeled it as racist or fascist art. Various critics, historians, journalists, and officials of the Iranian government, including President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, denounced the film, for presenting Persians as bloodthirsty zombies or ""black"" people. <br/><br/>Actually, the ""baddies"" in the movie are not presented as ""african"" or ""black"" people¬ï only three Xerxes' emissaries and a decapitated general are portrayed as ""black"" or Africans in order to portray that time vast Persian Empire's multiracial and multinational character. Xerxes and the rest of Persian troops are portrayed as ""whites"" or Caucasians, as they were indeed. So it's not racist. Furthermore, Mr. Ahmadinejad and his Islamic regime is the ideological descendant of 7th century's AD, Muslim conquerors of Iran, who destroyed ancient Persian civilization. Thus it's ridiculous to pretend to be Ancient Persia's advocate, while he's actually an Ancient Persia-hater. <br/><br/>The historical events are depicted very accurately, such as: the cruel Spartan law for weak and sick male babies, the ""Agoge"" system for the education, the ""Krypteia"" (young Spartans' survival into the countryside), the Spartan women's social status, the Spartan war code, fleet destroying hurricane, battle details etc., plus the famous quotes: such as Gorgo's (to Leonidas) ""Come back with it, or on it (his shield)"" or Leonidas' (to Persians) ""Come and Get Them (Molon Labe)""etc. The film demonstrates a specific affinity with the original material of Simonides, Aeschylus, Herodotus in that it represents Thermopylae as a ""clash of civilizations"" and a battle of ""the Greek idea of the free citizen of an autonomous polis"" against ""Eastern centralism and collective serfdom"". It's just in the visualization that it's surrealistic, because the intention was to entertain first and teach second. <br/><br/>Of course it's needless to say that filmmakers in artistic license, added fictional elements to the story, such as: a) the grotesque Persian Immortals (which are not part of the original graphic novel), b) Xerxes' (played by Rodrigo Santoro) surreal appearance as a bald tall androgynous, c)Ephialtes (played by Andrew Tiernan) the Greek traitor, as a vengeful Spartan Quasimodo-like hideous hunchback, whereas in reality was a Malian of unknown external appearance d) Ephors as gnarled and black souled, bribed by Xerxes, old priests who ""keep"" a beautiful oracle girl in their temple, whereas in reality they were annually elected by and from the people powerful officials, etc. However we shouldn't forget that Xerxes was really a vicious and extreme arrogant who claimed to be divine and ruled in an authoritarian manner (he had the sea whipped because it wasn't calm), and that according to Aristotle the Ephors were corrupted tyrants. <br/><br/>""300"" is a war film, where battle, death and sacrifice are celebrated. It preserves the Thermopylae's spirit and captures the martial ethos of Sparta. If some critics believe that simplifies the meaning of freedom vs. tyranny, then they should reread Herodotus, Plutarch and Diodorus again."

","I really don't understand all those who voted 1 or 2.. I guess they had fun when they did that. I cant believe that anyone on this planet would consider that this film deserves 1. The cinematography technique is unique so far, only sin city was something like this but ""300"" beats them all in originality. The special effects are amazing and the colors are splendid. They fit in the scenario perfectly! Actors played wonderful and script was beautifully done and so on and so forth. But thats my personal opinion and i should appreciate this film from a 3rd person view. Even so i will stick to my personal opinion: This movie deserves 10+ for everything i wrote a few rows ago. Some say its an awful movie because it doesn't reflect reality but thats just it: this film isn't a history one, neither does it say that it is inspired from a true story. The story is a legend, so was Troy or Alexander. This is an epic/drama film."

","This is so far the best movie of 2007 I have seen. I'd like to first to talking about the special effects. It brought me excitement, chills, and a lot of shocks. The one thing I'd like to say the most is the beginning the way it opens up. Since when I was first seeing it for the first time, I knew I was in for a lot of gore and intense battle scenes, but by the sound of the loud noises, it sent a long chill over my body, and I don't really even know why. There were a lot of parts like that while I was watching the movie, and it is extremely loud. Some parts bored me a little, but the battle scenes just blew me away, and were awesome. I recommend this movie definitely. And if I were you, If you haven't seen it yet, and you want to so much, I recommend you buy the DVD the first day it is released, I know I will.

(sorry many big lie's ) there are many movies with lie's, but this one is top of them. you just need to read a little history , so you will know what a lie you watched. as you seen in the movie they show the "" Xerxes "" ( His real name is ""Khashayar sha"" ) (king of Persia) look like the African people with the strange things in his nose and ears and ..... . well if you don't know the Persian people are white and Aryan descent , for example the same as German are. and You believed the 300 Spartan could resist against thousands Persian army? ( not a millions ) ( another big lie )well if it was true why on that days persia was empire? if it was right so the Greeks could uses 3000 Spartan to capture the world . lol the truth is there was thousands army under 300 spartan commander. and as a movie its look like a fantasy cartoon without any good actor or actress . why no superstar or just a star didn't play on it? we Iranian ( same Persia ) haven't any problem with Greek people , we look like to each other, in culture , in family things and ... , this is just you USA ( The Government ) want to do and change peoples idea about us. well this is what a country with 500 years history want to do to the country with 5000 years history . i hope other people in the world just think and read more about history. well a few things more: 1- there wasn't less than one star , so i couldn't give zero star to this movie. 2- The young Director of this film Zack Snyder is more look like Gay than the Xerxes. 3- What razor spartan uses to shave their body ? lol 4- and sorry if i have mistake on words or grammar, cause i'm not English.<br/><br/>An Iranian Thanks"

","Yes it is based on Miller's Graphic novel so you and all the other fools should stop criticising it for not being historically correct oh no wait because I'm sure that there were 10 foot giants around then weren't there? It only has a very small amount of the actual history in the graphic novel but if you weren't so narrow minded i'd guess you'd know that wouldn't you, and if the history's not important then why bring it up in the first place. and as for the narratives, they are mainly taken out of Millers dialogue from the comics so you're actually criticising him and can you explain what you mean by awkward because that doesn't actually make any sense in this context, and as you're such a history fan you're criticising the plot of a film roughly based on a TRUE STORY. <br/><br/>Your right the action scenes are kick ass n if you actually had any appreciation for good films you'd see how much effort has gone into each and every fight scene in the movie to make it resemble the comics.<br/><br/>300 is SO awesome it actually made me sick, seriously i physically repulsed"

The worst aspect of this film is that it's basically LOR with attitude. Nothing but walking in this film! Walking, walking, walking!!! Sure, I loved the battle scenes. They were amazing...but it took too much walking and talking (like 35 minutes at one point) just to see 3 minutes of action! We watched this with my stoned brother in law and even he fell asleep!!!

"bigjunior45","10","2","6","21 April 2007"," Based off of a GRAPHIC NOVEL not based on ancient history
","For all of those who are disappointed from this movie because it's not true from it's history background are freaking idiots. For those who want to go see this movie please PLEASE keep this in mind that this isn't based on ancient history but on a graphic novel. This is entertainment not reality....if you want real accurate stuff than i suggest you to leave the theater and go home turn the TV to MTV and watch their lame ass reality shows. This movie is great in such ways of the acting, the special effects, the fight scenes and the storyline. The acting was excellent in many ways, ways in which they reacted in the fight scenes on how they expressed their pain and emotions. The special effects are just out of this world. I was so amazed and drawn in on the movie because of the special effects that i made me see this movie twice. The blood and gore was what this film needed hence it being a action/fighting movie. The storyline explained how the main character started out the way he did from childhood to adulthood as a warrior. It's starts of slow but it really needed it to explain the story. And i tell you what when it starts in on the battle scenes it don't stop till the movie is done and over with. If you like blood and gore than this movie is for you. It's a movie for entertainment and a movie to sit back enjoy. I say this again because all of these reviews are just bugging the crap out of me but this movie isn't suppose to be a history reminder movie but a Graphic Novel. It'll have some weird characters and strange customs but who cares it has action, battle scenes, blood/gore, and did i say battle scenes. If you go in this movie thinking about a graphic novel/comic book type of movie than you wont be disappointed but if you're going in there to learn about history than you're in the wrong place...the library is two blocks down the street. And for all of those who have watched any TRUE STORY movies most of those movies are true but Hollywood has some extras to it to make it more exciting. For example The Invicible with Mark Wahlberg, at the end when he recovers the fumble and scores the TD...it happened but he never ran no 40yds to score the TD he ran maybe 10-5yds in real life. Just something to think about.....Hollywood adds more than what there really is. 10 out of 10"
"alterego_spyder","10","2","6","18 April 2007"," Easily the best movie I have ever experienced.
","What can I say, other than WOW! I am only 17 but I consider myself a fairly active moviegoer, and this one blew me away. I am the type of person that not only goes to see a movie in theaters just once, but i usually don't see them again after that unless they leave a serious impression on me, and this movie did. I have seen this movie four times in theaters and if going to the movies didn't cost so much i would have gone more. Everything about this movie is as close to perfect as it gets. The visual effects were absolutely awesome, the landscapes, the city, even the blood. The acting was great, not just by one or two people, but by every single member of the cast. Also, before I go further, I want to state that I have seen this movie twice with less than remotely good sound systems and it didn't make the slightest difference. I saw 300 the third time in my hometown theater which is notorious for having a horrible sound system and I came back the next night just because it didn't matter. However, when this movie is seen with a good sound system it is just that much better.<br/><br/>Prior to seeing this movie I say that Gladiator was my favorite movie of all time, but, I must agree with some of the comments I have read- 300 makes Gladiator look like a Saturday morning cartoon. I give this movie a ten because the rating system doesn't go higher."

"little_mac789","10","2","6","11 April 2007"," Great Epic
","300 achieves brilliantly what it sets out to do; to create a movie based off Frank Miller's graphic novel. I was amazed by the level of skill and detail inserted into every scene.<br/><br/>For people who disagree with a rating of 10 in saying that it had a simple plot and dubious script there should first consider the movie's origin, a graphic novel! Not a thriller by Dan Brown. As such many gave it a score below what it deserved.<br/><br/>The fight scenes are excellent with the Spartans being appropriately powerful, disciplined and skilled though still defeatable (like in the immortals scene). I did find Xerxes a bit strange with his martigra style costume though I had to remember, this is based off a graphic novel so anything goes.<br/><br/>I found the personalities of the characters very well rehearsed and appropriate with the Xerxes being the spoilt child-king, the queen being diplomatic and formal, and the king Leonidas (Butler) being blunt, dangerous, and true to spartan culture in every way.<br/><br/>The one part of the movie that shocked me was how easily and effectively they managed to insert comedic lines. All amusing phrases were placed at appropriate times and received many laughs from the audience. A good example is Butler's confrontation with Xerxes for the first time where he blatantly jested at a man who thought himself a god Overall I found 300 to be amazing from the very beginning to the climatic end thanks to the detail and amazing battles. On a foot note I am quite biased for this movie so don't see it based off hearsay or reviews.<br/><br/>10/10"

","It took me four weeks and three tries to see this film (one time the movie sold out while I was in line). It was definitely worth it. Yes, the narration at the beginning sounds a bit corny and may make you worry that you picked the wrong movie. However, after about 2-3 minutes I was sucked into the story. The visuals are amazing (especially on that huge screen) fight scenes are unforgettable and vivid, but the best part is the acting. You probably haven't heard of more than two of the actors in this movie, but they are all well-cast and each one knocks it out of the park. The only complaint I have is with the narration at the very beginning and at the very end (just a little cheesy, but forgivable). See this movie. You know you want to."
"alexframe","8","2","6","7 April 2007"," A new type of movie experience
","Having heard the hype and being of Greek origin i walked into the cinema with a somewhat open mind. I am familiar with the history and did enjoy the earlier movie with Richard Egan from the early 60's. My conclusion is this movie is not a history of the battle but pure entertainment and as pure entertainment it is amazing. A new type of movie was made and what excited me was what will we see in the future using these techniques. I cant wait for the first WW2 movie set in Europe or Pacific,so many other famous battles are just waiting for this treatment. Many commentators have missed the point this is groundbreaking film making.Blockbuster war and action movies can be now made at a fraction of the cost and Hollywood will love that. As for the movie the acting took a backseat,the battle scenes had me salivating,the cinematography,the sound,the colors i could go on and on! I did have to laugh though when Xerxes appeared and he looked like an escapee from a gay Mardis gr as but hey it was all part of the experience. Well done and look forward to the next one."
"Truusso","8","2","6","7 April 2007"," Breathtaking but a little annoying.
","I had really high expectations on this one for several reasons, it was based on Frank Millers work, it had a very promising story, and when I saw the trailer it looked awesome (although trailers tend to always look awesome). <br/><br/>The movie truly was awesome, but unfortunately it made some unnecessary and annoying errors. For example, it felt totally wrong that the Persians would have ogres in their army, stick to the history as much as possible I say. The other element that bothered me was the one about good vs evil, the Persians was monsters, without human feelings, wile the Spartans was a tough but fair and democratic people. I'm sure that in the reality it wasn't that black and white. For example, although the Spartans truly were democratic, only 14 % of the people could actually vote. Also, I think that the film could have tried to avoid some of the worst clich√©s. <br/><br/>One thing that may bother a little is that the creators of the movie has exaggerated the numbers of the armies, for example that there was only 300 Spartans. However i checked it up, and it actually seems that the numbers in the movie are quite true to the real historical battle. The only thing that has been changed is that the Spartans had support from about a thousand more men from different allied Greek states, and this men withdrawed after the second day. It is also true that the numbers of the Persians were huge, for example at day one 10000 men from the Persia army died, wile only about three from the Spartans fell!<br/><br/>The fighting scenes of course are breathtaking with slow-mo cameras and really cool stunts. All the scenes but one (some men comes riding on horses) are recorded in a studio which allows the director to go wild wit angles and locations. The film also has a grey, antique color, it looks really special, not exactly like the last film that was based on Frank Millers work, Sin City, which had a comic black and white style, but something like that. Also just like in Sin City, you can tell that it is based on Frank Miller because of the narrator who not mainly describes what happens, but the feelings of the characters. <br/><br/>The acting is very good, especially Lena Headey plays convincing in role who easy could have disappeared totally in between the battle moments. Gerard Butler also does a good job, but his role is more of the easier kind. <br/><br/>A very cool film, with some annoying elements."
"kidboi","7","2","6","5 April 2007"," Awesome, but completely over-hyped.
","I just came home from seeing this visually stunning, but somewhat flawed film. I have been hearing so much about this movie, that it pretty much made me sick. Not in any forum could I avoid the buzz about ""300"". First I was hyped myself, but then people started stating that it's the best thing that they've ever seen, so I was expecting a masterpiece of modern cinema. How foolish of me. At the end of the film, I honestly wanted to scream ""That's it!?!?!"". There was one forum in particular that over-hyped the movie for me. However, I shouldn't reveal the name of this forum. Don't ask why, I have my reasons.<br/><br/>So, about the film. While I was kind of disappointed with the film, on the way home I started remembering some scenes from it and slowly realized how awesome it actually was. It wasn't the great film I was expecting in the beginning, but overall, it's extremely entertaining, solidly acted out. It does contain numerous clich√©s, but then again, how could it not? I have nothing bad to say about the visual part of the film. It's just amazing to say the very least. However, I felt that the film was just lacking it's own special style. Half of the film reminded me of ""Gladiator"" or ""The Lord Of The Rings"". But still, this was just a minor put off.<br/><br/>It's also heavily annoying how people tend to rate the film for it's historical accuracy(?). This is very unnecessary as this film is pure entertainment and must be viewed as such. This is definitely one of the year's best blockbusters, probably a contender for the best visual effects Oscar. If you want amazing visuals, cool battle scenes and more amazing visuals, go see this film. If you want a historical account on the battle of Thermopylae, read a book about it and skip this film."

"KUAlum26","9","2","6","31 March 2007"," About what I thought a film version of a graphic novel SHOULD be,particularly one set in ancient Greece.
","My knowledge of Greek history is a little fuzzier now than in the past,but if I recall right,the Spartans were quite the intense,warlike people,with an immense sense of personal pride,loyalty and honor to their fellow Greeks and themselves. <br/><br/>So when an emissary for the Persian King and conqueror Xerxes arrives at the palace of Spartan KIng Leonidas(Gerard Butler,quickly making people forget he was the Pahntom of the Opera),making a grand and patronizing offer of peacefully conquering the Spartan(And in effect all of Greece)in exchange for allegiance and servitude,the Spartan KIng does not take this very kindly. He not-so-subtly offers his reply,and before long,he is rounding up soldiers and planning to take on the oncoming onslaught of Persian soldiers(numbering anywhere from the tens of thousands to,as one account would say,millions)that would follow. He meets resistance from many in the Greek council,particularly from the foreign emissary Theron(Dominic West)and gets no support from the arbiters of the country,a vile collection of inbreds named the Ephors,who consult through Oracles--basically young,attractive women who are drugged into mystic spells and incantations. His most powerful support lies in his strong,attractive wife Gorgo(Lena Headey) and,of course,the three-hundred soldiers he assembles for what is understood to be more of a suicide mission to save the country.<br/><br/>Director ZAck Snyder,incorporating plenty of the gory energy that was fraught in his 2004 offering Dawn of the Dead,puts this Frank Miller graphic novel to screen in a mostly digitalized,eye-busting creation. MUch of this film takes place about the way that one would expect an ancient Greek story would:told in almost lyrical narrative,foreboding and larger-than-life. To me,this is something of a throwback movie,a film that hearkens back to the days when adventure and narrative was more important and nuance and acting was an afterthought at best. While this is hardly(outside of the technology employed here,much like the equally visually astounding Sin City,also a MIller graphic novel)revolutionary film-making,this is a very good example of what sit-in-the-theater,popcorn-munching entertainment is all about."

You couldn't turn a corner without seeing the poster on some bus passing by, and with the trailers being shown nearly every ad break on the telly together with the fact that there was nothing else showing that interested me, I decided to buy a ticket and I didn't regret it.<br/><br/>King Leonidas is born to fight, and feels it's his destiny to lead 300 Spartans to battle with the Persians - cue the gruesome bloody fights as the 300 men fight for their country, regardless of being so small in number when compared to their enemies.<br/><br/>The extensive use of CG(which is amazingly done, like the sequences with arrows shooting through the air) and slow-mo shots ads to the comic-book and stylised feel of the film, seeing as it's based on a graphic novel I've not read but who also wrote Sin City which I also saw nearly 2 years ago and enjoyed.<br/><br/>There are some shocks along the way as certain characters do the unexpected things. You really get into it when watching, fully behind the King's army, hoping for victory. Gerard Way gives a great performance as the main character Leonidas, and the supporting actors also hold their own.<br/><br/>OK, it does look like an 18-rated high-end violent next generation video game, and may seem like a very masculine film, with the war cries and very toned soldiers, but this film has a deeper message than any superficial stuff - it's quite inspiring in a way, to think that these men, against all odds risked their lives for freedom.<br/><br/>Overall, it does contain some funny lines that are shouted by it's main character(""Tonight, we dine in hell!"") but this is good, being a visual feast and not completely daft."

","Lets cut the crap, 300 men in tight leather shorts with 6 packs that David Beckham himself would be proud of. There were obviously no pies eaten during the making of this film. This is the first film i can honestly say would keep most men and woman happy at the cinema. The men can relish in the action and blood and the women can watch the gorgeous muscles flex across the large screen. OK so Leana Headey flashed her nipples early on the film but i promise you the rest of the film is definitely male testosterone. OK some of the guys fell from the ugly tree but once they put their helmets on that problem is well and truly solved. Mmm nice Their chant was ""WAR"" i saw ""PHWOAR""."
"Weredegu","10","2","6","24 March 2007"," As escapist as it gets? Borat-style shock humor? Manipulation all the way? What was this thing that hit me?
","10 out of 10 in this case means: you have to see this film. Nothing more, nothing less. I wouldn't dare deduct a single point from the maximum available score, for discouraging anyone from viewing this movie could not be further from my intentions. It's an exceptional cinematic experience (provided you really go and see it at a theatre). On that level it is unmissable. On other levels you have important choices to make. You can regard the concept behind the movie as a joke or caricature of some kind - Borat-style shock humor if you like, built around a kind of exaggerated orientalism. Or you may see it as irrelevant, focusing instead only on the visuals. These are the ways to enjoy this movie. These are the techniques that I consciously tried to concentrate on applying, to keep enjoying it. It wasn't that great a mental effort - ever since I saw the trailer I could hardly wait to see '300', and so it would have been difficult not to feel rewarded by finally making it. On the other hand, you may not necessarily like what you see if you can't put yourself beyond rightly seeing this movie as historically inaccurate.<br/><br/>And that's the key question. If it's shock humor or just an irrelevant means in the service of the greater purpose of escapist entertainment, then the inaccurate account of historical events is not manipulative. In fact in that case it is, potentially, even sarcastic and caricature-like. However, if it was meant with at least a bit of seriousness, it becomes quite problematic. The 300 could then be a bunch of Marines going loose after feeling their orders are counterproductive, only to put up a hell of a fight thanks to their superior training, to the potential bitter end. And Sparta might be the U.S. protecting freedoms with its own distinct, more sacrifice-ready culture for the rest of the democracies out there. And the Persians today's Iranians. And so on, with each and every politicizing statement like that being enough in itself to spark a debate that could escalate into world war with the faulty consensus-seeking software human beings are produced with in the factory, you know.<br/><br/>And there's one more thing. While I think we did get the special 'product' we were looking for in this film after first having seen the trailers, we could have had more of it here to make the film really exceptional. The story should have been less moving in a way. Spartans went out there for some serious blood-letting not minding even if in the end it was to be their blood that was to be spilled. They don't want to be remembered by us swimming in tears. They would probably appreciate a warrior-like reaction more, seeing, as they 'dine in hell', people willing to become strong to make the ultimate sacrifice and, importantly, to make it count, make it efficient as well. You don't have to accept their mentality but that is their mentality. Watching a movie you have to suspend disbelief and identify. So how can you watch soldiers making their sacrifice, sympathize with them, and, at the same time, think they are mistaken. The contradiction might go away if you temporarily but fully identify with them and start critically reflecting on that only afterwards. But this shows that then the film shouldn't try to evoke sorry for the soldiers. A lot more heavy music (most fittingly some straightedge hardcore) should have been added to the film score and the film should rock all the way. It's okay if, one hour after having seen it, you start thinking, oops, how I got carried away by the power of the film. But while it's underway you shouldn't for a moment cease to look for the next battle, together with the Spartan unit. In that, I think, the film tried to be too wise. Shouldn't have tried to make the message complex at all, that's my message to the crew. If there was an effort to that end, it didn't succeed."

","I know nothing about the history this story was based on. I don't care. The shear look of this film took my breathe away. The entire film was like being in someones dream... or nightmare. I think 300 has already won the Oscar for Best Cinematography! I came out of the theater wanting to be a filmmaker even more. I never thought I would say this about a sequel but... I can't wait for Sin City 2! Do any of you know how movies like 300 or Sin City... or Natural Born Killers for that matter get that certain look they have? For me the texture and color of the image on screen has the most impact on how I perceive the story. For me, it's one of the most important elements of a film."
"redsoxmb545-1","10","2","6","24 March 2007"," '300' Is Nothing Short of a Masterpiece
","Based on Frank Miller's graphic novel about the Battle of Thermopylae in 480 B.C., '300' tells the tale of King Leonidas' stand with 300 of his finest Spartan warriors against the massive and impenetrable force of Xerxes' Persian army. This over-stylized, but stunning interpretation of the event is not meant to be historically accurate. Director Zack Snyder based the movie off of Frank Miller's graphic novel. In fact, they are nearly identical frame-by-frame. The overall story is true, but the details have been altered quite a bit. But unless you are a history fanatic, that really shouldn't matter to you too much. The movie itself is visually stunning. Your jaw will hit the floor so many times, you'll loose count. '300' is an epic beyond epics. Using 90% blue screen, and 10% green screen, the creators of '300' opened a world of options for CGI graphics. The possibilities became virtually endless with today's technology. This is the future of computer animation in live action films. And the action in '300' is phenomenal. The choreography, camera work, and execution of the battles is mind-numbing. You will not see anything like it anywhere, anytime soon. '300' is near perfect. The only complaint that I could possibly have is the potentially right-wing conservative political view of writer Frank Miller. That aside, this as an amazing film, with not a dull minute through it's running time. I highly recommend it to action fans in particular, but really any mature movie audience. '300' is nothing short of a masterpiece.<br/><br/>P.S. Try to see it in IMAX. It is more worth it than you can imagine."
"gfgr","10","2","6","23 March 2007"," An Epic Must See!
","This movie was BRILLIANT!<br/><br/>Being Greek myself I grew up with stories from the ancient world. Some of these historical events or mythological epics have been brought to the silver screen the past few years, but until now they have all fallen short to my expectations. Troy was a nice movie, Alexander, not so bad¬Ö but by far the best is 300. The movie, being based on a comic book, takes a historical event and fills it with mythological and rather poetic, at times, elements, like the scene at the oracle.<br/><br/>I was particularly happy with the acting; Butler becomes Leonidas. I was also pleased to see that the script lacked cheap American wise cracks and it also included a few phrases from the original story such as ""Come and get them"" referring to the Spartans' weapons.<br/><br/>The visuals are astonishing and the on and off slow motion scenes really hits the spot by giving impact to the scenes and could be seen as stills from the comic book when they are almost paused. The overall rendering of sepia contrasting with the crimson capes of the Spartans really sets a tone for the movie and the well designed costumes succeed in transferring us to this ancient world of heroes.<br/><br/>A full on epic movie with great music throughout making the spectacular visuals even more dramatic. There is more to it than just great visuals. A must see.<br/><br/>(Empire magazine gave it 3 stars out of five, the same as Ghost Rider. I beg to differ; Ghost Rider was a horrible move!)"

","300 never claims to be historically accurate Snyder and Miller have loosely based this movie about the legendary battle.<br/><br/>The movie has the visual effects of Sin City but instead of Sin City's black and white with some colour 300 has a very dark feel about it and is in colour though it is clearly computer generated.<br/><br/>The Choreography of the fight scenes is excellent and the Spartans fight with great technique and as Snyder said they have been changed so they are historically incorrect to look cool they most certainly do.<br/><br/>Each spartan is incredibly well built with no exceptions there is a ripped six pack every where in their army. 300 makes Troy look like a girl scrap and rivals gladiator for its excellent fight scenes, though it is portraying our heroes in a different way they almost push being a hero to the extreme unlike Maximus who is an excellent fighter but does not so much enjoy the killing he does whereas the Spartans love it.<br/><br/>I think that its safe to say the Spartans are nothing more than a group of Bad Ass Mother F****rs who can fight like no others and are ready to show it off at any given opportunity, it looks as if their having as much fun as us the audience.<br/><br/>The only thing i think 300 lacks in is the emotional power of gladiator, when we should feel sad in 300 its quite hard as we're still recovering from the scenes of mass violence, where as gladiator hits hard with emotional power, however i still feel 300 is a good movie and worth watching and am looking forward to what Snyder has in store next."

","After seeing the first trailer for 300 i was hooked. I really thought this film would bring forward a fresh idea with plenty of impressive visuals and action. And i was not disappointed.<br/><br/>From an advanced preview last night, 2 days before release. I went into the film expecting it to blow most other movies i had seen recently, out of the water. And it did. This i believe (along side spider man 3) will be one of the best movies of the year. Big, Loud, amazing action, great acting, new story.<br/><br/>Its a strange feeling that you know all the 300 are going to die, and you feel it as they are attacked again and again by numerous warriors, ranging from simple foot soldiers, to the 'immortals' who are the deadliest soldiers in the world (until they meet the spartans). Then elephants, sorcerers, rhinos, and a **** load of archers.<br/><br/>The ending is uplifting, heroic and emotional.<br/><br/>All in all. I loved this movie. Definitely re-watchable.

","This movie NEVER intended to be an accurate version of the Battle of Thermopylae. It's based on a COMIC BOOK that was INSPIRED by historical events but remain, mostly, as a work of FICTION.<br/><br/>OF COURSE the Persians were not like that... The Persian army in 300 looks much more like an alien army in a science fiction movie, and are not to be taken seriously as the real ones.<br/><br/>Anyone who thinks that 300 is a political movie or has any intentions to confuse people can only be described as narrow minded and just plain stupid.<br/><br/>That said, 300 is a really enjoyable experience. It's not as violent as most critics said (it's certainly not as violent as Apocalypto) and it's pretty much like Frank Miller's graphic novel (but not as exciting, i'm sorry to say).<br/><br/>The funny thing about all this controversy is that, when the comic book was first released, people were not mad at Miller because of the way he portrayed the Persians, but because of what King Leonidas says to the Persian Messenger in the beginning of the story (when he calls the Athenians ""boy lovers"")."

They never wore horns it was used in STORY telling to make them more menacing and thus causing more fear in the listening audience.

But then a movie called 300 comes along and it has the rare quality of being worth every penny.<br/><br/>The visuals were astonishing. It resembled moving art work in a non-traditional museum. The way they sped up the movements of the warriors and then slowed it down put me right in the movie. I felt like i was one of the fearless 300 battling for the freedom and dignity of my country. 300 soldiers against an army of millions. The enemy just kept coming and our heroes just kept defeating them. One after one the cruel enemy fell a soulless death fit for a group of people with black hearts.

"filmfan92","8","2","6","19 March 2007"," '300' is a lucky number
","""This is MADNESS!"" shouts a crony who looks suspiciously like Djimon Honsou.""Madness?"" says King Leonidas (a hearty Gerard Butler) ""This is SPARTA!!"" At this point, encouraged by his wife Queen Gorgo (Lena Headey,who steals the film from her male co-stars, Leonidas shoves the crony, along with a handful of other low-level baddies, into a huge, deep well to the thundering tune of heavy-metal music. OK, so in the course of history, that probably didn't happen. But wouldn't it be cooler if it did? That's the approach '300' takes, and, in this case, it works. Taken from a comic book by Frank Miller, who puts the ""graphic"" in ""graphic novel"", 300 is the tale of 300 Spartans who attempt to defend their land from 250,000 Persians. Sure, you've heard the against all odds story, but not like this, From the opening scene, which shows a young Leonidas battling a wolf in a narrow cave, I knew this movie would be unlike any other. The look of the film is indescribable, a delicious mix of CGI and real location in a way that they have never been mixed before. Every scene holds hundreds of visual wonders. This is without a doubt the best looking film in modern history. However, '300' is not without it's flaws. A subplot about a weak hunchback (Andrew Tiernan) who is spurned by Leonidas falls flat. The leader of the Persian Army, an effeminate and self-aggrandizing warlord named Xerxes, is played by a miscast Rodrigo Santoro, whose voice is artificially (and obviously) deepened. And the speechifying is just plain awful (""Eat your breakfast, Spartans. For tonight, we dine in hell!""). But Director Zack Snyder, his small troupe of actors, and his army of post-production whiz-kids have accomplished a visual miracle like no other before it. '300' heralds the arrival of a strange and wonderful new kind of film-making."

The actors are warriors, they don't seem like hollywooders. The way they thrust their spears and scream their battle cries, show the essence of warriorship all the way down deep into their eyes. My blood was racing, I felt incredibly in my body and felt the freedom of being alive from watching these men portray ancient Spartans.

After the movie I looked at my girlfriend and said ""Well that movie was about as cool as it possibly could have been."" Time slowed down about six hundred times during the film and each time a scene was over you were ready for more. I am a major in transpersonal psychology, not just some meathead guy who likes violence.

Go see this movie if you want to know what being alive truly means. Could not have been better."
"moviemanMA","8","2","6","11 March 2007"," Spartan Law
","It is written that 300 Spartan men stood up against a horde of Persian warriors, one of the greatest armies ever assembled. These 300 soldiers fought valiantly and without hesitation to the throng of enemies before them. This would be there finest hour, a period of history that would be glorified for centuries to come. <br/><br/>Frank Miller (Sin City), whose graphic novels have won critical acclaim the world over, shares his retelling of the Battle of Thermopylae with us in 300. The story of how few stood against many and changed the course of history and warfare. Director Zack Snyder makes his second film since his remake of the 1978 cult-classic Dawn of the Dead. <br/><br/>The year is 480 B.C. King Leonidas (Gerard Butler) lead his small band of the bravest and most elite troops in all of Sparta. They all had a wife and children to fight for and carry on their name. They were more than soldiers; they were Spartans. The ""God-King"" Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro) of Persia was on the war path, snatching up all the land he could. Leonidas would sit back and watch as his people were turned into slaves. They would meet at Thermopylae. <br/><br/>Unlike most societies of the day, Spartan's hailed their women and considered them sacred. They believed a true Spartan woman could give birth to a Spartan man. Leonidas' wife Queen Gorgo (Lena Headey) is as tough and strong-willed as her husband. She is more than just a wife but a voice. She plans to sway the politicians to send more troops to help fight with her husband. Theron (Dominic West), who has the power of the council in his hand, tries to thwart her plans because he believes what Leonidas is doing is unjust. <br/><br/>In the meantime, how about a nice, hardy helping of Spartan brutality? Leonidas and his band of cut, lean warriors fight off wave after wave after wave of Persian assault. Everything from the common foot soldier to elephants armed to the tusk. Masked attackers and monstrous beasts try to take a slice out of the Spartans. Their will is relentless and their feet planted firmly on the ground as their cause for battle.<br/><br/>History aside, Frank Miller's interpretation of the event is more or less; gruesome. The battle scenes are epic and not choppy like most action films of today. You don't have to keep guessing who is in what shot or what is exactly going on. The camera is steady and smooth. Swords ablaze and shields shimmering, the Spartans move around the battle with fluid movements as if this were practice for them. The camera zooms in on some shots, emphasizing a slash, chop, or impalement.<br/><br/>Speaking of battle scenes, the fight choreography is hard to match anywhere else. Some shots last for several attacks and don't cut away for a moment of the action. There are some one-on-one shots but most have a foreground action and a background action creating this feeling of being in ancient Greece. Another important thing to mention: this movie is not for the faint of heart. 300 goes beyond hack and slash. Limbs, heads, and gallons of blood cover the field of battle. Spartans show no mercy.<br/><br/>Like his previous work on the big screen, Sin City used a lot of harsh lighting and dark shadows to present a certain mood. 300 has a lot of earth tones; dark, dull, and aged colors. Certain colors stand out like the red robes the Spartan soldiers wear and the golden chains Xerxes wraps himself in.<br/><br/>If any other film had speeches as uplifting and energized as this does, I would probably laugh. After listening to Leonidas talk of honor, glory, and death in battle, I myself wanted to take up arms with him. The dialogue isn't mesmerizing but it certainly does the job.<br/><br/>300 is not your typical film. Do not call it a comic book movie (because a graphic novel is completely different) or a war drama. 300 is unique and has redefined the graphic novel genre. It is technically and visually brilliant. Don't take the kids to see this one. Prepare yourselves for an awesome spectacle of valor, courage, and chiseled abs. To Victory!"

","In this case, the words ""Art of War"" are not in a sense of the chess-like moves of power on a battlefield, but the absolute beauty that found in portraying how it could have happened. This film is absolutely amazing and breath-taking! This includes the acting, the graphics, the editing, the music selection...everything! Please do not read into the childlike bashing from other posts on IMDb that can't see the film for what it really is...a piece of art brought to life on film. Frank Miller has delivered a stunning piece of work.<br/><br/>If you want to see cinematography at its absolute best (circa 2007), watch closely the scene where Leonidas is followed in battle with the ""stop then speed"" action of hacking, slashing and dodging through a several minute-long series of killing Persian after Persian in blood-flying, limb-tearing detail. Now think of it as if someone had painted it in the form of an ancient Greek artist's canvas and then turned it into a flip-book that goes on and on. Its amazing. I was so happy and excited to see the battle done in this fashion that I was smiling from ear to ear saying ""Oh my god, that is sooo awesome!"".<br/><br/>I seen the movie in IMAX (highly recommended) with several other friends...and also with my 16 year old son. We loved every entertaining moment of it! Me and my son play video games together and we both love the Lord of the Rings movies, so I knew we both would like this film. Although there are a few nude scenes and sexual situations, I never felt embarrassed that my son was watching them since they were not flaunting and fit well with the story line.<br/><br/>As someone in these posts so precisely said, ""Go to be entertained, not educated"".

This is one of those unique moments in film that you should bare witness in the theater. Every emotion is invoke and evoked out of me watching 300. Okay, I guess I could pull a criticism out of my as*. ""Those pecks were uneven, and that guy in the left frame's abs was totally pubic hair."" Yeah, and I'm going back to the gym, I am a wuss. Oh, and... if this film does have a release year of 2006... we are about to witness an atrocity at next years Oscars. This film has raised the bar very high in 2007. It would be a shame to see this masterpiece go horrifically ignored because a movie studio failed to keep a film in a can and wait for the right time.

","As a hard-core Gerard Butler fan, this movie was always on the must-see list, especially after the many months of hype through internet video journals, training blogs, and intriguing photos of oily men in leather underwear! But Zach Snyder has provided so much more than sweaty shots of well-toned men posturing in front of a green screen.<br/><br/>Like Sin City, 300 is based on a graphic novel by Frank Miller. The scene is the Battle of Thermopylae, 480 B.C. where King Leonidas of Sparta (played with roaring and nashing of teeth by Gerard Butler) unwaveringly led his 300 soldiers to ward off the coming Persians, aiding in the dawn of a new day, bringing the hope of democracy to the land. Students of history will be pleased with the accuracy for which Snyder has told this tale.<br/><br/>This movie is visually stunning and poetic. Snyder has created a look that is both beautiful and desolate. Stark grey cliffs and sea are juxtaposed with the billowing scarlet robes of the soldiers. The moon impossibly fills the night sky, illuminating the raw faces of the 300 men, awaiting the dawn, ready to meet their destiny with bravery and determination.<br/><br/>In addition to kick-ass battle scenes that speed up and slow down to a rocking soundtrack, 300 also shows love and tenderness between a King, trained since birth to be a ruthless leader, and his Queen (played with strength and dignity by Lena Headey). The Queen is her King's equal in the bedroom and in the council chamber, a refreshing reminder that women have been respected and revered long before the so-called women's liberation.<br/><br/>In addition to unflinchingly graphic scenes of beheadings, almost lyrical blood-spurting, and a passionate love scene between the King and Queen, 300 also presents orgies and deviant sexual behavior, in the camp of self-appointed god-king Xerxes, himself a transgendered amalgam of masculine power, makeup, and accessories.<br/><br/>This movie is not for everyone, but I highly recommend it on its themes of loyalty, bravery, and destiny. It is a beautiful film, well-crafted and seamless. The acting is top notch, the effects are flawless."

","I'm still deciding whether or not ""300"" is the best movie I've ever seen. There are some experiences that are truly hard to explain to others...Witnessing childbirth, A lunar eclipse, Your first(good)sexual experience. Some things have to be EXPERIENCED to really appreciate them. ""300"" is one of those things. ""Things"" is the wrong word though, Marvels is the proper word. ""300"" is truly a cinematic marvel & the best American film of the last 10 years at least. There are literally no flaws in the film aside from a slightly slow opening 20 minutes & I loved them as well. They set up the mythos of Sparta & allow you to see what it means to be a Spartan. I'm not going to belabor this comment with actors names..etc...etc. They can be seen up on top of the screen. Suffice it to say that the film is PERFECTLY CAST & I cry over the fact that it wasn't released earlier last year so that it could have gotten some award recognition. There is some artistic license taken (Giant mutated warriors, Large beasts, Seraphs, Oracles) that seem to be taken straight out of ""Lord Of The Rings"" but this is not meant to be an accurate historical representation of the event. It is the comic put to film. There are scenes that will flat out leave your jaw agape & tearing up at the same time. Zach Snyder (in my mind) has proved himself to be a cinematic genius. Between this & his ""Dawn Of The Dead"" (Which also kicked ass) he has made quite a dent on the cinematic landscape. I understand he is doing ""Watchmen"" next, Which has been in limbo for 10 years at least. I still think it is unfilmable without a 300 million dollar budget but if anyone can do it I believe Snyder is the one. ""300"" is one of the greatest films ever put to celluloid. Period."

Story wise it was pretty awful. Dialogue - probably the cheesiest I've heard this year. I pretty much got what I paid for but what was with all the homo-erotic crap. WHY WAS THE KING OF PERSIA SOOO GAY. It's fine to make an empire look bad but there is other ways of doing it. For the first hour and a half not a single Spartan dies. The Persian hordes keep attacking and falling for the Spartan little block and attack technique. I had no problem with the monsters because I understand that's how Frank Miller gets down but I definitely don't thing there was any need for all the homo-erotic content. I have nothing against gays, I have a lot friends who are gay but I don't see why the Spartans have to be all ripped and oiled up in their Speedos and for the king of Persia to be so gay and awkward.

Though unlike those, the story used was not the original stories. this story although still based on the historic stand of the spartan warriors, is actually based on the graphic novel by Frank Miller (Sin City,Robo cop) and as with Sin city, Millers love with the green screen and what it allows him to do is apparent.This Movie,like Sin City, really feels like a comic book, though not as heavily as Sin City did. it also allows for some of the greatest special effect's I've ever seen on film. Finding myself at times, wondering if that arm flying off was CG or not, or that spear actually went though a body or it was a CG.<br/><br/>The Cast is full of Names that aren't seen a whole hell of allot of the time, Lead By Gerard Butler as the Spartan King Leonidas makes a pretty god performance as the man who leads the 300 until their dying breath. though at times he sounds a bit like a younger Sean Connery when he speaks, which kind of makes some of the little ballsy defiant quips even better, the main antagonist The King of the Persians is played by Rodrigo Santoro, and does a pretty good job of playing the megalomaniac. The Fight at home is lead by the Kings queen played by Lena Headly, and she is countered on the home front by Theron played by Dominic West.<br/><br/>The Film was a great adventure, and is chock full of many things, most of which I leave you to discover, though some of the more obvious ones are, well a lot of men dying."

","I was very eager to watch this film, not only because of the stunning and promising trailer, but also because I like this genre (ancient Greek/Roman/Middle-East history).<br/><br/>I knew from the start that 300 would be a graphic novel adaptation based on Miller's 300, so when I sat down, I wasn't expecting a history lesson on-screen.<br/><br/>What I got was probably the most visually stunning I've seen lately. The photography is pure eye-candy, the colour themes are a very pleasing bronze-brown, and the surroundings created by CG are a match to Lord Of The Rings. Some shots reminded me of the french Brotherhood of the Wolf (Le Pacte Des Loups), as did some fighting scenes shown in slow-motion. The whole world depicted is one fluid piece of art with the mystic Persian army to the noble-hearted Spartans, perfectly grasping the essence of the way they are seen on ancient vases and murals or statues. Definitely a nominee for such awards.<br/><br/>There's not much about the plot: it's a classic static character film: no one really changes, all minds are set and just do what they plan. Most of the movie is a battle, which is OK, but I found it tiring at times.<br/><br/>The acting: flawless. The cast is brilliant, everyone is perfect in their role. Leonidas, Xerxes, everyone.<br/><br/>Summa summarum: Don't miss this if you like raw battle scenes and if you are a CG junkie and a fan of Frank Miller.

The action combined with the, and lets be bluntly honest here, excessive usage of slow motion sequences. It looks good, but the second time you watch the movie the slow motion starts to wear thin.<br/><br/>The story is set in ancient Greece, where 300 heroic Spartan warriors set out to fend off the invading Persian army consisting of well over 100,000 soldiers. The Spartans are lead by King Leonidas, a man whose courage equals his skills in combat.<br/><br/>As I mentioned earlier, ""300"" is fueled by the sheer amounts of impressive action sequences. And it should be said that the choreography and camera-work during these action sequences is nothing short of spectacular. It is a visual display of pure warfare by the clash of steel. The storyline actually falls in second after the action sequences in my opinion.<br/><br/>The visual department also deserve a great amount of credit for their contribution to making ""300"" an entertaining and very watchable movie. The effects are spectacular, and often makes it feel like the audience is right there on the chaotic battlegrounds.<br/><br/>Also the props and wardrobe department really pulled their weight in this movie. There were so many nice details in the costumes, armors, weaponry, etc. It really helped to bring the movie to life and added a believable element to the movie.<br/><br/>There is an impressive ensemble of talents on the cast list in ""300"".

","300 is adaptation of the Frank Miller graphic novel which is indeed ferocious enough to satisfy those with with its gore, violence and chest-pounding machismo while savvy enough to downplay the homoeroticism that will ever-so-subtly cause heretofore unexplained stirrings in the loins of these same armchair warriors. Yet for all its brutality. Beyond its demographic-targeting, however, its greatest claim to fame is that it's positioning itself as the next step on the evolutionary CGI ladder, offering, ""a true experience unlike anything you've ever seen before.""After all this years have passed, 300 still manages to make impressions of newcomers."
"sebbystone1","6","1","2","11 November 2015"," Mind numbingly stupid at times, but entertaining enough to merit a pass.
","300 should never be seen as a historical retelling of the battle of Thermopylae. The stylized blood, historical inaccuracy and bizarre monsters mean that it shouldn't really be taken seriously. But is that a bad thing? 300 isn't a 'bad' film as such, just not a particularly good one. Its rather average. Plot twists are given away far too early, the ending is very much an anti climax, and overall it could have been somewhat better. However, its not so much bad things which pull the film down, just that nothing is especially good. The cast is alright, the action is nicely stylized but occasionally not too good, overall the film is the definition of OK. I'm not a fan of the stylized colour scheme this movie uses, and the CGI overuse really takes away from a potential sense of scale.

The battle of Thermopylae, in which three hundred Spartan soldiers, led by King Leonidas, battle one million Persians. The king uses an interesting strategy, where he finds terrain with a narrow passageway to force the vastly larger army to be narrowed, and thus making it possible to fight them in smaller numbers.<br/><br/>Gerard Butler as the king, and Lena Headey as his wife have strong chemistry, but unfortunately, the majority of the cast look like Cippendale dancers, with bodies shaved, and ready for a night at the Gay Pride Parade in Greenwich Village on Halloween. The battle scenes are excellent, with breathtaking cinematography, and colors so rich, that it will blow you away. The biggest complaint seems to be with how much of 300 is true.

","When I first time saw this film I thought this was truly boring pointless film expect the beautiful artistic visuals. The only reason it occurred to my mind to watch the film again was the homo erotic pictures of half-naked masculine bodies. And to be honest my basic knowledge about spartan people is limited to it s warrior-culture which magnified the masculinity even to the point of homoerotism.Of course every nation under serious external or internal thread appears often to us ""civilized"" individuals as fascists society full of exaggerated collectivism and eroticised violence. As I know the story is based on a comic book and surely NOT based on the real history, as many noble descendants of the ""glorious and civilized Persian empire"" have pointed out several times here. It is a tale told by Innocent mind of an ancient soldier who believed in higher order and values of his nation...those happen to be something like freedom from external oppression and tyranny, which are considered to be justification for most ""just wars"". Emphasizing the contrast between the real warriors for liberty and the slave soldiers might appear to someone as western propaganda, because it emphasizes the favorite story of western people about their common cultural origins derived from the well known ancient nationalist racist misogynist and rather egalitarian Greek culture. But there might be also rather artistic reasons for this kind of propaganda -it s a part of the psychology of extreme conflict and regression.In Lord of The rings there is used the same kind of moral dualism when depicting the fight between the good and the evil -on the other hand there are the elves who live harmony within the nature and then there are the Saruman and Sauron who are corrupted from the lust of power.I recommend this movie for people who enjoy comics, simplicity,violence, patriotism and a quite handsome men.

"sme_no_densetsu","8","1","2","20 October 2010"," A potent mix of testosterone and stunning visuals
","Zack Snyder's ""300"" is based on the graphic novel by Frank Miller, known for ""Sin City"" among other works. In the film, King Leonidas of Sparta (Gerard Butler) leads a group of 300 Spartan warriors to face the Persian army at Thermopylae circa 480 B.C. The story is based on historical fact but contains many embellishments in the name of dramatic license.<br/><br/>The film's main draw is its graphic-novel inspired visuals. I'm not familiar with the original book so I can't say exactly how much of the film's look comes from there but the results are, in a word, breathtaking. A large portion of the film employs blue- or green-screen technology so much of the look was achieved through CGI.<br/><br/>As for the acting, it's actually above average for an action movie. Gerard Butler is stalwart in the lead role, the lovely Lena Headey holds her own and Dominic West makes for a slimy villain. The smaller roles are populated capably, though I'm not overly fond of David Wenham's narration.<br/><br/>Snyder's direction is well-handled but he may have slavishly followed Miller's artwork for all I know. The score is suitably epic, like everything else about the movie. While the script contains some questionable lines it's not bad overall and shows some imagination.<br/><br/>Ultimately, ""300"" is the type of film that divides audiences. Some will say that it's senselessly violent and generally over the top. They may have a point but I, for one, think that the film's visuals greatly contribute to making this a rewarding modern epic. While it will probably find the most favour with popcorn-munching action junkies ""300"" should not be overlooked for its technical qualities."
"Jules45","6","1","2","1 October 2010"," 300 - 294 = 6 Well earned stars
","More arrows than Robin Hood. More slushy sword slashing than Kill Bill. And more underrated than expected of the critics who balanced it firmly on the halfway mark. It may not live up to Snyder's most recent graphic novel adaptation but it's a should-be-3D action epic that kicks with an extra 'This is Sparta!' Unlike the diplomatic and looming dilemma his Watchmen adaptation cast over the film like a suffocating tyrant of grim news of nuclear war, 300 takes the less radical and more hands on approach to their strenuous problem of how to save Sparta from the impending threat of Persian destruction.<br/><br/>Gerard (Butler) and his small squadron of loyal and ridiculously muscular soldiers embark to act before their advantage of leaving the village for the safety of women and children gets the better of them. It doesn't delve too much into the political side of the war (not sure about whether the graphic novel did) especially when there are throats to be cut in ferocious but terrific style.<br/><br/>The backdrop to the massacres while being so blatantly beautiful not to be CGI, it's a rare sepia-esquire fa√É¬ßade showing the times they are fighting in, such as the lesser impressive beige colours in Gladiator or the T.V. series of Rome. However, ironically the heavy handed use of CGI can often make the film feel overcooked and lacking humane substance to such an inhumane film (not that I was expecting lengthy sessions of mourning for their slaughter or many layers of depth under the visuals).<br/><br/>Definitely a visual treat, particularly the slow-mo scene which terrifically isn't like anything on screen ever seen in a film, in spite of slow moving murder being a common screen spectacle."
"pninson","4","1","2","1 April 2010"," Knuckle-headed entertainment
","If I were to rate this movie for its intelligence, I'd give it a 1. The dialogue is cookie-cutter, overwrought and insipid. The performances are largely one-note and the constant pounding of the theme that war is great, war is glorious, and violence is bloodless gets pretty annoying after a while.<br/><br/>I'm not a stickler for historical accuracy --- I'd rather that the movie be entertaining. However, 300 has almost no basis in reality and clings to its comic-book origins with melodramatic ferocity. Its think level is close to zero.<br/><br/>Having said all that, this is still an entertaining and visually dazzling action film, with an eerie, otherworldly look that is oddly captivating. Gerald Butler and Harry Hamlin do all that can be asked of an actor (I'd say Hamlin's performance here is more convincing than his Perseus in CLASH OF THE TITANS, but that's not saying much).<br/><br/>Based on its entertainment level, I give this a six, which offsets the annoyance of listening to all the pompous chest-beating and infantile dialogue.<br/><br/>For my money, the original film, THE 300 SPARTANS, is a much more interesting picture. At least it gives you some idea of what actually happened (according to Herodotus, anyway) and it doesn't take itself so doggone seriously. Watching 300 is like being in Basic Training with a Marine drill instructor screaming at you."

"legspinner","8","1","2","15 July 2009"," you've got to admire a film that gets such power out of such a weak script
","The script for this movie is atrocious. There is no doubt about that. This is an ailment which afflicts most 'comic-book' crossovers, and usually stops the movie dead in the water. Here, it doesn't. Why is that? Again, leave aside Scottish Spartans. Personally, I found that quite an ingenious comparison, because of the warlike races. One man's artistic meat is another man's poisonous turkey; but people assume there is one particular way of making films, and build up critical attitudes this way. Anything that violates those attitudes is likely to cause offence simply because a dividing line has been drawn. One's parents' values get passed down through the generations, etc etc etc.<br/><br/>The main virtue of this film is it makes you consider what *you* are doing with life, and whether *you*, in the same circumstances the characters find themselves in, would react any differently. Another virtue is its revitalisation of classical antiquity, but I don't want to dwell on this too much because I suspect the facts as they are understood have been somewhat played with. All the characters get their interesting moments of deliberation and decision - except, perhaps, the kid - and they are all quite intriguing. Would a Spartan woman allow herself to be raped for her country, for instance? It's not a perfect film by any stretch of the imagination; by which I mean, it lacks the essential control of all the elements. Script is usually woeful, lighting all dreary darks and rumbling clouds and ethereal lightning, and the subject is not given a wide enough historical overview to be utterly satisfying - but this film as I said before is about the power of its central stories. I know I said most scripts from comic books are woeful; and they are; they encourage retrograde, wooden acting as actors consciously or subconsciously go for the 'freeze frame' look. As I say, though, if you sit back and let the occasional film just be itself, it can hit all the right notes; after all, no one would consider not watching 'The Italian Job' simply because of the inaccuracies and ""miscontinuities"", would they? Good film. I'd probably watch it again."
"Flyer78","10","1","2","7 July 2009"," The most visually innovative film I've ever watched.
","I cannot begin to praise Frank Miller enough for his work with 300. The film adaptation of the comic series looks completely awesome visually. All of the textures are so thick and gritty, and the style is perfect for a film of this nature.<br/><br/>The acting is amazing, especially the work Gerard Butler and David Wenham. Both of them play very likable characters, especially Leonidas, who is one of the greatest bada**es in the history of film. And what many people take for granted is the fact that this film is pretty much a nonfiction with a few tweaks to the story. The story of King Leonidas and the brave 300 spartans is indeed true, and it happened thousands of years ago. Most of the time, I don't necessarily enjoy films based on real events, but this, along with Tombstone, Public Enemies, and a few others was an exception to the rule. A BIG exception. I have an enormous level of respect for our brave soldiers in the Middle East fighting for our country, but the things that the spartans and other alliances did in the ancient times were nothing short of unreal.<br/><br/>My only gripe with this film is a very minor one, and it's the fact that I wished the film could have been just a little longer and expanded. 130 minutes would have been perfect. But like I said, that's a very minor flaw with any film, much less a film of this caliber.<br/><br/>But the single thing that amazes me the most about 300 is the fact that this film can bring out every last one of your emotions. The action scenes will excite you, the visuals will put you in a state of awe, and the ending of this had me absolutely bawling. And there is one scene is this film that gave me chills because of its sheer greatness. Even if you have not watched this film, I recommend going to YouTube or any video site you please and watch the ""What is your profession?"" scene. Awesome, AWESOME stuff.<br/><br/>So to sum things up, 300 is one of the best films ever made, and it deserves much more recognition than it receives. It's labeled as a guy film, and in truth, that's what it is. But if you ask me, male AND female alike can get something from this movie and enjoy it. So that's the end of my review for this epic masterpiece. GET OFF OF YOUR COMPUTER AND GO PICK UP 300. You will NOT be disappointed."

","""300"" ,the new movie of Zack Snyder, who made a very decent remake of George Romero's ""Dawn of the Dead"", would please the fans of the graphic novel in which this film is inspired, rather than those who are interested in historical accuracy or at least, something less exaggerated or ridiculous. (Ironically enough, the comic book of Frank Miller was inspired in ""The 300 Spartans"" that is a much better film in almost all the aspects, and it had a more interesting and realistic portrayal of the Battle of Thermopylae ) The plot, despite the violence and the nudity, is nothing but a childish amount of clich√©s as present as the good guys as handsome, muscular and tanned, while the ""bad guys"" are weak, ugly and effeminate, ridiculous use of the most obvious and blatant stereotypes, and a MTV-visual technique flashy enough to please teens but not enough good to make us forget about the lack of deep, characterization or anything that could have made this film more interesting than it actually is.<br/><br/>If your looking for mindless violence and cartoonish characterization of events in bold sepia tones and loud digitally mastered sound, then ""300"" will be your cup of tea.

","I wish to start out by saying the only reason I have given it a 2 is because of the CGI in the movie and the fact that one is the worst.<br/><br/>You would have to have very poor taste to like this mess. Seriously the worst direction I've ever seen. If the film makers had of recognised how pathetic the story they were presenting was they would have come to the conclusion that they should have just done the whole movie as one lame battle scene. <br/><br/>This film continually went back to the story of his wife back in Sparta, who you can't be bothered to care about, and who is always displayed at the stupidest points through out the movie. This just proves the dreadful state of the plot, not to mention it's inaccuracies. I am aware that the filmmakers have said they did it sensationalized it so it can be as the Greek story tellers would have remembered it. So why not put a warning like that in the actual film so the audience who are not braindead, who would be able to tell how inaccurate it is with no knowledge of Spartan life at all, could see what the film makers were trying to do. <br/><br/>Maybe I'm expecting too much from this film. However to me it's nothing more then an example of good CGI. Even though it was good what a waste of a movie. OOOOO they've put fighting in super slow-mo! SO?"
"tawdry_hepburn","8","1","2","26 June 2008"," 300--gay, fascist and brilliant fun
","300 is an exceptionally manly movie. Every moment and every second of it is filled with manly vigor. I can't remember another film with more shots of taut muscles, drenched in sweat (and blood), shimmering in the sunlight, in slow motion no less. Yea, it's a little gay, but this is the Roman era we are talking about.<br/><br/>For the 3 of you who might not know, 300 tells, through the lens of Frank Miller, the fabled story of the battle of Thermopylae, where 300 Spartans stood against 10,000 enemies and more or less saved the Roman empire.<br/><br/>For the first 20 minutes, the film plays like a hyper stylized episode of some awesome history channel show. A long monologue describes, in brutal detail, the history and practices of the Spartan People. Most of it seems accurate from what I remember from high school. After the opening, the film devolves into a surreal and beautiful mess.<br/><br/>I don't mean mess as insult however. The movie is a gloriously muddled piece of film-making. One moment there is fairly realistic ultra-violence on the battlefield and the next, the audience is treated to visage of an 8000 pound man with his arms cut off to the elbow and replaced with knives being used to execute failed generals, a sort of human guillotine.<br/><br/>The movie is chock full of stuff like that. Egyptian Gods show up for no discernible reason, as do rampaging rhinos, ninjas of some type, and a 12 foot tall, metrosexual Xerxes wearing more mascara than Robert Smith circa 1987. There is no logical reason for any of this, but that doesn't mean it's not cool.<br/><br/>In Casablanca the entire plot hinges on mythical ""letters of transit"" that allow someone to leave the city and fly to the free world. No one seems to ever notice that those letters of transit make absolutely no sense and have no basis in reality. In spite of that, that film is considered amongst the best in the history of Hollywood. 300 faces a similar conundrum, very little of the film makes any cognitive sense. But, like the best of action cinema of old, things like physics and logic rarely interfere with ""cool."" And if there is one thing 300 does well, it is the cool factor. At least 4 times during the movie, the audience broke out into spontaneous applause. There are some gorgeous images on display here. There are of course the over cut battle scenes filmed too close, as is par for the genre, but 300 takes things a step further. More than once, the camera follows King Leonidas (Gerard Butler) along his path in one unbroken take as he slices and dices through his enemies. The camera pans as Butler walks calmly through the battle field and cuts off the legs of one Persian, while decapitating 2 others with his twin swords.<br/><br/>The shot looks cool, but becomes absolutely epic as it goes on and on and on and builds momentum. The camera, all still seemingly in the same take, zooms in and out as the film speed speeds up and then slows down. It's like a frantic ADD victim discovering the multi angle option on his first porno DVD, but the shot manages to never be confusing.<br/><br/>The film is certainly not perfect. There is far too much self important pseudo-Shakespearian dialogue and the CGI sets don't always work, (a prime example being the pivotal scenes set in a citadel which feels absolutely cramped). Also, the pacing during the first 2/3rds is all over the place with battle scene after battle scene seemingly leading to nowhere. But, there is something charming about the film. Sure, there are no truly likable characters, and the film is ultimately a love poem to fascist thinking, but damn if this movie doesn't make fascism look fun.<br/><br/>As the theater emptied, people walking out into the vomitorium looked absolutely stunned. A giant short bus grin covered most of the young men's faces and the women looked woozy from staring at so many chiseled male frames for 2 hours. Unlike so many of the recent crop of epics, ""300"" offers something unique, a damn good time, no strings attached.<br/><br/>For more reviews visit www.collider.com"
"Gunnar_Runar_Ingibjargarson","7","1","2","17 June 2008"," Good one
","Like Sin City before it, 300 brings Frank Miller and Lynn Varley's graphic novel vividly to life. Gerard Butler (Beowulf and Grendel, The Phantom of the Opera) radiates pure power and charisma as Leonidas, the Grecian king who leads 300 of his fellow Spartans (including David Wenham of The Lord of the Rings, Michael Fassbender, and Andrew Pleavin) into a battle against the overwhelming force of Persian invaders. Their only hope is to neutralize the numerical advantage by confronting the Persians, led by King Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro), at the narrow strait of Thermopylae. More engaging than Troy, the tepid and somewhat similar epic of ancient Greece, 300 is also comparable to Sin City in that the actors were shot on green screen, then added to digitally created backgrounds. The effort pays off in a strikingly stylized look and huge, sweeping battle scenes. However, it's not as to-the-letter faithful to Miller's source material as Sin City was. The plot is the same, and many of the book's images are represented just about perfectly. But some extra material has been added, including new villains (who would be considered ""bosses"" if this were a video game, and it often feels like one) and a political subplot involving new characters and a significantly expanded role for the Queen of Sparta (Lena Headey). While this subplot by director Zack Snyder (Dawn of the Dead) and his fellow co-writers does break up the violence, most fans would probably dismiss it as filler if it didn't involve the sexy Headey. Other viewers, of course, will be turned off by the waves of spurting blood, flying body parts, and surging testosterone. (The six-pack abs are also relentless, and the movie has more and less nudity--more female, less male--than the graphic novel.) Still, as a representation of Miller's work and as an ancient-themed action flick with a modern edge, 300 delivers."
"Jerseyfinn","3","1","2","31 May 2008"," 300 is a meal without calories
","It's not that I totally dislike the film. Give the CGI its due, some of the scenes are brilliantly conceived and rendered, and it's hard not to want to watch this sort of imagery. But every movie must be grounded both in visual aesthetics as well as plot & substance for one to feel as if they have had a "" cinematic meal"". 300 did not give me indigestion as much as it leaves me feeling empty and unfulfilled.<br/><br/>The story plays out in a slow mendacious fashion which creates a growing impatience as the minutes tick away sans plot. It seems that the director had a great movie in his mind and he throws out all of the visual stops to tell his story. But he lacks a plot around which to seamlessly move his characters. Hence a very nice scene at the end in which the dead Leonidies roams a golden field of wheat with his wife and son comes off more as a rip off from Gladiator than as a poignant, culminating moment. Once again, some very appealing visuals, but by the time you get to the end, you can't wait to get out as even the battle scenes grow mundane."

The battle sequences were just amazing to watch. The styling was great too. Sure it snot the most historically accurate movie, but Frank Miller didn't quite aim for it to be that way.

","I think my title line sums it up. The whole movie was visually stunning, well done, blah blah blah, but the text was so clumsily and horribly delivered that it ruined the movie for me. I KNOW it's based on a comic book, and was pretty faithful to it, but couldn't they have made the spoken part of it a bit more natural? Does Gerard Butler not know that his mouth is crooked when he talks (in a role and in real life)? What about the lame, nondescript accents? I suspended my historical disbelief, realizing that it's more of a mythical/fantasy subject than historical, but could they not have delivered all aspects with the gorgeous conviction of the visual one?"

","Taken for what it set out to accomplish (film a graphic novel) this is almost perfection. I give Sin City a slight edge because it's a little more accurate to the graphic novel it's based on.<br/><br/>A lot of people are up in arms about how this movie glorifies war and is insensitive to other races but guess what?....There are countless movies that are ""insensitive"" toward anything you can name and most don't seem to get half the attention 300 does. I'd say about 80% of movies glorify something (Violence, Sexual Content/Nudity, Swearing and so forth). Don't watch something if you think it might offend you. People put themselves in that position all the time and then everyone else has to hear the bitchin' that comes from not being well informed about the movie going in.<br/><br/>My Mom watched this movie and gave it a 9 as well. She's 60 and doesn't like lots of brutal violence and overt sexuality. She saw it as it was supposed to be seen because she was well informed about the purpose it was trying to present. (She thought the violence was to much and still gave it a 9).<br/><br/>Enough ranting. The visuals were spectacular and breathtaking especially in the magnitude of the battles. The sound was good enough that I felt half the blows being dealt out. The acting was way over the top but it was supposed to be.<br/><br/>Someone on the 300 boards mentioned that this is a popcorn flick. I agree. If your looking for reality here look elsewhere. That's not the point. Have fun watching what amounts to a really cool visual treat and great action film."
"kellyadmirer","8","1","2","30 March 2008"," A Tale of Two Movies
","This is a tremendous film that truly captures the spirit of deadly vengeance and defiance. It is filmed in stark, shadowy shades that gives it a gritty, realistic feel. The concepts of honor and obedience, whether to a person or an ideal, dominate the action and the dialog, and are shown in vivid contrast to the degradation that results or could result from their abandonment.<br/><br/>As such, it is a terrific film for getting out your aggression and focusing your inner energy on achieving a goal. I imagine that watching this film the night before participating in an important sporting event would not be a bad thing. You would be primed to go out and knock some heads together. ""No prisoners!"", as the man yells during a key fight scene. After the initial set-up, there is one fight after another, macho men showing how tough and cruel they can be in a decidedly un-ironic way - well, aside from corny, manly-type jokes such as ""We fight in the shade!"" when the 300 are forced to cover themselves with their shields to avoid incoming arrows. There is lots and lots of blood and gore, the sort of realism you would expect in a film like this. In that sense, it is similar to films like ""The Dirty Dozen"" and ""Cross of Iron"" - not bad company to be in at all. Those happen to be among my favorite films.<br/><br/>So, I really like this film. It shows primal motivations of the character (the wolf in the winter) in a way few films ever achieve. If you are in the mood to see ""300"" in a straightforward, heroic fashion as I've described, I can't really think of a better way to spend an evening than watching it.<br/><br/>But there is another film here. And I say that without taking away from the first film - it all depends on how you approach the film and what you bring to it. So, if the film I just described appeals to you, you definitely will enjoy it for what it purports to be.<br/><br/>The second film is a camp-fest that is ripe for parody. The manly breast-beating can go a little too far, the characters (especially the hero's wife, who wears way too much makeup for 400 B.C.) a little too earnest and stoic, the villains just a tad too campy. The heroes may not wear white hats and the villains black, but the fact that the pretty boys and girls are the good guys and the deformed, ugly creatures are the bad will help you keep track of what is going on. If you want, you could make endless fun of the soldiers walking through the damp while still strategically exposing their manly chests. Leonidas suddenly exclaiming, ""We go to the hot spot!"" when discussing strategy, well, that almost made my draw drop. There already is at least one parody film out there mocking this one, which I haven't seen, but it really wasn't necessary - the second film I'm describing here essentially serves as its own parody of the first.<br/><br/>I think Gerard Butler does an amazing job portraying a legendary leader with more than a touch of humanity. Hands down, the best acting job I saw in 2006. Rodrigo Santoro as Xerxes, though, steals the movie every chance he gets, serving as the main bridge between the first film - the manly, heroic tale of savage defiance - and the second - the campy take on ancient history. The soundtrack could have included some Queen songs to underscore his character's ambiguity and play up his husky voice, though that would have tipped the balance too far towards the campy side. The other characters are notable mainly for short scenes that will stick in your head, such as the Persian whose face fades out while his eyes linger on screen, conveying that almost campy evil that again bridges films 1 and 2. The screenplay could have explained the circumstances of the Persians invading Greece a little bit - the news of the invasion just suddenly comes one day like the latest weather report - but it is still a fine tale, well told.<br/><br/>So, decide what kind of mood you are in and how jaded you are, and watch. Either way, you should enjoy it. I did. Tremendously."

","There are so much good things and compliments that I can write about this movie.This is the first classic of the 21st century,one of my favorite movies(300,The Usual Suspects,1408).Everybody knows that this movie is visually impressive,but it is not just a visual experience.Vincent Regan and Gerard Butler are just terrific in their roles.The director Zack Snyder(The dawn of the dead) has did his job in a perfect way.I can say that this is an adaptation of Frank Miller comic book which is inspired by a historic event.I hope that all people who didn't like this movie for some political or unknown reasons are aware that they don't have good taste,this movie has good acting performances,brilliant direction,great special effects,it is visually impressive,has impressive battle scenes,depth,awesome screenplay and it is a demonstration of excellent film making.I had seen this movie only once for now but i really hope that i will have the chance to watch it again.It is clear that this is a real piece of art.Some people say that this movie is overrated with rating 8.0,I think that it is underrated.It is with no doubt one of the best movies ever made and a real classic among historical and war movies of all time.This is a truly epic movie."

","Another Frank Miller adaptation, 300 is the classic story of the 300 Spartans who took on a huge empire. Mythology rules this movie. Comments of homosexual tones are washed away with Lena Heady's performance. Very sultry woman who isn't afraid to love her man even if he is doomed to die in battle. Unfortunately this film does have it's flaws. It's very shallow and lacks likable characters. But it is stunning to look at especially the graphic battle scenes, the goriest of recent times that's for sure. And if you know the story then you know how it ended. The 300 are defeated and all perish. But the ride up to the grim end is wonderful and worth a look.<br/><br/>7/10"
"Gregonar","Null","1","2","27 January 2008"," 300: Old Story, New effects.
","300: Old Story, New effects.<br/><br/>While most movies about the classical period have the epic feel of a long bedtime story, Zack Snyder's 300 broke from the flock with its much shorter length and its cool special effects. Arguably, that was the whole movie.<br/><br/>King Leonidas, played by Gerard Butler, leads his Spartan elite corps of 300 against Xerxes' Persian hordes- fighting for freedom, reason, civility, and the like. Obviously the Spartan warrior culture hardly stands for those concepts by today's standards, but for them, it was something to die for. A modern day equivalent of Leonidas' plight might take place in a courtroom in the form of an ""Erin Brockovich"" versus ""some corporation"".<br/><br/>The film, however, doesn't really focus on the didactic potential of the story. But instead showcases the grind of ancient combat, souped up by effects we may more closely associate with the Matrix series.<br/><br/>Personally, I dumped those thoughts out of my mind, as well as obvious similarities to Gladiator (partially because of certain scenes, partly because I think Butler totally looks like Russell Crowe) and found the movie overall very enjoyable.<br/><br/>I analyzed it to death afterward, and it went something like this: The film was obviously unreal. I mean I don't doubt that the 300 Spartans must have been a clever and disciplined bunch, but Xerxes couldn't care more with his melange of immortals, Mongoloid mercenaries, elephants, and such. It was a modern adaptation, for a modern audience, done through modern cultural vision goggles- it can't possibly be real.<br/><br/>So what, then, it's about the special effects; the shock of gore and the psycho-emotional thrill ride (it was Frank Miller's idea, so expect Sin City elements), isn't it? If so, is it all bad? Doesn't this idea encapsulate all modern media? If we were to take the spunk out of it all- action without effects, comedy without laugh track, drama without constant music- would it stand on its own? Would we be interested without the hype of glamour and gloss? Reality blows, obviously, and story-telling is an art that requires those psycho-emotional thrill rides.<br/><br/>This is a depressing thought but I'm sure most of you will continue to enjoy media's special effects, I know I will. I enjoyed 300, albeit it lacks the aftertaste of other better movies. The silly analysis of modern media came later, which isn't very important.<br/><br/>Upon second thought, this movie is actually a cash cow. Whenever a movie lacks original plot, didactic plot in favour of special effects, the cash cow possibility kicks in. To compound that, I know I've mentioned that the film can't possibly be real, here's one more reason why (pay attention ladies and 10% of you men): Those buff Spartans are all half naked! Please refer to your Classics professor about whether or not Spartans wore breast plates and shin pads like the rest of those classical soldiers. As if that wasn't enough, I don't know what you all use for shaving purposes but I find it dubious that the Greeks of old had such luxuries(so they were fit, cleanly shaved, and half naked, whew).<br/><br/>For what it's worth, 300 is a good cash cow.<br/><br/>-G.G."
"misel982001","10","1","2","3 January 2008"," Impressive!
","This movie is an epic one. While it is inspired by a comic book it manages to keep the same spirit as the original 300 incident in ancient Greece. Even this will sound bizarre, the historian's reports talk about an even more violent incident than this we watched on the 300 movie!!! Everything on this picture is awesome: The battles, the dialogues, Gerard Buttler, just everything! Although as a project, it did not cost too much (About 65 million $) it is still a very impressive and enjoyable movie. Although some critics warned the public about extreme violence, I believe that in wars and epic stories, violence is an important element. To conclude this is an by all means an excellent movie that will be remembered for a long time to come. Also it is imprtant we learn that 300 heroes from Sparta saved Europe long time ago."
"kurtdavies580","8","1","2","28 December 2007"," An epic...
","I thoroughly enjoyed this film, it has everything; Drama, violence, love. Its an emotional roller-coaster.<br/><br/>The 300 soldiers represent the morals of courage and honour, much like the knights did in the film ""King Arthur"", if you liked that film, then this a definite must see for you. What adds to the overall experience is the camera work, there's lots of slow motion battle scenes to allow you to better appreciate the choreography and special affects. The soundtrack is also brilliant.<br/><br/>There is only one flaw I can find with this otherwise amazing film, and that is a rather annoying battle seen, which is virtually black and white, and only the red capes of the Spartans are in colour. I myself prefer more gore and violence, especially in films such as these, as it adds a sense of realism to the film and allows the viewer to appreciate what a battlefield really looks like. However I suppose this gives a battlefield a more graceful outlook, which some viewers will appreciate.<br/><br/>Beneath the action packed battling, is a thick political plot which gives the film a purpose and adds to its drama, greatly.<br/><br/>I do recommend this title, especially to film lovers of this genre, you will not be disappointed.<br/><br/>8/10"

"nightmedic30","9","1","2","11 December 2007"," Not very off on History.
","What is the big shock of the film was how close it came to the history of the real event. What may be an eye opener to many viewers (and reviewers) was that the Spartan Hopalites (King's Body Guard) were the Delta Force of their time. Sparta DID cast out babies found ""not worthy,"" they did wear little more than a cloak and groin cloth. They were sent out in early teens to survive by whatever means necessary. They also were the only army to that point in history that actually fought in a coordinated unit structure. The ""Shield Wall"" was as portrayed the short spear used as shown, the short sword used after the enemy was broken. The Persions DID break through and eventually burned Athens, But the Greeks under Spartan Leadership drove the Persions out in a defeat that they never got over. They actually started hiring Greek mercenary armies to help with their conquests. If you would Ike to know more Google ""The Ten Thousand."" Which documents the march of a cut-off Greek army which after not getting paid fought their way across the entire Persian Empire taking their pay from the cities they encountered, and arriving as an intact force back in Greece."
"luke-346","6","1","2","6 December 2007"," Poor camera-work, bad editing and a dire script... but somehow fun.
","300 is a film littered with poor camera-work, bad editing and has the unfortunate luck of being lumbered with a dire script. The only redeeming features are its stunning visuals, which do manage to set it apart from its Hollywood contemporaries. 300 is a film that has apparently been heralded as an epic of battle like proportions (which it is not), it is visually though as exciting and pioneering as the cult-classics ""Tron"", ""Back to the Future II"" and even ""Willow"" and this is because upon release it has showed some sort of visual cinematic progress, yet it is likely that this is also the reason it will be a cult film in many years to come. Subsequently Zack Snyder's utilisation of some slow motion, CGI and irrelevant narrative cutaways turn probably an hours worth of film footage into two - and it shows.<br/><br/>300 attempts to build credibility on the ideals of loyalty and honour, but it is no ""Gladiator"". The fight scenes are poorly choreographed (the fast pace editing only illustrates this further) and the tight use of camera-shots fail to transpire on anything less than a very large television¬Ö I did feel that this type of camera work in the battle/fight scenes was only employed to gloss over the poor choreography. I also felt that the lack of establishing shots prior to battle scenes failed to give any sense isolation among the Spartans or any feeling of companionship, the explanation of loyalty and camaraderie has only be left to the poor script. Snyder has tried too hard to stylise the fighting and battle scenes and although it looks good, it serves no real narrative purpose apart from a few moments, the most note worthy being the decapitation of the young Spartan and the scarring of Xerxes.<br/><br/>Finally, the only gratification for 300 is for those that were fortunate to see it at the cinema or who have a 46inch HDTV, but if you're really after good visuals then buy an X-Box and indulge yourself in the cut-scenes of Halo 3 because that is that is where the films real competition lies, in a video game!"
"madmaxmedia","5","1","2","3 December 2007"," A 2-hour video game cutscene
","The best way I can describe this movie without being too judgmental is that it is a super- pumped up, technically brilliant video game cutscene extended to 2 hours in length.<br/><br/>I guess my judgment seeps through there, but it seems everyone has opinions of this movie one way or the other. Fans of the movie say that if you like fruity, unintelligible foreign independent movies made by acne-ridden emo art students then this is not for you. Critics of the movie say that if you have the mental capacity and emotional maturity of a 5-year old and love monster trucks then this is the perfect movie for you. Either way there's a lot of not-too-subtle sniping going around.<br/><br/>All I will say as the movie is really as extreme as the opinions seem to indicate. There's really no attempt at any sort of emotional depth, or connection to reality or actual humanity in this movie, so don't bother looking for it. Whether this is good or bad is up to the viewer to decide. If you know what it is going in, then it can be an enjoyable ride. (after all I never said video game cutscenes aren't entertaining.)"

","A friend of mine recommended this film and I've read, and indeed agree, with the people who have loved the film and commented on it before - I'm just not one of those that loved it.<br/><br/>This film is all about action and sadly, those people that love this sort of action most are going to be bored out of their mind for about the first minutes of the film.<br/><br/>With that minimal nod to story and plot over with we can get on with the bloodfest! And there is plenty of it. Even I will agree that these scenes are done in loving detail. Slow motion fights, stylistic movements rendered slowly so the eye can catch subtle details. It is very much like art.<br/><br/>What I really didn't like about the film though is the message. Pretty much, if your strong and stubborn your a hero. If your smart and prefer to think your way around a problem, or even *shock, gasp* compromise, you are a coward/loser. Certainly the hero of this film was given plenty of opportunities to surrender and save his and his men's lives. But he didn't (often killing the messenger as well) and he is venerated for it."

Now I have to sat there was a lot of amazing action sequences and sort of a plot but I didn't care and you probably won't care much either. It is about 300 Spartans who are fighting against thousands of Persians. They fight until they all die proudly at the end. There are plenty of slow motion stabbings and killings to make you go WOW. I don't get why movies like this and Troy have such mixed reviews when they are entertaining which they are supposed to be. It's better than watching a boring history lesson on ancient colonies.

"robred69","Null","1","2","7 October 2007"," A Stunning Visual Feast.
","I have actually been to Thermpolaye, when I went on a Classical Tour in the mid 1990s. The setting of the battlefield in the 300 looked nothing like the terrain that I saw, but it makes for a better picture I guess. I've been waiting for this film on DVD ..I wanted to see it on cinema, but time wasn't on my side.<br/><br/>Well, finally watched it, thoroughly enjoyed it. Its the rumours that circulated around the film, ""its homo-erotic"" or ""its racist""... Maybe I missed something, but I didn't really see that aspect of it. Yes there's nudity and the uglier features of Spartan Society are actually laid bare. The Spartans were very, very religious and that really should've been explored more.<br/><br/>Anyway, the film, a visual feast, for those who like battle scenes. The slow motion scenes were truly effective and the mixture of animation and reality was brilliant. It added to the mystique of the times. If I was to cast my eyes on disappointment, it would be the historic inaccuracies and the geographical betrayal. Cold winters and cloudy weather....Were talking Greece here!!! Its hot and the Countryside, especially around Thermopolaye, is hilly and arrid. Olive trees and bushells. The water was calm and battles spanning from the time of Antiquity to the Mediavel era were campaigns that took place in the summertime. Anyhow...A visual feast, I was impressed with Gerard Butler's Leonidas, when he calls to his men, eat hearty this morning, for by the night we shall be dining in hell...unfortunately, he should've said..with the gods!!! David Wenham, as Pelios, commanding performance, excellent narration and a mixture of his previous character in Van Helsing was a nice touch!!! Anyway, definitely a ""must view""...Just for the Battles and the mysticism. The biggest contradiction of all, ws that Spartan society was not only religious, it was extremely conservative, when hearing Leonidas talk of freedom, justice and reason...I did think, ""hang on a minute""!! Because it was the Spartans under Lysander that beat Athenians in the Pelyopinesian Wars..and destroyed a society that actually strived for those virtues. Anyway...Enjoy the film."

","Another amazing film based on Frank Miller's graphic novels. The cinematography is absolutely stunning, and the story amazing.

Every time I watch it I never want it to end. I strongly believe that this film should have a much higher rating, I cant see what people don't like about this.

"colonel_green","7","1","2","4 September 2007"," A faithful adaptation of Miller's source material.
","Frank Miller has, since the 1980s, been one of the most popular and influential creators in comics, almost his fame culminated in 1986's ""The Dark Knight Returns"", and his later works have been less successful commercially. Despite Miller's fame, I have never been particularly impressed by his work, even of his supposed magnum opus, the aforementioned ""The Dark Knight Returns."" From what I have read, the highlight of his career was his early Marvel work on ""Daredevil"", and everything since then has been fairly downhill, especially after ""Sin City"", which, while adapted into a very fun film, typifies his work: completely devoid of any real value beyond crude entertainment, with no emotional investment, and obsessed with extreme violence and highly sexualized depictions of female characters.<br/><br/>""300"" is post-""Sin City"" in Miller's career, and is basically the story of the legendary 300 Spartan warriors, with the usual Miller features: Madonna/whore women (tilted towards the latter), graphic violence, anti-gay humour (despite Spartans being historically homosexual). It's a fun entertainment, but nothing more, and certainly not a great movie. The technical merits are quite impressive (including the abdomens of the Spartan warriors, led by King Leonidas; Gerard Butler's performance has at the very least supplied fodder for innumerable internet parodies; Butler is not bad, let me be clear; he perfectly fits the histrionic, one-dimensional material, and I know him to be a very talented actor in other roles).<br/><br/>This film did well enough to get Zack Snyder the job of directing Alan Moore's ""Watchmen"", which will be the real test of his skill; he provided a convincing film translation of a one-dimensional story, and now he faces the Holy Grail of all mature, literate comics. We'll see how he does."

","300 (2006) *1/2<br/><br/>'300' has earned itself a fairly hefty reputation among the movie going masses as a very good film. I can see why so many people enjoy it. It is action packed, satisfying to blood lust, and it's the kind of rah-rah film that the masses love. And not to step on the toes of the public and insinuate that stupidity and ignorance are beyond common expectations, but I have to wonder seriously about the depth of the mass public's sense of morality. <br/><br/>300, based on Frank Miller's graphic novel, follows the Battle of Thermopylae (the hot gate) through King Leonidas (Gerard Butler). We begin at his birth, where the narrator cheerfully describes that had he not been in good birth condition he would have been tossed among the carcasses of other less than perfect children. The massive army of Persians come to Sparta and tell them that they must kneel to their deity Xerces or be destroyed. Of course, Leonidas kills the messenger and declares war. On being denied permission to go to war by the freakish oracles (who are as we are told traitors to Sparta) Leonidas puts together an army of three-hundred and there is our movie.<br/><br/>My problem with 300 is not its constant graphic violence. My problem is not with the films near relentless pretentiousness. Nor is my problem with the constant stupidity of 300. My problem is the unique combination of these elements which 300 creates into a complete glorification of violence with a dash of racism and a hint of fascism. <br/><br/>The film's visual style and flair allow for some beautiful imagery and astonishing sights. There is no arguing that arduous labor went into creating 300 for the big screen. Zak Snyder shows that he is a good director (His remake of Dawn of the Dead was a very good film, especially considering its material and what it had to live up to). That the film is well made does little to save it from itself in the end. The dialogue is incredibly poorly written, with more cheese than a mouse could stomach. It's pretentious to the point of preposterousness, and preposterous to the point of pretentiousness. When the characters aren't talking about the glory of slaughtering, a narrator does it for them. <br/><br/>300 is essentially nothing more than a feature length portrait of sado-masochistic macho porn on a multi-million dollar budget. It's an offensive film that revels in its violence not to disgust us by it, but to enthrall us with it. Its violence is so stylistic that it can hardly be described as offensive, but it is in how the story feeds off it like the life blood that bacterium suck from a host. The heroes of the movie, all extremely buff white men (since apparently ancient Spartans had ready access to anabolic steroids) go around slaughtering then reminiscing about how great it was to slaughter their enemy, all of whom are either Arabs or freaks, save for one white traitor. <br/><br/>300 defenders will surely attempt to draw parallels with other violent epics such as Braveheart, a film that dealt with essentially the same theme. My response to those defenders would be that films like Braveheart never glorified its violence but repulsed in it - violence was a consequence of the plot, instead of plot as a consequence of violence. It also never separated its characters by race or grace. <br/><br/>300 is so well made that its rather unfortunate it hasn't the legs to tread water in its sea of moral repugnance. <br/><br/>1.5/4"

I finally had the chance to watch it and I believe its a superb film that interesting tells the story of what happened. <br/><br/>There's something special about this film, apart from the epicness of the action.

Also, the acting is marvellous and the characters are portrayed as extremely interesting. The pacing is superb in the film and how the film starts was just magnificent and interesting.<br/><br/>My favorite movie of all time being the Lord of the Rings trilogy, I have always loved good sword fighting action, but my only concern of this film is the obvious use of Lord of the Rings material, which is clearly seen at the end of the film when Leonidas is getting killed. Remember Boromir from Fellowship of the Ring, how he receives three mighty thick Uruk arrows embedded into his chest, the same happens here as Leonidas is fighting. Remember how Boromir died, his last words being ""I would've followed you my brother, my captain, my king"". Here, Leonidas' last words were ""My queen, my wife, my love"" which is pretty much in reverse form of Boromir's words. It sorta annoyed me considering how much I love LOTR and is the reason I give it a 9 instead of a 10. <br/><br/>I was grateful to see the guy who played Faramir in Lord of the Rings play Dilios.

Sparta was, for all intents and purposes, still a monarchy.<br/><br/>My suggestion would be to read the Herodotus Histories or at least watch the History Channel version called The Last Stand of the 300. This is a far more accurate version of the events. It also gives you some background as well. It is very entertaining as well."

","I watched this movie last night, and ... I had a good time. But then again, at times I am easy to please. When watching this movie one shouldn't forget that it's based on the epic drama and the comic strip by Frank Miller. So don't expect subtleness. Don't expect a balanced picture. Don't expect well worked out characters. It's just not that kind of genre. But if you love one liners ('Freedom doesn't come for free'. Ooooo, that's deep!), if you can appreciate a simple and over the top plot, some good animation, pretty (or gory) pictures, and tons of bloody action, then this movie is for you. Now to what I did not like: There is absolutely NOTHING new in this movie. The style of the leader and credits is taken from Sin City. The pretty monochromatic pictures are taken from Gladiator. The cripple and the battle scenes are taken from The Lord of the Rings etc etc. That's why I would hate to see this movie getting an academy award nomination.

Like some epic tale out of Heavy Metal magazine, the imagery here is not to be missed. This is surely one of the best war movies ever made and I would go as far as saying that it is one of the best movies ever. The action is fast-paced and reminiscent of most modern action movies.

"Solipsisticblog","4","2","7","19 March 2007"," A tedious bore
","What's this movie about? Who the hell knows. Various critics have accused director Zack Snyder of producing a fascist tract or a glorification of the destructive policies of the Bush administration, but I think more than anything its a paean to CGI. The film is a tedious two hours and feels like a demonstration piece to help move home entertainment centers at Best Buy. It's devoid of emotion or drama and hopes to win audiences over solely through the steady bombardment of hyper-stylized bloodletting.<br/><br/>The film fails fundamentally by not creating a world we believe in. Snyder has tried to bring painterly comic book presentation to screen, a la ""Sin City"", and in this he succeeds. This movie world looks crisp, sharp, and perfectly composed. And lifeless. The hordes of CGI soldiers, meant to evoke fear in their might and number, don't emerge as real but merely as computer-generated hordes. The world looks artificial as do many of the soldiers. There's nothing at stake because we don't believe in the film's reality.<br/><br/>As in last Spring's big budget comic adaptation ""V for Vendetta"", the heroes of this tale, the 300 brave Spartans, are nearly invincible. These guys are mighty and as a whole nearly untouchable, and don't display any vulnerability until the script needs them to. There's no oomph to the battles because the 300 are so supernaturally mighty. They crush everyone in balletic slo-mo. Yawn. The story's brief moments of political turmoil away from the battlefield are predictable and seem culled from a different film.<br/><br/>If the film is guilty of any sin, it would be in trying to sell warfare as awesome and the enemy as relatively faceless and soulless. Hopefully the movie's presentation is so fantastic and ridiculous as to not sell anyone on the cruel, bloodthirsty code of the Spartans.<br/><br/>""300"" is a bore and tedious. In IMAX, as I saw it, it's flaws were glaringly apparent."

","First surprise: My wife talked me into seeing ""300"". I really couldn't understand why she was so interested in a gory comic book version of one of history's great battles. Our 17-year-old son even tried to talk her out of it. Second surprise: We actually enjoyed the movie! Yes, it's extremely violent, but after Saving Private Ryan, Apocalypto, Pan's Labytinth, and the evening news I suppose we're getting used to such things. And the look of the film is just detached enough from reality that its shock value is somewhat reduced. And boy is it gorgeous! I love stories of courage and honor, and this one has it in spades. Plus it doesn't pull any punches. The timing of its release--just as the Democratic Congress is trying to force trough a 'non-binding' resolution to cut-and-run from Iraq--just can't be a coincidence.

The battle scenes are extraordinary and unlike anything we have seen on film before.

Daily Ta Nea newspaper gave Zack Snyder's 300 zero out of 10, with critic Dimitris Danikas claiming the film even carried a message about the U.S. war on terror.<br/><br/>""By ancient Persia, they refer to modern Iran ¬ó whose soldiers are portrayed as bloodthirsty, underdeveloped zombies,"" he wrote. ""They are stroking racist instincts in Europe and America."" Robby Eksiel at the daily Ethnos said moviegoers would be dazzled by the ""digital action"" but irritated by the ""pompous interpretations and one-dimensional characters."" Greece's critics were similarly scathing about other recent movies depicting ancient battles, including Wolfgang Petersen's Troy and Oliver Stone's Alexander in 2004.<br/><br/>It's a pattern that disappointed Panayiotis Timoyiannakis, the lone voice of support among Greek critics for 300 ""This is not a university lecture, it's a movie,"" he wrote in the daily Eleftheros Typos.

Soldiers in each army were depicted in such a way as to make them seem exactly as I expected. The political part was a little annoying at times, but a necessary part of the film; that was where I had the hardest time figuring things out immediately. It's just not very fun to think about something when you're watching people fight a lot. I think that I saw one of the first previews for 300 last summer and I knew then that I was ready to watch for glory, but after waiting so long to see it I think I blew its glory up too much and expected perfection. My apologies to Zack Snyder and everyone else who worked on or in 300."
"ingres77","8","2","7","12 March 2007"," Conflicted experience
","I'm conflicted over this film.<br/><br/>On the one hand, you've got one of the most testosterone driven films you'll ever see. Watching this movie, you want to go out, eat some raw meat, drink whiskey, get in a fight in a bar, and ravish a woman. This film has more machismo than a Rocky marathon on TBS. It's pulsing with enough masculinity to make you question your sexuality.<br/><br/>Heh.<br/><br/>On the other hand, you've got a masturbatory film full of patriotic verve and cock-suredness (!) that it confidently and self-righteously pummels you with the message that freedom is bought with blood. A good message, and a true one, don't get me wrong. But 'subtlety' is not in this film's vocabulary.<br/><br/>At it's best, this film is awe-inspiring. The music pulsates with heavy rock beats, the violence is thick and heavy, and the acting is overpowering. There is no subtlety in this film. It does what it intends to do: show the unimaginable heroism of the battle of Thermopylae, and kicks freakin' ass in the process.<br/><br/>At it's worst, though, it's absurdly juvenile. Zack Snyder (the director) is a like a kid who's been given the keys to a cinematic kingdom. He uses every trick of the industry. He does too much, too soon. He pushes this film too far, and tries too hard. There is simply too much cool for the one-hour and fifty-seven minutes.<br/><br/>Ultimately, though, this is a film that has one mission: to kick ass. And it does.<br/><br/>But in the process, this film can be absurd. Almost violent-kitsch. For instance, slow motion can be used to great effect...if you know what you're doing. Kubrick, Kurosawa, and Scorsese have all used it effectively. Mel Gibson has made the effect a major part of his directorial repertoire. It's became a bit of a trademark for him.<br/><br/>The difference between these directors and Snyder, though, is that Snyder uses it in almost every scene. It's done so much in this movie that it has no emotional impact. Like the close up, slow motion works best to emphasize, to enhance. used too much, it becomes a cheap ploy. Instead of heightening the drama of a scene, it distracts from the film and takes the audience out of the moment. It's sole purpose, in this film, is to make action shots ""cooler"". Which is great if you're a 16 year-old, video game playing male. But if you're not, this film will leave you wanting more.<br/><br/>Like everything else in the movie, the acting is over the top. Gerard Butler is imposing as King Leonidas, but there are times where it seems as though he's yelling everything. I get that he's trying to motivate, but as someone watching a movie, you're left with the thought of, ""enough already"". For a stoic warrior, he's the most impassioned man on the screen.<br/><br/>But you know what? At the end of the day, this is the kind of movie that's meant to simply be enjoyed. It's not meant to be deep, or overly analyzed. There are flaws, yes. But this movie was designed for you to sit back, chill out, and say, ""damn. That's awesome."" And more often than not, that's exactly what your reaction will be."

It is a little over-the-top, but that's everything the graphic novel deserves. Nearly the entire movie is made up of realistic and epic effects powered by computer graphics. The battle sequences are the best in any movie since ""The Matrix"" and build on new, improved technology. An epic movie that lives up to its epic previews.

","It's probably been told more than enough by now but ""300"" is a wild visual feast that should appeal to anyone who knows what they're in for. Adapted by director Zack Snyder from Frank Miller's graphic novel about The Battle of Thermopylae, the movie's a frenetic composite of stylish atmospherics, larger-than-life characters with equivocal motives, and brash - even poetic - dialog. Anyone who's found pleasure in Robert Rodriguez' cinematic translation of Miller's ""Sin City"" and Snyder's reworking of George Romero's ""Dawn of the Dead"" will most likely find this an incredible visual interpretation for the testosterone-driven. It's bombarded with habitual skepticism and extraordinary bloodbath, but all that works to the film's advantage eventually.<br/><br/>""300"" tells the story of the Spartan King Leonidas (Gerald Butler) and his 300 men who dealt a massive blow to the numerically superior army of Persian King Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro) before coming to their demise. From a narrative standpoint, there's nothing much as Snyder and the screenwriters favor the mythology of the context more than factual accuracy. Style triumphs over substance, so to speak, and here characterization and nuance are thrown off the window. As such, it should be pointed out that this is not a movie for everyone, but if you're one who gets a kick out of action and atmosphere, then this is one to enamor.<br/><br/>It's basically turgid film-making that achieves what it's set to do, because from a technical standpoint, ""300"" is a regal buffet, filled with the sort of desaturated colors blended with blue screen background that lends to the film's ethereal look, capturing the look of its source material and giving the film its energetic pace that rarely pauses for a break once it gains momentum. ""300"" is a movie about valor and heroism and it raises an angry crimson atmosphere that matches well with its epic theme.<br/><br/>All of the actors, none of them big-name stars, do a pretty good job and seem to be at home with their portrayals even if they aren't required much to stretch their thespic skills with hardly fleshed-out characters. Nevertheless, as the king and leader of the Spartan army, Butler gives a passionate and forceful performance that conjures a credible character. Dominic West and David Wenham are the more familiar faces in the members of the Spartan army but both depict their roles subtly in such a way they blend seamlessly with the rest of the warriors. Lena Heady as Leonidas' wife provides a strong feminine balance to Butler's vigorousness.<br/><br/>""300"" obviously has its sights on audiences weaned on extravagant visuals and visceral thirst. Honestly, there's a feeling that it could have been more but Snyder seems content not to go anywhere near Rodriguez' tier as he simply promotes the technical over the dramatic aspects of the film. But given the epicurean eye candy in this lush production, it's really not necessary to ask for something more than an unabashed spectacle."
"jamtheguitarman","9","3","13","25 March 2007"," An outstanding piece of art
","My thoughts. <br/><br/>I went into the movie with huge expectations, I've been waiting for this since it started production last year.<br/><br/>So did it meet them?<br/><br/>The visuals absolutely met my expectations. In fact, the whole post production side of things is just as good as anything your going to see. <br/><br/>The CGI/effects are obviously the main attraction to this film ( but not in a ""dude, explosion.....cooool"" kinda way :) ). They've managed to create this whole world in which EVERY SINGLE frame of film could be a piece of art. It really is breathtaking and unlike anything else.<br/><br/>The battle scenes are of course top notch, the editing is superb. They used the slow motion technique in a lot of the scenes in such a way that the sense of power behind every strike is just phenomenal. You can really feel it! The choreography and ideas are excellent of course, its not just hack and slash.<br/><br/>The music is generally well tailored to the films atmosphere, again the battle scenes in particular. I like the approach Tyler bates took, using electric guitars heavily blended with the usual epic style movie score. There are a few scenes where i found it a touch overbearing though.<br/><br/>So its 10/10 for that side of the production.<br/><br/>Im not really sure what to say about the screenplay. Its based on Frank millers graphic novel which is loose historic account of the Battle of Thermopylae in 480BC. I like the story, and it does work to some extent. I just cant help feeling like we were given a snapshot of events (of the film, not the actual historic event). <br/><br/>It felt too short and too distant to evoke any kind of real emotions or attachment. The pacing was frankly too quick considering the nature of film. <br/><br/>However, i don't think it was perhaps possible to achieve any of this considering the nature of the Spartens and how they have to be portrayed. They are meant to be cold warriors who are born and raised to fight. I don't see how its possible to create any scenes were you properly dive into character identities and backgrounds. It would just turn into a complete contradicting mess of a film. <br/><br/>So taking that into account i think they did a pretty good job with a difficult story to put to film effectively.<br/><br/>I also thought the dialogue was patchy, in some cases it was excellent. In more places it wasn't.<br/><br/>I thought the acting was pretty good in general, in particular Gerald Butler in the main role was excellent. Pretty much perfect casting for that role! <br/><br/>So what does it come down to? This film for me is more like a piece of art than a piece of drama. Its truly breathtaking and without doubt one of the most instantly memorable films created.<br/><br/>However, if you go in expecting a moving dramatisation of a historical event you will no doubt be disappointed. Frankly, if you do that you shouldn't have the right to complain.<br/><br/>The bad reviews this film gets from some places are extremely unfair. Yes its all subject to each individual, but you cannot deny what a significant piece of film making this is.<br/><br/>Its films like this that push the boundary's and open people up to new ideas."

"MaxBorg89","8","4","21","25 March 2007"," Sin City it ain't, but still an awesome, breathtaking action movie
","Those drooling with anticipation for Sin City 2 (and 3) should give 300 a look, since it's similar to Robert Rodriguez's masterpiece: same source material (a graphic novel by Frank Miller), same filming technique (the backgrounds are all computer-generated) and, most important, same brutal atmosphere.<br/><br/>Whatever Miller writes involves torture and death, and 300 is no exception. In fact, the beginning of the film is made more painful to watch by the fact that the events depicted really happened in that period: we're talking about a town, Sparta, so obsessed with physical perfection all disfigured male children were killed instantly. As for those who lived, the law established that they be taken away from their mothers at the age of 7 and not return to Sparta until they had become perfect killing machines. This same thing happened to Leonidas (Gerard Butler), the Spartan king the story revolves around, and this explains why he refuses to surrender when he's told the Persian army is about to invade all Greece. Since a true soldier would rather die than yield to the enemy, Leonidas chooses three hundred men (hence the film's title) to help him stop the Persians at the Thermopylae. Given the numbers (300 Spartans against one million Persians), it really takes lots of courage to embark on such a mission. And that is why, as the narrator (David Wenham) underlines, everyone will remember that battle.<br/><br/>Being based on a comic-book, 300 is not a movie classicists should see: although his work was partly based on that of Greek historian Herodotus, Miller was more interested in writing a spectacular tale of love, loyalty and sacrifice, rather than an accurate account of this particular phase of the Persian war. And judging from the celluloid version, historical accuracy wasn't something director Zack Snyder (the man behind 2004's Dawn of the Dead remake) thought that much about either. His focus is on the scope and explicit brutality of the battle, and he cunningly uses his video-clip experience for that purpose: the fight scenes are among the most stunning in recent years, courtesy of smart editing, Lord of the Rings-inspired music and frequent use of slow-motion. In terms of style, 300 is every bit as mesmerizing as Sin City, each frame being filled with energy, beauty (as seen in the spellbinding oracle sequence) and, in the case of the battle scenes, lots of blood (enough to make Troy look like a PG-13 feature). The energy also emerges with insistence from the cast, particularly Butler's charismatic, relentlessly tough sovereign.<br/><br/>However, 300 does have a few minor flaws: whereas Sin City was 100% faithful to the written page, there is one significant diversion from the graphic novel in the form of Gorgo (Lena Headey), queen of Sparta, who was barely shown in Miller's story but is employed by Snyder to tone down the testosterone and give some room to the political side of the events. Now, the confrontations between Headey's caring monarch and Dominic West's opportunistic traitor are interesting, but kind of slow down the film, as the audience's attention is all in the hands of Leonidas and his men. Also, Rodrigo Santoro's camp and flamboyantly gay portrayal of Persian emperor Xerxes robs all his scenes of the grandiosity present in the rest of the film.<br/><br/>In the end, though, 300 stands out as the year's first great blockbuster, a compelling depiction of bravery (and extreme violence) and further proof that not all movies based on comic-books are dumb."

","300 is one of the best movies I've ever seen. There is excellent acting, the graphics were absolutely beautiful including all the effects, and the music was pretty good too. Honestly, I couldn't find much to criticize on this movie. The action was excellent and was very realistic. It wasn't like they killed everyone, and didn't have a scratch on them. I don't really get how someone couldn't like this movie; it's a show for both genders. Some people say that its racist, saying that they made the Persians look like monsters. Hmm well I guess they made it like that because it came from a C-O-M-I-C book! The fight itself is based on a real event, but there wasn't a giant monster, and the Spartans didn't wear leather Speedos and red capes. So just sit back, and enjoy the movie. It's an action movie, not a documentary about the war between Persia, and Greece."
"slknik10","10","3","14","5 March 2007"," Free sneak preview of 300 sponsored by Bodog.net and Drexel University
","300 has to be one of the best movies ever made in the past decade or two. By far the best CGI graphics or camera filtering i have yet to see, even better than any lord of the rings or harry potter known of, including millers past Sin City. It was a true tale of war, honor, love, and glory all for the protection of the fearless Greek society of Sparta. Its a movie about how young Spartans grow up to become these fearless and glorious soldiers who are then thrown into the ranks and battle at the ripe age of only 7. They are taught never to surrender, fight as one, and die as one, all for the glory of Sparta. The movie itself is kind of obvious from its cinematic and television previews, a movie of war against the massive and powerful Persian empire who seek to take over the Spartans as well as Greece, and how the Spartans lead by King Leonidas are extremely out numbered against the Persian army of one million to his mere 300. All i can say is that I've never seen anything quite like this and like everyone might have been saying from the previews, yes it does make the movie Troy look like some half-as Disney all-star movie with no depth or substance. 300 is what all Greek war movies have been trying to create for years. This one nails it and i couldn't imagine anyone giving this movie less than 8 stars, because frankly the acting was a 9, the graphics and cinematics were a 10, plot a 10, and directing was perfect by Snyder 10. Great graphic novel by Sin City legend Frank Miller and nothing less than a perfect re-production of it. Truly a great masterpiece i definitely encourage everyone to go and see it when it comes out this Friday March 9th, especially if you have an IMAX theater near by...OMG!"
"Cmbh","10","4","22","25 March 2007"," Good but it could have been great
","Voted 10 because of all the ludicrous one star reviews, most of which seem to come from people residing in Iran.<br/><br/>Just got back from seeing it. It is a good movie but could have been a great one.<br/><br/>It is easy to see why I read so many hostile reviews from (mainly American) critics. 'Noble' Greeks fighting barbarous Asians and all without pensively meditating on the futility of war. Even if this had been a masterpiece it would have still got a critical hammering. Ridley Scott only got away with doing a movie on the fall of Jerusalem by making the Knights Templar the bad guys.<br/><br/>But sadly just because a movie is being sniffily condemned by 'right on' movie critics does not make it a great one.<br/><br/>They seemed at first to be trying to capture the essence of Spartan society and made a far better job of it than most would have. But sadly any movie that has Spartans proclaiming that they are fighting for liberty and civilisation is losing allot of credibility. It is comparable to the defenders of Iwo Jima going to their deaths saying that they are fighting for liberty and democracy.<br/><br/>The battle itself is better than most Hollywood battle scenes (a very faint compliment) but does seem to be taking place on a stage rather than a mountain pass. Most of the time you never really get the sense they are fighting against a million strong Persian army and after the first engagement they give up on showing how the Spartans actually fought (in Phalanx formation) in favour of a mass brawl.<br/><br/>All in all the movie is only saved from being a poor one by the performance of Gerard Butler in the lead role.<br/><br/>When you finish there is a sense of disappointment, of an opportunity missed. Many scenes are very good indeed and with better scripting and a longer running time this could have been a great movie."
"crculver","3","2","8","9 September 2018"," An occasionally intriguing fantasy undone by cliche after cliche
","300, the 2007 story of the three hundred Spartans who held off a massive Persian offensive in Ancient Greece, proved a disappointing film. In spite of my Classics degree, I won't complain about the divergences from recorded fact. The film is clearly meant to be a fantasy on historical themes instead of a faithful account of the event. Rather, what irked me was the hammy dialogue. There were the tropes of recent Hollywood battle scenes: warriors on the good guys' side defending themselves with little exertion as they trade silly quips about how they've got each other's backs. A queen gives an address to a council that is all melodrama -- are we back in George Lucas' ""Star Wars"" prequels?<br/><br/>Having enjoy SIN CITY, which had a similar green-screen approach, I thought that 300 would be worthwhile at least on the basis of its special effects, but alas it wasn't. For one, the cinematography is claustrophobic. All outdoor scenes but one were filmed with a green screen, but these digital backdrops add no depth. Even when supposedly standing on the Greek coast under a big sky, everyone seems like they are just standing around in a fairly small room. Also, the fight scenes seem primitive considering that this film followed years after THE MATRIX RELOADED.<br/><br/>The little I can recommend 300 for is the variety of demonic monsters and exotic costumed assassins that fill the Persian army. As I said, this is a fantasy on historical themes, and the additions are often interesting. Still, I had a hard time sitting through the whole film."

","I really don't know what's with the big fuss about this movie. The plot is weak, the characters aren't developed, and the whole point seems to be blood, guts&gore. It's quite obvious that they didn't take too much trouble being historically accurate, the description of the spartan society being shallow at the most. Not to mention that the Persians are NOT Africans... they are known for being a blond and fair-skinned people. The title and the promos hinted to a movie about heroic deeds and charismatic leaders, instead I had to face almost two hours of blood spurted all over the screen and too many moments when I thought I accidentally hit the ""pause"" button. What is it with that anyway? Cinema is about moving pictures, not an endless amount of screen shots... The computer generated effects are over-abused, the sepia coloring is fine at the beginning, but afterwards it's just an eyesore. The acting is very bad, the characters have that bleak and brainwashed look in their eyes. We get it that they're soldiers, they don't have to have that rabid animal look in their eyes all the time.

","After movies like Troy and Alexander I'm glad the cool Greeks are back! ;o) Seriously though: I really liked this movie, although I'm not in any way supporting the Spartan way of life (which is one of the few things, that is accurately depicted in the movie).<br/><br/>Having said that, it would be a mistake to say that this an accurate depiction of what happened back then (history-wise). It is based on the graphic novel by Frank Miller (and yes his novel is based on the historical events, but he took the liberty of changing a few things). And although I haven't read that novel yet, I heard the movie is very accurate to the graphic novel.<br/><br/>Don't mistake this movie as a political propaganda too. Yes there are certain lines that can be interpreted that way (pro-Bush and pro-War), but they were either written/invented by Frank Miller a few years ago or they have been said many centuries ago (like the, then ""we will fight in the shade"" saying). So why connect them to the recent developments in the middle east? People say it's the timing (like why did the film come out at a time like this? You could argue that scenes like that couldn't be made a few years ago).<br/><br/>So yes you can read anything in the movie if you want to. But is that how you should absorb the movie? I don't think so! I think either you are going in (especially after having watched the trailer and/or teaser) wanting to have fun (although some scenes are not for the faint of hearted, decapitations and so forth) and enjoy a popcorn movie or you just want to hate ... It's up to you to decide ..."
"theoneeggy","10","2","8","30 March 2007"," Frank Miller's 300
","I was just reading some of the forum submissions, and felt compelled to write my own comment and hopefully inspire some of the naysayers to reconsider. There are many arguments as to why it was a bad movie. I will start with the simpler ones: Gore. If you thought this movie was bloody/gory, you must never have seen movies like Saving Private Ryan, The Departed, Gladiator, or other movies which share somewhat similar graphic content. The gore in this is considerably low, not something to complain about. Another of the weaker arguments is the grudge against apparel. People back then wore those loincloth type clothing when the fought. Deal with it. You can't change historical fact.<br/><br/>On to some of the heavier arguments, we get to the problems people have with plot. There wasn't enough tension - obviously you weren't watching the movie. Tension between the Queen and the Senator whose name escapes me and tension on the battle field were present. Its not a lot, but once again I say that you cannot change historical fact. It would kill the history fanatics. There weren't any twists or suspense in the plot. Suspense cant make it, because most people know how it ends anyway, and as to twists, if they were added it would compromise the factual basis of the movie.<br/><br/>To the most prevalent argument: The movie is anti-Persian. OF COURSE IT IS! They were the bad guys in this conflict, don't you remember?? It is bound to cast a negative light on them, and it must, because it happened. Not quite as embellished, but this event did occur, and the Persian people as a culture must learn to deal with there past and not take offense to it.<br/><br/>As for my own comments, I thought it was very well done, as apparent by my rating (10). Gerard Butler did a fantastic job as Leonidas, maybe not Oscar status if I must admit, but a great job nonetheless. The conformity to original spartan values, battleplans, upbringing, and mostly everything else concerning the spartan civilization was great. The gore factor was at a decent level, giving the bloodthirsty a thrill, but not driving the weak-stomached to the hills. There was also a bit of comic relief factor, which I thought was very well placed and did a good job of keeping the fans entertained through dialogue which might otherwise be ignored. And last of all, the history, and the embellishment on such. The history was great, the writers and Frank Miller did a great job of keeping the general history in check, and did a great job with the details they change, giving a more 'epic' air to the movie.<br/><br/>Overall, it is a must see, must buy, and a great movie for most anyone. **********/********** (10/10)"
"mehdimarechal","3","2","8","20 March 2007"," Great SFX and CGI but Etnocentrist, racist and historically incorrect.
","OK, this film has great battle scenes, SFX is good, CGI is terrific...but the story??? This film will appeal to lovers of computer games and flashy MTV clips, but not to people who want some content and depth in a movie. Speaking of content one can't possibly ignore the Etnocentrist and racist underpinnings of this Movie. 300 noble Greeks, members of ""the great Western civilization"" take on ""barbaric, blood-thirsty Persians"". By the way, can anyone ignore that the timing of the release is not innocent? While the Bush-administration is pushing for sanctions against Iran, making plans to bomb Iran... In 1939 Stalin ordered Serge√Ø Eisenstein to make ""Alexander Nevsky"", a film in which brave Russian troops defeated blood-thirsty Teuton (German) Knights...this film needed to straighten national identity and cultural cohesion in the wake of a possible German invasion of the USSR. Nonetheless ""Alexander Nevsky"" is a remarkable, great epic masterpiece, but one should call it what it is: a propaganda film. This is true to the same degree for ""300"" (although ""Alexander Nevsky"" is despite it's age far superior). 300 is a propaganda film, and it IS psychological warfare against Iran, please remind when watching and enjoy!"
"classicalsteve","6","2","8","17 March 2007"," CGI Battle Scenes Star--But No Shivers for the Story or Characters
","Because of the breakthroughs in CGI, there has been a surge of epic films set in the ancient world such as Troy, Gladiator, and Kingdom of Heaven. This trend is very similar to the time when Cinemascope made its debut in the 1950's with movies also set in the ancient world such as The Egyptian, Spartacus, Ben Hur and The Ten Commandments. Now ""300"", based on comic book legend Frank Miller's graphic novel of the same name, has entered the list of action movies set in ancient times, and the very short list of feature films that exclusively uses CGI. If amazing battle scenes with blood-running spectacle is what you enjoy, 300 is for you. In many ways, 300 puts you in the middle of every battle, a bit like computer and video games put the user the into the middle of the action of a situation. At times, the movie felt like a computer game in a movie theater. The CGI battle scenes are the star of the show, and worth the price of admission if no-holds-barred sword-fighting is what allows the warrior within to feel some momentary gratification. <br/><br/>However, complex thematic story-telling is not what this movie is about. The characters are more caricatured icons than real people. Leonidas as the King of the Spartans is the warrior-king who is, well, a warrior-king, nothing more, nothing less. He acts as the devoted savior of his people with the selfless agenda of a demigod. The kind of person you wish would run for president of the United States, but can't because no such person exists. His wife is equally as iconic, feminine but strong-willed to defend her husband's resolve. Have people like this ever existed? And when these icons are not spearing their enemies, they are making speeches about how great it is to spear their enemies.<br/><br/>A couple of moments had potential for interesting story development. Two supporting characters, a hunchback who is refused by Leonidas, and Theron, a member of the Spartan council who is not as grateful for Leonidas' battle campaign, divert the story a little from its predictable track. Unfortunately, these characters' stories, their motives, and their destinies have little development, and it was frustrating that more unpredictable situations did not occur. As much as I did enjoy the spectacle, I found I didn't much care about the characters. It's not that they were as blood-thirsty as their enemies, but there was little to about them that made me feel that these characters had enough flaws to feel like they were real people.<br/><br/>The portrayal of Xerxes was over the top, even for a baddie. He is not just arrogant and hedonistic. He is also a sloth, watching as his people die for his vanity. And when he sustains a superficial flesh wound, he reacts like the teacher's pet that got punched in the nose for his insults. Did the Persians real pick this guy as their leader? (Even Darth Vader had proved himself as a warrior.) The portrayal of the Persian warriors are also caricatured as unskilled amateurs. The Persian troops have about the same fighting skill as your average first-round combatants in a video or computer game. They die at the first swipe. Each Spartan cuts down about 50-60 Persian combatants per battle! And when they are not getting their clocks cleaned by the Spartans, the Persians are engaging in hedonistic sex with deranged and deformed concubines. (I can understand why people of Persian ancestry have become offended by this movie.)<br/><br/>I compare this film to Excalibur. Both have iconic characters with bigger-than-life themes based on mythic stories. Both are set in ancient times with an emphasis on battle and warriors where the good guys and the bad guys are clearly defined. But Excalibur had more heart and more mystery. We know Arthur is doomed in Excalibur as everyone knows the story of Camelot and the Knights of the Round Table. However, the way in which the tragedy unfolds and how the characters deal with their destiny is what makes the journey worth taking. Even Arthur has moments of vanity when he first meets and battles Sir Lancelot. Mordred is evil but he cunning and intelligent, not just vane and slothful. And its hard to beat the portrayal of Merlin. In 300, I never felt that I was close enough to the characters to find I felt or for that matter understood what the characters were up against. And with each successive wave of battles, I found it a bit less compelling than it should have been.<br/><br/>When the last remaining warriors of the Knights of the Round Table go to fight their last battle against Mordred, even though I know what's coming, I always get shivers up my spine, even after 25 years. The knights riding through the lush countryside making their last tragic stand, knowing the outcome will not be in their favor, with their pennants that represent their code of honor flowing behind them in the wind, is what knighthood is all about. When the Spartans made their last stand, I was intrigued, but not moved. No shivers."

It had its moments. There were a handful of choice scenes that actually affected the story in a meaningful way. Namely the opening sequence showing the training of a Spartan.<br/><br/>3. It was under 2 hours.<br/><br/>Why this movie didn't deserve a ""10"": 1. I don't care if the movie wasn't intended to be historically accurate, the dialogue should stick to a given time period. The dialogue in 300 had no regard for a given time period; sometimes it seemed like we were in the middle ages, sometimes it seemed we were in the present day.<br/><br/>2. The plot failed to develop, and was utterly transparent. You could basically guess within 5 minutes of being introduced to a character exactly what his or her role was in the story. There was absolutely no character development. Movies from the bottom 100 of the IMDb have more character development than 300.<br/><br/>3. Far too many parts of the movie were overdone. The Oracle sequence was a good example of this. It was basically a tasteless excuse to show some nudity and visual effects.<br/><br/>4. The acting was spotty at best. Gerald Butler's performance was good, everyone else needed some better direction.<br/><br/>In conclusion, if you don't care at all about story, dialogue, and acting, but have eyes with which to watch the screen, you'll love this movie.<br/><br/>If you like war epics, but care little about their veracity, you'll probably enjoy this movie.<br/><br/>If you didn't agree with this review, you most likely rated this movie a ""10"".

This stylization is both in it's storytelling and in it's aesthetics, which yields a unique and brilliant look and feel.<br/><br/>The parts of the film that drive the plot forward in between battles are kept pure, short, and too the point. Like the battle scenes, they help maintain the true feeling that all of our 300 heroes are bad asses, and that the people they oppose are slimy, corrupt, arrogant, or all of the above. This makes the characters one dimensional, but this proves to be a good thing. It creates a legendary feel for the movie, and dosn't bore us with random niceties about the various character's feelings. Now this may make me seem like an action whore, but honestly, why are you seeing this movie? You're seeing it because you want to see bad ass battle scenes. That was the problem with movies like Flyboys, where you had to sit though monumental heaps of poor attempts of humanization before you got to the next aerial battle; 300 keeps your attention by staying stylized and focused on what it dose best.<br/><br/>Now this movie has been criticized for being overly violent, being conservative in politics, and being historically inaccurate. The first should be addressed by asking: If you don't like violence and fighting, why the hell are you watching this movie in the first place? What do people expect this movie to be? It's based on a Frank Miller Graphic Novel, of course it's going to be violent.<br/><br/>Having liberal politics would not be fitting to the Spartan image either. The Spartans are supposed to be the definition of war and glory, and the basic message of the Battle of Thermopylae is one of war and sacrifice. The movie maintains a basic good/evil battle fitting for the idea of an epic. It's nice to see something without the usual ""war is hell"" politics for a change. I may not agree with it, but it works for the movie as a whole.<br/><br/>Lastly, why on earth would anyone expect historical accuracy? You see the preview, and it says it's based on a graphic novel, you see it's exaggerated color scheme, you see ancient warriors and kings who look like they should be on the cover of some fantasy hair metal album, and you see the Persians have a giant. People should be able to figure out right off the bat that this movie is not intended to be historically correct. All the criticisms stem from people expecting this movie to be something it was never intended to be.<br/><br/>If you want another dull and boring war epic telling you that war is hell, puke when you see blood, and have a cow at historical inaccuracy, don't see this movie. It's not for you and wasn't intended for you. But if you love Miller's visual style and stylization, want some good and unique action, and want to see a grand story of glory in battle, Go out and watch this movie right now."

","The Battle of Thermoplyae, 300 characterizes the Spartans who fought there. When studying Greek history it is often too easy to focus only on ""the philosophers and boy lovers,"" Athens, and its intellectual achievements, while labeling Sparta as a barbarous, war-mongering city-state. 300 shows Thermoplyae in all its gruesomeness, but it too shows a Sparta otherwise overlooked; the politics of its council, the corruption, the adherence to the will of the Gods.<br/><br/>As portrayed, the battle is not necessarily historically accurate. However, since it is recounted by a survivor, it must be viewed as a work of propaganda to galvanize Greece. The bigger than life elephants are what one would imagine while listening to the stories of how Leonidas and his 300 Spartans held off the armies of Persia.<br/><br/>The cinematography is amazing. Colors are dulled for an older feel. Shadows that were such a success in Sin City are again used. Most noticeable are slow motion fight scenes. A Spartan charges, normal speed, reaches the Persian, a slow motion kill. The juxtaposition of slow to fast emphasizes the speed of the battle, while pausing to show the severed limbs.<br/><br/>If war movies or history is your interest this film is a must see."

","I just came back from the movie and ""300"" by far lived up to my highest of expectations. I usually hate going to the cinemas because of the ignorant people who refuse to be quiet during the movie, but that was surprisingly not an issue this time. This is because ""300"" was just so astonishing that nobody wanted to miss one second, and the filled theater was really quiet for such an action-packed film.<br/><br/>Everything about this movie stands out and I really think it has set a new standard for how ancient myths, legends or (in this case) classical history should be presented on the big screen. The acting was top notch, the sound was superb and above all, the visual effects and cinematography were breathtaking. If you enjoy watching film-making at its best, then I assure you that this is a must-see. ""This is SPARTA !!!"""

","When I saw this movie, only one word came to mind: MIND-BLOWING. Every scene was shot to PERFECTION. The beautifully artistic and stylistic CGI environment looks completely Fantastic. Each scene was candy for the eyes. I could not look away for fear I might miss something SPECTACULAR. The music was very WELL-DONE and WELL-TIMED. The acting (although not amazing) was FINE.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie is extremely intense--an EPIC MYTHOLOGICAL film that completely captures the heroism and valor of ancient Greece with a Sin City-type twist to it. If you expect an action-filled blood fest with hot women and great CGI (not to mention the BEST action sequences I have EVER seen before--not even exaggerating), you will not be disappointed. This movie makes Gladiator and Troy look like Barney. Basically, this movie delivers...<br/><br/>Edited 3-18-07: By the way, many people complain that the dialogue is very poor. I have seen this movie twice now. The first time, it did not bother me much; the second time, it did not bother me much. The dialogue truly is not that bad. There are a few not-so-good lines, but they are very few and hurt the movie very little (if at all): ""Give them nothing! But take from them everything!"" And there are some very great lines (not yet listed in the ""memorable quotes"" section) that really touched my heart: ""'Good-bye, my love.' He doesn't say it.

","So...I just saw 300. Now, I'm betting that you will come up with many valid criticisms of it: they do enhance the Persian army to a ridiculous size when it's not really necessary; they do add this subplot with the queen which is not really necessary and they make Xerxes have a really strange voice for unknown reasons. But I don't care. Those 2 hours were 2 of the most fun I have had in a cinema since I can remember. Leonidas was perfect, they captured the look of the graphic novel perfectly and the battle scenes were simply incredible. And, oh yeah, it's a true story. It's not a film that will win any awards, but it is was certainly a true cinematic experience."

","I was wonderfound sitting in a theatre on Friday night with 1000 people. When the Legendary Pictures symbol came up then the ""300"" title flashed across the screen in bold red... people cheered, teenagers yelled, and a tear formed in my eye. This is what movies at a theatre is all about. Someone in the crowd yelled ""Tonight we dine in hell..."" The crowd laughed and cheered. And it is true... this film ""Won the Crowd."" As so beautifully spoken in ""Gadiator."" The colors were so rich I was on sensory overload... then Gerard Butler appeared on screen. What a force of nature... charming, dangerous, powerful... but there was humanity in his eyes even though he looked like Hercules; a superhero. He cried, ""This is Sparta!!!!"" and the whole crowd cheered and I saw many teenagers giving each other high fives. This movie is not just entertainment... it is an experience; must be seen with a large crowd. Anybody who has played organized football, any contact sport, or served in the military will feel like one on Leonidas's men... Who would not die for that man? This is no historical epic but something entirely new... a Historical fantasy, horror, western, Passion film. Leonidas sacrificed himself for his people and the concept of freedom, albeit in Spartan society freedom for the few but the concept spread. Leondidas is like a Christ of Freedom. Mr. Butler was elemental... he roared like a lion and growled so small in tender scenes he could not have done it better. Leonidas stands with Douglas's Sparticus, Crowe's Maximus, and Gibson's William Wallace as one of the true heroes of sword movies. Much can be said for the supporters... David Winham (Spelling, sorry) was magnificent... Gorga was so strong, Xerxes was like a vision of beauty and evil. When you go see this film, forget all you know and have seen and enjoy it... appreciate the time these men and women put into their bodies, the stunts, the SGI, and Zack Synder's amazing craft of storytelling... who had the skill and humbleness to let Miller's vision come to life almost effortlessly. And to Mr. Miller: Please write more stuff for films, we need you. Do not compare this to Gladiator and Braveheart... it is a different animal all together. And lastly I want more! Make this a trilogy starring David Winham and bring in Leonidas's son. There is so much more to the war the Greeks and Persians fought so many years ago... nuff said."

Ridiculously ripped men running around bashing each other's heads in and stabbing the living daylights out of each other. It was like a realistic superhero movie. This stuff could actually happen---OK not totally, but pretty much it did.<br/><br/>The filming of this feature was rockin'. I loved the weird hugh that saturated the film and the blood splatters were actually beautifully artistic. I can't explain it. But it was ten times better than the filming of Sky Captain, and not as colorfully annoying as Sin City (in my opinion it was horrible). The actors were totally disciplined for this one. I mean... They must have had a five to ten hour work out each day. They were sick. <br/><br/>The one part they could have done without was that Smiggel-esk character who was over done. But alas, it served its purpose. Somehow this movie made me want to work out in a barn and become a hulking soldier who storms into combat. This is saying a lot, especially seeing my views are for peace and not war and violence. So rock on with this movie!"
"whyallthehate","10","2","8","9 March 2007"," Extremely stylized movie, ignore the people crying racism
","I just went to an early show of this and I was absolutely blown away. Unlike other movies like Lord of the Rings or Gladiator where it's all about the fast action to the point where you can barely see wtf is happening, this movie takes a very stylized approach to all fight scenes. This is not to say that it doesn't have the adrenaline pumping full throttle fight scenes, it's just used intertwined with slow motion brutalities.<br/><br/>I laugh at the people who cry racism, at no point did this movie ever pretend to be historically accurate and at no point did it say all Persians were evil or anything.<br/><br/>Definitely recommend seeing it if you're expecting a high action over the top movie, wouldn't recommend it if you're a bleeding heart who likes to cry racism at every chance based on false assumptions and stupidity."
"Rasputins_Heir","10","2","8","9 March 2007"," outlandish, absurd, spectacular
","I had the opportunity to see a midnight showing of 300 last night. When I think the classic (and stereotypical) testosterone-fueled, tough guy action movie characters of our generation, I think of Arnold Schwarzenegger and Jesse Ventura in Predator, the Colonial Marines from Aliens, Russell Crowe's Maximus in Gladiator, or Mel Gibson as William Wallace in Braveheart. The Spartans in this movie, especially King Leonidus, make them all look like boy scouts.<br/><br/>300 is to historical epics what Snakes on a Plane is to action-comedies. As you enter the theater, you'll need to check any expectations of realism at the door. Everything about this movie is completely, ridiculously over the top. The good guys, King Leonidas and his Spartans are tough, noble and almost stupidly brave. The bad guys, Xerxes and the Persians are nasty, evil, decadent and overwhelmingly numerous. Both sides are arrogant in the extreme, which sets a perfect tone for the conflict.<br/><br/>Early in the movie a Persian messenger comes to Leonidas asking for ""earth and water"" as a token of Sparta's submission to the Persian Empire. Leonidas ushers him to a large open well, telling him he'll find plenty of earth and water at the bottom just before kicking him in. Thusly provoked, the vast Persian army marches upon Sparta to force it's submission. Due to a religious holiday the corrupt Spartan mystics forbid open war with Persia, so Leonidas takes his 300 Spartans to ""The Hot Gates"", a small gap between the sea and mountains through which any army entering Sparta would need to pass. With only a narrow passage to defend, the Spartans have no risk of being surrounded or flanked, which makes the Persians' superior numbers much less of an advantage. Both in the movie and in the history books, this worked perfectly. The Spartans had their 300 as well as a few thousand other Greek conscripts. Most historians believe the Persian army consisted of something between 300,000 and a million troops. What is certain is that the Persians had what was, at the time, the largest army in history.<br/><br/>The battle scenes are an absolute spectacle. When the Spartans are in formation they really seem like they're a single, vicious machine chewing up Persians by about a dozen at a time. The fight choreography is extremely convincing, they look like they've been trained for this their whole lives. When they break formation and start fighting individual Persians, slow motion is briskly employed with each new opponent. A shot will start in normal speed with Leonidas or another Spartan run towards a Persian soldier, then suddenly the speed slows just as he lands a killing blow, giving the audience a lovingly focused look at the bloody blade cutting through them. This is all set to heavy electric guitar, which works better than you'd think.<br/><br/>The Persian soldiers include the throngs off identical foot soldiers sent at first, then Xerxes' elite guard, The Immortals, and several different types of warriors from all over Asia. They also brought along a rhino, a few elephants and a hulking inhuman berserker. There are scenes of Xerxes' failed generals being executed where we see the executioner is an obese, barely-human-looking thing, with his forearms removed and replaced with ax blades. Again, if you're wanting historical accuracy, look elsewhere. We're also treated to a scene in Xerxes' private tent, full of barely-dressed multi-ethnic courtesans who range from stunningly gorgeous to repulsively mutilated. Xerxes himself is an odd character, extremely tall and dressed in what looks like solid gold bondage gear. His clearly digitally-enhanced voice imposes both power and seduction as he tries to bribe Leonidus into surrendering.<br/><br/>During all of this there's a lot of political shuffling going on back in Sparta showing the debate of whether or not to send the entire army to fight the Persians or not. This results in some interesting scenes, but it pretty much serves as an occasional break for the audience. The battle scenes are the real point of this movie, even more so than most movies of this kind Shot almost entirely on green screen sets, little besides the actors is real at all. It's easy to forget as the digital environments look flawless. I can't remember ever seeing a film that used such lavish colors. Nearly every frame of the movie could be frozen and hung on a wall. Some frames could be hung in a gallery. I'll go ahead and predict several Academy Award nominations for art direction, costumes, makeup, Cinematography, etc. It's certainly not winning any awards for writing, acting, etc. but when a movie is this much fun, who cares?"

","This movie was amazing. The action scenes were among the best I've ever seen in film, as they actually let you see the action going on instead of that jump cut close-up garbage that is so prevalent these days. Now I've seen a lot of people complaining that the film's not historically accurate and what not and that's because some people missed a crucial point: This is an exaggeration of the Battle of Thermopylae. It nowhere claims to be a historical retelling, it is an adaptation of a graphic novel that is in itself an exaggeration of a legend based on historical fact.<br/><br/>Xerxes isn't gay, he's portrayed as a king who thought himself above the laws of man. He's decadent, arrogant, and a little unstable, which doesn't contradict the very limited historical resources available on Xerxes. The idea was to show that he believed himself to have no moral standard of his own.<br/><br/>Ephialtes is a twisted man on the inside, and so Miller made him appear that way on the outside as well. I don't think there's any place where anyone says ""This is what he really looked like!"" There are giants and demons, but again, we have to imagine that this is presented as one Spartan's STORY of what happened. And as such, details would be exaggerated for dramatic purposes. So perhaps there were no giants historically, but maybe there were simply large, foreign looking men. To the Spartans, perhaps they seemed monstrous. The same is true with the size of the animals, or the faces of the immortals.<br/><br/>This is the battle through the lens of storytelling. It's exaggerated, it's biased towards the Spartans, as it's a Spartan relaying the story. It never in the context of the film, nor in the marketing for the film, nor in the comic, claims to be an accurate portrayal of what REALLY happened.<br/><br/>And it's a better movie as a result."

"TheNabOwnzz","3","2","9","19 July 2018"," Messy, ugly & ultimately pointless
","While 300's concept of the famous historical final stand of the greeks against the Persians might be an interesting premise, the actual cinematic quality of the picture itself is quite low.<br/><br/>It is admirable how the film approaches masculinity in this modern age, because its main characters ( Especially Leonidas ) are not to be trifled with and are shown to be nobody's plaything. However, the constant shots of these precisely trained sixpack abs starts to become quite ridiculous, as if we were watching a couple of fitness freaks hit the gym instead of acting in a movie. There is no real story or character development, and we are not even given a backstory about the Greeks & the Persians and why they are enemies or what they stand for, other than that Xerxes is a 'Tyrant', but that clich√© is just lazy writing. Leonidas decides to march against the thousands of Persians with just 300 men, and no real reason is given for this weird course of action.<br/><br/>While Gerard Butler is somewhat charismatic, he is completely miscast as Leonidas, as his mannerisms are seemingly much too modern. Take his first conversation with Xerxes for example, and his weird 'Unable to knee' excuse. Michael Fassbender and David Wenham are also great actors in the cast, but are not given the chance to shine due to the fact that this movie doesn't seem to have a plot.<br/><br/>The cinematographer, Larry Fong, creates this weird grainy kind of visual look for the picture, and constantly uses artificial backdrops and artificial lighting in order to visualize his scenes. His cinematography doesn't use color variation. It is just one bland mess of white, grey & black, which makes me wonder why it is filmed in color at all, because it isn't being used. It's obvious it is a poor attempt at being original, but every shot is just so ugly and artificial that it becomes a poor joke to look at, and this is not just the case in a single scene but in EVERY SINGLE ONE. Even one indoor scene with Leonidas's wife being accused of something by Theron has the weirdest and unnatural kind of lighting ever seen in film. The result is the visuals of this film are extremely artificial, plastic & fake looking, and nowhere in the picture does this make me believe that what is happening here feels like an actual world. Instead, it feels mostly cartoonish in its visuals.<br/><br/>There is no character development to speak of, since every character remains the same. I don't think there is a single character that has clearly defined characteristics other than most of the male's masculinity, so there is really no one to care about, since we know nothing of the characters and since we are not given the feeling that they could be real. Snyder's direction is highly stylized but once again has little substance in the end. Slow motion is generally a great tool to use in creating suspense before something happens or as a kind of 'Reflection' for a character so we can better sense their inner struggles at a certain point. However, the use of slow motion in 300 is completely pointless, as it is used in the battles themselves in an on and off kind of way, which no doubt looks very 'cool' to most milennials, but in the end does not serve a purpose. There is a lot of blood in these scenes, most of which looks extremely fake and cartoon like.<br/><br/>Ultimately this means that 300 is a mess. There is no character development, no lore or backstory, no real narrative structure, poor writing with mostly mediocre dialogue, actors who are not used to the best of their abilities, no morality or metaphors, and all the while this is accompanied by the most abyssmal looking artificial cinematography, as if we were watching some kind of kids cartoon."

I found the ""300"" to be visually stunning, like one big CGI/Pulp Painting in motion, derive ""Frank Miller""'s Sin City style, but it failed in depicting the ""Persians"" and in fact it is an insult to the Persian History because they were portrayed as this evil dark people as if you are watching ""The Lord of the Rings"". What makes Greeks superior to Persians is like saying White people are superior to Black people or any other culture; which goes to show you how stupid and sick are the people who write such crap, people like Frank Miller and those to make such a film in a time when the middle east is already has a negative image as the center of terror.

Greek soldiers were just not attacking but were waiting to be attacked. all funny and awful!! rest my comment it done but i need more lines. <br/><br/>The movie is abt sparta ;) Sparta (Doric: Œ£œÄŒ¨œÅœÑŒ± Sp√°rta, Attic: Œ£œÄŒ¨œÅœÑŒ∑ Sp√°rtƒì) is a city in southern Greece. In antiquity it was a Dorian Greek military state, originally centered in Laconia. As a city-state devoted to military training, Sparta possessed the most formidable army in the Greek world. Its defeat of rival power Athens in the Peloponnesian war asserted Spartan hegemony over Ancient Greece, and by overpowering both the Athenian and Persian Empires, Sparta regarded itself as the natural protector of Greece. Laconia or Lacedaemon was the name of the wider city-state centered at the city of Sparta, though the name ""Sparta"" is now used for both. The Spartan Kings were believed to be the direct descendants of Heracles.<br/><br/>The city of Sparta lies at the southern end of the central Laconian plain, on the right bank of the river Evrotas. The site was strategically located; guarded from three sides by mountains and controlling the routes by which invading armies could penetrate Laconia and the southern Peloponnesus via the Langhda Pass over Mt Taygetus. At the same time, its distance from the sea¬óSparta is 27 miles from its seaport, Gythium¬ómade it difficult to blockade. That should do it."
"sixtwentysix","7","2","9","16 March 2007"," Worth watching but poor acting and directing foil what could have been a classic war movie
","Clearly, this film is not for everyone. The film looks utterly fantastic, but the reality is, this is a failed attempt at a breakthrough film. The battle scenes are magnificent; in fact I can't remember seeing a more interesting film about ancient war. Now before the fan boys pile on, ask yourself honestly about the poor acting, horrible directing and quite possibility the worst voice over ever heard in a movie and why it really put a damper on the party for some. I know people will disagree and say that it was supposed to be over the top and that is fine, but I think even less dialogue would have improved this film. Everything was drilled home in 50 point block letters and subtlety was completely abandoned. People in the Imax I saw this film with were eating up the endless catchphrases. Well, that's showbiz... I guess.<br/><br/>As a comic book movie, this was mission accomplished. Great villains, amazing action sequences that stylistically were like a dance and really, really bloody battles make this an action film for fans of the genre. And these elements reach right in and pull this movie out of the fire. And while I was not bothered by the no-name cast, the direction of these actors was bordering on criminal behavior. The over use of slow motion and not mixing up the technique really marred the overall product that was provided to the viewer. It really started to seem like a music video. Don't get me wrong, there were some amazing movie moments in this film, but the eye rolling at the ham fisted words really detracted from the movie as an overall piece of art it could have been. If Zack Snyder is really going to direct Alan Moore's the Watchmen, he needs to go and look up the words subtle and substance before he utters ""action"" even the first time during filming.<br/><br/>Much has been said about if Synder was trying to slip a conservative message into the film and a lot of things could be read or misread from this. Believe me, he wasn't that smooth. In my opinion it was a not so subtle way of portraying the hawk-like nature of the Spartan culture is ultimately what was being conveyed and not a slipped jab to eastern Asian culture as some have implied. But take what you will from the ""they ask you to stand and I ask you kneel"" remarks of Xerxes. That is the rhetoric of rulers and warriors and it's not always pretty. A lot of items in this film can have modern day parallels drawn. But ultimately it is just a movie. Relax. Followers of Islam should relax, Islam didn't even exist during this time.<br/><br/>I guess for me personally, the worst part about this film is how much potential was wasted. This is an amazing legend that could have really been translated into something we would remember for a long time, had some actor directing skill and improved dialogue, this could have been a masterpiece. I love and hate this film at the same time."
"adudewhoiscool","10","2","9","15 March 2007"," A brilliant film that will not insult Frank Miller's original work.
","""300"" is a marvelous, visually stunning film that needs to be viewed as soon as possible. The intensity will get your blood pumping. The visuals will keep you in awe. The soundtrack is just as epic as it should be. Everything about this film should keep you on the edge of your seat wanting to cheer on the Spartans for victory. Those familiar with Frank Miller's graphic novel should breathe a huge sigh of relief because it is not at all an insult to the original story.<br/><br/>""300"" is based on the graphic novel written by Frank Miller. In 480 BC, the Xerxes, the Persian King, sends an army to conquer Greece. The Greek city of Sparta decides to take action by sending 300 of their soldiers to meet thousands of Persians at Thermopylae. For any normal person this would be considered a mismatch and an instant suicide mission, but not to Leonidas and his Spartan men. Can few stand against many? Find out in this epic showdown.<br/><br/>The intensity of ""300"" will get any persons blood and heart pumping. The action scenes will have you wanting to cheer aloud for the Spartan army. There are so much limbs and heads chopped up, with lots of blood squirted out similar to his ""re-imaging"" of ""Dawn of the Dead,"" that you cannot help but feel powered and manly. To get an idea of how intense this film is, you must first picture the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy and the film, ""Gladiator,"" having a child. ""300"" is that child injected with steroids. By the end of the film, you will immediately want to see it again.<br/><br/>Another thing that will keep your heart pumping is the visuals. Words cannot describe how awesome they are. Because of them shooting the film in 90% blue screen and 10% green screen, Zack Snyder really gave the film a real unique look to it. Instead of making it look like another ""Lord of the Rings"" epic or something similar to the typical blockbuster of today, Zack Snyder made the film look as close to the graphic novel as he could. At times, it was hard to tell if the movie was an actual movie or just a moving painting. It would be impossible to make it look closer to Frank Miller's graphic novel then how Snyder showed it.<br/><br/>As visually stunning as this movie was, you cannot have a movie of this kind be as cool without the great soundtrack. As this reviewer has mentioned in his ""Eragon"" review, a good epic fantasy movie has to have an equally great film score in order to grip you into the story as if it was a supporting character. Tyler Bates, who also collaborated with Zack in the ""re-imagining"" of ""Dawn of the Dead,"" created an amazing musical score that is complete with a 250 or more person chorus. In addition, occasionally during the battle sequences you would hear a heavy metal sounding guitar. Could you imagine the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy with metal played in the middle of the battle scenes?<br/><br/>Besides the music, the visuals, and overall intensity of the film, the acting was also phenomenal. Gerard Butler should be moving up fairly soon to an A-list actor after this film because his performance as King Leonidas was exceptional. Many of the women in the audience were cheering because Lena Headey's Queen Gorgo gave a performance that screamed ""girl power."" Rodrigo Santoro gave an amazing performance as the villain, Xerxes. Dominic West gave a performance as the Spartan traitor, Theron. Both West and Santoro were the antagonists that you will love to hate. David Wenham was great as not only a narrator but also a member of the Spartan army, Dilios. Everyone gave exceptional performances.<br/><br/>For those of you who are fans of the graphic novel, as this reviewer is, you should not be disappointed. By re-reading the graphic novel, this reviewer can safely say that Zack Snyder did nothing to insult Frank Miller's original vision. Not only does the film look exactly like book, but there are many instances where the dialog is the same too. There are some minor points left out but it was not at all a distraction. Snyder also added some things to the original story, including a whole subplot that gave a crucial character more screen time, which should not distract the viewer familiar with Frank Miller's original story. If you are one of those that believes that Snyder insulted Frank Miller's creation, you should remember that Frank Miller was the producer and consultant and, because of that, it was Miller who gave Snyder permission to use what was showing on the screen.<br/><br/>Overall, if you love epics or action flicks, you will love this film. Men will crave this film because it is a very testosterone filled film. Women will enjoy all of the actors being so buff and half-naked. Frank Miller fans will also love this. The only ones who should not view this film are those under the age of 14 or 15 because not only are there many graphics fights, which made the battles in the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy seem harmless, but also lots of sexual content and nudity."

","It is a proved scholarly fact that the Persian Empire in 480 B.C was the most magnificent and civilized empire. Established by the Cyrus the great, the writer of the first human right declaration, Persians ruled over significant portions of Greater Iran, the east modern Afghanistan and beyond into central Asia; in the north and west all of Asia Minor (modern Turkey), the upper Balkans peninsula (Thrace), and most of the Black Sea coastal regions; in the west and southwest the territories of modern Iraq, northern Saudi-Arabia, Jordan, Israel, Lebanon, Syria, all significant population centers of ancient Egypt and as far west as portions of Libya. Having twenty nations under control, encompassing approximately 7.5 million square kilometers, unquestionably the Achaemenid Empire was territorially the largest empire of classical antiquity.<br/><br/>Based on the Zoroastrian doctrine, it was the strong emphasis on honesty and integrity that gave the ancient Persians credibility to rule the world, even in the eyes of the people belonging to the conquered nations (Herodotus, mid 5th century B.C). Truth for the sake of truth, was the universal motto and the very core of the Persian culture that was followed not only by the great kings, but even the ordinary Persians made it a point to adhere to this code of conduct.<br/><br/>We did not expect Warner Bros. Picture company, as one of the world's largest producers of film and television entertainment to ignore the proved obvious historical facts, and damage its own reputation by showing the Persian army at the battle of Thermopylae as some monstrous savages, and thus create an atmosphere of public mistrust in its content, and hurt the national pride of the millions of Persians while doing so.<br/><br/>While announcing our disgust at such a heresy, we demand an immediate historical review and quick apology from the responsible people.<br/><br/>http://www.petitiononline.com/wpci96c/petition.html"
"bensonmum2","7","2","9","10 March 2007"," ""Give them nothing! But take from them everything! ""
","It seems there are only two or three movie releases each year that get me excited. 300 just happened to be one of those movies. Overall, while I enjoyed 300, it wasn't quite the movie I had hoped for. Part of the reason could be that I had over-hyped it in my mind to the point where no movie could live up to that lofty of an expectation. However, with a rating of 7/10, it should be obvious that there was plenty here for me to enjoy.<br/><br/>To begin, the ""look"" of the film is phenomenal. The stylized visuals perfectly suit 300's graphic novel origins. The action scenes are breathtaking. There is enough slicing and dicing to make any action fan happy. Finally, I found the acting surprisingly good. Gerard Butler may get most of the notice, but most everyone gave a convincing and solid performance. I was especially impressed with Lena Headey as Queen Gorgo. She just seemed so real and natural.<br/><br/>But where 300 falters, in my opinion, is in its extremes. Director Zack Snyder walks a fine line between these extremes and, for the most part, does so successfully. However, moments when historical accuracy bubble to the surface tend to put a drag on the film. Conversely, scenes and images that take 300 into the realm of fantasy and take it too far from its historical roots become all but absurd. It may be a small complaint to some, but this keeps me from rating 300 any higher."

","This movie is so remarkable that I registered with IMDb just to praise its brilliance. I won't add to the discussion by summary or repartee; however, I will share an observation about the wide variance in user comments.<br/><br/>Admirers of this film understand the mythos and ideals it embodies. Critics, however, point to the trite speeches and apparent mindless acting and, worse yet, its inaccuracy--saying it ""could have been better"" or that the director overreached. Moreover, most comment upon the physique of the actors, saying how they idealize some homo-erotic vision. A.O. Scott of the NYC based his entire review on this¬ósoldiers are sexy.<br/><br/>To this latter group I can only say: you have sadly become so jaded by a passionless existence that you can no longer even fantasize about that which stirs the soul.<br/><br/>It's only a movie, yes, but its magnificence is in how it captures passion. History is replete with examples of such devotion. We don't remember the hard facts, but we feel the reverberations of famous actions and understand them through abstraction and ideals. <br/><br/>In short, we communicate the sublime through myth¬óand 300 is both mythic and sublime. However, some people are so divorced from authentic feeling that it doesn't matter how 300 was made. The point would be inexorably lost."

Fortunately, it didn't let me down at all. Every scene was at least extraordinary from every aspect. The cinematography so as the film editing were magnificent. I found the direction of Zack Snyder very original and clever.Furthermore, the casting was very good, especially Gerard Butler as Leonidas, with his fierce look and his angry voice. I can't thing of better match for this role. One other fact that surprised me was the accuracy of the events that occurred in that particular battle hundreds of years ago(except of course the Persian monsters that are only depicted in Frank Miller's ""300"" but serve the purpose of the film very well),something that was absent in similar films concerning ancient Greece like ""Troy"". The only ""minus"" of the movie was the translation of ""Thermopylae"" to ""Hotgates"". Overall, the movie had the perfect amount of action, visual effects and sentiment and I definitely think it's a must-see.I believe it is a very good fact that Hollywood (through Frank Miller's graphic novel) honored the ancient Greek civilization and history with this great film"

","When I first heard of this movie and it was based on the graphic novel by Frank Miller, I was half expecting another Braveheart, and in regard to the basic storyline and battle scenes that's what I got, a king fighting for his people's freedom against a greedy tyrant and memorable battle scenes, and the demonizing of the invaders, in this case the Persians. The Spartan society was on the whole rather harsh and cruel, unsurprising considering its warrior status designed to weed out the weak, and a lot of aspects of this were omitted. However Frank Miller and Zack Synder have said this movie never meant to be historically correct, it was essentially a propaganda story being told by a survivor from Thermopylae to rally the Greek army before going into battle. But this movie wasn't as inaccurate as I thought it would be, it contained actual quotes from accounts taken at the time, some battle scene's were authentically accurate and the depiction of the back story of Leonidas was on the most part correct with the exception of the final rite of passage. So to summarize this movie was entertaining and inspirational."

","Typically I detest the kind of over-stylized action favored by Hollywood post-'The Matrix', but Zack Snyder's '300' looks like Frank Miller's graphic novel in motion, and all of its many (many) exaggerations ultimately serve it well.<br/><br/>The cast isn't given much to do save for look buff and scream, but Gerard Butler is fiercely charismatic as the warrior king Leonidas, and David Wenham gives as standout performance as his chronicler and fellow warrior, Dilios. Narrating the movie, Wenham adds a nice bit of wry panache to a film that otherwise takes itself very seriously despite its over the top style."

The acting and battle scenes are top notch too. You will care about the characters and will be engrossed in what happens to them.

If you're a girl... well, there are numerous men who don't wear that many clothes and make me feel terribly inadequate.<br/><br/>It's about those - unsung cinematic bad-guys - the Persians. They only decide to pick a fight with Greece (or, the Spartans, to be precise). But Sparta - despite boasting how they train their men to fight from birth - have suddenly discovered their sensitive side and refuse to fight. But, luckily, they have a semi-Scottish king (Gerard Butler) who is well up for a scrap - any time, anywhere. And so he leads 300 of his finest drinking buddies and promises them death or glory (or just death, but they don't seem to care).<br/><br/>What follows is nearly an hour and a half of some of the most stylish violence even committed to the silver screen.<br/><br/>And it's enormous fun - silly fun, but still enormous fun. The whole film (despite originally having some roots in an ancient Greek legend), was based on a comic book. If this did ever happen (and some say it did), I doubt the Spartans were faced with mutant rhinos, giants, ninjas, wizards and time-travelling cyborgs from the future (I might have made that last one up). However, this is an action film and who cares about factual accuracies here? This film is not realistic and it's not meant to be. It's meant to be fun. And it is. Enjoy... for SPARTA!"
"alugell","5","1","3","8 June 2014"," Fairly entertaining at best, but very flawed and hilariously over the top.
","So here we have 300, the story of the spartans who held the pass of something or other, male machismo blah, defending Sparta, more blah. Point is, if you've come for story, you should look elsewhere. 300 relies on one thing and one thing only, the brutal (and in some cases, entertaining) action sequences. However, even that is clogged down with slow-mo effects, which quickly become repetitive. Seeing Gerard Butler swinging his sword in an arc in slow motion loses its novelty pretty quickly.<br/><br/>If those were the only problems, I might be giving the film a 7, even an 8. However, there are some aspects of 300 that are flat out silly. To name but a few, Xerxes is given the voice of the anonymous witness protection program, there is a fat thing with swords for hands, and some kind of weird goat-man-thing at another point. You just can't take the film seriously, something that the film clearly wants you to do. <br/><br/>What really annoys me is that some people have actually ranked this alongside the far superior Gladiator (in some ways, doesn't surprise me- 300 does rip off a fair bit from the better film). I was going to give it a 6, but then I remembered that fade-to-black moment with the Mr T character near the beginning of the film. It's moments like this that drag 300 down. Anyone who rates this above 7 is apparently a fan of mindless, generic action sequences that are all style and no substance."

","Last Saturday, while I was hopping channels on TV, I found a historical film, which was just getting started. I stopped hopping and settled down comfortably in my leather armchair to watch, obviously an American, mentioned historical film which was called ""300"". The film, directed by Ridley Scott, and starring Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix, made on me, after 130 minutes, really good impression. Although I had expected numerous special effects from this Hollywood production, this surpassed my expectations. It tells the true story of an impossible to win battle of Termopile's where three thousands years ago met the army of Persia with three hundreds Spartans. The battle was very uneven on account of huge difference in manpower of both armies. Persia had 20 times more warriors than Spartans. Obviously this second army was defeated but they inflicted a huge debit for Persia. During the battle we can observe a lot of surprising and excellent unexpected twists in the plot. Of course, I noticed some fantastic and unreal scenes but in my opinion the director must have added them to enrich the film of something more. Moreover, it makes that film is more amazing and charming than we could imagine. The play of actress is also on very high level and they did a really good job. To sum up, I enjoy this film very much and I would like to recommend it everyone who likes strong action movie and well-constructed plot."

My expectations turned out not to be entirely wrong. I just discovered I really love that!<br/><br/>Also, I realised that it's not just dumb violence.

It also makes you understand why dying in battle is often considered an honour. There are few female characters in the movie; actually only one I can think of but she is strong and respectable. The way Leonidas's wife handles the situation really makes you sympathise with her. It was weirdly refreshing, an almost exclusively male cast. Don't ask me why... Maybe because you know there won't be any mushy I-don't-know-which-guy-to-pick love stories attached. <br/><br/>Of course there are all these cool one-liners like: ""I hope you had good breakfast, cause tonight we dine in Heeel!"" and ""Freedom isn't free at all. It comes with the highest cost. The cost of blood."" No, really, this movie was just very cool... and what's wrong with that? :-)"

","I'm all for violence and gore and even slow motion so why isn't this movie amazing you ask because the characters really and the believability.<br/><br/>So the story is taken from a graphic novel and that explains why they have basically monsters and guys with saws for arms. But still this isn't a fantasy the fact all these Spartans are half naked makes me wonder how did these guys not get slaughtered during these battles. So it is basically 300 of the best solders in all of Sparta go to fight the endless armies of Persia and how they hold them off for a while. A weird thing I noticed in the story is they preach about freedom yet the main character is still the king of Sparta and his men call him my lord it seemed more or less a power thing then freedom just Leonidas not wanting to bow down to anyone. It is still interesting action wise that the main story just blows over.<br/><br/>The visual design is awesome I remember arguing with people because they said it was animated and no I'm not sure what they did visually but I enjoyed that immensely.<br/><br/>The acting was OK there was no one I hated but there was also no outstanding performances. Then the writing they had some cheesy dialog but it also came up with everyones favorite line ""This is Sparta""! so it has that going for it.<br/><br/>This is directed by Zack Snyder and this is just his trademark slow motion yes the visual design but this still isn't his best film nor his worst.<br/><br/>Overall I say this is a high rental because there is still a lot of fun to be had here."

","""300"" is based on Frank Miller's graphic novel about the battle between the 300 men of Spartan versus a large number of Persians commanded by King Xerxes. The movie follows Miller's concept, both are not History lessons over a period, it's more concerned about how difficult it was the Battle of Thermopylae (occured in 480 BC.)<br/><br/>Zack Snyder's action film is pure action with everything that is required of a action film, has fights, blood, visual effects in which most of the film was made, heroic speeches made by King Leonidas (Gerard Butler), villainesque moments of Rodrigo Santoro and a voice-over that tells us about how powerful and magnificent the Spartans were. And this voice-over is the thing that was unnecessary and it almost drags the movie down for being a better movie than it is.<br/><br/>Throughout the film there's a narration that goes on and off without care, appearing in some moments and disappearing in another's made by David Wenham. My complaint is not against him but it goes against the ""300"" writers of included such an awful element into the film, something that to me was like saying that the viewers are dumb and they need to be told what's happening at all time. Example: ""See how wonderful the Spartans soldiers were. They were so brave"" and then you see the soldiers killing everybody"" or right in the first line ""When the boy was born, like all Spartans, he was inspected."" and we see a boy who would become Leonidas. We already have the image so why insisting on using a narrator with a awkward voice (specially if you watch the Portuguese dubbing version which is quite annoying and I watched the original version and it's a little better) that keeps saying ""Do you understand what you're seeing?""?. <br/><br/>I can't complain about the action sequences since most of the them were well made, with violent moments captured in slow-motion effects (but I felt bad when one of the soldiers was killed in front of his father, and it's a shocking scene considering that the film wasn't so much violent as I thought it would be); the drama involving King Leonidas wife and the senators back in Spartan was very good presented, balancing the tension of the battles with a conspiracy plan made by Dominic West character.<br/><br/>You might not believe that everybody had washboard abs back in 480 BC., or that King Xerxes was transported in a strange vehicle carried by thousands of slaves but this film is not a historical film and don't tend to be. It amazes me how so many people wanted that ""300"" were an accurate film, and worst it's so ridiculous that whole controversy about how the Persians were portrayed and that whole political thing. This film is beyond this, it's a good and exciting entertainment. No more, no less. 8/10"

","Maybe I am missing something, but I don't see what's so great this film. I found this film be boring, tedious and endless, with wooden performances and ugly visuals.<br/><br/>The plot was predictable and dumb, all was the typical story of ""the good guys and the bad guys"" with lots of clich√©s and annoying stereotypes (Some of them very offensive) <br/><br/>To summarize, ""300"" was boring, dumb and offensive. How it get so many good reviews it's beyond my comprehension. Personally, I hated it. It was a terrible film, a complete waste of time, without any single redeeming value."
"XChristopherHuynhX","9","1","3","14 November 2009"," One Of The Best Movies You Will Ever See
","The film 300 was by far one of the greatest action films that I have ever experienced. The film takes us to the city-state of Sparta which is threatened to be taken over by the massive army of the Persia. King of the Spartans, Leonidas, sets out with only a small army of 300 Spartans to confront the incoming threat of the Persian army led by their king, Xerxes. All events in this movie are said to be 90% accurate to the history of Sparta.<br/><br/>One aspect of the film that catches the viewer's eyes would be the amazing use of lighting. The film's lighting reinforces a sense of drama, suspense, and energy throughout the entire film. The action scenes would have a bright lighting whilst the dreary scenes had dim and very faint sense of light. The lighting would set the mood for the audience to experience that particular sense of emotion. I commend the director and crew for their choice of lighting in the film, especially during the scene where young Leonidas slays a giant wolf which in turn makes him king of the Spartans. The lighting of that particular scene showed transitions through the snowy area to the dark crack in the mountain.<br/><br/>Another aspect of the movie that would intrigue the audience was the great use of music and sound throughout the film. The sounds of metal clashing and dramatized blows will give the audience the sense of realism and actuality, while the music sets the tone for specific scenes whether they are drama, action, or suspense. Furthermore the use of the camera angles also amplified the tune of each scene, for instance, during the final battle the camera angles gave a specific sense of emotion to the viewer that was genuine and passionate.<br/><br/>In addition to the sounds, music, and lightning use of the film, the performance from the actors of the film was brilliant. The performers of the film showed such raw emotion that it would either bring a tear to your eyes or inspire you to give your support to the Spartans and to disregard the fact that they were highly outnumbered by the Persians. In my opinion the actors really did an amazing job with their dialogue which seemed appropriate during their respective scenes. The actor's performance will make the audience crave for more as the movie progresses through each scene.<br/><br/>Overall the film to my understanding was outstanding and I highly recommend it to those who have yet to see it. The film will teach the history of this once great civilization that a high school class most likely did not. 300 has taught those who have watched it a special lesson, that being that no matter the odds we should fight for what we believe in and strive through the adversity to achieve what we have been longing for."
"Suffie777","10","1","3","17 September 2009"," Wow. Great Movie
","This movie is just beautifully done. It comes across as a higher art form. It takes cinema to another level. It is pure and simple, the best of anything is simple and straightforward, despite all of the complicated work it takes to achieve those results. Gerard Butler is great in this, there is so much he says with just his eyes, and his movements and stance are just perfect for this character. It is good vs. evil and both are portrayed so well. Rodrigo Santoro is creepy yet mesmerizing as Xerxes. He has a snake-like quality to him when he asks Leonidas to kneel before him, as if he is not asking for much. Will you sell your freedom and values for gold? Reminded me of the serpent and Eve. I was surprised to learn that many of the catchy one liners or simple dialog in the movie were actually taken from Herodotus' account of the Battle of Thermopylae. Those were some of the best lines in the movie. There are SO MANY great lines from this movie that are memorable and worth repeating. The movie moved along nicely. The dialog was succinct, nothing was wasted, and they said much with very little, both in dialog and with the changes in location. Lena Heady was amazing as the queen. She showed her Spartan toughness in wielding a sword. It's an inspiring epic that doesn't plod along at an epic pace. The music was perfect. All the elements came together to make one great film. And all the beefcake walking around was pretty great too HA-OOH!"

I am telling you now, before you watch it - DON'T WATCH IT.<br/><br/>I have watched movies which were worse, but the only reason that this movie was better than them was because the general storyline was reasonably good.

"gus120970","8","1","3","11 July 2008"," Laconically bold
","300 is at once mesmerising and uncompromising. It is a stylistic and creative vision which will knowingly be hated by some, but is consistent throughout. The most controversial aspect of the film is its undeniable post-911 political overtones, explicit right up to the final declaration of the final battle between 'mysticism and tyranny', reason and freedom.<br/><br/>Those decrying it for its 'cheesy' dialog and 'lack of plot' absurdly miss the point. Many of the lines of dialog are lifted directly from Herodotus and Plutarch - blame ancient literature not Hollywood.<br/><br/>300 is hewn in the epic tradition, not so much the 1950s Charlton Heston kind, but in the original Greek poetic tradition, where the actions are heroic, the odds multiplied, the lessons stark and the characters dazzling. 300 faithfully follows the tradition on all of these counts. In addition, the cultural observations on Spartan life are in many cases supported by contemporary accounts, mostly external as Sparta had a strict non-literary tradition.<br/><br/>In historical reality, it was clear the Leonidas last stand was as much a tool of Greek national propaganda, in order to rouse the fragmented states to defy Xerxes' divide and conquer strategy.<br/><br/>It's ironic, perhaps intentional that a Scots actor, Gerard Butler is chosen to play the heroic role very similar to that of William Wallace in Braveheart, though Leonidas is much less the reluctant hero.<br/><br/>There has been considerable complaint about the lack of accuracy in the depiction of battle - a criticism also laid at Braveheart, which took massive license in that department. True, the stylised slo-mo orgy of violent action bears little relation to historical Spartan battle tactics, but uses no less hyperbole than the historian Herodotus himself (the 'Father of Lies') would have approved, had he the budget. History back then was a form of political art, not the preserve of accountants.<br/><br/>Viewing 300 through the prism of our current age does make it seem risible and clich√©d, but remove that layer of judgement and understand the integrity behind it and its a remarkable artefact."
"Anonymous_Maxine","7","1","3","7 March 2008"," Wow, I gotta start working out...
","I remember I almost fell out of my chair when I first saw the preview for 300, although it's taken me over a year since I bought the DVD to get around to watching it. Maybe because the bad reviews started trickling in. It's an adaptation of a graphic novel that I haven't read, but I'm told that that novel portrays a sort of heightened reality like what Leonidas describes as he is faced with seemingly insurmountable danger. The movie retains that level of hyper- reality and achieves a truly unique look and experience, but it may put off viewers interested in seeing something about the real story that the film is based on.<br/><br/>Of course, the true story of a hugely inferior band of Spartans holding out against the Persian army is so clouded in myth and legend that by now it's impossible to say for sure what really happened, but we can probably assume that a good majority of what happens in this movie didn't happen.<br/><br/>My knowledge of ancient Greek history is pretty limited, to say the least, but I was sort of expecting that the movie would tell something about what happened at the Battle of Thermopylae, where the courageous Spartans took their stand. Instead, it's sort of a bloated comic-book movie the sometimes doesn't seem to know whether it wants to emulate Troy, Lord of the Rings, or Harry Potter. There's a hunchback, there's magic, there are fully grown mountain dwarfs, a healthy dose of Hollywood/comic book machismo, and lots of spraying blood that reminded me of Tarantino's spectacularly disappointing Sin City. At least here it's not green.<br/><br/>In the movie's defense, it is definitely an astonishing visual achievement. It's true that the entire film is digital and you are never able to forget that, but it is definitely beautiful. The problem with digital backgrounds is that, apparently, they still haven't been able to make them look really realistic, especially battle scenes. I'm pretty sure they're making video games these days that look this good. <br/><br/>Half of the reason I wanted to see the movie was because of the tough talk in defiance of so- called authority, I always love that. Have you seen those ""Caution: This is Sparta"" signs? HILARIOUS. Anyway, there are a lot of classic moments and memorable lines in the movie (""There's no reason we can't be civil, is there?""), but after a while I found the over-the-top bravado a little cloying and just a little too, ah, over-the-top. There is no sense of realism, but then again the movie never tries for it. It is, basically, a romanticized and dramatized telling of a historical battle, just like what Braveheart is. But this movie is romanticized and dramatized in completely different ways. Ultimately, I think the result is better off intended for a slightly younger audience. <br/><br/>The performances in the film are wonderful, sometimes even astonishing. Gerard Butler as Leonidas is one of the most intense performances I've seen in a movie in some years, reminding me for some reason of the unbelievable level of intensity that Tom Cruise brought to Mission Impossible III. I noticed some IMDb user make the bizarre claim that Xerxes, played by Rodrigo Santoro, looked gay. Yes, Xerxes is quite a spectacle to behold, but effeminate? PLEASE. The only thing remotely effeminate about him were his eyebrows, but other than that he had the otherworldly presence that a living god should have. And besides, I have to say that I wonder about anyone who could hear his voice and think androgyny!<br/><br/>300 was a slight disappointment to me, but it definitely succeeds in what it sets out to do. It's a wild ride from start to finish and it never lets up, but I can't deny that there are some definite cheese moments, even for a film like this. It promises basically 100 minutes of exactly what you see in that almost weirdly impressive theatrical trailer, and if you can handle that for a couple hours, you're in for a treat. <br/><br/>Terrible date movie, though..."

","Before 2 months back I watched this movie and I liked Gerard Butler's acting. It was pretty good. As far as i am concerned this is a very good movie like acting as well as graphics both were handled pretty well, But I couldn't understand either it was based on historical events or evil based. Any way it is a very good entertainer. Director could have taken this movie as a Historical based one. If he had done like that, he would have won the Oscar..But one thing i can not accept from this movie, In the beginning the messenger who met the KING was killed. It is not acceptable thing and It is a coward activity.Even though these type of mistake's spread-ed over all of the the movie, graphics scenes and other ultimate things are remembered us to these type of small mistake. GREAT"
"khemass","Null","1","3","7 February 2008"," Impressive visual experience and good acting, but too much violence
","I give this one a score of 7.5 I think the film has both its strength and weakness. There are things that I really like and things that I hate.<br/><br/>Let's start with the bad points first. Too much violence on the battle scenes. A lot of slaughtering and blood spilling. I don't think that killing is something beautiful and some scenes in this movie are just like violent video games.No children should watch it. There is also unnecessary graphic sex and nakedness(the dance of the fortune teller and the sex between the king and the queen). The modern music does not go well with the ancient war story. Sometimes the background music is like noise to me.<br/><br/>However,I still have to say that this is a successful movie. Before I watch the film, I was thinking that if it turned out to be another brainless violent story, I wouldn't waste my time watching the whole thing. However, once the it started, I couldn't help keep watching it. The visual is really outstanding.Even that stupid dance of the fortune teller looks beautiful. The story is very simple and easy to follow. Nothing new in the plot or dialog, but that's not the main point of the film anyway. The reason behind the war sounds like good reason to me. I'm someone who minds a lot about the theme of movie. If a movie sends out terrible message to the audience, I would hate it so much no matter how well-made it it. (for example, Kill Bill,the film that says to everyone ""Revenge is sweet and killing is funny and entertaining"" Oh, how I hate that film!) Nevertheless, 300 does not have such a terrible theme. A country has the right to stand and protect its freedom and its land. I think it's fine for a king who fight for the independence of his own country. I think I can see brave people in this story. Men in the past need to be quite tough to survive and they have to fight to the last breath, I can understand that. So, the movie is a bit too violent, but not without good reason to support it. (Braveheart is one of such movies) Another thing is good acting. Gerald Butler makes me believe he's a good and brave king, and a great warrior. The queen is beautiful and elegant. She looks powerful when she talks. (Much better than the one who plays Helen in Troy) I like also, the actor who plays the Persian King.<br/><br/>The clothes that Persian people wear look weired but interesting, suited the film's overall style.<br/><br/>To conclude it, I can't say I hate this movie, but I just don't like some scenes that emphasize violence. It's an entertaining movie that keeps the audience stick to the seat from beginning to end.It's an excellent computer graphic art.The story is about some brave ancient people who fight to protect their independence and dignity, so it's not stupid, although there's nothing new in it.<br/><br/>Just don't take the children to see it, I insist."
"ClaytonDavis","6","1","3","6 October 2007"," A 300 for Effects, a 3 for Story
","This visual spectacle based on the graphic novel by Frank Miller is diverting as it beautiful. The film tells the story of King Leonidas and the 300 other Spartans who fought in the Battle of Thermopylae in 480 B.C. against over a million blood thirsty warriors. Gerard Butler best known for his lead portrayal in The Phantom of the Opera and his villainous turn in Dracula 2000 plays the headstrong king. Butler who has become a steady pretty face in Hollywood takes the action hero role to a new level.<br/><br/>With memorable one liners, Butler reinvents the clich√© hero like Sylvester Stallone, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Jean Claude Van Damme have in the past.. With poor dramatic moments, the role doesn't demand a well equipped character actor but abs, muscles, and strong facial features. The acting revelation if you could even call it, comes from ""King Leonidas'"" supportive wife, ""Queen Lorgo"" played exquisitely by the breakout star of the year, Lena Headey. She sizzles the screen with more than her looks but with striking pain-stricken ability to scene steal as if it were a crime. Her Queen is one of the stronger supportive wife turns to hit the screen in our new century.<br/><br/>Dominic West who is one of the stronger supporting actors working today plays cowardly villain role reminiscent of Joaquin Phoenix's ""Commodus"" in Gladiator. As brief as the role is, it leaves sour taste and gut wrenching imprints on the viewer post-film. The rest of the cast do what their roles demand but nothing out of the ordinary.<br/><br/>Visual effects, sound, and powerful cinematography are the brighter parts of the film. You can't help but admire the fascinating choice to shoot this film as a Michelangelo portrait with beautiful scenery and outstanding results. Engaging as the film is don't look for character depth or emotional connections as this is a watch and go picture. Be entertained as you can.<br/><br/>Grade: **¬Ω/****"

I usually also don't care for overtly artistic films, but again, this movie is just so cool I just didn't mind. For example, I couldn't stand Sin City because it lacked continuity and focus. This story isn't just about killing people, which while entertaining isn't enough to make a decent movie, its about what it takes to be a man. The characters in the movie are not afraid to die, they aren't afraid of failing, they are afraid of dishonor. It may sound really cheesy, but sadly this movie really inspires me. I have probably seen it more times than I would care to admit and would readily vote for this movie to be one of the most influential in its genre. <br/><br/>This movie is sweet."

Nothing about Greek culture (except perhaps clothes?), no historical value, even no romance (except some female nudity scenes?).<br/><br/>If you like hairy potter, you are one of the lord of the rings, or you are a fan of the MTV strutter (telling the story behind the screen and explaining the picture for idiots) then this movie might be for you.

I waited to see ""300"" on DVD instead of watching it in the theater, but enjoyed it nevertheless. It was a wild ride, and the battle scenes blew me away.<br/><br/>As to criticisms of the historical accuracy of the film, I believe the movie portrayed the battle ""sufficently"" for the type of film it was. Sure, many of elements of the battle were greatly exaggerated (such as the monster-ish Immortals), but the movie is primarily action-mythology. And while the battle should be portrayed accurately, as it was, it is in mythology that ancient stories really come to life, just as the ancients have done countless times in their own legends, and probably would've intended for us to do as well, for the sake of giving this amazing story a modern spin.<br/><br/>300 - A fun ride, and a worthy adaption of a great moment of heroism. 10/10"
"mhajs","5","1","3","27 August 2007"," Only the beauty of photography and visual effects out-stands in this film.
","Zack Snyder's second picture advances little or doesn't advance at all on the plot, has a poetic, but joyless and objective-less narrative. The movie, based on Frank Miller's graphic novel, emphasizes most of the time on the battle between spartans and persians and also on some spartans war habits. Therefore, the characters are not very well developed and the script is a little repetitive. There is even a sub-plot about despised women power on the senate, but without much context also. The only good quality of the film is its beauty, thanks to the great visual effects, nice photography and good performances (some of them, anyway). Too bad post-production modified Rodrigo Santoro's original voice, making his tone somewhat harder. I guess, in the end, it was necessary for the film."

"lucyiyoung","6","1","3","13 August 2007"," Disappointing
","The fighting was brilliant; the green screen completely suited to this graphic novel adaptation. But I still feel let down by this film. It felt like it was trying to be epic like Gladiator, but also true visually to the graphic novel. And, personally, I don't think you can do both. Although the visuals were stunning and detailed, they were done in a way that focused on the individuals rather than the landscape - which is fine, but this film is long and felt like it should be epic, and so all the lack of attention to the surroundings makes it hard to concentrate for this length of time. The story itself is OK, but it doesn't feel like Sparta is really under threat. This film should have been a lot better than it was, or should have been a lot shorter."
"doodygray","5","1","3","12 August 2007"," A bit of a let-down
","I've heard a lot of good things about this film. So when I finally got round to watching it, I was hugely disappointed. Perhaps this was because I watched it at 4 o'clock in the morning on a long-haul flight with no leg-room, and was therefore thoroughly disgruntled at the time, but looking back on it I really can't see why this film has been so highly praised. Even though I'm a socialist, I have little problem with the fairly blatant right-wing attitude of the film. I've always thought that I can still enjoy a film even if I don't agree with its message. But that wasn't why I didn't like this film.<br/><br/>The simple fact of the matter is that this film is dull. I was promised a mindlessly violent action film, which would be fine with me. But it just didn't excite me at all. It seemed that Zack Snyder had recently found the 'slow-mo' button on his camera, and went a bit overboard with the celebration. I'm all for inventive camera-work, but I'm pretty sure that over half the film was shot in slow-motion. And if I ever have to hear Gerard Butler utter the word 'SPAARRRRRTANS!' one more time I will certainly not be a happy bunny. I suppose the general consensus was that it would be a rousing battle cry for the first couple of times. When that number gets into 3 figures, it loses its impact.<br/><br/>Maybe one of the other areas where this film falls down is that I simply couldn't give a tinker's cuss about any of the characters. I really didn't care who dies and who survives, because I couldn't work out why the Spartans were the good guys and the Persians were the bad guys. The main dividing factor seemed to be that the Persians were more ugly and generally more deformed. Therefore they are evil. A wonderful moral message for everyone.<br/><br/>I can understand why people would like this film. It's just that I don't. To be honest, it bored me, despite its obvious popularity."

","I saw this thing for the first time last weekend- I had to watch it twice to see what I missed! Imagine my disappointment when I realized I had missed nothing... definitely not a historical film, and definitely not a drama. It is a collection of small scenes chopped together with really no story and sometimes no sense. It just proves that a comic can never be a film nor vice versa.The film has great visual effects and the sound quality is tremendous! Though as I said it was a pieced together string of scenes. I would like to see this done as a historical film like Braveheart or maybe even ""gasp"" Spartacus. 300's biggest plus is it's length. At less than 2 hours it is a great movie to watch at night and then put something else in the DVD player. One of my biggest gripes was the lack of Spartan armor- instead we get these guys running around almost naked in capes and helms.Nothing is perfect."
"Coalvayne","9","1","3","8 August 2007"," An epic that stands with the best of them.
","Little can be said against the premises of 300. 300 Spartan warriors fight to defend the freedom of their country against 20,000 enemy's in epic battles that only The Lord of the Rings films tops. This movie is based on the Frank Miller comic book, and so it isn't meant to be historically accurate. Having comic book roots and not taking on the history aspect of the film is why its well above Gladiator on my list.<br/><br/>In fact, I watched the two movies back to back. Gladiator felt like boring political debate compared to 300s highly stylized action sequences. The bulk of the movie having being shot on a blue screen makes the one of the most graphically pleasing movies ever made. The colors are gritty but vibrant and the key motions are smooth as silk. Mix in the incredible action scenes mixing slow motion and live speed fighting over 60 seconds of uncut footage and you begin to see how far we've come since Gladiator.<br/><br/>To often I hear the complaint ""The plot was boring"" as being the biggest downfall of the movie to which I simply ask, ""The main reason you went to see this movie is the plot?"". No. The draw is the action, and in that respect, the movie delivers 100 fold. The plot in fact isn't all the weak either. The exposing weakness of men lead to betrayal and corruption, small doses of politics mixed in with glory and honor, and a ending that gives a sense of accomplishment beyond most films today. Add in boobs for the men, and 300 pairs of exposed manly pecks (thats pectoral muscles, gentlemen) and chiseled for the ladies, and you have a movie you can sit down and watch with your significant other."
"zafirah_andikara","8","1","3","6 August 2007"," A very good film, but it is not very deep
","After seeing the previews of ""300"" I was determined to see the film. It was perhaps one of the most visually stunning films I have ever seen. However: There are various people who will loathe this film for many different reasons.<br/><br/>1) History buffs I admit that I am a large fan of history. Seems strange to say, but I love history. This film is not historical. The Spartans are given off as noble warriors. They seemed to have a democracy, great morals, and a hatred of slavery. Those who know anything about Sparta would laugh at this depiction. Spartans were known for their slaves and their cruelty, and they were far more a monarchy than a democracy. As well, many things are left out of the movie which makes it hard to understand for those who do NOT know history well, the foremost being that the Persian army was indeed Persian, not Hellish. Other things include the lack of explanation for why the Persians attacked, the truth about the Ephors, etc. etc.<br/><br/>2) People who enjoy great plots If anyone goes to this movie expecting an excellent plot, they are in trouble. The plot of this movie was hardly different from any other epic film. There was a hero. He had a lover. He fought for a cause. He was valiant. This plot hardly differs, in fact it may be a little bit worse.<br/><br/>3) People who want to see a great script, and actors convey the script well The actors were alright. Butler and Wenham did a fairly decent job in their roles. But most of the lines were clich√©d action lines, speaking of bravery, honor etc. Nothing really deep.<br/><br/>Now...if you are going to a movie to see excellent visuals, see this movie. It was quite artfully done. Many lines were said with a great passion that draws you in.<br/><br/>Zack Snyder went to prove that all you really need to entertain people are great fight sequences, and amazing visual effects. This movie has these simple factors in spades.<br/><br/>So- for those in need of ""eye candy"" you have a friend in ""300""."
"moviemaniac008","9","1","3","1 August 2007"," A pretty decent movie
","As I watched 300, I learned a valuable lesson that I will put to use on every movie that I'll watch: never have too much expectations towards a movie. I had so much expectations for this movie that they weren't all achieved. But I did like the battle sequences, only I found some unrealistic and very gory. But that's what I liked best in this movie. But what somehow bored me to death was how characters would speak for what seemed hours and hours and hours. Sure, some of that talking is important, but half of it isn't. The actors did a very good job, and I liked this movie. Though if they could have taken about 10 minutes off the unnecessary talking, it would have been perfect!"
"ngamarra3689","9","1","3","1 August 2007"," Good Movie
","I truly though that 300 delivered an almost all levels and I think paid a good homage to Frank Miller's style while still remaining relatively historically accurate (at least in comparison to some movies Saliere hating Mozart in Amadaeus being entirely fake anyone?). I seriously loved the visuals and for anyone who has seen the graphic novel know that almost every illustration and panel seemed to line up with the movie in a way that reflects books (or graphic novels for that matter) better than some (Eragon anyone?). Yes the freedom theme in the movie is downplayed by the fact that Greek Men had 7 or 8 slaves and yes some of the plot and character development is left out from the movie. But for any person who appreciates technological marvels (the whole freaking movie is CGI I mean LOOK AT HOW GOOD IT LOOKS), action sequences (I think this one speaks for itself), artistic representation, strong themes of patriotism, citizenship, triumph over bureaucracy, and the power of the few with strong drive and courage against the masses, and possibly a few risqu√© sex scenes all packed into one movie then this movie is perfect. Personally I wish I could have seen some more character development of some of the Spartans and more on Leonidus' role as leader of Spartans before the battle but it was a film achievement worthy to be seen by all because I feel every person can identify with Leonidus and the Spartans and can find something in the film that is identifiable and enjoyable (I pledge that this movie wont leave you sad shriveled mess of a person wondering if their life really is bad enough that they are willing to pay 11 bucks to see it)."
"Kev50027","1","1","3","31 July 2007"," Disappointing to say the least
","I can just see what the writers of the script were saying when preparing this movie. <br/><br/>Writer 1: Dude, this 300 story is totally a bummer, there's like nothing really exciting about it. What can we do to make it super cool and like make us rich? <br/><br/>Writer 2: Monsters! <br/><br/>Writer1: Dude! Totally! Monsters make everything super awesome, but this has got to be a blockbuster, what else can we add to this ancient story?<br/><br/>Writer 2: Matrix effects! <br/><br/>Writer 1: Heck yeah! monsters and Matrix effects! Woah dude, you're totally trippin! Now all we have to do is advertise it like crazy dude!<br/><br/>My thoughts on the film:<br/><br/>They took an ancient story that is more myth than truth, added monsters, Matrix like bullet time effects on people using swords, and changed the colors a bit.<br/><br/>Another huge letdown in this movie is that they talk about fighting for Sparta, yet they don't even let us see Sparta in the film! We don't know what it's like there, and the audience doesn't have any emotional connection with the city/state (in the film, it's called a ""country"", while the idea of a country didn't come around until after the French Revolution). This movie is akin to watching someone play the PS2 hit game God of War. It slows down every time something violent happens, then speeds back up with that over used Matrix style from 1999.<br/><br/>The story is abysmal, and since I already knew the ending (this myth was taught to me as fact in High School), there are no plot twists or anything at all to keep me interested. This movie should be a horror film, made to show how badly Hollywood can mess up a perfectly fine myth."
"mrh1967","9","1","3","31 July 2007"," A triumph of style over substance
","This is an epic film that is so shallow that the entire plot could be summarised in a couple of sentences but in this case it really doesn't matter; it's a masterpiece of visual effects and, like such films as 'Master and Commander', almost any frame from it is a work of art. This is pure visual entertainment and very faithful to the graphic novel, if not the actual events in 480BC.<br/><br/>I was initially dubious about watching this because I thought that a film that consists almost entirely of one long fight scene would get tedious after a while but it kept my full attention throughout and is a perfect example of CGI used to great effect.<br/><br/>Highly recommended even if you don't think that it's your sort of film."

There isn't one thing bad about this movie, many of you are retarded and can't just sit there and enjoy, you have to narrow it down to every little aspect. Racism? Unrealism?

","300 has very few words to describe it. It is a phenomenal film! When I saw this movie in the theater, it absolutely blew me away! It definitely deserves to be on the Top 250 list.<br/><br/>Zach Snyder brings Frank Miller's Graphic Novel 300 to life in this film. The film focuses on the 300 Spartans who fought off the Persian armies in the memorable Battle of Thermopyle. The vast superior Spartans where believed to have faced some million Persian soldiers. The superior fighting skills of the Spartans are beautifully portrayed in this film. The fight sequences are great, one of the best I have ever seen in a film. The film is dismal and dark, giving it a scary/saddening characteristic. The effects are stunning, jaw-dropping, eye-bulging, and so forth! This is what I call eye candy! The sound and music is perfect. Action is a plenty in this film. Never dull, never boring, and edge of your seat excitement. <br/><br/>The story is well-written. Not just the story around the Battle of Thermopyle but also around the success of the Spartan soldier and the Spartan Empire. The story focusing on the wolf and the hunt and the training of a soldier is brilliant. To actually understand how and why these Spartan soldiers were as powerful as they were. A terrific story!<br/><br/>Gerard Butler portrays King Leonidas. He does an incredible job with this character. The intensity and enthusiasm of him is incredible. He portrays the anger, intensity, and determination of his character perfectly. I think he could get an Oscar nomination for his performance. An absolutely stunning acting job by him, one of the best performances I have ever seen. David Wenham does a good job as well with his character Dilios. Dilios is one of Leonidas' top commanders and his character is excellent. Although I heavily emphasize these two actors performances, the rest of the cast does a great job as well.<br/><br/>I like the interpretation of Xerxes (the Persian Leader) in this film. He is a disgusting, vulgar, repulsive, and disturbing individual. A beautiful portrayal of his character. I absolutely hated him and I think that may have been the goal of Zach Snyder. To create a villainous character that the viewers could hate and it is done perfectly here.<br/><br/>If you have not seen 300 in theaters, go find one NOW! This is what I call a ""Theater Experience"". It is a must see, either in or out of the theater. A terrific film and absolutely stunning visually!"
"vsilly25","8","1","3","26 June 2007"," Not for everyone.
","OK I didn't realize what happened in real history (although I'm Greek) so being mad at the ending was just my lack of common sense. Otherwise this is a good film. I had to nitpick at some of the dialogue, which seemed like it contained words from out time (""We're in for a wild night"" just doesn't fit in for some reason) There is constant fighting and gore, which for some can get tiring. Special affects were amazing, and I'm shocked this movie only cost $65 million dollars to make. Although everyone else in my group was disappointed (except one of my friends who went only to stare at Gerard Butler), I was just upset with the ending and i would be fine with watching it again. It's not a film for everyone, some may find its simple minded or overly exaggerated, but I found it entertaining."
"yannzeeuwe","7","1","3","21 May 2007"," Nice
","Hmm, very weird movie. It was a friend of mine who first told me about this title. Right after he told me I went to IMDb to read some reviews. They all clearly state that you don't have to go to the theater to see it if you like story lines in a movie. Well, as I like the plot of a movie more than brainless hash and slash action, I didn't like going to this movie at all.<br/><br/>But yeah, the problem with friends is they convince you all the time. We were going to see this movie to go out right after it. So there we sat. After the credits our opinions were very different. I thought they should've given more attention to the story, my friends said they did. Well, what do I have to do now? I decided to watch it again.<br/><br/>Then, yesterday, I watched the movie again. Now not prejudiced. I have to say, it seemed a lot better to me this time. The storyline isn't that bad at all, and the action is just fantastic. Every screenshot of the movie looks like if you can make a poster out of it. Wow.<br/><br/>These two totally different experiences of the movie make it hard to give this movie a vote. The second time I watched it it simply seemed better to me. When I use my second experience I would give it an 8/10, for the first time watching I would give it a 6/10.<br/><br/>(+ great action) (+ very nice edited, every screenshot looks like a poster) (+ you really get a manly ""spartan"" feeling) (- the storyline still could've been better)<br/><br/>I'll vote 7/10."
"scobbah","7","1","3","6 May 2007"," Well executed
","I tend to like flicks that cover historical events so I thought I would give '300' a go. Before dealing with the plot, I must say that the featured scenery is first class. There is something special about the scenery that makes it sort of magic, as though there was some sort of mysterious magic filter processing the video content.<br/><br/>I do not feel that I am in a position to press charges against any of the actors due to poor performances. Gerard Butler does his job great indeed acting as King Leonidas. What I do feel though is, that the flick unfolds a bit too fast to the point where the Spartan army finds itself at war with the Persians. At any rate, the violent scenes of the war are well executed and I found the balance to be decent between art and war.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I give '300' a solid 7/10."
"Monotreme02","7","1","3","27 April 2007"," Visually breathtaking if glaringly flawed
","At a first, objective glance, I find it incredibly easy to dismiss this film. It suffers from everything from genre clich√©s ¬ñ so yeah, the wailing woman soundtrack worked well on Gladiator but that doesn't mean it has to be used in every historical epic made ¬ñ to a screenplay emptier than the dark pit into which the Spartans cast their enemies; and with such an excessive use of slow-motion photography, one wonders just how short the film would actually be had the entire thing been played at normal speed. Despite this, at the same time, I found 300 to be nothing short of a groundbreaking achievement. And if one looks a little further outside of the box at this film, one will see that there is much more than meets the eye. <br/><br/>Despite its obviously out-of-the-box nature, I can't convince myself to ignore some glaringly problematic flaws the film suffers from. While its action scenes keep the blood pumping and the adrenaline flowing, I must admit that during most of the scenes in which killing of some kind was not depicted, I found myself indifferent and bored. The filmmakers attempted to interweave a subliminal political/social message into the film ¬ñ some dribble about glory and freedom ¬ñ which came across as forced, ridiculous and underplayed. Also, I found the utter lack of any characterization to be an irritating distraction. The previous Frank Miller adaptation, Sin City, was populated by caricatures. This time around, 300 is populated by nothing less than cardboard cut-outs; characters so utterly devoid of any traits or characteristics or anything interesting whatsoever about them that it's beyond the level of stereotypes. The acting too was mostly problematic, with Gerard Butler delivering a borderline-irritating performance, shouting and screaming for dramatic effect alone without even an ounce of conviction or sincerity in his words. The rest of the actors seem to be practically sleepwalking through the entire show. The film almost ¬ñ but not quite ¬ñ makes up for these glaring flaws with its incredible achievements in other fields, but I really feel that these problems drag it down and could have easily been fixed to create a truly compelling work. But alas, no film is perfect.<br/><br/>Unsurprisingly, probably one of the most noticeable aspects of the film's screenplay is its exaggerated, unbelievable, outrageous and sometimes downright ridiculous over-the-top nature. But since Snyder and Miller so cleverly book ended the film with a subjective storyteller, effectively they give themselves total freedom to spin the tale what which way they please. If you think about it, this really gives them the artistic license to include the over-exaggerations, the glorifying, and the outrageousness: monstrous creature-men, terrifying mutants, giant god-kings, over-sized elephants and other creatures, and so on. Actually, I quite liked this aspect, as it added a totally original spin to the classic, historic tale. Indeed, had 300 been a regular sword-and-sandals historical epic, I doubt it would really have anything new or interesting to add to the genre. By in actual fact crafting what can most easily be described as a fantasy film, Snyder and Miller portray the genre in a fresh, new, imaginative way as never has been seen before.<br/><br/>I am not a big supporter of the digital revolution. I think that movies like George Lucas' Star Wars prequels and to a lesser extent most any other significant action film from the past few years overuse and abuse the CGI tool to the point of excessiveness, and it all just comes across as terribly, unimpressive laziness. The two major flaws of over-using CGI is that it isn't well developed enough to carry an entire movie realistically and convincingly, and the other is that it really comes across as lazy and negligent ¬ñ Lucas' Star Wars prequels in particular are living proof of everything that is bad about CGI. But in 2005, Robert Rodriguez treaded new ground in the CGI territory, and with 300 now Zack Snyder takes the CGI tool to entirely revolutionary levels. Instead of using CGI to replace reality, Snyder uses it to create imagery that is otherwise utterly impossible to create in a practical manner. By doing this, I can truly and honestly say that Snyder has crafted a groundbreaking film that uses CGI not as a tool but as an art form.<br/><br/>And I don't say this lightly whatsoever. Indeed, this total freedom Snyder has given himself by filming on blue screen sets allows him to craft what may be one of the most visually creative, unique and utterly astoundingly beautiful films of all time. I'm not exaggerating when I say that every single shot of this film is a heart stopping, breathtakingly gorgeous work of art; a renaissance masterpiece of the modern age. The sepia tones, the golden gleam, the striking dark shadows, the contrasts, the vibrancy¬Ö this film is simply put, visually astounding.<br/><br/>In all, notwithstanding the ridiculous plot and story elements, painfully flat characters and boring, pointless talky scenes, 300 is a totally unique, brilliantly creative and an arrestingly visual masterpiece: With the most creative and breathtakingly artistic use of CGI imagery in any movie, 300 may just pave the path to a new, entirely visually liberated style of film-making. And if one views the film as a fantasy piece as opposed to a historical epic, one realizes that it's all in fun and just an entertaining, wildly crazy ride. Still, some flaws are too glaring to forgive, and had the film sharpened itself in terms of characters and story, it would have been far better than it actually is."

","This makes a good history movie if it was real. The movie is 'alright' movie, you watch it because of its fighting, other than that, nothing seem good as the story is straight forward. You know what Frank miller's comics are like, they have graphic violence and sex, not so much on language. The director even made the deaths so detailed, example like when the head was sliced off, you can see what is inside of it. The style of the violence is slow-motion, until you are tired of them fighting in slow-motion but for the first time, you will stare in awe at how the director made the violence slow, slash. The soldiers are cruel, have no feelings, kill those who get in their way, is spartan soldiers like this? No feelings but filled with justice, they just slash and slash without thinking. Do spartan soldiers always like to die for their country? All senseless violence and madness! <br/><br/>If you want good story plot, this one does not fit but if you want to watch bloody violence, slice and slash or like war movies, this movie fit your glory...happen that I like its style of violence, I rate 7 out 10, if not 6 out of 10. This is one typical war movie that has endless wars."
"rafael_spa","8","1","3","19 April 2007"," Very good looking, very funny, very well done
","It's curious to state so, but it seems that Frank Miller is going to set himself deep in the heart of Hollywood.<br/><br/>Sin City was good, 300 is even better, and they both are brought to the big screen straightly from the comics pages. 300, in special, couldn't even be called an adaptation, once that it begins, develops and ends exactly in the same way as in the comic book (except for some slight differences made to get it closer to a conventional movie, such as the Captain/Son part, and the Queen Gorgo plot), even repeating the quotes line by line, in many occasions.<br/><br/>In my point of view, it's a interesting point, that makes it distinct from other movies that work upon the same kind of material (such as Troy and Alexander). It changes the pace, changes the attitude and thrills the viewer (except for those too familiar with the comic book). It also relieves the audience from the more common ""true"" historical approach in favor of the adventure.<br/><br/>Once the usual historical description of the battle in the ""Thermopillas"" is almost certainly exaggerated by the Greek storytellers, I can't see nothing wrong about shooting the movie in a stylized way, as it's not a documentary.<br/><br/>The direction by Zack Snyder is remarkable, original and very inventive, no matter the way you analyze it. The cinematography is beautiful, and the costumes and sets are stunning. The use of grotesque elements along with the action is also something to be mentioned, as it provides a great impact on screen and help building up the intended dream-like (or nightmarish) feel that the movie contains.<br/><br/>By the way, the movie is not totally perfect, by standard evaluation, as the all-time over the top background reflects in the acting, that sound somewhat exaggerated in many times. I wouldn't say the acting is bad - not at all - it's just too different from the standards by which we comment on it. The actors behave more like an Opera cast, consciously boosting the dramatic feel of the scenes, in a way opposed to the usual ""real life"" approach we are familiar in movie-making. Nevertheless, I can't think of a better approach for the interpretation.<br/><br/>The one point I think was a bad step was the Xerxes voice. I see no reason for it to be dubbed the way it was. It felt nothing like the voice of the characters interpretor. It just felt like dubbed... Didn't like it.<br/><br/>Except for that, I can't think of a low point about this movie.<br/><br/>It may be epic, filled of action and good looking, these are undeniable qualities! But many films achieved it before. The greatest quality for this movie is the innovative feel, the new and effective approach to Greek-rooted historical material. If it was just another epic, you could pass it, the way it was done, it's the first real must see of this year.<br/><br/>So, go for it!"
"pinbyte","7","1","3","13 April 2007"," Can you count how many heads are lopped off?
","Normally, I would not elect to watch a movie like this. But as circumstances would have it, I ended up seeing this film and I cannot say I am disappointed. I really did not know what to expect which I suppose helped me enjoy it more. I generally don't go for violence and blood. If you can stand it though, you might just want to see it. It is more comical than disturbing.<br/><br/>This film is an over-the-top fantasy war drama 'epic' taking place centuries in the past. Don't rate it for historical accuracy or you will be sorely disappointed. Don't look for great acting. If you need a 'story', please avoid. It is pure eye candy rendered by quality CGI and bigger than life characters. Well-choreographed fight scenes that slow down from time-to-time¬Ö and are not so cluttered that you cannot figure out what is going on and follow the action.<br/><br/>I must admit a guilty pleasure at the sight of a big bad guy's head taking leave of his body in slow motion. There are quite a number of heads lopped off, I counted four before I lost track. All in all, this was about the action and the over-the-top characters¬Ö the story was just an excuse. Still I could not take my eyes away from it, and I believe I could even sit through it once more should circumstances have it. I was not bored, and I enjoyed the two kings especially.<br/><br/>The Spartan king Leonidas with his strong voice and steadfast determination was an interesting character to watch. I liked him. His enemy, king Xerxes, was the real star of the show to me even though you see little of him. He had an even more resonating voice (as if that were possible) and what must be a computer enhanced screen presence. With his bizarre adornments and self-absorption he is an over-the-top sight to be seen. You just won't get it unless you watch the film.<br/><br/>Those self-proclaimed intellectuals who berate this movie because it IS stupid and pointless just don't know how to have fun. I expect adult females will not be disappointed with the myriad of half-naked idealized men in action. Few adolescent males would object to the overt violence and blood. This movie is not for everyone. But, this 40-something, educated straight male was entertained far beyond expectation and I am giving it a 7/10 (much to my amazement).<br/><br/>P.S.

"ArjunPadhya","9","1","3","13 April 2007"," Some movies are larger!!
","Everybody, even a 'not-so-much-movies' person also knows that movies are larger than life. And probably, this fact is the key force for anyone to watch a movie. We see stars on screen; we enjoy a movie like a visual feast¬Ö.<br/><br/>But mostly, it is the stars, the actors that we cherish. We see an actor as a hero¬Öwe pretend to be like him during and even after movies sometimes. Our dream girl very often resembles to an actress!! Anyways, one can understand that I am not saying something very deep or important.<br/><br/>What is important is, that some movies are indeed larger, but they are so large, that it does not matter who starred in that movie. What remains larger is the movie itself, and not the stars who are worshiped. Anyone can say that this type of movies would have remained the same even without popular stars.<br/><br/>For example, in Superman movies, Chris Reeve was so handsome and adorable, so fit for the role that it became impossible for us to even imagine a Superman movie without him. Even today if we imagine Superman, we see him, and not Brandon Routh. He was larger than the movie. And this happens very often.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the movies like THE INDEPENDENCE DAY are larger than anything, it does not matter weather it had Jeff Goldblum and Will Smith, it would have still remained a blockbuster with completely unknown stars. Spiderman movie would have remained the same if it had someone else and not Toby. The movie made Toby large; Toby did not make the movie large.<br/><br/>Such movies don't come very often. But they do.<br/><br/>This movie is surely one of those! I could bet a month's salary on it.<br/><br/>But before I start writing, I must say, that it was very difficult for me to get SIN CITY out of my mind and watch 300 as an independent film. And you might find the same while reading this comment.<br/><br/>During the initial ten minutes, while watching the young Leonidas fighting the fierce wolf¬ÖI saw two eyes of the wolf in the dark¬Öand the way it is shown in the movie, I instantly recall Elijah Wood and his shinning spects in the dark and chill went through my spine¬Öand I mean it, literally. Even if I will see Elijah in person, I will be frightened for a while¬Ö.It was very difficult to get SIN CITY out of your mind. I think this is a credit to FRANK MILLER. If these are his work, he is surely a genius.<br/><br/>History has always told everyone that Athens was superior to Sparta and Spartans are always projected as barbarians, killers, hooligans¬Ö.. I thought the same.<br/><br/>And how wrong I was!! It is a fact that Spartan females were not only more strong, but socially, they enjoyed more freedom that any other female in the contemporary society. Queen Gorgo speaks for Sparta very firmly in the movies. This is not a sign of a barbarian civilization. NO.<br/><br/>Lena Headey is beautiful, but she is sexier and she has a superb, ringing voice. You will feel good just by listening to her voice. It has that special quality. I would watch the movie second time and her voice would be a reason.<br/><br/>Gerard Butler is perfect as the King Leonidas and the entire flick is brilliantly directed. But still, I would give the credit to FRANK MILLER.<br/><br/>I recommend analyzing the whole movie as one, instead of doing the same with its characters, story and other technical aspects.<br/><br/>The movie, at the end, keeps you thinking about Sparta, Spartans and Spartan females instead of the movie it self. The real hero of the film is Spartan civilization. I was glad to view the Spartan civilization with a different point of view.<br/><br/>I have already obtained the disk of THE 300 SPARTANS, released in 1962, starring Richard Egan that tells the same story. I was told by a friend that it is more powerful that this one. Well..let us hope¬Ö I give 05/05 to 300. A must see.

","You know a lot of my friends came and told hey lets go watch this movie 300 its great everybody says, but after we saw it ah ah ah ah you know what people were blowing their trumpets i am not kidding.<br/><br/>300 is a 2007 film adaptation of the graphic novel 300 by Frank Miller, itself partly inspired by another film based on the Battle of Thermopylae, The 300 Spartans.[1] The film is directed by Zack Snyder with Frank Miller attached as an executive producer and consultant, and was shot mostly with blue-screen to duplicate the imagery of the original comic book.<br/><br/>Spartan King Leonidas (Gerard Butler) and 300 Spartans fight to the last man against Persian King Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro) and his army of over one million soldiers, while in Sparta, Queen Gorgo (Lena Headey) attempts to rally support for her husband. The story is framed by a voice-over narrative by the Spartan soldier Dilios (David Wenham). Through this narrative technique, all manner of fantastical creatures are introduced, placing 300 within the genre of historical fantasy.<br/><br/>I suggest that frank miller shaves his legs but you know what a lot of writers wrote and never came back but frank miller came back and will.<br/><br/>The only reason i gave this movie an 5/10 was because tank aka Zack Snyder was just smoking and forehead it was too realistic and frank millers novel was eh eh ah ah i am not kidding.<br/><br/>I AM NOT KIDDING..........................i gave it a 10/10 a must see"
"cj_685","8","1","3","8 April 2007"," Surprising Opinion!
","The reason i went to see this this film was purely based on the fact that i was obviously aware of how well it had been doing! Action films aren't generally what i would go and see but being the biggest film released so far this year, especially in the US, i thought it would be my best option! Well i've got to say that it is a reasonably simple story and once i realised that it was mostly about the visual and the fighting, i really got into it! The film looks amazing and the way the eye moves through the physical action is magical! It is quite gory and this made some people in the cinema cringe a little- the woman sat in front of us was on her own and looked traumatised throughout which was amusing! There were also various places where the odd comic lines added occasional humour which worked perfectly! Personally, i think that this is definitely a must-see if you're not against some graphic action violence! This is actually a film that i wouldn't have thought i would want to buy when it comes out on DVD, but would now i have seen it! Once again, the visual is almost gripping!"

","I am a die-hard Frank Miller fan(also Tarantino/Rodriguez enthusiast) and I loved the comic-book violence depicted here. I loved every inch of Sin City. But, I have some problems with this movie, and I think that stops it short of what it could have achieved.<br/><br/>1. Voice over - this film has a weak voice over. In Sin City, the cold, detached VO was one of the USP. But the voice used here is just not upto the magnitude the film tries to portray.<br/><br/>2. Gerard Butler is just not powerful enough to act Leonidas - he shouts a lot and inspires a little - the lines he had could have given him a chance to make him immortal in the heart of epic movie lovers,but he fails to deliver the dialog with that mastery - sorry for the unfair comparison - but can't help thinking about Viggo as Aragorn / Russell as Maximus when I see something like that -and sadly Gerard has a hard time to live upto the expectation.<br/><br/>Still, worth a see.

"kooleshwar","7","1","3","2 April 2007"," Had everything but lacked soul..
","I was dying to see this movie from the time I heard of it especially since I'm a big fan of the R-rated gory battle movies and loved Sincity.The fact that there are no names in this movie hardly seemed important and wasn't in the end.<br/><br/>The premise of this movie had limitless potential for the stylised bloodshed and swordplay that I love so much, the real battle was much less one sided (a thousand at a height against 1,00,000) but I was happy to learn that the movies would be taking liberties with history in order to make a more entertaining film.<br/><br/>And entertaining it was.........<br/><br/>It excelled in almost every field the visuals were brilliant (albeit very heavy on CG and the digital effects could be jarring for some) and every scene felt like a painting, the film had a similar comic book feel that Sincity had and similar film effects had a lot to do with it.<br/><br/>The action scenes were brilliant albeit historically inaccurate, they were as brutal and gory as can be and I loved it. The action was well choreographed and it was great fun seeing a bunch of super warriors annihilate all sorts of stuff that was thrown at them. (Being Indian I found it hard to believe how the Greeks tackled elephants when ironically 300 elephants of Poruses army wiped out most of Alexanders if it wasn't for the storm that drove the elephants mad Alexander would have lost his entire army of 75000).<br/><br/>The acting was good with the movie always remaining true to its comic book heritage with lots of short simple and effective dialogues peppered across the film and THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF ANY COMIC THE NARRATOR.<br/><br/>The story was interesting and as with almost all history the stories that are remembered the most and the longest are the ones involving some tragedy or mishap (obviously the ultimate victor writes history but again the events that are remembered are the tragedies for either of the sides). People love the underdog here too a handful of great warriors taking on a massive army endears to the heart.<br/><br/>The background score was decent and added to the movie.<br/><br/>Technically the movie was near perfect with excellent direction and digital cinematography the way the comic book feel is created is brilliant.<br/><br/>The short length of the movie ensured that you never lost interest for even a moment and enjoyed throughout the film.<br/><br/>So why the low rating?!! Like I said the movie lacked a soul...<br/><br/>The comic book dialogues were perfect for Sincity which was always about the comic but this movie involves an intense epic battle and the absolute lack of any stirring dialogue does more good than bad, scenes involving patriotism were absolutely lost, THOSE THAT ARE LESS EMOTIONAL ABOUT BATTLE MOVIES AND PATRIOTISM WILL NOT BE AFFECTED BY THIS AS MUCH AS ME THOUGH.<br/><br/>I loved the sheer amount of bloodshed but the lack of spirit that I was talking about surfaces here too though with the sheer number of deaths taking precedence over the intense personal fights between two great warriors that are shown in most movies involving epic battles.<br/><br/>Im a person who fantasizes about dying for my country and gets easily stirred by battle and very emotional in those involving patriotism and the underdog,(i seriously believe that I may have been a warrior and freedon fighter in my past life) even then this movie failed to strike a chord in me (I'm one who gets emotional even in movies like Troy or Arthur which was supposed to be less intense than say a Braveheart).<br/><br/>Maybe I set my expectations to high or wanted something from this movie that it was never supposed to have but a movie that seems tailor-made for me yet failed to stir me seems like a serious issue (save for patriotism and victory of the underdog I like my movie as simple as possible I like my fights gory, lots of murder (zombie flicks), my comedy crass and the women nude). So even though it was impossible for me not to like this movie it seriously fell below my expectations.<br/><br/>The common critic always favour movies that have drama and going by the hype surrounding it I seriously felt this movie would have loads of spirit.<br/><br/>The ending too was lack-lustre and could have been done much better especially considering the preceding comic book like story and action.<br/><br/>In either case this movie is a much watch movie with just about enough to please the festival crowd and those who use the word cinema instead of movies.<br/><br/>-s absolute lack of soul,lacklustre ending, fell below expectations.<br/><br/>+/-s comic book feel (loved it Sincity though).<br/><br/>+s superb technically, good acting, great action scenes with lots of blood and gore, hot chicks,short and sweet,very interesting story, suitable for all audiences.<br/><br/>total 7/10 (ignoring the fact that it fell way below expectations lacklustre ending will be an issue even for people with different tastes and is a major factor in the lower rating)."

"americaspac","Null","1","3","27 March 2007"," What's accurate; what's not
","There's a lot of discussion of how accurate the film ""300"" is. Being based on a graphic novel gives the director license to stray from history somewhat; but it's more the fact that little is known of the battle that allows the director to be inventive. It's a legendary story in a sense, so characters can be overdrawn; although Xerxes truly was a magalomaniac who had the sea flayed with heated scourges because a storm sunk many of his ships as his army crossed from Asia into Greece(only the storm is shown in the film).<br/><br/>One thing that stands out as questionable is the Spartan King Leonidas invoking faith and reason. This would have been more accurate coming from an Athenian than from the leaders of an autocratic state like Sparta. But while individual freedom was not a Spartan principle, the notion of independence was. Sparta stressed its own independence and freedom from outside rule or domination, so its unified, regimented society was felt to be necessary to maintain that freedom.<br/><br/>Even more important, Spartan warriors were critical to saving Greece, which, as a whole, was indeed the seat of reason and freedom in the world at the time.<br/><br/>Without Thermopylae, the Spartans, and the victories that followed the West would never have been able to create the most successful and creative civilization in history. Periodically the West has had to fend off barbarians like the Persians, the Muslims in the 700s in Spain and France, the Mongols in the 1200s and the Muslims again as late as 1683 at the siege of Vienna. The question now is are we united and inspired enough to repel the Muslim terrorists who threaten us today.<br/><br/>300 shows a unified warrior people defeating (ultimately) a benighted, aggressive invasion. Where are the warriors among us today?"
"RNHunter","9","1","3","11 March 2007"," Excellent Drama of Real History
","I often find myself comparing historical movies to real history. One way of doing that is to both see the movie and then also read up on the reality and / or see comments from the History Channel. In most cases in the past I have been disappointed. Real history is often more interesting and at times even more fun than the movie regarding it.<br/><br/>But in the movie 300, I have to give full credit to Frank Miller's handling of the movie. It kept close to history and in fact embraces many of the realities of history. However, we of course must give the movie industry some poetic license. Frank Miller then adds a dramatization and human interest stories on top of it. In my opinion this is the movie industry at its best - stick to the basic truth, but add some drama and entertainment to the story line. Excellent movie, and close enough to recorded history to receive a very good grade there also.<br/><br/>I should warn some without giving away the plot here that the movie is a war movie. There is much bloodshed here. Of course there also was much in history. The movie was also believable. The actors playing world conquerors and military leaders actually looked the part. Very well done in my opinion."

","300 will add to the next generation of stunning imagery in film that has begun since CG. Simular to sin city's style 3oo will be the next classic in comic book film sagas. Frank Millers novel will come to life in an epic fictional story of the last stand of the 300 Spartans who stood against the Persian army 600 years before Aleaxander the Great in eastern Greece. Filmed in the same dark yet high contrast of light like Sin City, 300 promises to be visually stunning while emotionally involved. Gerald Butler and Dominick West both gave amazing performances as the Courageuos King and fierce warrior who fight to the death for honor. I hope dark horse comics continues making new movies based off there comics."

"lynnlefey","8","2","10","9 March 2007"," Visually Awe Inspiring
","The movie is a beauty to behold visually. There are moments in film, images that could just as well be still frames that engrave into our minds. This movie has many of them, and rightly so, based on the work of Frank Miller.<br/><br/>The only down sides I can think of are as follows; first, I would hardly call the plot advanced. Even so, the simple story plays out well. Second, while the music was certainly appropriate, I fear it may not age well, like 'Ladyhawk', where modern instruments are used in a fantasy (or in this case near-historic)... particularly heavy metal guitar and drums.<br/><br/>Set all that aside. Set aside any preconceived notion about the morality tale this movie may be trying to send, since I find it very unlikely it was intended the way many accuse.<br/><br/>It plays well, if you take note that it is (seriously) rated R. It is profoundly violent, and has a smattering of nudity and adult content.<br/><br/>I think when coming out of the theater, I was nearly in shock, not at the blood and gore. Those things really don't bother me. It was the impact of the story. I had an emotional connection to it. Simple story or no, it resonated.<br/><br/>Not a perfect film overall, but nearly perfect visually. I would HIGHLY recommend it."

","This movie is so awesome! We have seen so many cloak dagger epic battle movies before. But in the age of computer-generated effects, we have had ""Gladiator"" and ""Troy"", to name but the most high-profile ones. ""Frank Miller's 300"" somehow even surpasses these very accomplished films.<br/><br/>The whole look, cinematography, costume, sets, editing, musical score, make-up, and yes, sound and visual effects all score superlatives! It is beautiful to see, despite the relentless gore and splattering blood. It may be true that we are becoming jaded in watching displays of extreme violence on screen. However, the highly stylized choreography of the violent scenes, so over the top that it hews close to its graphic novel origins, is an eloquent cinematic achievement. The acting of the ensemble was commendable. This is the first I have seen of Gerald Butler since ""Phantom of the Opera"", and he really lives and breathes Leonides. The actors playing the individual Spartan soldiers are also impressive. Their bodies showed their discipline in preparing for their roles, so much that their muscles look like visual effects. The Queen was also portrayed as a strong character, not a mere helpless woman just waiting for her husband.<br/><br/>Highly recommended! I loved ""Sin City"", and I have got to say that I love ""300"" even more. Can't wait for the next Frank Miller project!"

Yes, historical inaccuracies (it's based on a comic book, please keep that in mind), yes, some shots were just too off to take seriously, (**SPOILER** To be fair, I'm only talking about the spinning head scene), and yes, Frank Miller tends to use the same archetypes again and again for his characters but this does not, in any way detract from this being a thoroughly enjoyable film that satisfies any war movie fan's blood lust. I watched this movie knowing that Frank Miller tends to have his hits and misses, but after Sin City (a movie I watched about 14 times since it came out) I thought I couldn't worship him for anything else. I'm not going to exaggerate by saying that 300 is the BEST movie that I've ever seen, but it's definitely one of the best I've seen in a long time. After Ghost Rider I dreaded the next comic book movie adaptation, 300 basically replied to this with a ""shut up and watch. This is how it's done"". <br/><br/>To anyone worried about the movie not living up to the comic--- trust me. This does justice.<br/><br/>This is a movie that I'd probably watch on the big screen, again, thrice. So go forth, behold, worship, for freedom!

It wasn't 'animation' but then again it didn't look like regular film, it was definitely enhanced and manipulated to give it an appearance unlike anything I'd seen before. I was curious to see more. However, after I'd adapted to these new visuals I was more available to focus on the story, script, and what was actually going on. That's where the trouble began. This film seems to be stuck in one gear - very high. Every scene was like yet another climax. It was unrelenting and before soon lost it's impact and power to excite. Also, the script wasn't so much dialogue as much as it was profound statements, rally cries, epic speeches meant to inspire and awe, and that was basically it. It seems this film was meant to awe and inspire the audience through its visuals only, but for me I need a supporting story and characters who, love them or hate them, I need to feel something for them. 300 is interesting to look at, but has nothing else going for it."

"ha-98192","4","1","4","5 May 2016"," its all very impressive and I gain new experiences
","This film isn't for all people. That's to say about a lot of movies in general of course, but this one in particular brings up a big clashing point between critics; What do we want to see in our movies? What is more important, to portray a fictional setting for the sake of giving people a mind blowing visual experience or to amuse and amaze them with clever plot twists and intelligent dialogs? First lets analyze what exactly this film is made of. Basically, the whole thing is just one epic fighting scene after another. Most noticeably is the camera work and the visual effects. Every shot seems like it was intended to be a work of art. The colors, the characters, the costumes, the backgrounds... every little detail has been given so much attention. During the big fights you'll also instantly notice the unique editing. There are a lot of ""time slowdowns"" throughout the battles which show what exactly is happening. Fatal wounds that slowly leak blood spatters in the air, decapitated heads traveling in slow-motion across the screen... it's all there.<br/><br/>The story on the other hand isn't very complicated, in the sense that the whole movie could probably be described in a sentence or two. The dialogs are simple and most often talk about moral values like freedom and honor. If you would look at the script, it would probably look like another movie that has nothing more to offer then idealistic visions of how life should be.<br/><br/>Reviewers of this title seem to be split up in two groups. They either love it with passion calling it an epic movie of the 21th century, or hate it even more and throw it off like a piece of garbage consisting of mindless action and silly clich√© phrases. I feel reluctant to take a position in this argument. Normally it's tolerable to weigh out both sides of this matter to result in a fair judgment about a movie. Not in this one. On the one hand the visual are surely among the best to be witnessed in a movie. Every detail, every background, every special effect set to the scenes are so mindblowingly stunning. On the other hand the plot and dialogs are of the most simplistic and quite frankly dumb kind. ""I fight for freedom! I'd rather die in honor then live in shame!"" Sounds familiar? Of course it could be debated that this movie was never intended in the first place to have a unique plot that makes your head spin. But from an objective point of view it's still lacking in this department, so it should be noted.<br/><br/>Now that's fine and all, but does that all make of the film? Is it worth watching or what? I think it is. For me the good outweighs the bad by miles. From the second the movie started it grabbed me and didn't let go. Every battle, every scene of the movie had me at the tip of my chair. Everything from the strong acting to the wondrous visuals to the war-shouts of the soldiers was just so stunning... it was truly a wonderful experience.<br/><br/>I did not one single moment felt like the movie lacked anything. But I could imagine why other people did.<br/><br/>So here's the deal."
"Atheist_Dude","Null","1","4","31 March 2016"," Frank Miller's tight story, Gerard Butler's tighter abs power Zack Snyder's war fantasia masterpiece
","Zack Snyder's retelling of the famous Battle of Thermopylae does not even for a second try for historical accuracy, it is instead a horny teenager's wet dream painted luridly across the big screen. Snyder here blends the old and the new, his war fantasy is equal parts ancient Grecian Art and modern comic book aesthetic.<br/><br/>Every single element in this movie is over-the-top and cranked up to 11 - the odds are impossible (300 Spartan warriors against a million Persians), the war scenes splattered in non-stop blood and viscera and the testosterone raging forth as if this film has a permanent erection.<br/><br/>The characters are complete contrasts and raised to the level of mythology. Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro) is literally a 10 feet tall god, decked in gold jewelry from head to toe and androgynous or even effeminate. Spartan Warrior-King Leonidas (Gerard Butler) on the other-hand is hyper-masculine and portrayed with such a jaw-droppingly muscular and shredded physique that he looks like a Greek God himself, even though he's mortal.<br/><br/>For a war film, Snyder builds dramatic tension very successfully in the first half through tense exchanges between Leonidas and Persian/Spartan statesmen as Persia invades Greece. But once it explodes into all-out war, the film becomes an action fans dream and stages one brilliantly-choreographed and dazzlingly-executed action set-piece after another. This is seriously some of the best fantasy action ever committed to screen ‚Äì coherent, imaginative and brutal.<br/><br/>This is most certainly the most beautiful film by Snyder ‚Äì it literally bursts with luscious saturated color and tangible textures. Ostensibly shot in a single blue room with no sets, every backdrop and even entire cities and armies were added digitally by a horde of special effects artists. The results are both extremely artificial and vividly dream-like - every frame is a piece of Greek Art or comic book frame that can be put in a museum.<br/><br/>You might think that the actors are a bit lost amid all the war frenzy and CGI trickery, and that is true of some of the supporting actors. Not Gerard Butler though, who in a role of life-time, seizes the part by its horns and gives a truly towering, monumental and film-elevating performance. This is surely one of the most over-whelmingly uber-macho performances in the history of cinema, Butler's Leonidas is the alpha male to end all alpha males.<br/><br/>When you see him hero-walking at the head of the Spartan army, flexing his huge muscles and roaring like a lion with blood-curdling fury (Leonidas means lion), it is difficult not to get warm in the blood and join the answering Spartan war-cry. Butler is the perfect match for Snyder's sensibilities in this regard, he completely gets the material, the tone Snyder is aiming for and isn't afraid to give a big, dialed-to-11 performance. Butler literally roars every single line with a deep manly Scottish baritone but such is the passion and intensity of his performance that none of the lines sound ridiculous, they instead sound like great-one liners that make memorable quotes on t-shirts.<br/><br/>You cannot talk about Butler's epic performance without talking about his iconic look. Butler, sporting close to no fat, is ripped beyond belief, showing bulging eight-pack-abs and muscles so elaborately sculpted that he once and for all raised the bar on what is possible for an action hero to look like. Audiences gasped in astonishment and media widely speculated that his physique was CGI but don't be fooled folks, it's all real and there's never been a more cut leading man in the movies. This is again a melding of the old and the new ‚Äì Butler's used modern bodybuilding to bring together classical Greek sculpture (aesthetic proportions and every single muscle developed to perfection) and comic book aesthetic (muscle definition so intense it makes your eyes water). He is essentially the perfect masculine ideal here - complete with his enormous beard and cropped haircut.<br/><br/>Snyder invokes the classical concept of 'heroic nudity' in that Butler appears almost fully nude, wearing only a leather codpiece, to relentlessly flaunt his physique throughout the film. Butler's nude Spartan look contrasts with the fully clothed Persian soldiers, and further distinguishes the virile Spartans soldiers for their immense courage, war culture and military might, showing they have nothing to hide even in battle. These pumped-up Spartan soldiers look physically perfect and help the audience to believe the movie's premise that it is not only possible but even likely that the Spartans will defeat the Persians.<br/><br/>On the battlefield Butler cuts an intimidating and terrifying figure, looking like an anatomy chart as every muscle ripples and strains with the war effort to wreak carnage on the enemy. In one unforgettable single take sequence, he becomes the god of war himself as he mercilessly massacres dozens of Persians in a single charge (the best cinematic representation of Homeric war imagery). The scene is both shockingly violent and crazy bad-ass, now a classic of the action genre.<br/><br/>Butler aces even his extended dialog scenes with his entertaining and exciting screen presence and off-the-charts charisma. Make no mistake, his cocky Leonidas is not an ideal bench-pressing bicep-curling gym-jock (though he is impossibly buff), he is an incredibly intelligent and shrewd tactician as well as a powerful orator. Towards the end of the film, one is surprised to be even moved by his performance. Leonidas is unapologetic, uncompromising and blatantly arrogant but also fearless, gutsy and heroic and Butler here has pulled off the impossible trick of being both HeMAN and HuMAN in a single film.<br/><br/>Snyder, buoyed by Butler's aggressive performance, delivers a tightly focused narrative that delivers the thrills, and gets out while still ahead. It remains his best and most exciting work and leaves hope that he might return to the glories of this triumph in his under comic book undertakings."

","As this retelling of the story of the Battle of Thermopylae opens Dilios, a survivor of the battle, narrates as we learn how his leader Leonidas grew up learning to be a fighter before growing up to become the King of Sparta. We then learn how King Xerxes of the Persians sends a messenger to Sparta demanding that they acknowledge his supremacy¬Ö Leonidas responds by kicking the messenger down the well! He knows that if he is to prevent the destruction of Sparta he will have to face Xerxes superior forces; the oracles forbid going to war at that time but he takes a force of three hundred warriors to a pass known as the 'Hot Gates'; here a small force will be able to hold off a superior attacker. Soon battle is raging as wave after wave of Xerxes' forces attack Leonidas' small band of Spartans. Back in Sparta Gorgo, Leonidas' wife tries to rally support to send the rest of the army.<br/><br/>If you are after historical accuracy this may not be the film to watch; however it might inspire viewers to learn more about the events which can't be bad. If you want action this film has lots of it; much of it is fairly bloody but it isn't too disturbing thanks to the stylised way in which it is presented. The action is exciting and fairly non-stop once the battle has begun. The use of CGI is effective and not too obvious. The cast do a decent enough job with the material; although most of them just have to shout a lot and fight even more. On the downside the Spartans, who we are meant to support, come across as a bunch of proto-fascists; this is especially true in the opening scenes where we see young Leonidas taken from his mother and brutally forced to becoming a warrior whose greatest honour would be to die for Sparta. Overall I enjoyed this more than I expected and would recommend it to somebody after a film with lots of action."
"sandnair87","9","1","4","26 August 2015"," 300 is Zack Snyder's Valentine to Violence!
","Once in a while, a movie comes along that's so extraordinarily butch, it makes even the most pumped-up gym-jockeys look like spaghetti-armed girls. Zack Snyder's 300 is just that! It is an absolute beast of a film, glistening with sweat and other homo-erotic juices, almost drowning in a sea of testosterone.<br/><br/>300 tells the story of 300 Spartans led by King Leonidas (Gerard Butler) into the face of an insurmountable invasion at the hands of a million-man Persian army. The Spartans are proud and pure people, who raise their young on the battlefield to ensure their men grow into strong warriors to protect their land. When demi-god Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro) makes clear his intentions to raze Sparta to the ground, King Leonidas decides that rather than allow his nation to be conquered into slavery, he must take his best warriors, the Spartan elite, and do what he can to fend off the impending invasion. Picking up on that incensed energy, he leads just 300 of his finest warriors to meet the million soldiers of the Persian army in a fierce battle for survival.<br/><br/>From there the film explodes into a highly stylized, intense battle-royale in which the Spartans (all sporting six packs you could bounce a brick off), with their flare for battle and their constant arrogance, take on the vast Persian army led by Xerxes. The battle scenes themselves are something to behold, they are pulse pounding and intense yet not chaotic. Everything is slightly hyper-real, so expect jets of crimson to soak the screen, ninja-style leaps, giant ogres with axes and crazed war rhinos taking chunks out of each other in battle. It's all wonderfully OTT, but as the encroaching armies are gradually worn down and start to lose their heads, it's a deliciously macabre spectacle. In the hands of director Zack Snyder, 300 is a hurricane blast of epic energy - two solid hours of big, beefy men stabbing each other and yelling ""Raaargh!"" as loud as they can. He brilliantly recreates Frank Miller's source material, shooting it with a visual flair in a palette so stylized that it might as well be animation. The glorification of the body, the de-humanized enemy, the sheer relentless carnage presented as poetry and ballet - 300 is almost fascistic in its devotion to war and heroism.<br/><br/>Of the cast, it is Gerard Butler who clearly steals the show from the rest. He does more than just shout to his men prior to an impending surge - he is charismatic, irreverent and ultimately embodies the vision of a Spartan warrior. Resplendent in his scarlet robe and six-pack, Butler's warrior king brings both a sense of humor and a brooding intelligence to the slaughter.<br/><br/>300 is a valentine to violence, hilariously macho and eye-poppingly homo-erotic. Grab your Spartan helmet, sword and shield, it is time to kick some ass!"

"nexusfpl","10","1","4","6 February 2015"," Don't know what all these folks were complaining about
","Well, almost 9 years after its release, I've watched this movie just the day before yesterday.<br/><br/>What do I have to add after so many (good and bad) reviews? Only that I don't know what the negative reviewers were complaining about. What were they expecting? Didn't they know this movie was based upon a Frank Miller graphic novel? Didn't they know this wasn't supposed to be an intellectual movie? Didn't they know this film wasn't supposed to be factual? I can only wonder, since after watching this (and having read the original comic book by Frank Miller before), I have only positive things to say about this movie. I think it's a true masterpiece, in many senses.<br/><br/>There's no spoilers coming, don't worry. After all these years, every detail about this film is well known, right? All I need to say is that this is a real bliss for the eyes, a truly beautiful aesthetic experience. Every scene, every shot was masterfully done. It's truly a graphic novel turned into a Hollywood film- sometimes it seems you're reading the graphic novel on the big screen, it does not feel like a movie. Perfect to see, like very few films I had seen before. Also, I must say something about the characterization and the acting. The Spartans are, obviously, more real than the Persians, or the other people portrayed on the movie. There are lots of fantasy characters. I have no problem with that. Now, the Spartans are exactly as we imagine them- virile, inflexible, rude, men in the true sense of this word. About the acting, many people have noticed it before me, but I also need to say: GERARD BUTLER was superb! He does really look like he's come from a time machine, a true Spartan come alive before our eyes! And he does act like a king is supposed to act, his facial expression, his gesture, his way of speaking: everything is perfect. Really didn't know what to expect from this actor prior to seeing this film, but now I admire him a lot for this brilliant effort. The rest of the casting (if we can speak thus with Michael Fassbender included among the ""supporting characters"") is also very good, I like the way the actress who plays Leonidas' wife looks calm, brave, strong-headed: this is exactly what I think a Spartan queen should look like.<br/><br/>On a side-note, Rodrigo Santoro (the king Xerxes, the villain of the film) is a Brazilian actor who does have some talent, though he's not on pair with Butler. Here we don't hear his true voice, because he speaks very softly, and the Persian God/King wasn't supposed to be a gentleman. All in all, Xerxes is not on screen for a lot of time, but whenever he is, he's very convincing. <br/><br/>So, if you are reading this I suggest you to ignore the negative reviews and watch this movie for yourself. I really loved what I saw. Don't be discouraged by the violence too, it's not present most of the time, and even when the guys are butchering each other, the scenes are never gory, they are still beautifully made. That's what I have to say about this film really: it's a very beautiful experience, a true feast for the eyes."

","Gerard Butler stars as Spartan King Leonidas and Lena Headey plays Queen Gorgo. The massive army of the Persian Empire is sweeping across the globe, crushing every force that dares stand in its path. When a Persian envoy arrives in Sparta offering King Leonidas power over all of Greece if he will only bow to the will of the all powerful Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro), the strong-willed leader assembles a small army comprised of his empire's best fighters and marches off to battle. Though they have virtually no hope of defeating Xerxes' intimidating battalion, Leonidas' men soldier on, intent on letting it be known they will bow to no man but their king. Meanwhile, back in Sparta, the loyal Queen Gorgo attempts to convince both the skeptical council and the devious Theron (Dominic West) to send more troops despite the fact that many view Leonidas' unsanctioned war march as a serious transgression. As Xerxes' fearsome ""immortals"" draw near, a few noble Greeks vow to assist the Spartans on the battlefield. When King Leonidas and his 300 Spartan warriors fell to the overwhelming Persian army at the Battle of Thermopylae, the fearless actions of the noble fighters inspired all of Greece to stand up against their Persian enemy and wage the battle that would ultimately give birth to the modern concept of democracy."

","I saw this movie when I was in high school and was blown away by the experience. I remember seeing this in IMAX in a full theater and enjoyed every minute of it. The movie is a bit over 1 hour and 30 minutes, but it seemed shorter and I wanted more out of it. It's not a very satisfying movie in that regard but it's like being on a short entertaining thrill ride. This movie has badass written all over it. With the leader of the 300 Leonidas(Gerard Butler) becoming a iconic movie character. Quite a bit of the phrases has now become iconic phrases as well that people like to say or shout out. Sure when it comes to the story it doesn't have a lot of substance, but it has enough meat that just about any carnivores can chew down on and enjoy the feast with. When it comes the the environment it's mostly CGI and there is slow motion fight scenes, but I thought it was integrated and utilized so well in this. Sure, slow motion has been done before, but this brought in something new. What this movie does bring to the audiences, is basically guilty pleasure and it delivers in so many levels. What this movie is a war movie with Spartans that fight as a unit going up against the Persian army that outnumber them by huge numbers and it's awesome. This is a great adaptation from comic book to movie form that any movie goers that want to have a bloody good time can enjoy.<br/><br/>8.6/10"

","300 tells the story of the Battle of Thermopylae, a battle fought between the Spartans and the Persians. King Leonidas leads soldiers into a battle where they are greatly outnumbered, and there is no way for them to come out of the battle alive. Along the way they battle many different groups of powerful warriors. These battles are what the movie focuses on. It's filled with action from the beginning of the movie until the very end. The way these action scenes are made makes them seem so real and adds to the greatness of this movie. The special effects are done in such a way that brings the movie to life and makes you feel like you are right there on the battlefield. The battlefield is made to look very real as well. The acting is also very well done. You feel as if these people are actual soldiers fighting a real battle. You also cannot help but admire the courage that the soldiers have to go out and fight a battle that they cannot win. That's why the main thing that makes this movie worth watching is the heroism portrayed throughout the entire movie.<br/><br/>The first example of heroism is through the Spartans facing an elite group of warriors called the Immortals. These warriors were known to be so powerful that no one could defeat them. The Spartans even saw the destructive power of these warriors early in the movie when they came across a village that was attacked by these fearsome warriors. The village was destroyed with no survivors except one young child that collapsed into the King's arms. Despite that, the Spartans bravely faced them and even proved that these warriors were not immortal after all. One of the Immortals was a giant monster-like creature, that was so dangerous they had him chained up until they needed him to fight. The giant even took out some of his own people when he was released. The King fought this giant and showed no fear doing so. When he was losing to the giant, another Spartan bravely jumped in to help his king. The King also fought this giant without a weapon.<br/><br/>The next display of heroism that I saw in the movie was that the 300 Spartans agreed to go fight the battle knowing that they would die. They knew that there was no chance of them returning from this battle and yet they still went out and fought. Some of the Spartans that fought were still very young. One warrior sent his own son to the battle. Leonidas even notes at how young the man's son is early in the movie. The soldiers did not even show any fear when going into the battle. In fact, they were excited to go and battle for their king and their country. One soldier even hoped that one of the enemy soldiers would be able to kill him because he has hoped to be killed in battle for a long time. In the end when they face the enemies for the last time, the Spartans ran into the battle without any fear.<br/><br/>I felt that this movie had a very important meaning. The meaning is that you should always fight for what you love. The soldiers loved their country and they wanted to protect it with their lives. They fought and died to protect it. They also not only fought to protect their country, but also to protect the pride of their country. They were challenged by Persia and they could not just sit around and do nothing. They had to protect their pride and meet Persia's challenge. It took a lot of courage for the soldiers to go out into the battlefield and fight for their pride. The great heroism shown in this movie is just one of the great things about this movie. It was a joy to watch, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone that enjoys heroic tales or history movies."
"toll-8","7","1","4","14 March 2012"," See for the visuals alone!
","Zack Snyder is a director with a lot of potential. This was his second film after the Dawn Of The Dead remake but since this he has moved on to direct Watchmen and Sucker Punch, both with great visual effects that wow audiences, and he is working on the Christopher Nolan produced Superman reboot Man Of Steel as we speak. 300 was his first effort with the comic book visuals. It has been done before with a previous Frank Miller comic book adaptation in Sin City, but here we have it on a different scale entirely. Here we witness epic battles as if they were a moving comic book.<br/><br/>300 is about the war at Thermopylae in 480 B.C., which was fought between the Spartans and the Persians. The Persian army has begun to take over Greece and requests that King Leonidas of the Spartan's (Butler) joins in his new empire. Leonidas however realises that this would mean slavery for his women and children and this he can't accept, so he declares war on the Persian Empire which consists of one hundred thousand warriors. Due to Leonidas' disrespect, the King of Persia marches to take Sparta but Leonidas recruits 300 Spartan men, plus 700 Thespian soldiers, and blockades them in a narrow valley which will mean numbers mean nothing. For three days the Spartans hold off the barbaric attacks from the Persians, whilst back in his homeland his wife comes under attack by other Spartans who aim to take over Leonidas' thrown. It is a fairly simple plot as all it really sets up is a lot of battle sequences, and I tell you now this is the plus side about this movie.<br/><br/>The film does have a story but it doesn't ever go off on tangents nor have many sub-plots. There is little character development or back story and very minimal realistic dialogue. (Some of the dialogue is good it just sounds very preachy). The film isn't about the lack of key elements I have described above; it is all about the epic battle scenes and the togetherness of the Spartan army that will fight till the death.<br/><br/>It does simply consist of battle after battle. The short talky scenes in the middle are a little dull and you only ever want to see the fight scenes, and when they happen you are not disappointed. We see slow motion shots of decapitations, spears landing in chests, blood splattering over the floor in a comic book fashion. It is such a different take on a battle film. The colours are stunning, the reds and yellows really bring a different visual film. It is worth a watch for the visuals alone. You shouldn't be put off by the content of the film. The epic battle films are not my favourite genre, but if you put up with that for the sake of the brilliant visuals of this film you may change your mind.<br/><br/>The acting is also top notch. All actors take on their roles brilliantly and I actually believed that they were in fact Spartan warriors and not the actual actor. Butler is lost in the role and we actually see the Spartan he is betraying. That may be because he is hiding being a bushy beard and a rippling six pack though. The only time he becomes recognisable is when he shouts his epic line, 'this is Sparta', which we have all come to know him for since the release of this film. All the other actors are also great in their roles and we also get a very good Michael Fassbender in a side role. Little did he know back then what brilliance awaited him.<br/><br/>The film is a good watch. You will be confused and lost by much of it, like when the Persian leader is fully pierced, or at the Quasimodo look a like's cameo, but you will be completely enthralled by the battles. I know little about the history of this moment, but as far as I'm concerned I have seen what I wanted to know. The visuals are breath taking, the direction and acting brilliant, the camera work ace. See it for those reasons and you can forget about the lack of anything else it really has.<br/><br/>3.5 / 5<br/><br/>For more reviews: www.tolli-movieworld.blogspot.com"
"dirkwildenborg","4","1","4","23 June 2011"," 300 - Stylized crud
","300 (2006)<br/><br/>The movie starts with a very nice introduction. We get an impression of how Spartan culture works and also immediately, through showing the encounter with the wolf, the visual style of the movie.<br/><br/>Then we get to the scene were Leonidas is told he has a visitor. An officer seems to have specifically come to tell him about this. He doesn't say anything relevant and it's the woman who tells Leonidas about it. Notice also how the movie somewhat forces on us the cycle of Spartan life as we are now shown the boy being trained by his father. Okay.<br/><br/>Things start to go south as soon as the messenger comes to Leonidas. First of all, the tone the messenger comes with is not befitting a messenger at all. Why is he asking for trouble? He seems to propose Leonidas a deal that I could have told him beforehand, taking into account the Spartans and all, was not going to amount to much. Taking that into account, also the dramatic tone Snyder tries to create with Leonidas glancing over his people and all really misfires because there simply is no place for this kind of emotion (yet) because there has not yet been established any drama. So the messenger, who acts wooden, gets kicked into a pit I certainly wouldn't like to have in the middle of my village. Also, how he managed to get himself into the position of standing right in front of the well is baffling. So Leonidas's infamous 'This is Sparta' heralds the messenger's doom. Notice how for some reason Snyder found it necessary for Leonidas to in a way seek his wife's approval first. We get it, women are important to Spartans. You don't have to force this on us as well. As the guy falls into the pit in slow motion look at the messenger's lackeys. They just stand there, not even responding to what's happening. Not even in slow motion. No reflex, no instinctual turning of the head. Odd. Maybe the blue screen made it hard to act properly.<br/><br/>So then the scene ends and there's some terrible transition to Leonidas climbing up a hill. The shift of tone, color scheme and environment comes off as jarring to me. <br/><br/>So then we get an entire ordeal with these ugly guys of which I really don't get the use. I mean what does it add to the movie. Can't the Spartans just lure Xerxes into this trap without some kind of endorsement from unimportant and uninteresting ugly people? I don't get why this is in the movie at all. We could just cut it out and the movie would be just as good. <br/><br/>Then there's S e x. Because if we want to sell a movie then it's got to have sex. I guess it's only convenient that the relationship between men and women is so important to Spartans so that we can have a proper way to excuse this boring pornography. <br/><br/>So then we get a drawn out shot of the Spartans going to war. Snyder again loads this shot with all kinds of unnecessary emotion, among other things by again bringing Leonidas' wife into the frame.<br/><br/>They go to set up camp. No sleep for the king. Why not? How about using patrols so that they can all get some sleep? Even Spartans should get tired from sleep deprivation. I guess it's an effort to power Leonida's image. <br/><br/>So then this kid pops up and is allowed to move straight to the king. Let's suppose he had a knife with him. He could have injured Leonidas pretty easily. Probably wouldn't have killed him, but, you know, why take the risk? Why Leonidas then carries the kid around with him boggles my mind. There's so little that actually happens in this scene but it's all loaded with clutter as it meanders on and on. <br/><br/>They enter Persian territory and it's introduced by a lot of irrelevant bullshit about Poseidon and what not. Again an attempt to fortify Leonidas' image by showing how he remains calm amidst all of this chaos. Plenty of CGI shots at every turn that don't do anything for the plot. <br/><br/>This emphasis on style has to stop. It does not excuse a director from lacking in all other departments.<br/><br/>So I heard this thing about Zack Snyder liking to implement gay stuff and all and I kinda get where this is coming from because this Xerxes guy's depicted as having gay traits. Yeah let's be honest, this guy is supposed to be some kind of homosexual and it bothers me a lot. Not only because Snyder has to implement this in the movie, but mostly because Xerxes happens to be a sleasy, nasty, cowardish, lame, dishonest jackass with the word gay stamped all over THAT. Now I know people are going to take offense and say that by me raising this issue I'm just prolonging the entire thing and in turn, someone will take issue with that and it will be like where you kill a guy and then a detective comes and you kill the detective and then another detective comes and you have to kill that detective too and then a private investigator comes and... aaa! Is this madness? No, its the end of this review. But seriously Zack Snyder, knock it off. I've seen Watchmen, I saw what you did with the giant naked guy... Just knock it off man."

","What a strange and at the same time fascinating movie... I never was a fan of movies without any sense, movies that just want to be ""cool"". And so I expected the worst from 300. But I was somewhat surprised when I saw it. First you must know: if you are someone, who hates movies with stupid plots really hard, then you won't like 300. But if you are someone, who also gives such movies a chance, you should watch it. 300 has no story with surprising twists, dramatic highlights or something like that. 300 is simply a comic-style-war-movie. But unlike similar works like ""King Arthur"" oder ""Troy"", which somehow failed because they were stupid and had no style, 300 manages to be incredibly cool in dialogs and visual appearance. In fact, this is the only movie that wins by looking great, and nothing else.<br/><br/>I can understand, that many people don't like the movie, but if you give the art of how it appears a chance, you may like it."
"qqmoarr","1","1","4","5 January 2010"," Horrible
","When I first saw the trailer for 300, I thought, ""This movie seems pretty epic. I might check it out next weekend."" However, after I had watched 300, I wanted my money back. There are so many flaws in this movie that I don't even know where to start. I'll start with the action, because it is what this movie is most well known for.<br/><br/>I always cringe when I think of this movie's special effects and action scenes. I'm guessing that over half of this movie's running time is in slow motion. All of the fight scenes just phase to slow motion, go back to normal time, go to slow motion, back to normal time, and so on. I usually enjoy fight scenes like this, but the action was just so repetitious that I got bored in 10 minutes. It was literally like this: Spartan guy runs forward and stabs Persian in the chest in slow motion. Then, he runs towards another Persian and stabs him through the chest. Next, he dashes forward and chops off a Persian's head. This sequence repeats itself over and over again. BORING.<br/><br/>Now onto the characters, if you could call them that. Throughout the film, I saw them (the Spartans) as invincible supersoldiers who run around naked. It was simply impossible for me to actually like any of the Spartan characters, because they were pretty much invulnerable robots. The Persians on the other hand, were portrayed as weak barbarians who've never seen swords before. They were like robots too. The only character who I actually didn't hate was that hunchback guy. He actually showed some emotion (unlike the Spartans and Persians), but the ""story"" didn't go deep enough for me to actually give a damn about him.<br/><br/>This paragraph is supposed to be dedicated to dialogue. Except that there was almost none in 300 except for the infamous line, ""This is madness... THIS IS SPARTA!!!"" which is made fun of all over the internet. The rest of the dialogue in this movie (maybe 10 lines or so) is conveyed without a single shred of emotion.<br/><br/>The only aspect that I actually liked in this film was the sound effects/music. The sound effects were pretty good; the sounds of swords clanging and the screams of dying Persians were very realistic sounding. The music was also amazing. However, if you want to hear the music in this film, go look up the soundtrack. Stay away from the movie.<br/><br/>""What about the historical aspect of this film?

The last time I checked, 300 Spartans never held back 1 million Persians for several days during the Battle of Thermopolae (spelling?). The last time I checked, Spartans didn't go into battle wearing nothing but loincloths. The last time I checked, Xerxes wasn't this 10 ft tall naked man who wore hundreds of body piercings. You get my point? There are just so many historical inaccuracies in 300 that it would take me over a day to list them all.

Any beginner student of History nows that those values and principles were not adopted or even known at that time in Sparta (Sparta was a kind of military dictatorship by the way.

","Every once in a while, one of those films come along that just completely blows you away and ends up being one of your favorite films of all time. For me, 300 is definitely not one of those films. The slow motion action is annoying. The over-use of computer effects to create environments is annoying (un-like Sin City). The acting is terrible. Gerald Butler is actually not that bad of an actor, but because the script, the director, and the original source of the graphic novel, he was bound to act poorly. When I saw the film in theatres, I tried my best to like the film. I was trying to view it as a different kind of film to consider. But by the time the film got to that scene where that hunch-backed thing was talking to the Egyptian king, I stopped liking the film. The worst movie ever made!"
"js6807","7","1","4","10 March 2008"," Why the negativity
","Im not sure why so many people gave such terrible reviews of this movie. This movie is told from the point of view of a narrator. When we tell stories we tend to exaggerate what really happened to make the story more appealing. Leonidas tells the narrator to make sure the people remember the story, so yes he adds things like ogres and elephants and rhinos in order to make the story sound more glorious for the troops he was telling. For those who whine about lighting and effects. DID YOU SEE SIN CITY? If you did not like that then why the hell did you think you would like 300 in the first place. The truth is that this movie does what it needs to and it entertains you. No it is not going to be historically accurate. Would you rather watch a movie where they stay in their formation and just stab for 2 hours? Have you seen a movie that is based on history that is 100% accurate? Despite all that there were some flaws, such as the overuse of slow motion scenes, some of the dialog was pretty out of place for the time period. Even with those flaws the special effects were just phenomenal, the battle scenes spectacular. I recommend this to any one who is looking for a kick ass good time and is not into movies for deep artsy spiritual meaning"
"mikey-quinn6","Null","1","4","27 February 2008"," 300, pro-bush?, racist? highly doubt it.
","I must say, I've never heard that 300 is a ""pro-bush statement"" given that it is a film about a battle taking place 2 thousand years before there was a Britain never mind an America,and as for racist? the simple fact is that they're would have been no blacks in the spartan army, or any of the Greek city-states armies considering that Greeks are white, are we to believe that black people should have been added to the spartan army simply for political correctness? ridiculous.<br/><br/>Now for actual reasonable criticism, the movie is made in such a way as to be a comic book in film form, every scene is a panel from the 300 graphic novel, every gush of blood is meant to be dramatic, every move, every character is meant to be dramatic. The dialouge apart from being in English, is probably much the same as it would have been in Ancient Greece, they were very fond of witticisms.

I was dreading it being another 2 hour long 'Lord of the Rings' battlefield epic but it wasn't. The whole Spartan thing was great, and I thought the scene where the young king was growing up was very interesting. The action scene were quite typical, lots of arms being chopped off and decapitations but it was slightly different and made it very captivating to watch. Xerxes was a very very creepy enemy, very feminine to look at but a body of a fierce god and the voice like Candyman - very scary. <br/><br/>300 is not the best film ever but definitely worth a look!

The visuals, the soundtrack, the action...the elements of this film combine to deliver a powerhouse jab of adrenalin to the viewer. This is truly a unique experience but there are some similarities to the other Miller vehicle, ""Sin City"". Both films utilise green-screen technology to tell their story in a dramatic, escapist fashion and emulate their comic book origins.<br/><br/>Gerard Butler was born to play King Leonidas. It's the role of a lifetime and he breathes real life into this historical character. The supporting cast are also magnificent.<br/><br/>What really makes Miller's tale so enjoyable is the introduction of fantasy elements to the Battle of Thermopylae. These escapist touches are truly excellent and make for a gripping viewing experience.<br/><br/>10 out of 10. Unmissable action and epic storytelling.

The title refers to the three hundred Spartans, who fought, and died, in the Batle of Thermopylae. Thermopylae. Greek for Gates of Heat, was the key to the Greek victory. The Battle of Salamis, the turning point of the war, was two months later. However, the movie didn't end with the Athenian victory at Salamis. It ended with the Greek victory at Plataea. That was the last stand of the Persians in Greece. Why did Xerxes invade Greece? Revenge. Ten years earlier, Darius, Xerxes' father, had invaded Greece and lost the Battle of Marathon. Darius was planning another invasion of Greece but died before he could do so. This was dropped into the lap of his son, Xerxes, to do. Ephialtes, the Greek traitor, was portrayed as a hunchback. Whether he was or not, I can't say. The name has become a Greek synonym for fear."

"secretagent_007","9","1","4","28 November 2007"," 300 Not Deep, Just Awesome
","This movie gets a lot of a flak and I don't know why. People from wherever claimed that it had some political agenda, or that it was racist, or heaven forbid, it was historically inaccurate. Anything but that! It is a movie made by Zack Snyder, director of the Dawn of the Dead remake, and Frank Miller, creator of Sin City. I don't mean to make them sound like dolts or anything, but I feel like these two men are less concerned with politics than they are with telling a thrilling story in a cool way.<br/><br/>In case you don't know by now, 300 is the story of 300 Spartan soldiers who fought to defend Greece from a Persian invasion. It's been told before in Fox classic The 300 Spartans, which allegedly informed Miller's writing more than the actual history of Greece. While that movie is a pretty standard swords and sandals epic, 300 is a product of the digital film-making revolution. All but a few shots were filmed on a green screen set and CG is used heavily to create gigantic armies and moments pulled straight from the original graphic novel. But perhaps the movie is best known for inspiring thousands of men across the world to hit the gym a little more often. (I know I did after seeing this.) The 300 are made to look Herculean, like textbook alpha males with arms wider than my waist. They strut around in leather diapers and red capes, smack-talking the ""boy lovers"" in Athens, and likely smacking each other with wet towels when the camera isn't looking. Some call it homophobic or homo-erotic, depending on who's doing the talking. I call the 300 basically a big football team with spears. You will not see more slapped asses than during the Superbowl.<br/><br/>Much has been made of the movies political leanings too. Some say the Spartan army, fighting for freedom against a Middle Eastern enemy, represents our forces currently fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan. Then some others say that it's the god-king Xerxes and his innumerable forces that stand for the religious George W. Bush and the Christian conservatives he seems to command. I guess then, the Spartans are the American people pushing back tyranny and mysticism. I don't know. People choose to see their personal politics in this movie like people see their future in palm readings. When something (like astrology or 300) can mean so many things all at once, it ceases to mean anything. And that's all right with me. 300 is a rock 'em sock 'em movie with incredible visuals, great fight choreography, and a simple but strong story. I believe this is what Snyder and Miller intended to create - nothing more, nothing less. It's a direct movie that tells its audience what to feel and think outright. If you see anything lurking below the surface, it is merely a reflection of your own fears. Because like a mirror, 300 has no depth.<br/><br/>That sounds too negative to say about a movie I like so much. All I'm saying is come for the great action, stay for some cool dialogue (""Give them nothing, but take from them everything!""), and then leave it all behind. If there is a message within the movie, it's merely that we should stand up for what we believe in. Seems fairly obvious...<br/><br/>http://www.movieswithmark.com"

","I enjoyed the film. The European culture is descendant of the Greek culture.

The quickest reference is in YouTube, (e.g. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SQPQemLmO0) but a thorough search in Internet will give you the idea. There is no copyright for folk-songs, however it would be nice from the authors of the film to cite this somewhere.

","I watched this epic movie in the theatres with a lady-friend of mine WITHOUT ANY expectations at all. She's An horror addict and I'm an action-addict. Did check up on it AKA trailers and whatnot, but couldn't decide what to mean about it. Both of us hadn't any expectations other than we thought it would be 2 hours of entertainment. But when the movie started I was literally hooked from the first scene until the last and so were she. It literally BLEW me away. I, up to this point, considered Gladiator and then Troy to be the best movies in this historic-genre until the day I layed my eyes on this flick. No, it's not historical accurate at all. All of these kinds of movies has some added dramatization (in some kind of way), whether you like it or not. It's Frank Miller's interpretation of the battle of the brave 300 Spartans. I haven't read/watched his cartoon, but that doesn't matter. Robert Rodriguez Did SOOOOOOOOO GOOD with his (Frank Miller) Sin City. What a cult flick if you ask me. 300 came out of the same kind of dust. Sure it isn't a movie for the person that looks for what's wrong in the storyline or what's accurate. Take it as it is. An epic action story that also deals with matters of the heart (Seen from the Spartans wiev). I personally couldn't wait 'till it got out on DVD. 2 months before this got released on DVD, I got hold of a documentary called ""Spartans: The Last Stand Of The 300"". Check it out if you wanna know THE true historic battle. The day of release? You betcha I was there to get hold of the 2-disc Special Edition. I don't EVEN care about any goofs and whatnot. This movie HAS gotta be the best of 2007. Both cinema- and ALSO DVD-wise. If you don't like a lot of action and blood, then don't get this one. To ALL of you OTHERS.... GET IT!!!

Are we to believe that Spartans were naive and unintelligent enough to let their nation be taken over by Persians in that manner? If this movie producer had studied a bit of Spartan history there may have been some more believable scenes and some more real drama introduced.

"fedor8","Null","1","4","27 August 2007"," A straight-forward movie with plenty of testosterone. NOT an invitation to invade 21st-century Iran.
","Regarding the criticism of this movie, much of it seems to stem from Iranians, but also whining liberals and other anti-war Utopians who claim that this is a pro-war/pro-Bush movie. (I wish it were! ALL recent political Hollywood films are anti-Bush.) To actually take a story such as this, based on a comic-book - regardless of the historical aspect which is almost irrelevant here, used just as a backdrop - and find right-wing political propaganda in it is tantamount to taking one's own paranoia and elevating it to the level of godhood. This is just a fun action-fantasy yarn. Bleedin'-heart leftists need to take their medication, i.e. calm their fragile nerves. <br/><br/>To all of you who see Bush in every bush, a piece of advice: do not nurture your paranoia with such tender-loving care. Give it a rest now and again. Wake up and smell the real world around you. The way to succeed in this is to just say no to drugs (apart from the prescribed medication for left-wing paranoiacs) and Michael Moore...<br/><br/>I loved the unique visual look of the movie; unlike most sci-fi or fantasy spectacles today where blue/green dominate, here we have plenty of gray, a refreshing change. The machismo wasn't pathetic or stereotypical, but seemed raw, and VERY fortunately there were no effeminate girls like Brad Pitt, Di Crapio, Ryan Philippe, Tobey Maguire, Jack Gyllenhaal, Tom Cruise or Matt Damon to dilute that aspect hence making a joke of the whole movie in the process. Any of these guys is perfect for playing gay cowboys, and one of them even has, but please keep these pansies away from movies about men. Real men were cast here to play real men ¬ñ which is nowadays not only NOT standard practice, but has become as rare as Tim Robbins's brain cells. This was crucial. With a different kind of casting this would have been just another 21st-century big-budget Hollywood piece of crap. To be more precise, I thought that the casting of Gerard Butler did the movie tons of good. I've never seen him before nor even heard of him. Not only was he credible as the ultimate alpha male leader, but I liked his mannerisms and the way he spoke. Occasionally he reminded me of Mel Gibson, for some reason, although his presence is far greater than Mel's. (Mel tends to be a giggling buffoon too often.)<br/><br/>My favourite line in the movie was when Leonidis quipped ""We've been sharing our culture with you all morning"" (to Xerxes).<br/><br/>The battle scenes were very stylish. There was a certain elegance in the way the 300 cut their enemies into little pieces ¬ñ and I hope I don't sound like a psychopath here. I wasn't too surprised that this director did such a good job with the film. I saw his ""Dawn of the Dead"", a horror-movie remake; that movie also had some rather memorable action sequences, especially very early on.<br/><br/>As far as the non-battle scenes are concerned, I would say the most enjoyable ones were Leonidis's first encounter/dialogue with Xerxes, and the moment when the former's wife stabs the Spartan traitor in the Council (that was totally unexpected). A good aspect was that the movie was so simple plot-wise. No unnecessary bla-bla, because this is not the kind of movie where that would have been suitable. It is straight-forward, just like the attitude/mind-set of the 300."

Whilst this is fun for, say, an hour at the most, it eventually becomes tedious in the extreme.<br/><br/>With its CG rendered backdrops, beautiful lighting and faultless cinematography, 300 is visually arresting¬ó like classic Renaissance art brought to life¬óbut when applied to virtually every frame of the movie, this level of aesthetic perfection also starts to become tiresome. Likewise, an overuse of slow-motion drains the carefully composed battle sequences of life, leaving the viewer emotionally detached from what should be thrilling cinema. Used sparingly, these techniques can have a tremendous effect on the power of a movie, but Snyder has obviously forgotten that sometimes less is more and overcooks the whole damn mess.<br/><br/>It's a shame really, since Snyder had shown so much promise with his first movie, the impressively scary remake of Dawn of the Dead. And there is so much about 300 that could and should be praised (the set design, the amazing costumes, and realistic make-up and effects), that it makes it even harder for me to report that I was hugely disappointed by this overblown and rather pretentious 'blockbuster'.<br/><br/>A word of advice, Zack... next time, concentrate on telling a decent story, shoot enough footage so that you can afford to show the film at normal speed, lose the CGI blood, and get some decent actors.... if you screw up the long-awaited Watchmen adaptation, it might mean the end of your career."

","I saw this movie three times before posting this. And after watching it for the third time I am still shocked. I saw Sin City and of course I expected a great movie but what I got is one the best movies of the past five or ten years. It blew me away. I read the comic and I am a big fan of Frank Miller and 300 is my favorite comic. Many people are saying that this is a pro American or a pro war movie. And when you think about it you realize that it's complete nonsense. The Spartans fought for their country, home, tradition and freedom. They were the defenders and not the attackers. And if you ask me this doesn't sound pro American at all. All lot of you say that the script is awful. If you read the comic you wouldn't be talking that. Also this movie contains a great crew, a great cinematography, a great soundtrack and a great vibe. So you could say this is a great movie or you could even say this is one of the greatest movie of all time. But if you really understood this movie, if you understand Miller and his comics you'll just say: ''THIS IS SPARTA''"
"The_Amazing_Spy_Rises","10","1","4","29 April 2007"," The Best Movie Theater Experience of the 2000's
","300 is by far the most entertaining movie that I've seen in my life. Never before have I been reeled in like this by a film. Zack Snyder took Frank Miller's epic masterpiece and has brought it on screen in a beautiful and mesmerizing way that can only be described as epic. 300 is as good as epic film making gets, with an extraordinary Gerard Butler carrying the film all the way.<br/><br/>A Spartan man is born and taught to believe only one thing. Honor. The greatest thing a Spartan can do is die for his country, his Sparta. Now, with the threat of takeover and slavery by the Persian Godking Xerxes, Spartan King Leonidas (Butler) must lead the 300 best soldiers he has into battle against Xerxes' massive army of millions against the will of the Spartan politicians, in the hope that they can preserve honor, glory, and freedom.<br/><br/>First off, Gerard Butler is perfectly cast as King Leonidas. I simply cannot imagine what the film would have been like without him, nor can I imagine any other actor in the role. Butler commands the screen with a mammoth presence that you won't be able to disregard. His voice, his power, his delivery...all of it is absolutely perfect for the movie. You'll have no doubt in your mind that this magnificent actor is a king. He creates an amazing character in a film that is more about the fight than the people involved. That's one of director Zack Snyder's biggest strongpoints. He balances the story of the 300 as a whole and individual character stories extremely well. We get the most insight into Leonidas, obviously, but there are also a portion of other characters that get their fair share of development, including Queen Gorga of Sparta (Lena Headley) and King Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro). David Wenham also provides a mystical and perfect voice as Dilios and the narrator of the film. Headley provides a strong female character that is very similar to Leonidas, and is extremely believable. Rodrigo Santoro is somewhat cheesy, yet powerful as Xerxes, but it's not his fault if he seems too out of place. His body is edited by computers to look massive, as is his voice (it still fits, however). Santoro's base acting however, is very good, and he provides another interesting and unique character. It leaves one to wonder if the real Xerxes was actually like that. Also delivering a worthy performance is Vince Regan as Leonidas's right hand man, the captain.<br/><br/>Director Zack Snyder...thank you. This film is absolutely beautiful, including the actors. Every Spartan is chiseled like a statue, and the lone female character is beautiful as well. The battle scenes are extraordinary considering most of the film was shot on blue screen. The movie feels like a comic book in the camera angles and how at times the battles are shown in slow motion, especially when focusing on one character. The scenes are gory and very bloody, however, featuring a couple decapitations and the removing of limbs. Some of Xerxes' soldiers push fantasy and reality to the limit, especially The Immortals. The music is downright incredible as well, with a nice mix of soft tracks and of course, heavy metal battle sounds. It's a soundtrack you'll want to own as soon as the movie's finished. Snyder now has proved to the world that he can make one hell of a movie as far as entertainment goes. Every man in the world will enjoy this film and love it for months on end. Most women should like it as well, probably because every Spartan soldier, even the older ones, look in perfect physical condition. It's a tale of honor, freedom, and never, ever giving up. 300 is a masterpiece of epic proportions that shouldn't be missed for any reason. It is perfect.<br/><br/>10/10 --spy"

","If you manage to forget the score and plentiful golden wheat fields - both lifted from 'Gladiator' - plus the array of strange fighting creatures 'inspired' by 'Lord of the Rings', you may find enough in this film to keep you occupied. I managed to watch it all but by halfway through, couldn't really care less about Leonidas and his men, such was the overkill on the heroic speeches and shouts of 'Spartans!' as well as hyperbolic statements on Sparta's great history. I realize the film is based on a graphic novel but some of these graphic novel adaptations ('Sin City' included) need more than fancy CGI to engage audiences at any meaningful level."
"ksmith9232","2","1","4","23 April 2007"," Seen it somewhere before
","The only thing not plagiarized (from The Lord of the Rings trilogy, to Braveheart, and a bunch of others) was the sound. At least those all had a story line, this didn't, and that's the shame. This was one of those pivotal points in history. Had the Spartans not acted, at that particular place, and at that particular time, the Persians would have stopped Greece from becoming what it did and the world would not be what it is today. Instead of playing that card, or even developing the love story line, they went for the gore.<br/><br/>AND, then the sound ¬Ö how sad. Maybe there was a story line, but I couldn't tell because of the mumble factor. I agree that the sounds of battle are loud and some lines must be spoken softly, but what I heard was either over-modulated screaming (so loud I put my fingers in my ears) or soft mumbling (followed by audience members asking one another, ""What did they say?""). The overall effect was a silent movie ¬ñ acting by facial expression ¬ñ which in this movie was ""glare at me and I'll glare right back at you"". The dialogue, including the narration, could not be followed. And the music was poorly edited, which all too often distracted and was often inappropriate. What ever happened to sound as an integral part of the movie? Like lighting, sound is meant to enhance the experience of the final product. Seems to me that, somewhere along the way sound has become an afterthought.<br/><br/>Not such a great movie for me. If one star means asking for my money back, I give it two stars."
"asalem182","7","1","4","22 April 2007"," The Critic and the Geek
","Every film is made for a reason. Some films are made to entertain, others to educate. I'm sure Zack Snyder (the excellent Dawn of the Dead remake) had one thing on his mind when he was making 300; create the most faithful comic book movie yet. Sin City, another film based on a Frank Miller comic book that was shot using bluescreens, was criticized for being ""style over substance"". 300 takes that concept to the next level. In 300, the style is the substance. The film is a shot-for-shot adaptation of the comic book. In fact, some shots are lifted directly from the graphic novel (the scene where the Spartans push their enemies off a cliff comes to mind). Needless to say, the film, which tells the story of the Battle of Thermopylae between 300 Spartans and (estimated) 1 million Persians, is extremely beautiful to look at. Imagine visiting Le Louvre and you're pretty close. Every single frame is like a painting.<br/><br/>Some people have been talking about how the action genre is dead. 300 proves them wrong. Basically, the second half is one massive fight, with limbs flying, heads spinning, and blood splattering across the frame. As you might expect, the film is pretty violent, so if you're a parent, you might want to leave the kids at home. Snyder shines in those action scenes. He has a lot of tricks up his sleeve. Slow mos, fast forwarding, zooming, and rapid-fire cuts are all used to perfection. And hats off to whoever choreographed the fights. They were poetic.<br/><br/>With the visuals being at the top of the filmmakers' agenda, characterization had to take a back seat. All the characters are either black (evil) or white (good), with no shades of grey whatsoever (believe it or not, the most complex character is Ephialtes the hunchback, who has about 5 minutes of screen time). Take Spartan king Leonidas (Gerard Butler, in a decent performance) and his army for instance. They spend their whole screen time kicking butts, delivering big speeches and uttering cool lines. OK, so they're fearless and heroic. What else do we know about them? Zip. None. We barely know them, so they don't earn our sympathy. Remember how you were emotionally invested in characters like William Wallace (Braveheart) and Maximus (Gladiator)? I'm fairly confident you won't feel the same way here. Also in some scenes, the film was way too weird for its own good. I mean, I doubt we'll be seeing a man-goat rocking out in any other film this year.<br/><br/>I really don't know how to grade 300. The geek in me, who has seen the film 3 times so far and has a giant 300 poster hanging down his wall, wants to give it a 10. On the other hand, the ""critic"", who rates films based on plot and characters and whatnot, wants to give it 4 or something. So, I guess my grade should be somewhere in between"
"space_base","10","1","4","21 April 2007"," A ""bloody"" good time!
","""300"" has become the most anticipated film in a long while, and in my honest opinion, it delivers exceptionally.<br/><br/>The film contains some of the most Jaw-dropping special effects and battle sequences I have ever seen, and contains some of the most memorable dialog in film (Our arrows will blot out the sun/Then we shall fight in the shade). Gerard Butler delivers his best, most powerful performance to date, and the supporting lineup including Lena Headey, David Wenham and Michael Fassbener was top notch.<br/><br/>I loved the dialog (which has been receiving some criticism) and the plot which many thinks is thin. I don't know what people were expecting from the straightforward plot of ""300"" to which most everyone knows the outcome, but I found it to be tight and engaging from start to finish.<br/><br/>""300"" isn't perfect- I think it should have been at least a half-hour longer, and the action could have been more varied (less spears to the chest, and more sword limb severing) but I can't really nit-pick on a motion picture this thrilling.<br/><br/>It may not be the next Spartacus, but ""300"" is a bloody good time. It's the most fun, and the most eye gluing experience I've had at the theater since ""Sin City."" Highly Recommended"
"SirSaeed","1","1","4","18 April 2007"," What was the purpose of this movie?
","It seems to be, because of the speed of producing the movie (in 2 months) and the companies which supported the movie, that always support politically oriented movies, it exactly shows that the movie produced by political reasons, it was trying to show Iranian people are wild and they are terrorists, they showed full disrespects to Persian people and even Indian & African & black people.. (Here King Xerxes showed mostly like a clown.. If you just looked at one of the historical monuments which remained since 2500 years ago, you could guess better about the appearance of the Persian Kings! And Persians never used elephants, rhinoceros or monsters... In their Army) they tried to show that, Persia (IRAN) is the greatest enemy of West and so on.. But it is clear to the professional movie watchers that it was B..t as a whole, and it showed manipulated historical events, like fantasy and Sci-Fi movies, I'm really ashamed as a mankind in 21st century, we are not mature enough, in understanding our situation yet which we should respect each other's history and culture and learn from it, however although it had nothing about real historical events which really happened, but had so many great scenes of digital effects for whom watch movies for colors not for what's inside of it, they will love this movie for the technology that has been used in it.."
"valadas","5","1","4","18 April 2007"," Just only good visual impact
","We learned at school while studying ancient history that in 480 b.C. 300 Spartans commanded by their king Leonidas stood in the way of a huge Persian army in the Thermopylae pass thus preventing it of invading Greece at the cost of their lives after a fierce battle. That story is narrated in this movie in beautiful images (although some of them awful indeed) of fierce fights sometimes in an almost ballet style. It seems however that there is the intention of presenting the Greek-Persian war as a fight between tyranny and freedom (with the meaning these concepts have nowadays) which is little true regarding the epoch in question when those notions didn't exist with the meaning they have today. Sparta was an aristocratic monarchy and even in Athens (so often called the cradle of democracy) only the citizens (which were a minority among its population) enjoyed civil and political rights. Going now back to the combat scenes it must also be said that there is much fancy in them namely in the characterization of the Persian army where inclusively we can see monsters similar to those that appeared in ""Lord of the Rings"". The impersonation of the king Xerxes of Persia like an effeminate being full of piercing objects is quite ridiculous and very unconvincing. And for instance the ephors who were respected magistrates and political leaders in ancient Sparta are here presented as pestilential and repulsive priests living on the top of an almost inaccessible mountain. This movie doesn't convey therefore any solid message according to the historical truth and it's only worth by the beauty of some of its images. We must refer namely to those with the sepia tones of the old photos."

"stephenwebster-1","8","1","4","13 April 2007"," Forget the criticism, go and see the movie and judge for yourself.
","I think most people writing here are missing the point of this movie. It is not intended to be historically accurate as it is an adaptation of a comic. In comics you tend to have a plot that essentially boils down to 'good versus evil' and in the case of 300 the 'good' side is played by the Spartans and the 'bad' is played by the Persians. As in most comics the good side are portrayed as being superhuman with the evil side as the complete opposite. And in the movie this was very evident in the hugely muscled, highly moral freedom loving Spartans vs the asexual, amoral, drug taking tyrants that were the Persians. Now my point is that this is in no way relevant to real life in fact the Spartans did keep slaves (this is how spartan men could devote themselves to training as warriors) and so it is fatuous to claim that this movie intended to be taken seriously as an historical epic....it is a comic book adapted to the big screen. You may as well complain that Superman should be criticised because people really can't fly or that the planet krypton doesn't exist.<br/><br/>As for why I gave 300 8 out of 10 my reasons are simple. The movie contains some powerful acting, amazing visual effects and was all in all a very entertaining and enjoyable movie. Yes it is shallow, the plot is simply '300 Spartans die' and you already know the ending. But my advice is simple, put this to one side, sit back and enjoy 300 for what it is."
"giant_killers329","10","1","4","13 April 2007"," Damn! What a film!
","So my dad and I were bored the day after Easter and when we get to the movies '300' was the only thing starting within the next hour...so we thought 'What the hell! If it sucks, we can always leave!' Needless to say it didn't suck...and we certainly didn't leave.<br/><br/>The story is simple enough...the Persians are invading Greece and top of their hit list is Sparta, where all the men wear tiny little leather underpants and are ripped like pro-wrestlers. Seriously hot! So, the Persians, under the command of the self proclaimed 'God-king' Xerxes (a creepily effeminate Rodrigo Santoro) send a particularly arrogant messenger to try and talk the King of Sparta, King Leonidas (the ever gorgeous Gerard Butler) into surrendering without a fight. First mistake. And the second is a whopper...the guy offends the King's wife, Queen Gorgo (Lena Headly). So Leo gets cranky and kicks em down a well! As you do. <br/><br/>What ensues is 117 minutes of unadulterated violence and machismo...and its stunning! Butler as King Leo is a force to be reckoned with, his gruff voice, fierce looks and ridiculously defined pecks making him every inch the graphic novel hero. Vincent Regan (Achilles attendant in Troy, yep, that's where you recognize him from) is Leo's right hand man as Captain, a tempered voice of reason, who also brings his son...as he says 'He is my oldest, I have others.' Gorgeous Aussie David Wenham is Dilios, and his sultry tones narrate the tale in parts, providing background for those of us not familiar with the original text. Dominic West turns in a particularly slimy appearance as Theron, a Spartan politician who want Leo out on his gorgeous and incredibly muscular backside! <br/><br/>The casting is magnificent, the story fast-paced and exiting and the visual effects mark a new era in film making. Without a doubt the most visually stunning film I have ever seen, and when you consider it was filmed almost entirely against a blue screen and the only scene that was filmed on location is within the first 10 minutes, the awe factor goes up several notches. <br/><br/>Well worth your money, but not for the faint hearted as there is plenty of violence and blood to be had. But if that doesn't worry you, you're in for a treat!"

Boy was I wrong, the backgrounds were so well done that unless you knew they were animated you wouldn't notice.

"smaugh-1","8","1","4","11 April 2007"," Entertaining and visually stunning
","What to expect when you go to this movie? Visuals. Beautiful, stunning, mind boggling visuals. And some extremely thrilling scenes, too - I sat at the tip of my seat from the moment the fight starts right up to the end. This movie is all about the spectacle and I'm afraid some of the people that gave this movie a lousy review really didn't get that. There isn't very much character-development, no, but somehow, that didn't quite surprise me... This being a movie with posters including roaring Spartans, bloodstains all over and tag lines such as ""Tonight we dine in hell!"".<br/><br/>You have to be aware of the fact that this movie is shot from the view of the only surviving Spartan from the battle, being sent away by his king to tell the story of the battle that was fought by him and his brothers in arms. This might put the way the Persians were portrayed in a different perspective: they are described from the eyes (or, in this case, eye) of the beholder and the beholder, in this case, was ready to fight these Persians to the death to defend what was dear to him (hence, perhaps, the 'racism'??). Another big point of criticism: Xerxes, the Persian king, acts like a transvestite, people say. True, but have none seen any reason in this? In this movie, Xerxes doesn't aim to be a mere king.. He aims to be a God. So he acts √†nd looks like one: the Hindu-God Shiva, to be precise. If this doesn't ring a bell, look up some pictures of ancient Shiva-statues and see what I mean. The God-king is made to look like Shiva and even his throne is dedicated to the portrayal of this.<br/><br/>In my opinion, this movie succeeded in almost every possible way in doing what it means to do: it's stunning, exciting, tells a great tale of heroism and leaves you hungry for more. If you're looking for character-development, sentiment or a VERY accurate record of what happened some 2500 years ago, look elsewhere. But if you're looking to be entertained in the most awesome way imaginable, this one's definitely the one for you.<br/><br/>Upsudes: Visuals, very exciting, great story, accurate enough to the main details of the real events, fantastic costumes and sets. <br/><br/>Downsides: Some effects look a bit cheesy, the guy in charge of the slow-motion might have been a little too enthusiastic, if you expect too much of this movie, you'll probably be disappointed.<br/><br/>8/10"

","7/10<br/><br/>SHOULD I, like my good friend and an astonishing number of reviewers here at IMDb, deride this movie on the grounds of what it lacks?<br/><br/>Could I have made it a better movie? Most certainly not. <br/><br/>SO, my comments ought to be centered around what is actually CAN do:<br/><br/>It was a FIREWORKS display of well-choreographed cartoon reality. Cartoon reality is, as we know, often at liberty to twist facts to suit the story. Why this is so with cartoons, and not to the same degree in singularly font-based storytelling, I do not know. But I accept it as a pretext.<br/><br/>I watch movies with my feelings. If a movie manages to convince me of its story - the logical framework being whole, and by this I don't mean not having plot holes, but the story in its entirety - it bypasses my head. This mechanism is not unknown to creators in any line of work. ""I buy it"". Which is the sole purpose of any product. ""I buy into it"" - I accept the reality of it.<br/><br/>I am not well educated, and know next to nothing of the ancient history. Am also well aware of the illusion that those who know not their history are deemed to repeat it ( - ""illusion"", because I see this upholding of History as not keeping anyone from aggression and greed. On the contrary it takes people away from themselves and the moment... Excuse the digression...) And I am aware that what takes place on the screen is a rendition of reality. Of one man (or a small collective of men) 's perception of leftovers from an era long gone, albeit analyzed over and over by academics, but still only one man's version or vision. <br/><br/>That I feel the impact of the movie is due to the fact that this man manages to portray a wholeness. Do I believe it to be true? I do not. It is a version. Am I fulfilled? On some levels, yes - but not like with a Tarkovsky or Coppola (to draw from very different movie-making expressions). ""300"" works. It completes its mission to persuade me to come closer and believe in the story - not as truth, but as movie. BEWARE THE DISTINCTION. <br/><br/>I couldn't care less if this was far from or close to the truth. It takes place in an altogether different universe from the one my forefathers lived in, and had their fun on the battle fields and in the subjugation of the weaker, because they could.<br/><br/>300 is a vehicle for messages about an impression of a or the human condition. Freedom, honour, glory - these definitions need dusting off from time to time in order for us to see something to believe in, which is not controlled by religion or money. What we would term ""inner value"". Okay, so ""300"" defines it as well worth dying for, in order to defend a way of life. Funnily this mechanism is what everyone uses in order to define the term ""human"". <br/><br/>The mechanism. Not the content. Very big distinction. We all put something inside of our definition of human, if we *need* to define it, rather than just be our own best example.<br/><br/>300 is not an altogether bad way of stating an opinion about what is needed.<br/><br/>Okay - bright people can work on pretexts. They can assume a position and argue from that POW. Without being there. And as such be opportunists, who will give the receiving end what the receiving end believes it needs at the moment - without themselves acknowledging anything but the fact that ""these mechanisms work"". <br/><br/>THIS is what I should look for, if in a criticism of this movie I should venture beyond my instinctive reaction. ""Do they themselves believe in their words?"" What say my instinct?<br/><br/>6/10"

The actors were absolutely stunning when it came to the battle scenes. Are third great characteristic of this movie were the actors. OH the actors were the best of the pick. But I can't give them all the credit, the script to that movie was fantastic. There were some of the best quotes I have ever heard or read in that movie. After seeing it all I could think about was the inspiration from that movie and the amazing dialogue that took place in that movie. Not only was the battlefront plot good but the subplot that took place in Sparta was just the cherry on the perfect chocolate cake. It was about Queen Gorgo trying to get the support of Sparta's senate to send more troops to aid King Lionadis in the battle of Thermopylae. The actress who played the Queen was brilliant and the subplot was very good. Although the movie isn't 100% accurate it was still very loyal to the graphic novel.<br/><br/>Now all of this was what made the movie an almost amazing movie but what really put it up to the amazing mark was the ending. If you knew anything about the movie or it's history, you would know that the 300 were all slaughtered on the third day. You knew from the beginning that it was going to happen but when it did I still couldn't keep myself from feeling sad, and anger at the Persians. The movie from beginning to end engrosses you in the plot and battles. After the 300 were slaughtered I thought it should just end and roll the credits but boy am I glad they didn't. The movie was finished with Greek nation's armies of all kind gathered to crush the Persians and then the character yells some of the most wonderful, amazing, incredible, and outstanding dialogue I could imagine.<br/><br/>If you are ever at a movie theater then i definitely recommend going to see 300. The only thing I ask is go into it with an open mind. Don't go into it with a positive or negative attitude and it surly won't disappoint you!!"
"kimidzi","10","1","4","9 April 2007"," Very Frank Miller-esquire
","I thoroughly enjoyed this film. The visuals, soundtrack and cast are excellent and are typical of what you would expect from a Frank Miller novel turned film.<br/><br/>In argument to mike23-4's review, the film makers make it no secret it is not based on historical accuracy from story line to battle field tactics. Like Robert Rodriguez's take on Frank Miller's Sin City, 300 remains true to the graphic novel and proves to be a thrilling watch.<br/><br/>The one slight hitch is the story's bias to the Spartan race and the evident lack of Persian perspective. The bias unfortunately proves to the advantage of a hero versus barbarian type story, something that even Herodotus failed to take into account on this particular topic.<br/><br/>Great fight sequences, beautifully shot scenes and a moving and powerful story 'based on' an historical string of events."
"stubbed_out","10","1","4","9 April 2007"," A testosterone fuelled epic
","300 is a pinnacle film for all styles over substance. quotes are forever memorable and the way in which the film seamlessly flows makes this film easy to follow for those of you who don't want to use much brain power whilst chowing on popcorn in the cinema. the film itself is set at a dark time, the Persians are many an ugly bastard they're advantage in the war is numbers rather than skill, whereas the Spartans are the complete opposite, born and raised into fighting and death, bulging torsos and pretty permanent conservative faces. they simply annihilate anything in their path. You'll be laughing at points, not at nonsensical jokes but at how easily they trudge through any obstacle Xerxes throws at them. the fighting looks cool, especially with added effects like slow-mo which follows a certain warrior chopping up opponent after opponent. in between the fighting, you'll get scenes of pure creative interest, such as the be-header man, and all the other beasts that the Persians come up with. at home, you get a taste of the political life and the dodgy deals that went on, its these scenes which really develop the character of Leonidas' wife. overall the acting is great, each man having his place in the pack. the king of Persia, sees himself as a god and acts wonderfully at this. the way the wife of king Leonidas keeps him calm and acts as his guide is played extremely well, in most films the wife of these ancient civilisation has a pretty light role, but in this it shows how proud they are and that although the men do all the fighting, the women have their places as well. the only bad point about this film is that there isn't really all that much substance or meaning to it apart from the fact Spartans were very much the man's man. however this comes from a comic book and i don't imagine it even needed much meaning because it is in the end, a fun and violent story. A lot of historical films have a similar ending, one where the hero dies, however, in 300, its a tad bit similar but much more clever as the narrator comes in to play a very very important role. i don't want to give anymore away though. i thoroughly enjoyed this festival of a film, as did everyone else I've spoken to about it. make sure you watch it on the big screen with the big sounds because watching it on your laptop isn't going to do it justice. now I'm going to go to the gym and pump some iron."

","There are few words to say how awe inspiring this film is. It is truly brilliant, I know it isn't historically accurate to exactly what happened but it is still good fun and it really is just a great film to sit down and watch especially at the cinema with the sound ringing about you can honestly say that this is one of my top films. All I wanted though was for it to go on longer because I just couldn't get enough. If only the end would go on longer and you could see the next battle that would really be something to see. Altogether though I can honestly say that this has been the best film so far for 2007 I can't wait for others this year but so far this is just the best."
"audible1","7","1","4","7 April 2007"," Blatant Propaganda?
","300 is a visually stunning and graphically violent comic book style depiction of the ill-fated battle between the freedom-loving, politically enlightened Spartans and the evil-hearted, morally bankrupt Persian Empire. Hmmm, why does that sound familiar? I cannot decide if this film is blatant pro-war propaganda or simply illustrates the fact that history (such as is recorded by the victors) is doomed to repeat itself.<br/><br/>The parallels to the present day war on terror are difficult to ignore. Despite the overwhelming congressional sentiment against engagement, (not to mention the illegality highlighted by the ""corrupt"" legislative body), King Leonidas takes his meager Spartan guard, along with a small contingent of supportive (albeit militarily inferior) democratic allies, to battle the hordes of heathen invaders led by the deliciously wicked god-king Xerxes. The Spartans fight valiantly against the odds, but are ultimately defeated at the hands of a traitor (a traitor who had been betrayed by Leonidas himself, mind you). Only then does the rest of civilization take up the fight against world domination and join the crusade for liberty.<br/><br/>I mentioned this to my husband after the movie and he said ""Huh?"" thus illustrating the fact that 300 may be enjoyed on many levels. If you are not a fan of political conspiracy, then you may still be fully entertained by multiple decapitations, fountains of animated slow-motion blood spatters, and a vast array of perverted human deformities ¬ñ not to mention some of THE best nipples this side of Vivid Studios. And for the ladies, there is no shortage of grunting scantily clad manly men sporting six packs where beer guts frequently reside.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I cannot help but wonder why this was not released in the US first???"
"idiot24","2","1","4","7 April 2007"," Leni Riefenstahl on crack
","Seeing that most of the other commentators give a much higher score i guess i have to explain a little what is so deeply disturbing about this movie to me.<br/><br/>Its not the lack of anything that could be called a plot or the excessive violence, its the glorification of this violence with a new aesthetic(half naked muscular men killing heaps of enemy soldiers in slow motion in a graphic-novel-like, surreal color-scheme) and the disturbing way in which the movie never once questions the plainly stupid and dangerous views and values of its Spartan heroes and puts (is it really that glorious to start a war and then die for your pride, fatherland or whatever ?), even more, it seems to take itself completely serious while promoting this.<br/><br/>Now, some will say in defense of the movie that its based on a graphic novel so you shouldn't mind the platitudes and the excessive violence and just enjoy how well it is done, but frankly i cant agree with it. Usually these movies (like Sin City (at least partly), SAW, Constantine, or just your regular low quality splatter movie, all of which i enjoy a lot) come with a healthy dose of irony that will show clearly how to take the content and make the extremes bearable and even enjoyable. This is not the case with 300.<br/><br/>Watching the movie felt a lot like watching propaganda to me. Well made, some beautiful shots, but still propaganda with a stupid and dangerous agenda (hence my summary line)."
"Phases","8","1","4","7 April 2007"," Pretty Good
","I came here and read a number of reviews before going to see the movie tonight. I think the IMDb rating of 8 out of 10 was right on the money. It was a real good movie, but not ""blow you out of your chair"" good.<br/><br/>I suppose I'd say if you liked Braveheart you would like this. It's taken the violence up a notch though, along with some nudity/sex scenes. Not as family friendly. Hence the R rating. That's not to say if you didn't like Braveheart you won't like this though! Between my wife and I we cover both sides of that.<br/><br/>One last thing though for those of you reading reviews before going to see it. We are having a hard time figuring out where one reviewer got the idea it was racist, homophobic, and to drum up support for a war in Iran. There was one line in the movie referencing homosexuality and nothing about racism. The Iran.. thing.. is just stupid. That reviewer needs to look at the region of the world this is set and when in time. And stay away from politics.<br/><br/>Good movie, worth the ticket price."
"darrenturner-1","8","1","4","7 April 2007"," entertaining
","Awesome! A truly entertaining and fun to watch film. I feel that the attacks made on this film for being historically inaccurate are unfair. The film is a mythical take on the story and changes were made to make it a more exciting film to watch. I for one love the manner in which Xerxes' personal armed guards, who in actual history were known as the ""Immortals"", are portrayed in the film as demonic creatures from the ""Blackness"" in order to emphasize their reputation and the fear that they struck in their opponents. Another example would be the exaggerated size of the elephants and the rhino which was done again to put emphasis on the fact that these animals were something new and unlike anything the Spartans have ever had to fight. the fights scenes were some of the most brilliantly done and exciting that I have ever seen.The use of speed changes was incredible. The claims that this movie is anti-Iraque or a political statement about the middle-east is ridiculous. The Persians were made out to be these horrible and beastly people in order to cause the audience to really connect with the Spartan's view of them.If you made a movie were the antagonists were portrayed as a group of people that the audience connected with just as easily as the protagonists then there wouldn't be any tension."

","This is a great action movie which for me had a slightly disappointing final battle. the actions scenes are gory and explicit in there detail with many a warrior losing his head (quite literally). Gerard Butler gives a strong performance as the King and leader of the spartans, and his support cast of mainly unknowns give there all as the action moves from swiftly along. the dialogue is solid if unspectacular but all we really want to see is how many Persian hordes are killed and how. the story differs slightly from the 1960's version in that the 'villan' is actually a spartan rather than a slave, but that is just detail and in a spectacularly graphic film that his not what you have come to see."
"skinnyjoeymerlino","7","1","4","6 April 2007"," Very good for what it is, a comic book fantasy based on real events.
","Zack Snyder's adaptation of Frank Miller's graphic novel 300 turned out to be an unexpected box office hit and was swarmed in controversy from the time it hit theatres. Obvious comparisons can be drawn to Robert Rodriguez's Sin City, also an adaptation of a Frank Miller comic book. Actors were shot in front of a blue screen for sixty days and backgrounds were CGI'ed in during a year of post-production to create a very dark and brooding atmosphere. Male characters are overly muscled in the comic book tradition and what few female characters there are are beautifully curved and scantily clad. Tough hard-boiled characters live and die by a dark philosophical code in the face of unspeakable evil.<br/><br/>The plot line of 300 is taken from the Battle of Thermopylae in 480 BC where 300 Spartan soldiers and an additional number of some thousands of other Greeks (glossed over in this movie) led by Spartan King Leonidas held off an exponentially larger army of the Persian Empire led by Emporer Xerxes for several days before finally being surrounded leaving the 300 Spartans dead to the last man. The battle galvanized the Greeks into uniting as one nation and they ultimately repelled the Persians.<br/><br/>The first twenty minutes or so detail the tough and disciplined upbringing made to mold Spartan boys into warriors which recalls Ridley Scott's Gladiator. Leonidas (Gerard Butler of Phantom of the Opera) is informed that Emporer Xerxes wants him to surrender without a fight by a Persian messenger. The messenger insults Leonidas's wife and is thrown into a bottomless pit. Leonidas consults an oracle who tells him Greece will be conquered or a Spartan king will die. There is nothing left to do, of course, but assemble 300 of the best Spartan warriors and fight to the death.<br/><br/>The action gets underway pretty quickly after that and the carnage begins. The Spartans fight in helmets, brown Speedos, cavalry boots, red capes and nothing else. The Persian army looks very much like the human mercenaries who fought on the side of Sauren's army in Peter Jackson's The Return of the King. One of the Spartans is actually David Wenham who played Faramir in the Rings movies. Blood spatters, heads are chopped off, bodies get stacked up, limbs fly, and Leonidas gives Braveheartesque speeches about honor and glory and freedom in a Scottish accent. More and more fantastic elements are introduced as the battle wears on--giant rhinos and elephants, huge trolls chained until they are released to destroy, hand grenades(?), and one particularly nasty fellow with meat cleavers for arms. Xerxes (played by Rodrigo Santoro of Lost) is around eight feet tall, wears eye shadow and mascara, is laced with chains and body jewelry, and little else, and speaks in what must have been an electronically altered voice that is both effeminate and baritone at the same time.<br/><br/>If the viewer is looking for historical accuracy this isn't it. Several of the speaking parts for Persians are played by Blacks, although Persia was what is now Iran and the Persian Empire never extended into Africa. Leonidas calls the Athenians ""Philosophers and boy-lovers"" but what really stopped the Persian advance was a sea battle fought by Athenians that sank most of the Persian navy. Quite often the 300 seems to be number around 50 in this movie, and the Persian army probably numbered around 300,000, not 2,000,000 as depicted here. The movie has been criticized by the latte liberal crowd as racist and homophobic; as well as celebrated by what is left of enthusiastic supporters of President Bush as a metaphor for the War on Terror: a few devoted REAL MEN defending white civilization against the barbaric brown-skinned horde while liberal surrender monkeys stab them in the back at home . Parallels could actually be drawn to Al Qaeda terrorists as well, with 300 depicting men raised since birth to take their own lives in a struggle against an evil foreign empire of infidels.<br/><br/>Presumably Frank Miller had none of these geo-political concerns on his mind when he put pen to paper and wrote an 88-page comic book about the Battle of Thermopylae. And Zack Snyder probably didn't either when he decided to put it on the big screen. The big screen is the place to really enjoy what is essentially a good rip-snorting action-filled popcorn flick in the tradition of Roland Emmerich's Independence Day. Don't think too much when watching this movie. Sit back, get comfortable, and just go with it."

Most war movies, contemporary or classical, have some sort of depth to them, and this..had none. Great costumes, and make up. Lots of yelling and oddly written one liners.

","If you liked the style of Sin City, but wanted more fantasy violence, and a little homo erotica, this film is hard to beat. Seeing this in an IMAX only underlined how good it looks and sounds. Occasionally the Calvin Klein ad cut scenes did make the film a touch disjointed, but with such a simplified plot there was nothing to think about.<br/><br/>This is yet another style over substance film, one which dedicates itself to a look and feel, not to historical perspective or acting. So one must judge the style; and that is good.<br/><br/>At times the bizarre ""homos vs trannies"" daydream the director was having did start to become flesh. And yes, I did feel that the whole thing may have been intentional anti Asian propaganda. But fortunately the unrelenting CGI did not allow you time to settle on irrelevant details for very long.<br/><br/>Unlike the unsure Gladiator, this film only exists in a single hyperactive tempo - but, as Morrisey says, why pamper life's complexities, when the leather runs smooth On the passenger seat?"

Here, all I have to say, is that it delivers.<br/><br/>The visual effects work perfectly, soundtrack is awesome and acting spot-on. The combat choreography is one of the best I've ever seen. However, the movie suffers from an unevenly paced plot, and several shots could've been better. Especially the ending was very bland, considering the raging macho attitude with which the movie started.<br/><br/>300 tries to balance between aggressive gory war / combat action, and with some deeper-than-life drama. While this might win the acceptance of a larger audience, for me it just didn't work out. The result is an uneven movie that feels just a tad bit unfinished. It's still good, but it could've been so much better with a few minor improvements. Several scenes don't make as much sense as they should even according to the world's own realism, and some script decisions were plain bad from the viewer's point of view, needlessly making things more complicated and / or reducing the emotional charge that was needed. This is especially obvious in the end, unfortunately.<br/><br/>I recommend it, in any case."

","I really don't understand why this film is gathering so much praise, I admit that it's very competently made, the visuals are interesting and well done, but ultimately it's a completely hollow experience. The characters are two-dimensional and ridiculously silly, how can anyone possibly relate to this film? Maybe I'm missing the point, but I wasn't even particularly entertained by any of the action. Some of it, I admit, was fun, but for the most part I was all too aware of myself sitting in a dark room watching what are largely computer animated images. It just didn't suck me in, and I'm disappointed because I thought it would be much better considering all the rave reviews on here. Unfortunately, by the end, I was just slightly bored. I'm not denying that the film has merits, it's still well made for what it is, but at the end of the day this has no right to be in the top 250 and I felt I should just add my two cents seeing as some of my friends were also disappointed.

"swiftnick47","8","1","4","4 April 2007"," Great adaptation!
","This movie should be judged, in my opinion, for how well it's adapted from comic to big screen and not for what It may lack in story, theme or deep philosophical questions. Its no Braveheart or Gladiator, it's 300! and it's, like the comic, there to tell a ""true"", gritty, down and dirty and bloody story, about insane men killing each other in the name of freedom and power...thats it. Frank Millers comic does not try to be anything else but that and so the movie, apart from a few added political scenes, don't either. For what It is, 300 is extremely well made, even cool at times. Visually √çt's stunning and memorable, like nothing I've ever seen before. The comic book too is very ""in your face"" with large drawings of battle-scenes and rugged countrysides painted with an imaginative color-palette. In my opinion, 300 is perfectly adapted from comic to screen, It's an action-packed, well made and well acted, beautifully shot movie that doesn't pretend to be more than what It seeks to adapt. This Is one of those movies you can always watch and enjoy again and again..a bit like Troy really, damn entertaining!"
"jon2005","8","1","4","4 April 2007"," 300
","Zach Snyder, the director of the latest Frank Miller graphic novel adaptation, 300, is not under any illusion as to what kind of film he is creating. Taking the backdrop of a real battle, that of Thermopylae in 480 BC where a group of 300 Spartan soldiers held back the entire Persian invading force for three days allowing the rest of Greece to prepare themselves to fight back, he has decided not to go for an historical film, like Troy, but reverse that films' intentions. Whereas Troy took a mythological story and tries to base it in history, 300 takes an historical event and tries to mythologize it. And Snyder wants us to know that from the start: he says himself that he had no problems with changing material from Miller's graphic novel or from history in order to make the film ""look cooler"". <br/><br/>So we get giant elephants and rhinos, diseased priests, Persian Immortals who look more like ninjas, and the Persian god-king, Xerxes, who's a modest nine feet tall. History be damned, 300 is here to have fun.<br/><br/>The visuals are, of course, the films main selling point. Taking its cue from the other Frank Miller graphic novel recently come to our screens, Sin City, 300 is mostly effects work ¬ñ indeed, all of the backgrounds are effects, and the film has been given an antique tone that fits with its style, making it look like a visualisation of a story that an ancient bard such as Homer might have told round a roaring fire (speaking of bards, there's one in 300 with a goat's head). The visuals are pretty faultless, staggering even, leaving the only criticisms to come from the story and direction.<br/><br/>The plot is thin, and will be known to most by now ¬ñ the Persians invade and 300 Spartans, led by their King Leonidas (Butler) go to hold them off, whilst at home his wife Queen Gorgo (Heady) tries to get the corrupt Spartan council (headed by a slimy Dominic West) to send the rest of the army to help. The set up doesn't take too long so that the meat of the film, the actual battles themselves, take up the majority of the film. It's an absolutely storming middle act that impresses with its style and its excitement. One draw back is the overuse of slow motion, which can be great in small doses, but here is employed to excess. Still, it serves its purpose ¬ñ to show how violent the film is. We see every sword thrust, every limb be carved off its owner, and there's no convenient close ups to distract from what we are meant to be seeing ¬ñ death. It's comic book violence, and so is not violently shocking, but it's strong nonetheless. <br/><br/>Of the cast, Gerard Butler manages to convince as a leader, his face showing the conflicts running through his mind ¬ñ bow to the Persians and live, or fight them and probably die. It's the Spartan way of life to be a soldier (as told in the first few minutes of the film) and his decision, though a hard one to do is an easy one to choose. The other Spartans are a little generic 'hard men', with six packs and eyes gleaming, but some attempt is made to inject some humanity ¬ñ a son looking for his father's recognition for example. The other noteworthy character is the giant Xerxes (Santoro), a man who believes himself to be a god, and who actually isn't that much of a bad man ¬ñ his offers to the Greeks are genuine (he doesn't want to fight if he doesn't have to) promising Leonidas power and riches if he were to bow before him. He is above normal rules for villains; despite his appearance, he is not a cartoon villain, he is a mix of menacing and kind, so it is hard to pin him down. It is a somewhat surprising angle to take, but works in the film's favour.<br/><br/>Overall 300 is a lot of fun, though not without its flaws. But it is a film that knows what is wants to be, and so in its intentions 300 is a success. It's a visual feast, and in this case it is enough to support the film; the plot is barely there, and most of it is based on real events anyway. The only surprises the film can throw at you are the liberties it takes with history, but these just serve to make the film most imaginative and more thrilling. By the time Leonidas has made good the promise he makes to Xerxes (we won't spoil it here for you), you'll be under no illusion as to how hard the Spartans are, and how cool it would be to be one of them. Don't think too much about it, and 300 will leave a good impression.<br/><br/>Rated: 8/10<br/><br/>More reviews at: http://www.thelazylounge.net"

"tinycei2","8","1","4","27 March 2007"," 300 a review w/ spoilers
","I bring you my review on Frank Millar's 300. So ready your breakfast and eat hearty, for tonight WE DINE IN HELL!! ¬Ö Sorry I may have gotten a little carried away, on with the review.<br/><br/>So let me first say that this is a fictional movie, it's based on a Frank Millar graphic novel called 300, which was in turn was loosely based and inspired by a movie called the 300 Spartans, which all in all is based and inspired by ""historical"" accounts and mythology. So this is not a history movie, don't go in to it thinking it is, cause its not¬Ö plan and simple. Get your history lesson somewhere else¬Ö like maybe an accredited Educational institution. OK now on with the review, but before I go one let me remind people that there may be spoilers, so if you don't want to know any thing that could possible ruin the movie for you then don't read any further.<br/><br/>The movie takes places in ancient Sparta. The Spartans are a race of warriors, trained and raised from the time they can walk to be fighting' machines. Raised to feel no pain, to feel no fear, to instill fear in their enemies and never back down from a fight. They are a whole race of perfect, efficient and ruthless combat hungry soldiers, where honor can be found in a glorious death on the battlefield. The movie is about the most glorious Spartan battle, the Battle of Thermopylae (Hell's Gate) of 480 BC, a battle in which 300 Spartans (get the title of the movie yet) and a band of Greek Soldiers and slaves fought the seemingly countless numbers of the invading Persian Army. The Spartans were lead by their king, Leonidas, played by Rodrigo Santoro, as they defended the mountain pass of Thermopylae. Out numbered hundreds to one, the 300 Spartans kept the invading horde at bay for 3 days and 3 nights and made the Persian king Xerxes, played by Rodrigo Santoro, fear the name of Sparta and lose all taste for battle. And as Leonidas defends his peoples' lands, freedoms and lives from a foreign aggressor, Queen Gorgo, played by Lena Headey, must defend Sparta from the inside, as bureaucrats and politicians attempt to sale her people and her king to the enemy. So yeah that's pretty much how the story goes, now to the review.<br/><br/>So with the plot out of the way time to start the reviewing or critiquing portion of this little ditty. Right then, let me start by saying ¬Ö HELL FU*KING YEA! This movie rocked, there's so much about this movie that kicked ass, and I mean lots of ass. But lets start with plot and generally speaking it was pretty OK by me. Sure it's a comic book envision of ""history"" but as long as you don't go in to it looking for a history lesson or looking for a movie to change your meaning of life and just have fun with the story you'll do fine. It's a story of freedom over enslavement, bravery over submission and honor above all else; where can you go wrong? Sure its a testosterone pumping, sword swinging action flick but it works, trust me, or don't I don't really care.<br/><br/>Next lets talk acting and casting, which if you ask me were both spot on. Rodrigo Santoro was perfect as the king of Sparta, hell he made me want to take up arms and fight to the death, truly a great performance. Lena Headey was as beautiful as she was strong willed. She provided pretty much the only female lead in the movie and did so with great passion and vigor. The whole movie is narrated by David Wenham and he does such a wonderful job telling the story, you just get lost in his voice. The rest of the Spartans and other random people were also pretty spot on, now don't get me wrong, does any one on this cast deserve a Oscar for best acting¬Ö no but they did a great job with the material. The same goes for the dialog, over all good time with a bunch of great one liners that will stay with you days after the movie as you scream ""GIVE THEN NOTHING BUT TAKE FROM THEM EVERYTHING!!"" to an unsuspecting passer by. What could have been cheesy and chewy came out rather powerful and enjoyable.<br/><br/>Now the biggest plus in this movie are the Visuals; the action, CG and cinematography were all just brilliant. If you want a great action movie then this is the one for you, people get chopped, stabbed, cut, and dismembered all over the place, it's fantastic. The combat scenes and swordplay were beautifully choreographed for full testosterone pumping potential (on top of the action there's enough gratuitous nude boobs to help you along the way, the red headed oracle has a great pair if you ask me). The entire movie is CG enhanced very beautifully; it's live action with some computer help, it makes for some pretty stuff to look at. And on top of that the shooting and cinematography was all very good, I don't know how else to say it¬Ö FU*KING WOW! So there you have it, all the positives of this movie, now on to the negatives¬Ö and well I don't have any. So again, there's nothing I didn't not like about this movie, every thing was OK, good, or great, but again it's not perfect. So in light of all the action, the great affects, T&A and over all coolness I give this movie a strong 8. If you like battle movies or epics like Troy or Braveheart, then you'll like this cause this movie is Troy on Steroids. Differently something I plan on owning and watching multiple times. So there you have it, my thoughts and views on Frank Millar's 300."

It isn't accurate. Some of the sexism in this film was also pretty desensitizing.<br/><br/>But the CG and cinematography was exceptional.

Well, hello but it is based on a comic book! Not too unbelievable then! It is very violent though which some people seem to be squeamish about so don't go see this movie unless you can stomach a lot of harsh violence. I wasn't too bothered by it but sometimes it was a bit too much, part of the reason this gets 8 from me and not perfect 10.

The story is great as I mentioned, but you don't really have a chance to really know a character and love it. The rhythm does not allow that. And what about the cheating, the queen was great, why would she cheat on her king. She was a great strong character resembling power, beauty and the spartan woman. Why did that happen?

","what can i say 300 was amazing the Battle scenes although not historically accurate were amazing. the slow mo may have been used a little to much but only a little, the fight's were graceful almost like a dance. The slow mo really lets you appreciate the full level of carnage that the spartans inflict. the acting was solid throughout and butler is very convincing as leonadis. overall the film looks beautiful with a great musical score and has enough slow-mo limb chopping carnage to satisfy even the gore hounds. don't think it detracts from the film as with out it the action would be to fast and you wouldn't be able to appreciate the full carnage as you'd miss half of it. this film is inventive funny and definitely worth watching. if your a fan of Miller's work then you'll be in heaven as this the most faithful adaptation yet ,however even if your not familiar with miller you should still see this movie."
"Theo3778","10","1","4","11 March 2007"," Amazing
","I find it hard to believe that anyone wouldn't like this movie. Its the BIGGEST underdog story the world has ever know. This movie IS NOT ABOUT THE PERSIANS OR WHAT THEY LOOKED LIKE. It's about the bravery of the 300 Spartans. The title is 300, not 1,000,000 (over exaggerated number). The war scenes were possibly the most awesome scenes ever. People aren't realizing that this movie is based on a comic book which I believe was based on the older 300 Spartans movie which was based on a war over 2,000 years ago. This is NOT a documentary of course. The image of the Persians in the movie are what I believe to be the image the Spartans and other Greeks saw. If you had NEVER seen an elephant before in your life i'm sure you would probably over exaggerate its size and appearance. This movie is not anti-Persian but overly pro-Spartan. There's a difference. The sound and the slow motion fighting scenes were tremendous. If you do not like the movie because of it's historical accuracy then you are wrongfully lowering the rating of the movie."

"jp_011205","8","1","4","10 March 2007"," Bloody Eyecandy That's Sometimes Sweet
","Film adaptations whether they're TV, musical, novel, or in the case of '300', graphic novel are always risky. The director has to worry about what to keep from the original material, what to take out, & what to add in order to make the final product considered great. All those things are equally important and if even one is flawed, the others could be comprised no matter how good they may be. In second-time director Zack Snyder's big screen take on Frank Miller's 1998 graphic novel there are many visual effects, but really not much else. The odd thing is, that's actually a good thing. A very good thing.<br/><br/>'300' tells the not-so-accurate account of the Battle of Thermopylae in 480 B.C. Led by King Leonidas, here played by Gerard Butler, 300 Spartan warriors fought to death against King Xerxes' Persian army. As a result, the rest of Greece was inspired to band together against Xerxes, creating the world's first democracy. There you have it, pretty much the entire movie in a nutshell. The simplicity of the film's outline for the most part helps everything move along smoothly. Snyder added a few bits and pieces to Miller's original storyline in order help spice things up, but nothing too drastic. Only a couple of times does it seem like things are going in slow motion, but that's mainly because of the intense battle sequences which make some instances feel dull in comparison.<br/><br/>Where as the last adaptation of a graphic novel, 'Sin City' was filled with notable names portraying the characters, in '300' there are slim to none. Mostly, none. Although Butler has starred in almost twenty films he's yet to reach that point where he's a household name. In '300' there is barely any room for acting between the arm slicing and head chopping scenes. Only a handful of the actors get a chance to do much with their roles. Lena Headley, who plays Queen Gorgo gets the most screen-time aside from Butler. She does okay I suppose. Nothing amazing, but not dreadful either. Acting isn't what is important in this film though. It's those fancy special effects.<br/><br/>The ocean scene is magnificent, the scenery is amazing, but other things aren't always so impressive. In the first encounter with the Persians, the stylized blood makes the graphic novel feel truly present, which is great. After that scene though, the effect is no longer seen. The blood is normal, I guess you could say. The feel was present in quite a few other scenes, but since blood is a huge part of this film, I felt some of the quality was lost. Also, the creatures such as the elephants and rhino were a bit shoddy. They didn't appear life-like. However, much like the other special effects extravaganza this year, 'Ghost Rider' everything looks cool so it's not that big of a deal. For the record that's the only thing '300' and 'Ghost Rider' have in common. I just want to make that clear.<br/><br/>Earlier this year I named '300' as one of the ten films to pay attention to. At the time, I thought it was going to be excellent. Now that I've seen it I can return to that presumption. I'm not going to lie, it did disappoint me. I expected something more. Don't get me wrong it's really good, just not great. I'm also not going to brush off the fact that that this film will still end up being a favorite of many. It has tremendous appeal and will gross well over $100 million at the box office in no time. Like I said, it's good that there are so many visuals effects and not much else. Had there been a lot of big names and the storyline been changed it wouldn't have been the same. The effects step up pleasing the audience and allow the actors (which most people won't even recognize) take the backseat for once. For me though, it just didn't have that oomph I hoped for."

WORTH SEEING, but not worth buying. I am a huge film fan and this isn't going to be one of those remembered films in 30 years. Aside from being Quite historically inaccurate on the spartan's side, it was 100% one-sided for sparta (which makes since since it is about them). The narration got very annoying to me, and i almost left at the first 30 mins. The direction was very very great, and casting was well. Acting was very very poor. I know that in war films, usually actors are not dramatic and such, but they tried to be way more dramatic in a few of the short speeches than they should have tried, because certain actors can only act so hard i guess. Rating this below a 6 would be a terrible idea, but above a 6 just isn't that great. If you watch this film 2x it might not even get a 6.

","I saw this opening weekend. I went in expecting a lot - great action and great artwork and hopefully a good story. I was not disappointed. The movie itself is 80% action with a shallow story to act as the action's catalyst. Though a lack of story can be annoying, 300 works well with little. When watching this movie, keep in mind: The story is meant to be a exaggerated war-tail passed on through generations. The good guys, the Greek, are perfect men - chiseled as Gods and ready to die for freedom. The Persians are portrayed as deformed evil demons. Each wave of new Persians are less human and seemingly more indestructible than the last. The visuals are rustic and kind of fuzzy as if you are imagining this instead of being there. Again, you are not witnessing this event first hand. A couple of my friends didn't enjoy the movie because of a mindset they are used to - movies are meant to be first hand accounts. ""The exaggerations are too unreal and silly."" So just go in assuming the story is exaggerated and the experience will be more enjoyable! ;)"

He was ripped and I mean he was the most ripped of all 300 Spartans. King Leonidas (Butler), is probably one of the coolest and most annoying characters, your typical war hero.

"Leofwine_draca","9","1","5","10 January 2015"," Hyper-stylised ancient battles in a gem of action cinema
","Many critics have criticised this movie, because it's not ""historically accurate"". They're missing the point. 300 is NOT supposed to represent the ancient Battle of Thermopylae ‚Äì instead, it's supposed to represent the 5-part comic book, released by SIN CITY creator Frank Miller in 1998. I've read the comic, and I'm delighted to say that 300 is utterly faithful to the storyline depicted therein, which is basically the historical story with added fantastical touches and plenty of coolness.<br/><br/>I'm a huge, huge fan of ancient warfare so I came to see this film with great expectations. All of them were fulfilled. 300 is a testosterone-packed movie with plenty to recommend it. 90% of the film was shot with green-screen backgrounds, so that the majority of backdrops and locations in the film are computer generated. They look fantastic; far from realistic, but beautiful all the same.<br/><br/>While the story of the film ‚Äì fighting, corruption, betrayal ad infinitum ‚Äì is simplistic and the scenes taking place at the royal court very much par for the course, where this movie really excels is in the battle scenes. The fights are plentiful and superbly staged. Nowhere else have I got a better idea of what it was like fighting on the front line than I have by watching this film. Hyper-stylised by director Zack Snyder (who previously directed the DAWN OF THE DEAD remake), the various battles are full of originality and very gruesome ‚Äì just the way we like them. CGI blood splatters across the screen, limbs fly in slow motion through the air, and every male viewer will be whooping with delight.<br/><br/>The cast members are pretty good. Gerard Butler and co. might not look or sound like ancient Greeks, but they seem to be born fighters and their perfectly-sculpted bodies give the movie an added dimension that recalls the look of the old sword and sandal movies of the '50s and '60s. Butler nabs all of the best lines and enjoys some wonderful shouty bits ‚Äì ""This is Sparta!"" etc., all stirring stuff. Vincent Regan is very good as his loyal, emotional captain and David Wenham (LORD OF THE RINGS) reminds us that his presence in fantastic epics is a given. The rest of the cast is also decent, whether it's Rodrigo Santoro's creepy Persian king Xerxes or Lena Headey's headstrong queen.<br/><br/>And so back to the battles, which take up roughly half of the movie's running time. We get Spartans battling Persians, as well as assorted creatures like elephants and a rhinoceros. The ninja-clad Immortals prove to be entertaining opponents and the movie benefits from plenty of grimness, like the wall of bodies built up by the heroes. My favourite scene by far is where Leonidas battles the massive giant, who seems to be as immortal as he is. The central theme of the movie concentrates on what it means to be a hero and the inevitable conclusion is moving while at the same time fittingly heroic. All in all, this is a wonderful battle film that works on many levels and is sure to go down as a minor classic."

The unexpectedly full-blooded acting (especially lead Gerard Butler) also managed to breathe life into stock characters often forced to mouth propagandist slogans (though the Spartans' battle cry, making them sound more like an American football team, is corny)! The battle sequences are among the fiercest ever depicted, even if the gimmicky editing distracts from their ultimate impact.

","Imagine the classic Homeric sword and shield epic ""Troy"" (2004) with Brad Pitt crossed with the contemporary look of the Mickey Rourke/Jessica Alba neo-noir crime thriller ""Sin City"" (2005), and you'll have a close idea about what ""Land of the Dead"" director Zack Snyder achieves with limited success in his brawny, bloodthirsty blockbuster ""300"" with ""Dracula 2000"" star Gerard Butler. Warner Brothers has racked up another major box office bonanza with their $60-million production of graphic novelist Frank Miller's 1998 comic book about the legendary battle of Thermopylae in 480 B.C. in Greece between the Spartans and heathen Persians. Talk about art inspiring art, Miller drew his idea for ""300"" from the more realistic though far less sanguinary 20th Century Fox epic ""The 300 Spartans"" (1962) that toplined Richard Egan as King Leonidas during the heyday of the Italian Peplum genre about Hercules, Ulysses, Goliath, Atlas, and Samson. Clocking in with one hour and 57 minutes of mayhem, treachery, and hard, glistening abs and pectoral muscles on display, ""300"" illustrates what happens when Hollywood rewrites ancient history with mind-blowing computer-generated imagery. Unfortunately, for Snyder and co-scenarists Michael B. Gordon and Kurt Johnstad, the spectacle of ""300"" overwhelms its dramatic intensity and character development.<br/><br/>Not surprisingly, Snyder, Gordon, and Johnstad rely on time-honored but unimaginative narration to bring its attention-deficient teenager audience up to snuff on Fifth century history. We're told little boys in Sparta trained from their youth to be fearless warriors. Living to kill, they killed to live. As Leonidas says early in the action: ""We Spartans have descended from Hercules himself. Taught never to retreat, never to surrender. Taught that death in the battlefield is the greatest glory he could achieve in his life. Spartans: the finest soldiers the world has ever known."" They also did some other things that Snyder and company have shrewdly eliminated that might have appealed to a larger audience but would have netted them an NC-17 rating. Peruse an unexpurgated account about ancient Grecian history and you'll learn the rest of the unfettered story. Once the filmmakers have established a basic knowledge of the setting that takes about a quarter hour, they introduce us to heroic King Leonidas (Scottish actor Gerard Butler of ""The Phantom of the Opera"") and his beautiful but anorexic Queen Gorgo (British actress Lena Headey of ""The Cave"") who talk a lot about freedom not being free. Indeed, you can draw some parallels between their dialogue and the American quagmire of Iraq and the Middle East at large. Snyder then trots out the evil, wicked villains, the Persians. These guys look either repulsive with their faces draped with jewelry and numerous piercings or depraved ""Shriek"" types with misshapen bodies. Xerxes (Brazilian actor Rodrigo Santoro of TV's ""Lost"") sends emissaries to warn Leonidas that the Spartans should surrender before his mammoth army of over a million wipe them out and turn their wives and children into slaves. Leonidas with a nod from Gorgo sends the emissary and his bodyguards plunging to their deaths in a deep well. Leonidas follows the Spartan custom of seeking the advice of a group of depraved oracles that reside atop mountains and intoxicate teenage girls before they issue their decrees. They warn Leonidas that Sparta is doomed, and our plain-spoken protagonist storms off in contempt and disgust to round up 300 of his best to meet the worst that Persia offers. What neither Leonidas nor his queen know is that a traitor in their midst, Theron (Dominic West of ""The Wire""), has already accepted bribes from the Persians to lay Sparta open to the Asian horde.<br/><br/>""300"" cuts back and forth between the fierce Spartan warriors battling the Persians on the Greek coast near a narrow mountain pass called 'the Hot Gates' and Queen Gorgo's futile efforts to raise reinforcements for her husband's aid. Theron has convinced Spartan leaders that Leonidas has broken the law by taking marching off with his troops without the approval of the politicians. Predictably, like the battle of the Alamo in American history, the Spartans in ""300"" are whittled down to nothing by a force six times its size.<br/><br/>By and large, ""300"" falls back on wholesale slaughter as entertainment. We see at least three men get their heads slashed off at the neck as well as numerous shots of severed arms, legs, and hands. The chief problems in ""300"" are the ersatz computer generated graphics. Synder lensed it on a sound-stage in Montreal using green screens to project all of its bogus looking backdrops, especially when the Persian fleet wallows in angry seas and many of its fleet sink. Anybody who doesn't know what the green screen or blue screen back projection process looks like should catch a local weather forecast. All those graphics are generated by a computer while the forecaster stands in front of a blank green or blue wall and points to areas that he or she sees on a television monitor. Worse, ""300"" is so choked with blood and gore that all the characters, except Leonidas, are lost in the violence. When our heroes aren't killing Persians, they spend their time finishing off the mutilated survivors and then stack them into walls of flesh to topple on the next wave of Persians. Xerxes makes a spectacular entrance, and his first confrontation with Leonidas is dramatic, but afterward he becomes just another cardboard character. Nothing relieves the film from its constant killing. There is nothing remotely humorous here, unlike some of the funnier confrontations in Mel Gibson's ""Braveheart."" Altogether, ""300"" looks like a spectacular video-game with half-hearted drama tossed in between the slaughtering. Guys will savor the cutting edge violence while females will ogle the warriors as if these ancient Spartans were nothing more than leather-thonged Chipendale strippers wading into war with swords and shields."

","I personally think this movie was made to GLORIFY how wonderful war is just so that George Bush can get his dollars to fatten his piggy bank. I was SLIGHTly irritated with the underlying Americanism and Bush's war propaganda. What with all the specific racial groups that were selected to be conveniently villainous, utterly evil, and easily detestable. Not to mention the constant re-emphasis of the NECESSITIES of war, that without it, liberty be lost, everyone would be slaves.<br/><br/>That having said, this movie can be enjoyed for its excitement, its action-packed fighting sequences. The best part of the movie was the honour and moving loyalty between the soldiers to each other even as they know they're advancing towards death. The sexy, ruthless, unpredictable wife of the King is also a nice addition. Just don't eat up the war propaganda it's feeding you."

","What a ride! These were my heroes since childhood and in this film they came to life. The moments I almost got a hard-on from excitement is when I was hearing the true and historically documented sayings deeply embedded in the Greek DNA: ""Your shield or on your shield"", ""Come and get it"", ""So much the better, we shall fight in the shade"", ""Go tell the Spartans, passerby, that here, by Spartan law, we lie"". I can't believe any Greek remained stiff during these. <br/><br/>My total respect to everyone involved in making this film. Guys, thank you from the depth of my heart. You created an absolute delight for us Greeks and I hope for everyone else. I'm over 30 and I haven't felt like this for years! Excellent costumes, wonderful imagery and very faithful to both the comic and the novel.

To begin with the army of 300 were not the army of 300 until the final battle, and the way this movie portraits the Persians is clearly an attack upon all Persians past and present. Let me remind you people that Xerxes grandfather was the first king ever to instate human rights which is one of the very pillars of the civilization we live in today. I try too take a glim's into the minds of the people behind this movie and i really want to know why they would want too take a crap on Persians, and i come up with 2 possible explanations: 1. propaganda supporting the eminent invasion of Iran...and 2. incompetent scriptwriters incapability of in any way uplifting the Spartans without taking a dump on the Persians....."

","Before watching this film with my colleagues at the cinema, i had unbelievably high expectations! We had had posters, larger ads and banners for months prior to the premiere. Once i got into the cinema a couple of beers blurred me, and after 30 minutes i fell asleep. Not something you would do normally, but beers have a tendency to blur me of! The bits of film i saw were tremendous though! Some of the hectic fighting scenes and a little of the love scenes :) When i saw it the second time i saw it was the digital version. I don't know if it was the beer blurring my vision the first time, but the quality was unbelievably better! It was my first digital movie, but i had never thought the quality to be very much better! I hope the digital very soon becomes standard! GET ON WITH IT! The movie is a fantastic action/adventure movie packed with special effects! And nice ones too. Perfectly made all throughout the movie! I really hope they come again. Somehow, frank Miller novels and cartoons are great, and though in a totally different genre this film was as excellent as ""Sin City"". It is not exactly historically correct (maybe more far from it!), but the interpretation of the events really takes you back to the old, dark ages in Greece! Are you into action, sin city, six-packs, fighting scenes, chopped of heads and nasty facial piercing, go see this one! And weep!"

","The battle of Thermopylae, in 480 BC, likely changed the face of Western Civilization. It is interesting to contrast the movie ""The 300 Spartans"" to 300. Of course, one came out in the early 1960's, while the other has twenty first century effects. Nevertheless, examine the history, and how Xerxes and the Persians are portrayed in one movie, compared to the other. Makes you think if Xerxes was given his fair due in 300? I thought the movie did a superb job captivating the audience. The story line was direct, and let the viewers understand how gruesome the times were in those day. Also, there was real cause in fighting for country, and protecting freedom. In antiquity, and even in modern times, real leaders fought on the front lines with their men. Overall, spectacular film!! Excellent job of incorporating mythical characters with factual. Regardless of the number of Persians defeated, (10,000 or 10,000,000) one thing is certain... Few Spartans stood against many, Awhoo!!"

"Medacakathareal","10","1","5","4 April 2007"," Epic film
","*Spoiler Warning* I just got back from a vision of cinematic heaven, and paradise is a pretty twisted and highly stylized place. By all accounts 300 is based on Fred Miller's graphic novel about 300 Spartans who fought and died in the battle of Thermopylae... From the beginning I could tell this movie was pure brilliance, they plunge you into the world of the Spartans. They don't westernize the Spartans to make them seem like us, you are submerged into the world they lived in and given the knowledge of what Spartans (least these fictional ones) believed...<br/><br/>The story is simple, the plot apparent from the onset of the film, and yet they managed to make a two hour (plus) film from it without it growing tiresome or boring (not even once)... The cinematography alone could hold your attention (unless you're like most mindless moviegoers)... What really stands out is the ""badassness"" of the Spartans, THEY DO NOT GIVE UP, THEY DO NOT BOW! And believe me, within the first few SECONDS of battle you will understand what I mean by badassness... these guys are just awesome...<br/><br/>How could a movie be so many things: violent, beautiful, epic, suspenseful, erotic, and even moving to a degree...<br/><br/>In short, this movie is the Saving Private Ryan of ancient warfare flicks (though not entirely realistic), the action scenes INCREDIBLE, the rest of the scenes SUPERB! Towards the end of the movie you'll wonder if Spartans can even bleed...<br/><br/>I watched Troy for the first time about two weeks ago, thought it was okay, this movie puts Troy into a shallow and shameful grave... If you've got eight or nine bucks lying around this is well worth the cash to see it...<br/><br/>Of course I should warn you there is gore (plenty) and some nudity but the movie itself is excellent and there is an emotional and powerful resonating need for freedom dwelling at its core... see the 300..."
"drfraud-1","9","1","5","4 April 2007"," Another incredible comic book adaptation
","What most people don't realize is that this film is based on Frank Miller's comic book and is made specifically to mimic the comic's general feeling. Just like the other movie that was based on his comics, Sin City, 300 is trying to capture the comic book and deliver it into another medium.<br/><br/>Just like Sin City, it does a good job in doing that. The film looks incredible. The visuals are stunning and everything that people might have enjoyed in Frank Miller's animation is recreated in 300. <br/><br/>The film does not claim nor even tries to be historically accurate, representing Persians as evil disfigured beings, but it still does a great job for Hollywood in presenting us with a heroic battle of epic proportions. I think if you are going in to see this movie with some sort of a historical expectation, you are not going to enjoy it at all. Similary, if you end up over-analyzing this, you might end up thinking this is some sort of an anti-Iran propaganda, which it is definitely not (but which did add some extra publicity to the movie). This is nothing more than an adaptation of a comic book and a really good one too. Watch it with an open mind and you will love this movie a lot.<br/><br/>9/10 for great visual effects and incredible new cinematic techniques."
"eyal philippsborn","7","1","5","3 April 2007"," Let the world know -Spartan men are really muscular
","Atkins diet is a pretty tough diet. Trust me, i'm going through it right now. The Atkins diet, for those of you who don't buy their clothes at linen stores, is a diet that restricts the consumption of carbon hydrates to a bare minimum. You can have a bacon and scrambled eggs but you should steer clear of bread, rice, pasta, sweets and Lollypops. Lollypops are the worst, they are pure carbon hydrates on a stick.<br/><br/>If you wonder why I discuss lolly-pops in an war epic movie comment, an explanation shall be given (hint: It has nothing to do with the title of my comment).<br/><br/>Sparta is probably one of the most fascinating societies to roam the planet. The Spartans had no rules, just a stern ruling system that took every seven year old male from his family and put him through a lifetime of torture-like practice so he can become a flawless fighting machine, devoid of any personal purpose but the purpose of engaging in a bloody battle.<br/><br/>King Leonidas is the man reigning on this theater of absurd that is Sparta. Absurdly enough, the king, a highly respected warrior in his own right, has to report every once in a while to the council of the Ephors who were according to Wikipedia, elected officials that were in charge of the king abiding the law. According to the film, they were also highly unattractive ogres that mediated between the Oracle and Leonidas.<br/><br/>Leonidas wanted to wage war against the Persian army. The biggest and most frightening army the ancient world ever witnessed. The Ephors, after a lengthy consolation with the oracle, decide the king should make major concessions to the Persian king without initiating a war he can't win. Leonidas does the unthinkable and contrary to the Oracle's decision, recruits 300 of his best warriors to face the menace that puts their entire country at danger.<br/><br/>The 300 Spartans are out numbered but they have two advantages:1) They can maneuvers the battle to a narrow road where the Persian advantage will be a marginal one. 2) They have the best warriors the world has ever known and certainly with the most muscular abdomen.<br/><br/>I don't know that much about Spartan culture but according to the film, the Spartan warriors had no shirts, just a cape tilted backwards, leaving their fat-free and well shaped abdomens to be highly visible during the war scenes.<br/><br/>The Atkins diet wasn't in high demand in that particular group.<br/><br/>At the absence of Leonidas, the queen had her fair share of verbal battles with the subversive Theron, the hate monger who tries to belittle Leonidas' bravery and the queens credibility to maintain control on the house of commons. That notion is a source to a feud (in full clothing, by the way) between Theron and the queen.<br/><br/>In case you are wondering whether this film is the ""Lord of the ring"" with an actual historical background or a version of ""Gladiator"" in the Greek empire setting, rest assured it's neither. This movie is a well paced, well written and superbly acted action movie that is ensconced in violence and a very twisted perception of heroism.<br/><br/>One of the myths of Sparta, omitted from the film is the ritual where one year old babies who were deemed unhealthy, unwell or disabled, were tossed of a hill to their early demise. According to the film, there was no greater honor for the common Spartan than to die at battle. The Spartan history was determined by the fear of Sparans of becoming slaves to one of their neighboring countries. This fear dominated the country to such an extent that the Spartan rule devised a mechanism that made every Spartan citizen a slave of his own country. Spartan became a synonym for rigidness and frugality. It should have been a synonym for irony.<br/><br/>The movie's historical take is opposite to mine but historical aspects are not the core of the film, they are used as some sort of rational for the gory, bloody and violent fighting scenes that the film consists of. Jack Snyder who wrote and directed the film, assembled a main course of cinematic violence with a historic background and witty script as side dishes.<br/><br/>Which brings me back to the beginning of my review. As a person on an Atkins diet, Lollypops, containing 97% carbon hydrates which makes them off-limits even if they have a nutritional value (which they don't). If a person detests the excessive violence in movies, there is no chance he will find the film compelling the same way I will not be able to watch Polanski's ""Bitter moon"" despite it's qualities because of its highly frequent and needlessly graphic sex scenes.<br/><br/>For those of you who can endure violent films, bare in mind that this film is fun to watch but don't be fooled to think it's a masterpiece. It has the The script, acting and editing to make it an engrossing film but it's the violence and the blind admiration to one of the most warped-minded societies in history that prevents it from being the extraordinary tale it might seem to be.<br/><br/>For those of you who wonder why I don't mind excessive violence but can't stand excessive sex scenes, I'm afraid I can't answer that. I've got enough concerns to deal with, what with the Atkins and all.<br/><br/>7.5 in my FilmOmeter."
"dunmore_ego","8","1","5","26 March 2007"," Body-shaved for Glory
","That reminds me, I need to hit the gym.<br/><br/>Some say *300* is as violent as *Apocalypto*, but it's not. *300* elevates violence to a new level ¬ñ violence as art. Sure, *Apocalypto* and other movies that push the envelope on graphic pain could be construed as ""art"" ¬ñ for the technicality that they are purveyed through an artistic medium - but only in *300* is the leg-lopping and artery-severing so balletic; only in *300* is the glittering pain so beautifully blood-smattered, so sensually body-oiled.<br/><br/>*300* is ostensibly the story (legend, if you will) of 300 Spartans led by King Leonidas, who fanatically and suicidally opposed 100,000 Persians at the Battle of Thermopylae in 480 BC.<br/><br/>But other than that base fact of 300 battle-bred Spartans (allied with a sprinkling of undisciplined warriors from other city-states) smashing up against the insurmountable forces of Persian King Xerxes, most of this movie is fancy-pants in a jester's bodysuit. Exhibit A: Xerxes himself (Rodrigo Santoro) - eight-foot tall, golden-skinned, face- and body-pierced androgyne with a ProTools voice.<br/><br/>I'm pretty sure there were no *Lord of the Rings* elephants back in 480 BC; neither were there giant ogres, mountainous rhinos or executioners with blades for arms; *300* shoves dramatic license in our faces like a Medical Marijuana Certificate whilst paying documented historical accuracy the shortest of shrifts. But the movie ¬ñ and this review - should not be judged on didacticism. If you didn't pay attention in school, I'm not going to refresh your memory of the Hot Gates here ¬ñ read about it on the net. The beauty of this movie lies not in its adherence to fact, but, quite simply, in its Beauty. It just LOOKS so damn good.<br/><br/>Even before we mention the director or writer, the art directors should receive their accolades - Isabelle Guay, Nicolas Lepage and Jean-Pierre Paquet. The CGI staff also warrant a hefty mention (without whom this movie would have no backgrounds!), imbuing such a vibrancy of rust colors, warmth and grit to the production that every single frame is a 70's album cover.<br/><br/>Directed effusively by Zack Snyder, screen-played by Snyder, Kurt Johnstad and Michael Gordon (from the graphic novel by *Sin City*'s Frank Miller and Lynn Varley), *300* is a living, breathing Frank Frazetta or Boris Vallejo, screaming at the seams in four dimensions.<br/><br/>As with Miller's *Sin City*, sex and violence is back on the big screen where it belongs.<br/><br/>In this world where kings were Real Men and torsos were chiseled like marble statues, we meet Spartan King Leonidas (Gerard Baker ¬ñ who only 4 years ago made a mule's ass of himself in Richard Donner's beyond-pathetic *Timeline*, now making mule's asses of everyone around him with his Stentorian resolve, power pecs and Abs Absolute), who holds a very modern view of the Delphic Oracle (""not taking the ravings of a drunk teenager seriously"") and leads his warriors to battle against a Persian invasion contra the advice of the Ephors (a council of elders suspiciously resembling Yellow Bastard ¬ñ either lepers or really heavy drinkers ¬ñ Frank Miller's fingerprint, mayhaps?).<br/><br/>Leonidas' wife, Queen Gorgo (Lena Headey) sees Leonidas off with the Spartan credo on her lips, ""Come back with your shield or on it""; as the Spartans themselves slam into glorious battle, spitting, ""No prisoners! No mercy!"" Strategically using the narrow Thermopylae Pass as his stand, Leonidas negates the overwhelming might of the Persian army, who are forced to come at the Spartans in manageable numbers, breaking like ephemeral surf upon Leonidas' indestructible Spartan phalanx.<br/><br/>When Leonidas bellows, ""No Spartan dies today!"" we *know* he means it. It is the resolve of a REAL leader, the likes of which the world of politics (read ""duplicity"") has long since forgotten ¬ñ this is not someone who would hide behind his disgraced office, his criminal cabinet and his unmitigated ignorance and pigeon-chested physical weakness ¬ñ Leonidas bellows from the front line of a death-dealing phalanx, shield and spear wielded for Maximum Hurting. No prisoners. No mercy. No rhetoric.<br/><br/>After awe-inspiring battles (where film-speed works as effectively as CGI to convey the m√™l√©e ¬ñ sudden slomo alternated with sudden slashing speed), where we see the machinery of the concerted Spartan shield and thrust attack in its trained glory; after building their enemies' bodies into unbreachable walls and massacring the feared, ""unkillable"" Immortals in their hundreds, the Spartans are undone by betrayal.<br/><br/>Trained from youth to be insensitive, unfeeling killing machines, even betrayal cannot make them turn tail or change their tactics. The Spartans embraced death as lustily as they lived life, so when Leonidas exhorts his men to ""Prepare for glory!"" they look forward to a ""good death,"" not victory. They all die (not that I want to ruin the end, but if you'd listened in school, you'd know this). Yet the 300's glorious, doomed stand served to unite the Greek states, enabling them to halt the Persian assault on other fronts.<br/><br/>*300* uses that old ploy of giving British accents to the ancients, because ¬ñ well, somehow, it just sounds right. Baker infuses his Leonidas with a Connery-syrup brogue and a very pointy beard, Vincent Regan is wholly British as Captain, and David Wenham (in the largest leap of any of these actors - from *Crocodile Hunter: Collision Course* to Thermopylae) narrates in squinty, Aussie-Briton melodramatic over-cheese. Having seen them for years in other roles, the question remains, ""Under all their clothes, were these guys always that built and body-shaved?"" <br/><br/>Truly, a Guy Movie ¬ñ with startlingly-defined abs for the laydayz. (The Spartans did, in fact, wear breastplates, but again ¬ñ no apologies for liberties, especially body-oiled liberties.) <br/><br/>Speaking of body-oil, think I'll work on my abs today¬Ö"

","Thre is a point early in the film when a Persian messenger comes to demand the Spartan King's surrender and Queen Gorgo offers her opinion on the situation. The messenger does his best to ignore her, and instead looks at the Spartan King and asks ""Why does this woman think she can speak amongst men?"" Queen Gorgo, before her beloved husband can answer, says ""Because only Spartan women give birth to real men."" At this point, you realize that this film has some good dialog, and some very capable acting taking place. Granted, this is not the Battle of Thermopylae as it happened; this is not the Battle of Thermopylae as it was told by Dilios, the Spartan orator that told the tale after the fact to inspire his countrymen into action; this is not even the Battle of Thermopylae as Hollywood would derive it from Dilios' work.<br/><br/>This is an adaptation of a Frank Miller graphic novel, which was an adaptation of the earlier Hollywood effort (The 300 Spartans), which was an adaptation of Dilios. This means, if you are familiar with Frank Miller (the Dark Knight series, for example), that you know that you are in for a hell of a ride. The visuals are done to be int eh same style as Frank Miller's artwork. The story is an ancient one, but with a distinct, unique, and very cutting-edge style. the writing is excellent (and by that, I mean that the dialog feels natural and smooth; the actions taken by the characters do not jar against the circumstances; nothing appears out of place). It really is about as good as action/adventure has ever been.<br/><br/>Is the film perfect? No. It has its flaws, but they are small, easily ignorable (or even missed!)

","...""300"" is yet another film realization of comic book 'enfante terrible' Frank Miller's dark and unforgiving vision of humanity, and director/co-screenwriter Zack ""Dawn of the Dead (2004)"" Snyder's equally Hobbesian outlook. It's a combination that pays off visually to the extreme, but also fails to connect with any significant emotional depth or impact. And that's a shame.<br/><br/>If Snyder's intent was to simply animate Miller's comic book, he quite obviously more than succeeded. Even more so than ""Sin City,"" ""300"" is a comic book come to life, right down to the inkblot blood spatters throughout the combat sequences. Everything is larger than life (and not just Xerxes), nearly surrealistically so. Loads of use of desaturated color and stuttering slow-mo, along with CGI sets and image enhancement contribute to the overall effect of a comic book come to life. Larry ""Lost"" Fong's camera-work is kinetic in the action scenes and a stark microscope in close-ups. The overall effect is mesmerizing, and yet empty. Unlike ""Sin City,"" this is a film in which the story is utterly subservient to the visuals, instead of the other way around, and it keeps its audience at a distance, refusing to connect on an emotional level (unless you count the release of adrenaline and testosterone to be emotional), despite the best efforts of leads Gerard ""Dracula 2000"" Butler and Leona ""The Cave"" Headey to build some sort of relationship with which modern audiences might empathize. In its attempt to raise ""sword and sandal"" epics to new cinematic heights, ""300"" still fails to create the human connection that made ""Gladiator"" a more compelling, interesting film. The intrusion of fantasy elements didn't help much, either, proving to further remove audience interest in any historical lessons to be learned.<br/><br/>The result of Snyder's recreation of Miller's stylized violence? Surprisingly little original insight into the nature of Spartan culture (not that I expected such) beyond the y-chromosome posturings of machismo honor and female subjugation to the warrior ethos, despite the independent efforts of Leonidas' queen. Much like Snyder's reworking of ""Dawn of the Dead,"" ""300"" is an emotionless adventure game that fails to engage the audience's soul or heart. It appeals primarily to the eye and ear alone.<br/><br/>(11.15.07 edit) I'm not surprised to see that the older the IMDber, the lower the rating for ""300,"" but still find it intriguing that females rate the film equally or higher than males, except the 45+ cohort. I would guess this may have to do with the beefcake factor; anachronistic buff torsos predominate, and older females are perhaps less impressed by such eye candy, not to mention indifferent to the shallow thrills of testosterone-laden combat sequences.<br/><br/>I suspect that ratings for this film will decline as more home viewers weigh in with their verdicts, and those who have already seen it adjust their scoring when they realize how superficial ""300"" really is."

It was highly entertaining and fun to watch, but honestly, i would rather watch the trailer 10 times in a row then go watch the movie again in the theater. Actually if they put the trailer in the theaters as its own feature, that would be some thing i would pay a dollar to watch. The trailer basically had all the greatest parts of the movie, only it was edited better to much better music.<br/><br/>My main issues with this movie have to do with the dialog and soundtrack (or lack of). Basically all of the dialog was stale except the bits they used in the trailer, and since you had already heard those 400 times, only with far more exciting music in the background, they had almost no effect on you while watching the movie. As far as music, I don't even remember any of the music during the movie except for one exciting moment right before the Spartans were going to kick some ass. Even after they started fighting though it seems as though, in my memory, the music disappeared.<br/><br/>Any way, enough of the bad.<br/><br/>Visual the movie was actually very stunning, and had lots of very nice looking moments. The action was was pretty awesome in general, but nothing new or groundbreaking as far as fighting scenes go.<br/><br/>I'm done rambling. Entertaining, but nothing amazing. Won't see again for a while although i will still watch the trailer every now and then.<br/><br/>6 out of 10 (almost 7)"

","wow this movie is good, all my friends loved it even my wife loved it, was not a fan of sin city but this movie is truly amazing, the whole time i was gripped by the atmosphere of the film and the colour of the back drops really made you feel you where there, the special effects where amazing too the way the blood flies matrix style across the screen, one to buy on DVD but as somebody else said this movie is a big screen movie, id love to see it on imax, this is a must see movie and id watch it again maybe 5 times more it was that good, this was one of 2 movies I've enjoyed so far this year lets hope there are more blockbusters to come!!!!! a truly 10 out 10"
"crimtar","7","1","5","28 March 2007"," For those who take their movies seriously...
","To begin with, I'd been waiting to see this movie for 6 months, ever since I watched the trailer sometime in October. It promised to be a magnificent mythological war epic, with stirring dialogues, powerful scenes, exotic Gothic style graphics....and so on. Trust me, after seeing the trailer, I thought it was going to be the movie of the year..in fact, I thought Godfather was finally beaten.<br/><br/>Then I saw the movie. Buzzed with anticipation, expecting the phenomenal, demanding to be blown away,and you might say I had over-hyped it for myself, so was let down....but that wasn't the case. I thought it through..and not just once.<br/><br/>First of all, you've got to realize that it's a movie about a battle between 300 Spartans and the gazillion Persians. So there really isn't much of a story. It's one side against the other, improbable odds...and the rest of the movie is just decoration. It's like the director thought of like 4-5 amazing scenes in his head...like the ""This is Sparta"" scene...the horses coming over the hill, the ""We will fight in the shade"" scene...and then tried to fill in the gaps. So there is a serious lack of substance. The cinematography lacks reality, the scenes look terribly fabricated although I would give them full marks for being artistic, it's like a fashion designer and a mythological cartoonist got high together...and decided to make a movie.<br/><br/>So I would say, the aspects that make a war movie truly stunning is it's accurate depiction of reality, it's purpose in it's scenes...and it's sense of humanity. That's where a movie like Gladiator shoots past one like 300. I do understand that the movie doesn't claim to be historically accurate, but really, if they told the story of the Spartans like it was with some terrific direction, you'd have Godfather beaten hollow. The Spartans were far more than just pumped bare-chested men trying to be heroic. Their lives were an excercise in inhuman discipline, unparalleled in our past, present and quite likely, our future. And i really would like to see the reality of that captured!<br/><br/>Finally, I'd just say, when you see the movie...and find yourself going ""Wow....awesome!""...think again, for a story that has been remembered over 2500 years, you'd expect something more than a passing eye-catcher."
"lilqtpi8913","10","1","5","28 March 2007"," ...A Perfect Mix of Sex, War, Gore, and Tragedy...
","Never before have I seen such a movie. The only words I can honestly think of to give 300 justice is amazing, for I dare say that anything less would be blasphemous. <br/><br/>Just as you would expect from an adaptation of a Frank Miller graphic novel, wild use of color, in both language and imagery is used to create the worlds of these well defined characters helping you to feel for each character and push you to the edge of your seat. <br/><br/>As you watch Spartan spears slice through the Persian slave's armor and flesh, their blood in a picture perfect image splatters from the body relentlessly, you feel no need to wince in pain as you do in horror flicks such as Saw 1, 2, & 3, instead you find yourself watching in complete awe, excitement, and thrill as limbs are sliced from the body of a Persian. <br/><br/>Gerald Butler, playing King Leonidas the King of Sparta gives an amazing performance that will have you leaving the theater bellowing his memorable lines, such as ""Persians! Come and get them!"" or perhaps ""This is Sparta!"" maybe just his open mouthed ""roar"". Nevertheless Gerald Butler is very convincing from his first to last lines. Lena Headey, who plays Gorgo, Queen of Sparta gives a thrilling performance as a woman in love with her husband Leonidas, scorned by Dominic West's character, Theron a Spartan of certain power in the council. Vincent Regan plays a memorable Captain who leaves you feeling his pain and brings tears to your eyes on one very sad occasion. Further more David Wenham (Dilios in the film) narrates the epic tale, his loud proud voice draws you in even as he whispers. Rodrigo Santoro (Xerxes the God King or Persia in the film) is very convincing down to the -in my opinion- the best moment in the film **The God King bleeds showing he is a mere mortal**<br/><br/>The whole cast is incredible in the film , just try and tear your eyes from the men's chiseled and nearly always bare abdomen, and for the guys there are several partial nude scenes that you'll most definitely enjoy. <br/><br/>Over all 300 is a movie that is a definite must see. Like I said before, a perfect mix of sex, war, gore, and tragedy."
"nyyrules1189","10","1","5","27 March 2007"," A masterpiece! Pure greatness.
","I just recently saw ""300"" and before going to the movie I thought that it was just going to be one of the same ""Gladiator-like"" movies. However,once I sat down in the seat I would be glued in for the next two hours,and heard that wonderfully composed theatrical music my Jaw-instantly dropped. That was one of the many many times my jaw hit the floor. This film has everything a movie should have in it - romance, drama,comedy(some of the lines were sarcastically funny), and just ounces and ounces of action. I don't care who you are and what type of movies your into, everyone needs to experience this movie in the theaters, because the movie theater sound and picture really bring out the perfection of this film. After watching ""300"" two times, I realize that this movie is my favorite movie of all time, and trust me thats really saying a lot about this movie.<br/><br/>I give ""300"" 20 out of 10! A must experience and must have once it hits the shelves."
"jeffislouie","10","1","5","27 March 2007"," Great film! Just know what to expect.
","This movie was excellent in every way! I enjoyed the plot, the battles, the cinematography - everything. But here's the caveat - DON'T go this movie expecting a non-fiction work. This is based on a Frank Miller comic of the same title, which was inspired by his viewing of the 1962 movie 'The 300 Spartans'. If you think this is a historical recreation of actual events, you will be confused, lost and angry. My friend went to it thinking it would be more realistic a la 'Gladiator' and as a result, found himself unable to follow along. The Plot - Well written and well executed, this plot never got cheesy or inane. Grand themes all too often missing in modern movies are all here - true love, pride, liberty, the cost of freedom, bravery, selfless actions, nationalism, love of fellow man - all here. The violence - very graphic. If you saw Sin City, you can probably imagine how this movie dealt with the violence in the movie. This aspect was cool, but this is not likely appropriate for anyone under 16 or so - no matter how badly they want to see it, nobody needs some 10 year old getting nightmares. Limbs fly off, blood spurts, and we see people getting run through by multiple spears, heads cut off, etc. This was an important part of the movie though, so come prepared with the expectation of gore. The love story - fantastic. Even my girlfriend found it touching. I don't want to ruin the movie, but this queen certainly was a true queen, dedicated to her king and her country. This aspect was never cheesy, though there is one love making scene that was a bit over the top. The bad guy - Okay, Xerxes wasn't that tall and he wasn't effeminate. This movie uses him as a stereotype - the god/king of the Persian Armies who is really just evil to no end. However, when you have a story trying to contrast good versus evil, evil has to be obvious, so this too is forgivable. The special effects - this movie will likely win an award or two for the fantastic work done here. Slow mo scenes are awesome, CGI is virtually undetectable at times, and the whole movie was heavily reliant on the effects. For some reason, they couldn't get some of the animals quite right, but again - forgivable in light of the picture as a whole. All in all, I highly recommend this movie. It was fun to watch, had a gripping story, and people were actually clapping at times - whens the last time THAT happened in a theater? Loved it!"
"angels_1970","10","1","5","27 March 2007"," 300 Spartans vs. the Persian army
","One of the most visually impressive films I've ever seen. Gerard Butler is absolutely fantastic as King Leonidas. I honestly don't think anyone could've been nearly as wonderful in this role. Maybe people will finally see what a great talent he is. The supporting cast also did an excellent job. Vincent Regan's performance brought tears to my eyes. Dominic West was terrific as Theron. Just watching the character of Xerxes, played by Rodrigo Santoro, is worth the price of admission. Zack Snyder's directing did the graphic novel justice. The battle scenes were so well done, it's easy to see why the film spent a year in post production. I've seen it twice already, and definitely plan on seeing it again before it leaves the theaters. If this film doesn't dominate at the Academy Awards, I'll be surprised."
"PoisonKeyblade","10","1","5","27 March 2007"," One of the Best Movies Ever Made!
","300 is the best movie so far this year and possibly the best movie ever made. Black Snake Moan, Alpha Dog, and Perfume: The Story of a Murderer were sensational movies, and this one really rises above them and blows them out of the water. 300 is certainly not your typical war epic; it's filled with more action, plot, character development, and gore than any action film I've ever seen. 300 is based very closely upon the graphic novel by Frank Miller, and is directed and written by Zack Snyder (director of 2004's Dawn of the Dead remake). 300 stars the multi-talented and sensational Gerard Butler, who starred in 2005's Phantom of the Opera, along with a cast of other relatively unknowns.<br/><br/>300 tells the story of The Battle of Thermopylae and many of the events that surround it, and this version throws in lots of flashy special effects, the best action scenes to ever hit the big screen, a perfect cast, and lots of interesting creatures and personalities. Led by Leonidas (Butler), an army of 300 trained Spartan men must face a legion of soldiers led by the ruthless Xerxes that outnumber them by thousands.<br/><br/>300 is extremely effective and careful in its method of storytelling, and we learn the tale of the Spartans both beautifully and effectively. The special effects, among other things, really make the film spectacular. Blood and body parts fly around like bugs, and the action sequences use slow motion in such a way that has never been seen before. The action sequences are clearly the best part about the film; in no other film have there been action scenes that were this gritty, violent, or realistic. The major highlights include some scenes where Leonidas and the others must battle large creatures and different races such as ""The Immortals."" Every character and creature sticks with you, including a disgusting portrayal of ""The Council"" that Leonidas must approach with permission to go to war. The cinematography and overall ""look"" of the film is similar to Sin City (also based on a graphic novel by Frank Miller), but everything is much more stylized and creative. Most of the set pieces and backgrounds are breath-taking and stunning; 300 is a ground-breaking film that sets the stakes extremely high for future action films or graphic novel adaptions. In terms of a translation to film, 300 comes across seamlessly.<br/><br/>As for the acting, Gerard Butler steals all of his scenes as the brooding figure of King Leonidas. He really comes across as a natural leader, and he controls the Spartan army with a fierce determination. Lena Headey plays Queen Gorgo, the wife of Leonidas and a headstrong leader of Sparta. She is very believable in the role, and she has several memorable scenes that are massive highlights of the movie. Rodrigo Santoro plays Xerxes, who is a menacing and disturbing figure in the very few scenes in which he appears.<br/><br/>Overall, 300 is the best action film to date, and one of the best films ever made. The directing, acting, special effects, and cinematography are all top-notch, and this genre of war film has never seen a better adaption. 300 blew away any and all expectations; film doesn't get any better than this landmark film. In the years to come, 300 will certainly be seen as a classic. Don't miss one of the best films ever made¬ó300 breaks all of the rules, doesn't hold anything back, has a dash of humor, and the action scenes are classic."
"ckykyle","Null","1","5","26 March 2007"," Best movie ever - contains AWESOME message
","WARNING: If you are a liberal, you will not like this film. Take a look at most of the comments about this film... the negative ones are more than likely written by all liberals. Why you ask? Because the film generates a good message of standing up and fighting your enemy when they threaten your freedom. Also, it is about fighting the Persians, which to a liberal, consists of a politically incorrect movie because it makes current-day Persians feel bad.<br/><br/>Well, sorry, but that is history and that's what happened. The Spartans DESTROYED the Persians and defended their freedom. If you are a person who feels strongly about freedom (non-liberal) and about defending it with your life, 300 is the perfect movie to go see.<br/><br/>Again, this movie is only going to appeal to you if you believe in freedom. This movie will make a liberal crap his pants.<br/><br/>GO SEE IT!"

","Hi everybody,<br/><br/>I saw the film and I loved it, not only as a Greek but also as a movie fan too. I 'm not here to add yet another comment; I would rather like to offer some information that many of you probably don't know. It is my strong impression that the whole ""styling"" of Leonidas in the movie has been heavily influenced by a famous ancient statue of Poseidon, God of the Sea. It is a bronze statue of around 460 b.C., found in the sea of Artemision, around 200 km north of Athens, which really shows what was the ideal picture of a mature man in ancient Greece. Especially the beard (i.e. length and shape) is identical with Leonidas' in the movie.

The battle scenes were action packed like roller coaster ride. The self sacrificing of the wife to get her husband some help from a self serving politician. tit for tat.

","While I hate comic books as a whole, and particularly 300 I have to say the movie is absolutely brilliant. It has much more depth than I expected, and than the book had. David Wenham also gives a fantastic performance. But what is amazing is of course the technical aspect. The cinematography is brilliantly lit and shot, the editing is brilliant, the costume/art/ and makeup are all fantastic, and the visual effects and particularly sound very well may be the finest of all time. They are simply flawless. The decapitated heads are particularly well designed. The script great. It brings depth to an otherwise flat story. The direction is good, but could have been a lot better. Still a great movie and probably one of my favourites. Look forward to the DVD."

"kevin_crighton","9","1","5","23 March 2007"," stunning, awesome, brilliant
","300 vs 1,000,000? No contest! Zack Snyder, who gave us the impressive Dawn Of The Dead remake, has turned out possibly the best movie of 2007 so far.<br/><br/>300 based on the graphic novel by Frank Miller and Lynn Varley (which I've not read), is simple stunning. The use of the same green screen technique used on Sin City, is brilliant. The action sequences are all impressive, specially with the little touches of slow motion at points to show the Spartan fighting style. If I have a complaint about them, it's that they lack the epic scale of the the battles in say, The Lord Of The Rings trilogy (Helms Deep or Pelinor Fields for example).<br/><br/>The movie that most springs to mind actually is Zulu. Again, it's a small number vs a large army, but the one difference which lets down 300 slightly, is that you only really get to know a couple of characters, whereas in Zulu, for example, it takes time to get to know more of the men before and during the battle.<br/><br/>However, the actors are all good, but credit has got to go to Gerard Butler as Leonidas. He has the difficult task of not only looking like he is one of the hardest men on the planet, but also the conviction to play the King of his people, and the leader of his men. He does so convincingly. I think he could have launched himself into the A-list with his performance.<br/><br/>I've read that Zack Snyder's next movie may be an adaption of the graphic novel The Watchmen. Based on this, and using the same technique on green screen, he may be the man to pull it off.<br/><br/>For now though, simply sit back in awe and watch the first blockbuster of the year.<br/><br/>Pirates 3 and Spider-man 3? Come and have a go if you think you're tough enough. Based on this, I doubt it!!"

"david-4069","10","1","5","21 March 2007"," A semiotically concentrated visceral thrill that works the way it should
","Films are stylised dreams. They use imagery to condense story lines, focus on dramatic plot devices and work, like condensed milk: they address a particular need in us while telling us they really meet many others.<br/><br/>Based on Frank Miller's graphic novel which provided a ready-made storyboard that must have been so useful in slashing costs 300 is more concentrated than most.<br/><br/>It has to work on stereotypes in order to capture the essence if not the reality of a titanic, doomed struggle that each time is mentioned still manages to capture the imagination of each of us.<br/><br/>Historical revisionists have recently laid upon the battle of Thermopylae the tipping point which began to see the rise of Western supremacy and Western values and the beginning of a journey that, for better or worse, brings us here, today.<br/><br/>300 should be taken the same way condensed milk is used these days: a total thrill to our senses disguised as something more noble. So if you are looking for historical insights, meticulous historical research, a balanced view of both sides in this conflict and a film that will leave you feeling you've learnt something new you will have to wait until the History Channel documentary that, I feel, will not be long coming, shows up.<br/><br/>The rest of us will enjoy an unashamed ode to violence legitimised by its connection to the historical moment in a stand that makes Alamo look like a Sunday picnic.<br/><br/>Is it enjoyable for what it is? Absolutely! Zack Snyder has obviously used his megaphone to yell ""more!"" so many times that actors and special effects guys have gone into a state of permanent delivery overdrive.<br/><br/>There is more blood, more gore, more death, more violence, more rousing speeches and laugh-in-the-face-of-death one-liners than any other film would reasonably be expected to be able to get away with.<br/><br/>The reason it all works here is that the setting to the doomed battle that actually happened is worked up so fast and in such stupendously realised stylisation that your brain never engages its analytical gears. The result is equivalent to knowing you're in a dream but never wanting to wake up.<br/><br/>At 117 minutes long the film is taut, the action slick and when it's over and you start breathing normally again you begin to realise why multi-plex bosses hate the wear and tear films like these impose on seats."

","And I am still waiting for the actual war between the Persians and the Spartans to take place!!! <br/><br/>I am not at all saying that the movie has no war in it; as a matter of fact this movie depicts one of the most beautifully choreographed action sequences!! The blood gushing out of bodies in slow-mo, the fight sequences in slow-mo, the camera movements, the lighting, the grainy visuals(damn neat); trust me I can go on for hours appreciating the technical aspect of the movie but unfortunately I have very few words to describe the story(which I wouldn't do, that will spoil the fun!) <br/><br/>It was a total 2 hr eye-candy visual extravaganza but I kinda feel, I as a movie buff, wanted something more out of this effort from Zack Snyder. I mean OK, this movie is based on a story through the eyes of Frank Miller, the graphic novelist who has given us SIN CITY (n SIN CITY 2 is in the making), but still WHY DEPICT PERSIANS AS BRUTAL BEINGS INDULGING IN ALL SORTS OF DEBAUCHERY?!!)This is a case of total distortion of the image of one of the greatest empires ever! Isn't it an age old movie formula wherein the evil is depicted as mutilated,over-grown,one-eyed,terrible looking orc and the good is depicted as muscular,fully loaded,six-packed(and everything nice!)??I mean they must have wronged a lot but why make them(Persians) look awful? Please oh Hollywood moguls, kindly come out of the cocoon you all have been living in! Mr.Miller, take a few tips from OH SO GREAT Stan Lee on how to depict evil; his depiction isn't at least distorted!<br/><br/>But all in all a good movie experience. CGI technology rocks! The production quality is amazing, so are the costumes. Gerard Butler has done an amazing job, the way his character commands respect from his fellow men, his diction; everything. Lena Heady is good too, her speech to the counsel men is neatly shown. David Wenham(LOTR 2 n 3 and Van Helsing) has earned a reputation of doing epic war movies! Rodrigo Santoro (LOST fame) donned every possible designer jewelery for his character. TOTAL EYE CANDY!!!! <br/><br/>But *sighs* it could have been better. Maybe they will make a sequel aptly titled 10000, with a better story-line."
"spasikd","8","1","5","18 March 2007"," It was, OK...
","In my opinion, this was a movie to be recognized, and very criticized.<br/><br/>The movie was very theatrical, adding to more of the war like drama which was most likely experienced during the real Battle of Thermopylae. Though while many things were accurate, many other things deserved harsh criticism.<br/><br/>The Spartan training was very accurate in portraying the brutal life style that the young Spartans experienced, i.e. starvation, pro vocatives, and the will fight. Though the whole ""cinimacy"" of the movie was highly exaggerated.<br/><br/>The real Battle of Thermopylae was a cause of the Persians demanding water and earth, as the movie portrayed. Though, things like only 300 Spartans, is highly exaggerated. The real battle of Thermopylae had 300 Spartans, 700 Thespian volunteers, and 6000 Greek allies (about). The movie should have really been called 7000. While all but 1000 soldiers were dismissed on the 3rd day, it still portrays that less then 300 Spartans remained poised for battle on the 3rd day.<br/><br/>While the battle was amazing where in the Greeks were heavily out-numbered, it seemed that the movie was more played off for people to say ""Woah."", rather then ""Interesting."". Things such as Ephialtes being a disfigured man, and being told to leave by Leonidas, never really happened in History. While Ephialtes did betray the Spartans, he never was disfigured or told that he could not fight in battle, non-the less, he was a traitor.<br/><br/>Also, in the last scene were the Greeks were ready to fight the Persians, the Greeks had actually a whole different plan of attack. The had planned to have a fleet attack to meet the Persians on the 3rd day. As opposed to the 30,000 Greek soldiers fighting in the end. Also many of the Greeks real attack patterns were heavily changed from the movie to give it a more actiony appearance.<br/><br/>While the movie was never said to be historically accurate, It really could have done much better.<br/><br/>Also another thing that I found comical about the movie, was the constant blood splatter. All throughout many of the battle scenes, blood almost fills the screen, with barely any indication of blood splatter on the ground, or on the bodies of the Spartans.<br/><br/>Well there's my two cents on this movie, hope this helps."
"Dark_Helmet","1","1","5","17 March 2007"," Really good, but overrated
","PROS: Great action, great style, mostly decent special effects (apart from the wolf and a few other shoddy effects), and the actor that played Leonidas was very good.<br/><br/>CONS: No real story, superficial characterization, generally terrible acting (especially on the part of the Keira Knightly look-alike that played the queen).<br/><br/>And another thing, why is it that everyone in these types of movies has an English accent when it just simply doesn't apply? The Spartans were GREEKS. True, this film was based on a graphic novel and obviously it requires some suspension of disbelief, but it's a clich√É¬© that is just too glaring to overlook.<br/><br/>Overall, it's a really good movie, but there is no way that it deserves a spot in the top 200. It wasn't even as good as Sin City."

","I'm not going to give it ten. I'll give it nine going on ten, but not quite full marks. It's not a decision I make lightly. Even now as I type I mentally scrutinize the content. <br/><br/>A ten, to me is earned by films like the whole lotr trilogy, It's a wonderful life, A Clockwork Orange etc. A 10 me is not just classified as Excellent, but absolutely outstanding, and provokes emotional and/or phsycological feelings. I have, I admit given ten in the past to films of a personal favourite to me like The Goonies and Over the Hedge. .I admit that those scores are given with bias because they make me smile and laugh so much on a personal level.<br/><br/>Not that this film is not one of the best pictures in the last five years.<br/><br/>Au Contrare . .<br/><br/>Epic, fantastic, brilliant. .those are some of the choice words I could use. The wow factor in particular, and some whoops and applause from me during some of the battle sequences. Indeed, it seems that despite the special effects, we are given very authentic looking battles. At times I am reminded of Peter Jacksons Lord of the Rings with spears and shield close ups, and perhaps even the matrix with the slow/rapid turning camera motions. The comic book blood is very effective, and I am glad they chose to utilise that method.<br/><br/>300 is indeed a landmark experience, with solid performances from beginning to end from a cast of fairly well knowns to not so well knowns. Indeed, Gerard Butler puts in a striking performance as a non A list actor, which should tell is a few things about the Hollywood system. His screen wife, stands just as strong, and plays no second fiddle to a film with so much body (no pun intended) that you can thrive on the testosterone alone.<br/><br/>This film has much historical and mythological value. Especially when King Leonidas (forgive any incorrect spelling) informs the deformed hunchback of his unsuitability to join with the 300 due to the way that the unit operates as one. The monsters, the creatures of this ancient world, whilst indeed a work of dark fantasy become as much a part of the film as the history it represents. And as such, it is quite possible to lose yourself in the authentic looking wardrobe and cgi sets and believe for a while that the dark ages of beasts and chaos did exist. Not since the Harry Hausen films, and Excalibur, and even Caligula have I been this drawn into a world of dark woven and quite frankly sinister shrouds of ancient mythos.<br/><br/>If it has to fall short, it would, I would have to say lose marks on the story content. <br/><br/>I think most of us, a greater majority go to watch this film because of the action. Everything holds up strong on its own two feet in this film, perhaps bar what you might call emotional engagement.<br/><br/>300 is a very 'tough' film; quite frankly merciless in terms of how *weak* the people of Sparta are not allowed to be, or pervade in any way. From the beginning we are shown the cruel but necessary trials and engagements that the very young are made to endure, to eventually become Spartan warriors. And as such, I do not think we,as an audience have any pity to fall back on, since violence and death is a cottage industry. <br/><br/>When we look at the story, there is in fact, not a great deal. It's quite a straight forward concept of not bowing down to an advancing empire; and as such sending a meager but iron tough contingent of Spartans against the millions of the dark Persian horde. Of course, we do get glimpses of the politically corrupt and certain things that seemingly must be done in order to preserve the empire; these however, are small potatoes and sidelines. That it lacks such emotional pull, is perhaps the reason it does not merit its ten. I could also have done without Wehnams pep talk at the end, but then again, they had to close the film out somehow.<br/><br/>That being said, it's not Gladiator, it's not lord of the rings. It 'is' rich, testosterone pumping Spartan grit and blood and battle, and I certainly will not ask for more in that respect.<br/><br/>A must see, a must own, as simple must.<br/><br/>9 and then some out of ten.<br/><br/>I would highly recommend this film."
"reidster21","8","1","5","14 March 2007"," A great action flick that is comparable in entertainment level to Gladiator
","This movie was very entertaining to watch because it was visually stunning. It is rare to find a movie that makes so much out of color schemes and can take suspension of disbelief to a new level by fantastically expanding on a real story.<br/><br/>First of all though, lets clear up some misunderstandings-this movie is not political. This is a fantasy flick-a movie that creates its own mythological tale around real historical events. I will not view this as political because there isn't anything political there unless you dig for it and try to make it be there.<br/><br/>The story in this movie really isn't anything that was too deep, and the secondary character development was relatively poor overall. A lot of the characters seemed soul-less in parts of the movie, which is good in a way because it painted a good view of Spartan culture. The distinguishing aspect of this movie was the cinematography. The battle scenes (most of the movie) are astoundingly well done. I was on the edge of my seat with every sword swing, and the slow-motion usage emphasized the fantastic aspects of the characters in the movie. Leonidas seems like Russell Crowe in Gladiator, and since most of the movie is about men on a Greek battlefield, I felt it wasn't much of a stretch to draw a comparison between this and Gladiator (I know that movie is Roman, don't write me emails).<br/><br/>This movie is a work of art. When you analyze a painting you look at the texture of the artwork primarily and then search for the deeper meaning. Thats how you have to analyze this movie-and nothing has been made like this before. This movie creates a myth-a fantastic, amazing myth-and because of that it is revolutionary."

This may very well be the best film I have ever seen and could be number one on the 250 list very soon.

"kypfisto","10","1","5","11 March 2007"," A Welcome Break from the Post-Modern
","These days everybody is used to seeing very sketchy films where nobody really knows who the good guys are or who the bad guys are. The audience of these films are left to wonder and think about how many flaws are we willing to accept to see a character as ""good"" or ""bad"". ""300"" breaks from this style and goes back to the olden days of film where everything was pretty much black and white. Now, some people might see this as hindering to the film's effect but it doesn't. In this day and age we need more heroes to look up to that have extremist but absolute and uncompromising without blinking. Of course its not reality. Anyone who knew what kind of graphic novel this was based on should have been aware of that going into the theater. The world doesn't need reality in all of its films. We need a modern myth, and ""300"" provides this, surely not on the scale of the original ""Star Wars"" but still epic in its own right. I'm not saying that commentary films aren't as good, but we've been overloaded with that variety for the past decade. Finding a balance so one could go into a theater, watch a film and think about what's wrong with society, then go into another and come out thinking what we can look up to and hope for as a people is what's most important. And in an era where most films depict anti-heroes and even glorify villains, showing some good old black and white good vs evil story is refreshing."
"jennin82","8","1","5","11 March 2007"," Exceptionally good at what it sets out to do
","This movie sets out to tell a tale...not an intricately detailed and deep plot, but a TALE!!! This is a historical piece on a war! At this, it succeeds as no other picture of this type has ever succeeded. I am not easily thrilled by chauvinistic violence in the theaters, but I can easily say that the violence of this movie absolutely THRILLED me and I cannot explain how they made each death exciting...but they did. Credits to Snyder, obviously, for fantastic direction in a medium (the constant use of blue/green screen) that I hope takes off and spawns a new generation of filmmakers, and also to Miller for the adaptation. The original story of the heroic Spartans remains, at its basics, historically accurate. The celluloid liberties taken were well done and pertinent to the necessity of entertainment. I realize that I've been praising the rather abstract aspects of this movie, but the acting was, although not breath-taking, good. Butler and Headey are the obvious stand-outs. They've breathed life into characters that were nothing more than caricature-like historical figures that embodied heroics...giving the roles life and emotion that may not have been delivered appropriately, given other actors. Hats off to Butler...he was the heart of this film (aside from the production).<br/><br/>Enough quibbling over the specifics, go see this movie! It's worth your money and your time. This movie is unfortunately probably not worth a best picture nomination, but IS in fact, probably one of the more exciting movies I've seen in the last decade. As I said, this sort of adventurous film-making will hopefully have a future in Hollywood. 8/10. Bravo!"
"yankeedoodles789","10","1","5","11 March 2007"," Fantastic!!
","I can honestly say that 300 is one of the best movies I have ever seen, if not, the best movie. While there isn't a great plot to back it up, the plot that is there serves its purpose, to further develop a great action movie. This is by no means a sappy romance movie, so don't expect it to be, it's a movie about a group of men struggling to defend the country they cherish.<br/><br/>As for everyone who bashes the legitimacy of the Persian army.. common, in reality they may have been a great, prosperous and civilized nation, but what would that do for the cinematography? Seriously? We could have the Persians strolling up to the Spartans casually chatting about the weather and if the would like to surrender or not.. or we could have a horde of bloodthirsty soldiers charging into battle with weapons flailing.. who makes a better antagonist? As for their looks, if they're gonna be the bad guys they might as well look the part.<br/><br/>I thought the CGI was incorporated extremely well into the movie, you can tell that it's computer animated, but it all looks incredible, almost lifelike. Also, you can't really chop off a guy's head in real life, so CGI is about as close as it's gonna get.<br/><br/>I honestly cannot think of a better action film I've seen or heard of. If I could give more than 10 stars I would do so in a heartbeat. Everyone (over 17 of course) should definitely see this movie at least once, if not for the historical value, then at least for the spectacular visuals and battle scenes."

The epic battles are so beautiful and poetic that they will bring a tear to your eye.<br/><br/>Overall, if you want to see just a movie go see something else, but if you want an emotional experience that will stay with you then see 300.<br/><br/>( Noir - a cinematic term used primarily to describe stylish Hollywood crime dramas, particularly those that emphasize moral ambiguity and sexual motivation.

"renegade5209","10","1","5","11 March 2007"," Brilliant in more ways than one
","300 sets a new standard for movies of its kind. Following the true story of the 300 Spartans who fought the entire Persian army. Although the movie certainly exaggerates some of the details, it does portray a factual depiction of the Spartan warriors raised to fight to the death. The movie is a perfect combination of history, fantasy, action, and drama. Combining epic battle scenes with sensual romances the movie does not provide a dull moment. War cries, poetic soliloquies, and some fantastic one liners are all used to give the sharp-tongued Spartans a modern smart-aleck tone while keeping the feel of the beautiful language of classic Greek epics. The unique, dark, exaggerated look of the film works well with both the intense, graphic battles and the more quiet, heartfelt scenes. The look of the film is a perfect fit for the writing and acting that force anyone watching to feel the raw emotion throughout the whole movie. You will not be disappointed by the hype this movies been given. You will feel with the characters, and begging for more you'll be reluctant to leave when the movie ends."

Frank Millers 300 will be a movie remembered in the next decade to come. I don't think there is any movie in its genre that can even touch it, or will come close to matching the amazing style Zack Snyder recreated from the graphic novel.

","From the presentation of the opening titles, to the credits at the end, the film flows seamlessly. The writing, acting, special effects, directing and cinematography are terrific, which means that the producing was spot-on!! There are very few films about which I think ""This could not have been done better!"", but that is my opinion of this picture. It was a superb reality-dream. I will see it again before it's run is through! I particularly thought that the decision to film in sepia tone lent the proper character to the peace. It is a grim story, and a gory one of necessity, and bright color would not be appropriate. It is also important that enough background of the Spartan culture is given so that the viewer understands that the Spartans were not machines, but real people trained from childhood to endure all for the protection and glory of Sparta. The film also presents contrasting cultures from the time, and would, by extension, allow one to compare and contrast our present attitudes toward combat and freedom to those of bygone eras. A beautiful and compelling film which gets the audience fully involved in a battle against overwhelming odds whose outcome resonates to this day."

","I Really enjoyed the movie and i saw it IMAX also, the battle scenes were very powerful and believable. I'm definitely watching this movie again some time later. It felt like you were actually there right behind the Spartans fighting the Persians. All the actors gave an amazing performance and the visuals were just stunning. I think it was a little better than Sin City but that's just personally my opinion. Frank Miller's graphic novel is a perfect twin. The original score is great and very moving especially with IMAX surround sound. I wish we see more of Frank Miller's work on the screen because if its done as well as 300 was he might be looking at Best Directing in An Oscar."

","I was super hyped about this film, but I went into just thinking that it was going to be a really sweet action film. After viewing I realized that it was MUCH MUCH more. The story is actually very deep in this one. The battle scenes were so incredibly intense as well. There was a great amount of slow motion, but this did not take away from the battles at all. There were also multiple scenes that I was just blown away by not only the visual aspects and the acting (By the way the acting was phenomenal), but just because how bad ass the scenes were. I highly recommend this movie to everyone, EVERYONE.<br/><br/>Even if you have a girlfriend who isn't into action or a girl with a guy that's not into action(???) this is a movie everybody needs to see.

","i just returned from a late night screening on opening day of 300. it's by far one of the best historical Greek epic (whatever its called) movies ever. on par with Gladiator as this generations top epic. like gladiator violent, but stylized not hiding anything, and going extremely over the top (in a good way). the non fight scenes were stirring and breathtaking (especially the love scene between Queen and King, its really good and tasteful). the effects were top notch, film almost entirely on green screen, the use of color and light enhance this triumphant film as a herald to cinema today. i suggest you see it, many times if you must."
"RedemptionSong2","7","1","5","9 March 2007"," Lives up to it's hype
","Well, I just got back from the 9:45 P.M. showing of 300. I was pumped to see it. <br/><br/>From the very beginning you get sucked into the plot. The Acting is average i would say. Some of the lines seem forced. The fighting is intense, Its not like those fast paced fights were you don't understand *beep* You can actually see how the fighters maneuver. <br/><br/>I would have to say, Frank Miller's style really detracted from the film. I feel almost as if the monsters are completely unnecessary. Although he's what put the entertainment and style into this film, it could have had a better feel to it without a 9 foot 3 inch retard with chains wrapped around him. <br/><br/>The Queen to me plays a great role, from inspirational speeches to the passionate love a wife gives to her husband. <br/><br/>For those of you who are wondering watching this with your parents would make you feel awkward for like 3 minutes of the movie. There's a seen were the king/queen do their thing and a massive orgy of monsters which kind of made me look the other way. <br/><br/>As far as the visually stunning part, I cant say its something i haven't seen before, its a computerized background. The style and how unique the movie is makes it stunning. <br/><br/>Lots of Action. Lots of Fun. INTENSE. Go see it if you haven't Rating:8.4/10 (I think the voters have it right!)"

It's been a long time I've seen a film so stylized and with such a great story, that this has been a great refresher for me. The film is loaded with some of the craziest and coolest fights you'll see in a movie, plus the actual script is so well written that the characters are so alive with personality. Not only that, but the actual acting was just fantastic, each actor fully embracing their character and becoming them in such a way that it is seen only sometimes. Honestly, this is one of the best comic book adaptations made since Sin City, which of course happens to be created by the same author of this film. I'm very much looking forward to what the director has in store for ""The Watchmen""."

I think that i was expecting so much of 300, but it didn't really be the movie i thought it would be. It's still a good movie though, but not amazing like how i thought it was going to be. I saw it with a big group of people, some of my friends loved it more then me, a couple of them hated it.

I don't know if I can say I often walk away from a movie thinking I got my moneys worth, to the contrary I almost never think it, often regretting the $10 I just laid down for a ticket but I can honestly admit that this one was worth every penny. Many critics don't like it. Citing that only the niche graphic novel lovers will enjoy it but I beg to differ. Equating it to Sin City I find is a falsehood. Every scene looked more like an intricate painting than a still shot taken from a comic strip. I am surprised no one has ever created a film of this battle previously since it writes itself. This is the kind of movie that is not remembered for the year but the decade in which it was created."
"timboytx","6","1","5","9 March 2007"," One-dimensional
","I found the film engrossing, but only because it was overflowing with striking imagery and plenty of skin. If we, the viewers, are to have a meaningful emotional connection with characters who risk their lives and lose them for the sake of their country, those characters must convince us they are, in effect, real people. In ""300"", realism is wholeheartedly jettisoned for the sake of artificial, though striking, imagery. As a result, it is a film for the head, not the heart. The characters are one-dimensional archetypes, hardly distinguishable from each other. In fact, if one thinks about some of the choices made by the director and/or production designer, it's almost laughable. (Capes?!!!!) The movie will be remembered only for its unique visuals, not for its impact on the heartstrings."

","An action inspired battle movie meets comic book madness. This is what 300 is all about! Bloody battle after bloody battle the special effects and directing are both beautiful and awe inspiring at times. Occasionally the blood spatters and giant foes go over the top but for the most part it is very well done and welcome.<br/><br/>My only real complaints with the movie is that it was a bit predictable, the narrator hurt the momentum and there was no emotions in this film. With this said, the acting was decent and Gerard Butler, King Leonidas, was very commanding and played the role of a fearless king very well. The narration helped explain the background of the film but would come at times where the battles just finished and the tension should be building. The tension probably would have been increased more if the audience was meant to care for any of the characters. Since the characters were mostly emotionless and nameless there was no hoping that they would live or die. The result is that the audience never feels tension and instead is left with just the pure amusement of the battle and the creative directing.<br/><br/>Like I said before, 300 is a mix of a action inspired battle movie with the creativity of a comic book. If you like how that sounds check it out, if not stay away."

","I hated this movie so bad I can't put it into words, I wanted to see a real movie about the infamous 300 Spartans, but this was just a piece of C.G.I. big budget garbage - pure Hollywood trash, with no heart, no style and no facts. TRASH!!!! So a stubborn man named Leonidas, in fear of his city being invaded by the Persian, takes 300 of his men out to kill as many as he can and will die before he returns. Okay that is stupid enough right there.. So yea he takes his measly army up against the thousands Xerxes puts against him and he kills hundreds, maybe thousand but yea he ultimately dies. The movie ends with the council finally (too late) sending out the Spartan army to aid up against the Persians, but the movie ends and oh well I could care less, I know the real history of what happened and this movie was as far away from the facts as anyone could dream of.<br/><br/>I am not a fan of Zack Snider, he did a good job with Dawn of the Dead remake, but even that had too much of HIS style and he's not a director, he's a guy filming a bunch of films with a bunch of computer graphics and his editor does more work, his animation department does more work, his cinematographer does more work and oh yea his deep pocket producers dish it out and people call him a great director, hes not!!! First off this movie is far from factual. It is so made up and over the top that it is cheesy and stupid. I viewed it as complete fiction and therefore I hated the characters, if you're gonna fight a losing battle then you deserve to die, I swear to god I think republicans made this movie happen it seems like a fantasized George Bush dream... The movie is full of these creatures that never have walked on this Earth before and if so, I can assure you the Persians didn't know how to train them. This movie was so dumb and such things killed me, this is Persia, these are Iranians, this isn't middle Earth, could they have at least TRIED to make it seem real. The old priests living on the hill with an oracle - WTF - Why were they crazy about gold for, I didn't see a shopping mall up on the hill there with them.<br/><br/>The movie was so big budget, yet it had a b-movie flow to it, the dialog was so stupid and this crazy narrator made me wanna strangle someone. The Spartans deserved to die if you ask me, they couldn't show love, they treated their children like crap and why would they wanna stay and protect that crummy place they lived. The Persians looked like they had fun and were living it up, put me with them any day of the week. These actors were horrible, more overacting than a movie I have seen since 1930. With their sprayed on abs and even cheekbones, reading the dumbest lines ever. The fake blood and the awful, awful, did I mention it was awful, slow motion fight scenes. Thats a directors way of cheating because he can't film it in actual time and get it done right.

"moonspinner55","5","1","6","9 October 2008"," ""Our arrows will blot out the sun!"" ... ""Then we will fight in the shade.""
","Frank Miller's graphic novel of ancient Greek battle becomes ""Matrix""-ized splatter-flick, though one with a bemused smirk and black blood (making it somewhat more tolerable than horror-themed slaughters with a high body count). Gerard Butler plays the King of Sparta, facing a humiliating loss of freedom from neighboring Persia, whose massive army is mythical in its legion. Despite a mere 300 men under his leadership, and a warning from the Oracle that ""all Greece will fall"", Butler's Leonidas devises a plan to combat the Persian soldiers and their king, Xerxes (who has a God complex as well as a kinky bent). Despite the orgiastic violence (countless impalements, gorings, decapitations, and disembowlments) and the brawny six-packs on the men--nearly every one of them--the film isn't intrinsically charged (either sexually in the masochistic sense or vitally). The matte paintings and other elaborate effects never take on a life of their own, and the scenario doesn't sizzle. Instead, it's a fairly straight-forward war film, and many will see this as an attribute. The screenplay includes several good lines of sharp or jaded dialogue, and yet the macho brute force is one-note. The repetition eventually wears one down, and the picture has nowhere to go after the one-hour mark. ** from ****"

","This movie is one of those rare spectacles that has something so original, so fresh, and so bold, that I can only describe it as perfect. It had been so hyped up by everyone that I couldn't help but walk into the theater with the highest of expectations. Those expectations were obliterated. Visually it is stunning. When it ended I was the last one in my seat because I couldn't use my legs. It was an amazing thing to behold. But what makes this movie so great is that once you are able to get past the amazing visual effects, you realize that there is also beautifully written and wonderfully acted movie underneath. So moving was the passion for freedom of the Spartans that I was brought to feel the same passion for my own freedom. The lines were brilliantly delivered and Gerard Butler was perfect in his role, as were all the others of a phenomenal cast. When all is said and done, 300 takes the bar for it's genre of film and sets it to a hight that no other has reached."
"cracka_mcnasty","10","1","6","10 April 2007"," Best movie I've seen in a while
","First things first, this movie is NOT, I repeat NOT historically accurate, nor is it suppose to be. For the last time people, it is based on a graphic novel. If I hear someone bash this movie one more time because it is ""historically inaccurate"" I am going to flip. It is also not an allusion to the war in Iraq because the story was written years before America went in there. It is not a racist movie, it is being told through the eyes of the Spartans, so of course the Spartans will make the Persians out to be the scum of the world, they are the enemies and are depicted as so. Stop being so critical and take in the movie for what it is, entertainment.<br/><br/>Now, on to the film itself. 300 is one of the most original movies I have seen in a good long time. No it is not just like ""Sin City"", but it is similar in the fact that it was written by the same guy. The visuals are breathtaking and I found myself getting lost in the world that Zack Snyder brought to the screen. The fight scenes were amazing. My jaw dropped to the floor more than once during those battles, as did everyone I went to see it with, each time I went (I've seen it 3 times so far).<br/><br/>The story behind the queen, though predictable, is still very well thought out. You can tell that the love between Leonidas and the Queen is true from what she risks to help him.<br/><br/>The score for the movie is absolutely brilliant. Tyler bates did a phenomenal job with the arrangements, and really brought the movie together with his pieces. The movie wouldn't have been half as good had the score been any different My only complaint about the movie is the random goat-human hybrid abomination of god that was smoking a hookah in a tent¬Ö or something of that nature. I mean come on now, that is definitely a WTF moment that will leave you scratching your head and saying ""Huh?"" <br/><br/>Other than that the movie was brilliant. Every time I see it, I get goosebumps at last scene with the ending speech, and every time I see it, I leave the theatre with a feeling of pride for the fact that I had just witnessed one of the most bad-ass events in human history.<br/><br/>Go see it."
"Max_Eggeling","9","1","6","9 April 2007"," The perfect movie.
","Well I still have to come down from what I saw.<br/><br/>""300"" is amazing. For me it is the best movie of 2007 right now. I cannot think about ANY movie better this year.<br/><br/>But let's talk about why I feel so.<br/><br/>""300"" is a war movie. I is full of blood, guts, severed body parts and violence all in all. There is no lame love story and there is no ""But we could try to fix all the problems diplomatic.""-Story.<br/><br/>BUT we do have a love story - but it is put in the movie so soft and inconsiderable that it does not disturb the slaughter. We have Queen Gorgo and King Leonidas having an intense relationship, they love each other more than anything else, but they don't show it all the time with comments like ""Oh god, don't go my love."" As it's said by the Narrator: ""It's no space for weakness!"" (I saw it dubbed in German so it might depend on the language what is said!).<br/><br/>In ""300"" we don't see the warriors cry or something like that. We don't see scenes in which enemies become brothers or other things seen in so many movies. ""300"" is violent - no doubt. The Spartans leave their home to kill and die - nothing more, nothing less.<br/><br/>When I saw the movie there were a lot of girls crying about Leonidas dying in the end - but I still don't know why. He died in honor and pride as he wanted.<br/><br/>But to leave the story aside: A lot of people I talked to about the movie said ""Yeah well, it was okay, but there was too much computer animation and that made it look unrealistic."" So what? Has anyone seen ""Sin City""? Or better: read Miller's comics? Snyder has brought the ambiance of those graphic novels to the screen. In every way.<br/><br/>What I also like to comment on is the following: A lot of German newspapers wrote about how ""300"" is a movie for gay people because of all the naked man in it. I want to underline that there are a LOT of naked (good looking) women too and that the Spartans make jokes about the gay Greeks. Another thing to be read in Germany is that the movie transports fascistic ideas. And I haven't seen those neither. As said: They kill - that's all.<br/><br/>All in all, ""300"" is an absolutely great movie. It shows how 300 fight against a million and how they die in honor while fighting. The ambiance is great, the actors play very, very good and I've seen only two goofs. What is questionable are the ""monsters"" the Persians carried with them, but okay, we take that.<br/><br/>""300"" is worth 11 out of 10 points but I cannot rate it that high. Watch it. watch it again and then buy the DVD to watch it over and over again. If you like violence and the graphic novels you will love the movie.<br/><br/>""Spartans! Ready your breakfast and eat hearty... For tonight, we dine in hell!"" Enjoy it!"

I was a bit sceptical but once the opening scene came on, I knew I was in for a visual feat. The storyline was fleshed out well. I feel the actors did really well, you could see the emotions from their eyes and voices. A special mention goes to Gerard Butler. He WAS King Leonidas. And for those people who said that it was historically inaccurate, c'mon, it was based on the comic book, not the historical event. And also, it was told through the eyes of the Spartan soldier who exaggerated the events so that he could honour his comrades. All in all, it was the best movie of 2007."

","Kudos to Gerald Butler & Lena Heady who bring off their roles as King & Queen of Sparta really well. They get some capable support but they are the two lynch pins that hold this film together well. <br/><br/>This is based upon the same story as The 300 Spartans in 1962 & is very well done. The computer efforts here look much better than the remake of King Kong's effect did just a short time ago. I enjoyed this film, as it is unpretentious about being an action film. The film is exactly as advertised.<br/><br/>The action takes place in the 5th Century BC, when 300 Spartans held off thousands of Persians for 3 days in order to give the rest of Greece time to mount up their defenses. After this battle, the Atneian Navy used a similar strategy of luring the larger Persian Navy into a smaller water area and soundly thrashing the Persian fleet. <br/><br/>The sex in this film is mild & artfully crafted, not something you need to worry about taking a teenager too. The violence, if brutal & if you have a teen who does not like violence such as be-headings, this might not be a film for them. This film knows where it is at & does a fine job of bringing it off. One of the better film remakes in quite a while. <br/><br/>Would highly recommend the tale of King Leonidas fighting to extinction to slow the invading hoards from Persia from conquest of Ancient Try & Greece. The Persion Leaders all seem to have a lot of body pierced hardware on. Almost looks like some of the modern day body piercing. Not sure how well this look fits historically, but it is not that important in how the film is staged & how the story is told. <br/><br/>For someone into gritty battle films, this is a must see."

","300 is a movie stripped to its bare essentials in every sense of the phrase. Storywise, it could be recounted on the head of a pin- with plenty of space left over. Acting doesn't really enter into it, as there isn't any: the actors themselves are mere set-pieces, and trot about in the nearly naked spouting clich√©s we've heard spouted by players in every forgettable TV series or fantasy film set among the toga-draped for the past 2,000 years. Like its second cousin on its father's side, SIN CITY, 300 almost manages to dispense entirely with the bothersome human element. The result is a virtual movie that's almost the next-best thing to watching a video game on the Big Screen. Almost."
"JimSDCal","6","1","6","17 March 2007"," A Pppular but not very good movie
","""300"" is a popular movie but not a very good one. There is little plot and a lot of violence. It tells the story, not well, of 300 Spartans who battled hordes of Persians seeking to destroy them and to te Greece. It is not so much the violence I object to, I really like ""Braveheart"" and the ""LOTR"" movies, but the fact that there is lo little drama in recounting the Spartans story.<br/><br/>Spartans, the movie informs its audience, were trained to be warriors from an early age. They are constantly drilled and tested so by the time they reach maturity they are able to encounter any foe with a good chance of being victorious in the encounter. Leonidas (Gerard Butler) is the king of Sparta and like other Spartans was trained to be a soldier and to never give in to his enemies demands. This training is put to the test when King Xerses of Persia comes to Greece intending to conquer the nation-states of that region. Xerses' forces vastly outnumber the Spartans and is certain, because of his superior numbers, to defeat the Spartans in battle, no matter how valiantly the Spartans fight. But the king of Persia turns out to admire Sparta's warrior mentality and all he demands of Leonidas is that he kneel before him, acknowledge him as his God and let Persia control Greece. But, this Leonidas will not do and he recruits the 300 best Spartan warriors to got to war against Persia. After this development, the movie is filled with battle scenes and mayhem as the 300 heroically oppose the vast Persian army.<br/><br/>So, with very little plot development behind it, the movie moves on to several very graphic battle sequences as the audience sees Spartans stab, impale, sever and behead their opponents. For a while it seems the Spartans are going to make the cost of victory so high that the Persians might give in. But, in a sub-plot a hunchback, whom Leonidas would not let fight with the 300, turns traitor and the Spartans are outflanked, leading to their doom. This sub-plot, like the one involving the Spartan queen and a council member only slightly ups the dramatic ante as both are very predictable in their outcomes.<br/><br/>Some people might be squeamish about the graphic violence of this depiction of a graphic novel by Frank Miller. But the battle sequences are the best thing about this movie. The action is almost all done with CGI as actors fight scenes that were filmed in front of ""green screen"" with backgrounds later added digitally by computer whizzes. It all seems very realistic and it is hard to tell what action is computer enhanced. But good CGI effects lacking a compelling story is a hollow victory for the movie's makers. I get the point that Spartans were warriors, more than willing to die to defend their nation. But this is a thin reed to base a 1 3/4 hour movie. I like the action of this film but not the story so I grade it 6 points out of 10."

"korink","8","1","6","15 March 2007"," Utterly epic
","Based on Frank Miller's graphic novel of the same title, 300 is a film, portraying the Spartans of the Battle at the Pass of Thermopylae's perspective. As such, it glorifies the Spartans, while vilifying the traitor, who showed the Persians to the Spartans' flank, as well as the Persian Empire's occupants.<br/><br/>Because it is based on a work of historical fiction, which, of course, contains some historical facts, it is not faithful to history. For instance, the Spartans and other Greeks are seen with out their brass cuirasses equipped, which runs contrary to history. The Spartans can also seen breaking their phalanx formation sooner than in reality, which would have, realistically, led to more losses than portrayed. There are several other liberties taken to history, for instance some monsters, and Xerxes's portrayal, though these are less significant than the above. Regardless of those facts, this movie IS NOT intended to be faithful to history, so the fuss over this (along with this film's supposed racism) is incredibly asinine. The Persians, after all, are not shown as totally impotent, but rather out-skilled, and out-witted by the Spartans and other Greeks present at Thermopylae. <br/><br/>The action is also not totally realistic, and some complain about the spears constantly piercing the enemy's chests. Quite frankly, this was how ancient warfare was waged; the Spartans would enter a phalanx formation, wherein they would create essentially a square, packed tightly, and raise their shields and spears. The enemy would clash with them, then the Spartans would repel them, and stab them with their spears. Furthermore, nearly all the units shown in the film (including, of course, the Immortals, and the Hoplites) existed in reality.<br/><br/>The special effects are, to say the least, spectacular, however, redeeming much of the above. There is an excess of blood, in some instances, but it is adequate, for the most part. The acting was also great - there was no forced or awkward dialog, though occasionally, the narrative seemed misplaced.<br/><br/>Why then, through my defense of this film, do I rate it only an 8? While the special effects are awesome, nearly the entire film is shot on a blue screen - the back drop is supplanted, rather than being a physical one. Also, some aspects were a bit too cartoony, among a few other (primarily minor) details."

","Fearless, brave, valiant. They were Spartans. The mighty King Leonidas led a team of 300 Spartan free soldiers against thousands of Persian slaves in the ancient battle of Thermopylae. The resulting battle made one hell of a movie. In the film 300, there is a non-stop sense of action and constant entertainment. This sensational film develops a unique, artistic, comic book sense of directing while never losing it's grip on the audience. Gerard Butler stars as King Leonidas who leads a cast of a relatively unknown, but none-the-less spectacular, Spatan army. The action sequences are superb and intense. As the death toll rises so does the audience's interest. This movie has it all and will leave everyone in the theater and at home staring and not daring to miss a second of it.

","OK, when I first saw the trailer/commercials for this movie, I had no idea what it was about. It just showed a bunch of muscled dudes fighting each other, some monsters, and a pretty cool visual look. When I found out it was about a comic book based on a historical event, and by the same guy who did ""Sin City"" I thought ""Ok, looks pretty entertaining."" Now I was one of the few people who didn't like Sin City. While the style was cool, something about the story and characters didn't do it for me. As the commercials kept coming on TV, I knew this was going to be an over-the-top action flick. I always chuckle inside when the main character would yell in the trailer ""THIS IS SPARTA!"" It was very silly to me. So, I guess what I'm saying is leave your brain on the doorstep when going to see this movie. It is not meant to educate you about the actual battle of Sparta vs. Persia. I doubt that any parallels between this movie and the current situation in Iraq was in mind when they made it. You've seen this movie before (Braveheart, The Alamo, anything where the protagonists are against unsurmountable odds), but enjoy it for its unique style and look."
"doctorx2","7","1","6","11 March 2007"," A violent cartoon
","""300"" is a spectacularly violent, sexually graphic cartoon, featuring live actors against computer-generated backgrounds and special effects. Faithful to the Frank Miller comic series, it is based loosely on history and (like much of Miller's work) has more to do with style than substance.<br/><br/>It's been pointed out by everyone else that ""300"" is based not on history, but on Frank Miller's comic series, so it is somewhat unfair to judge the film based on its historical accuracy. Nonetheless, it's difficult to overlook the conspicuous absence of some historically important and interesting aspects of the Battle of Thermopylae: the antecedent Battle at Marathon and what Leonidas drew from it, the naval battle with the Persians during Thermopylae and its significance in protecting Leonidas from being flanked by the Persians (the outnumbered Greek navy of triremes taking on the vast Persian fleet at sundown), the Spartan armor (the laminated Cuirass in particular, the ancient world's version of Kevlar), and the function and significance of the phalanx (Hoplite attacks with spears from above and below a wall of shields, etc.). One would hope that director Zack Snyder's sensational presentation of the story of the 300 Spartans would stimulate young minds to delve into history and gather the significance of the Battle of Thermopylae -- i.e., that they saved Western civilization, and had they failed, there would never have been a higher Greek civilization based on democracy, or (later) Rome, or (much later) our culture and society -- but one fears that young viewers will more likely be on the look-out for the next sensationally violent and sexually graphic film than a history lesson.<br/><br/>The actors are deserving of a word or two. Gerard Butler's Leonidas was a bit over the top, intense every moment. Some acting dynamics (taking it down a notch occasionally) would have made his high-intensity scenes feel more intense. The same is true to some extent of the entire cast, so perhaps the fault here lies with the director, Snyder. Lena Headey was great as the unfortunately-named Queen Gorgo, and Dominic West was wonderfully malicious as the evil traitor Theron.<br/><br/>The effects were spectacular, and the fact that almost every aspect of the film (backgrounds, sets, bloodshed) was digitally rendered makes the effects even more impressive. It is likely that more films will follow suit in the future. One bone to pick: the wolf in early in the film. What was that thing? It looked, well, not REAL, and the glowing red eyes were just silly. It was distracting. The same is true of the gigantic elephants, the gigantic rhinoceros, and the gigantic Xerxes. None of these needed to be so BIG.<br/><br/>The scripting was bit slow and hokey; not much dialog for a two-hour film, and the voice-over narrative, intended to give the story a mythic, legendary feeling, was campy (reminiscent of the voice-over narratives in The Road Warrior and Conan the Barbarian). Again, this is probably unfair, knowing Miller's work and the effect that Snyder was going after (impact, not teaching history).<br/><br/>Suspending disbelief and hanging with the script for a moment, one has to wonder why Queen Gorgo accepted Theron's ""deal."" Her doing so violated Spartan ethics (honor and duty), and she must have known that Theron was not to be trusted.<br/><br/>I saw this film in a theater packed to capacity with teen aged boys (I was one of maybe half a dozen dads there; no women of any age were in evidence). The crowd cheered and winced at all the appropriate moments, and gave the film an ovation when it ended. This would be a great film to see with a group of guys -- certainly never with a date or spouse.<br/><br/>So, ""300"" is really a 21st century version of the films we loved in our youth -- like the original Clash of the Titans -- but with a lot more sex and violence. Cheesy, violent, and spectacular -- but not a lot of substance."

Next THE IMAX....OH YES!!<br/><br/>You will walk into this movie going, what is this about, but when you leave the movie, your chest will swell, your arms will pump, and you will scream at the top of your lungs "" I AM A SPARTAN, HEAR ME ROAR "" and you will get a rush of invincibility about you.<br/><br/>The camera angles put your pretty much right in the movie and involve you. at some points you feel like the actors are speaking to you.<br/><br/>The plot of the movie is based on history and legend with a twist of carnival side show. you will understand when you see some of the army members in the movie.<br/><br/>The flow of the movie changes, it speeds up, slows down, and pauses. the best thing of the movie the MUSIC and SOUNDS. this movie WILL WIN the Oscar for sound hands down. it is an excellent piece of work.<br/><br/>I have been reading about how they showed the movie in Sparta, and some people were offended at the violence, and complaining that the movie shows the Spartans as blood-thirsty warriors, with no care for life. This is total BS, it is a movie our Marines would be proud of. Honor, glory, love, courage in the face of death. protecting your love ones from slavery, and oppression. <br/><br/>I know it may not be nominated for anything but the scientific subjects, light, sounds, costumes, art direction, etc..but it will be a masterpiece many would love to own, and will own in their ultimate DVD collection."

","I felt this movie had everything I could ask for in a film about Spartans.<br/><br/>-There was the brief telling of what makes a spartan warrior who he is and why he is such a fierce fighter. <br/><br/>-There was Plenty of action which as we all know is the sole reason we all went to see this film. <br/><br/>-It had the most impressive way of traveling I have ever seen from a ruler of his people, When I saw the Xerxes reveal my jaw dropped and all I could say was ""That's exactly how I would travel."" <br/><br/>-It had an Immense sense of style true to the graphic novel. <br/><br/>-It had great pacing allowing you to forget yourself, sit back and enjoy.<br/><br/>I just have to say this about the movie. Trusme me when I say you have not seen this film until you have seen it on an IMAX screen."

"ValianceInEnd","9","1","6","9 March 2007"," A very stylized, action-packed beauty of a film
","300 is an amazing little number that only Frank Miller can bring the world. From the dynamic lighting to the breath-taking (highly exaggerated) fight scenes, it's definitely worth your 9 dollars. <br/><br/>Each sequence has a dynamic lighting that sets the mood, giving it a very surreal feel. The blood and gore as stated before is very stylized, giving it the feel of a video game almost. When a Spartan stabs a Persian, the multiple blood particles splatter out in generous amounts, giving this movie an A+ in gore. <br/><br/>Yet the actors also play their characters 100%. Each has an interesting personality which holds strong all the way through. Seeing the Sparatans fighting with true ferocity sends tingles down your spine.<br/><br/>If there was one thing I could change about the film though would be to step up the soundtrack. During one of the fight scenes, the music has a hardcore metal edge to it making the fight sequence one of the most memorable in the film. If every sequence had blazing guitar and drum tempo, this movie would be hands down a 10/10. Unfortunately the score is to general for this genre, and the film does feel a bit repetitive in a few sequences that seem to go on to long. So this movie earns a solid 9/10. Good stuff, Miller. Can't wait until Sin City 2 is out."

They got a lot of the history correct if not the costuming (leather shorts! Sheesh!). I seem to remember that they fought in the nude which I suppose you couldn't put on film nowadays.<br/><br/>The acting was truly awesome because most of the cast was educated in Britain where they actually know how to train actors.

Although the movie was a bit over the top, that is how tradition was in that time. And in what way was this movie ""racist""?

","I saw 300 last night at the midnight showing, and I think what most impressed me was how great this movie looked. It was fun to see all of what the Persian Army had to offer, and even more interesting to see the really weird oddities it had within it. I felt like from a dramatic standpoint this movie did not quite get me to care about the characters so much that if something happened to them, it affected me. There were some speeches that characters would give sometimes that were just kind of dull, and did not add much to the movie. But people are not going to go to this movie for that stuff anyway. It's a visual feast, and a great movie to sit back and enjoy all that the screen has to offer."

","I never expected that three genres of film: the classical and historical early civilization war movies like Gladiator, Troy, Braveheart and Alexander; could be mixed with the fantasy epic like The Lord of the Rings trilogy and the blue screen/green screen comic book styled genre like Sin City, Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow and Dick Tracy would result to an highly entertaining film like 300. The movie is based on Frank Miller's ( creator of Sin City) graphic novel ""300"" which was inspired by another movie the 1962 classic ""The 300 Spartans"". It depicts the legendary tale of King Leonidas of Sparta and 300 of his men who gallantly fought against the mighty Persian Army climaxing in the Battle of Thermopylae thus changing the course of history. I myself, am not that familiar with ancient history war civilization, my knowledge of it comes from the Asterix series comic books, and movies like Gladiator, Alexander and Troy. Watching 300 not only made be entertained but also it aroused my curiosity in researching the history of Spartans. The comic book style of the film implies that the movie isn't to be taken seriously. Violence and carnage abounds but since the origin of 300 is from a graphic novel, it is not that gory. It actually blends well with the tone with the film. This is one war epic that you won't be caught sleeping to."

","Just saw this movie at a midnight screening last night on IMAX - Lincoln Center in NYC...oversold theater (people standing) - and it was absolutely stunning. The treatment of the film is artistically amazing. Zack Snyder has a good eye for framing a shot and making everything dramatic. His use of varying film speeds adds to the effect, especially during the awesome action sequences.<br/><br/>You have to see this movie on IMAX. The massive screen and sound is a feast for the senses.<br/><br/>And for those wondering, the movie deviates from the book a little bit: 1) The queen's role is fleshed out more (she's actually in the movie for more than the first 10 minutes - contrary to the book), 2) Theron's (the councilman) role is beefed up into a semi-major supporting role, 3) A couple of monster-enemy/mutants are added to the action scenes<br/><br/>Other than that, the movie brings to life all the powerful spreads that Frank Miller drew in his book. This movie was awesome! Definitely worth seeing more than once!"

","I want to keep this short and sweet.<br/><br/>I can only hope that any one who took part in this movie reads this site because for me personally this movie was simply everything I could have ever asked to see in a movie and then some. Ever since I saw The 300 Spartans movie when I was 14 in 2000, I have been anticipating a new movie about this battle. I was so fortunate to get my hands on an advanced screening pass and was blown away. The way that they were able to interpret different points of the movie was amazing. Even though they did not want to just make a movie based on actual historical events, it was not too far fetched. I thought the way the backgrounds, the fighting scenes and the acting was superb, especially with the introduction of the ""monsters"" that fit much better into the movie then I even imagined. My favorite movie of all time, that may seem a little quick to judge, but I feel it deserves it. Well done."

","""300"" had this oniric quality that make that one get the feeling he is dreaming. The outrageous sets, the slow-motion sequences, the music all converge to give this movie an atmosphere I never experienced before on a big screen.<br/><br/>Yeah, I'm all about history but here I really don't care the anachronisms, the aesthetics and historical deformations and the other liberties that were taken. I made my mind up well before I entered the cinema: This is going to be a fantasy movie. And it is.<br/><br/>Alas, some very contemporary elements marred my pleasure, and I felt extreme, if short, displeasure when I saw the Yankee elements on the ""war on terror"" clumsily patched-on here and there, loudly. It offends me furthermore because it rings false and contrived, furthermore when one knows about history a bit. I just couldn't hide myself off from the sentiment of pathetism I felt each time the Spartans howled Ahh-OOH just like these excellent US Marines do, or when whoever made a speech about ""freedom"". This is such a pity.<br/><br/>But that, as annoying as it gets, is not enough to make of ""300"" a bad movie - only one that is going to age faster. Both Butler and Headey's appearance seem to come right off an antique fresca, and I must underline the art that was put in their striking appearances, art that, sadly, did not extend to the rest of the cast.<br/><br/>In spite of the first-degree, time-stamped references to the Bush II dementia reign, there are no films that has done what ""300"" did - not even ""Sin City"", who reassembles it only by its faithful adaptation of a comic-book style on the screen and for that I give it a 7/10"

","300 by warner bros, which, according to all historical documents, is fraudulent and distorted, and its broadcast guarantees the violation of undeniable international legal rights. It is a proved scholarly fact that the Persian Empire in 480 B.C was the most magnificent and civilized empire. Established by the Cyrus the great, the writer of the first human right declaration, Persians ruled over significant portions of Greater Iran, the east modern Afghanistan and beyond into central Asia; in the north and west all of Asia Minor (modern Turkey), the upper Balkans peninsula (Thrace), and most of the Black Sea coastal regions; in the west and southwest the territories of modern Iraq, northern Saudi-Arabia, Jordan, Israel, Lebanon, Syria, all significant population centers of ancient Egypt and as far west as portions of Libya. Having twenty nations under control, encompassing approximately 7.5 million square kilometers, unquestionably the Achaemenid Empire was territorially the largest empire of classical antiquity. Based on the Zoroastrian doctrine, it was the strong emphasis on honesty and integrity that gave the ancient Persians credibility to rule the world, even in the eyes of the people belonging to the conquered nations (Herodotus, mid 5th century B.C). Truth for the sake of truth, was the universal motto and the very core of the Persian culture that was followed not only by the great kings, but even the ordinary Persians made it a point to adhere to this code of conduct. We did not expect Warner Bros. Picture company, as one of the world's largest producers of film and television entertainment to ignore the proved obvious historical facts, and damage its own reputation by showing the Persian army at the battle of Thermopylae as some monstrous savages, and thus create an atmosphere of public mistrust in its content, and hurt the national pride of the millions of Persians while doing so"
"kmillervir","10","1","7","10 March 2007"," THE coolest movie I have ever seen
","Take Sin City, and Lord Of The Rings, and mash them together, and you get 300. Some of the most entertaining and exhilarating battle scenes in all of film history. The special effects are awesome, the battle sequences are awesome, the story is awesome, awesome, awesome, awesome. I also heard that it follows the actual story line very closely, so for you history buffs, it has an appealing taste for you as well, besides the giant elephants and the kind of random goat person. The point is, this movie is fun for everyone, (except for the little kiddies) There are lots of decapitations, and body parts being hacked off. But it really reflects how battles were and the fierceness of these people. I read somewhere that during Napoleon's era, when he was sweeping across Europe, Sparta was still and underground city type thing, and Napolean was too scared to even go near them. And i think that, that feeling comes through in this movie, the actors and director do an incredible job of showing how powerful and united they were. There was also a lot of good filming. Lots of very close ups and interesting angles and perspectives. I would also recommend, if there is any i-max nearby, make the extra effort to go see it. I drove 3 and a half hours to watch it, and it was definitely well worth the drive. If your going to see the movie, see it right. So if you plan on goinbg to see any movies this year, this is the one to see, it is just action packed, pure awesomeness and down right COOL."
"polombob","6","1","7","9 March 2007"," Graphic Art - Yes. History - No.
","Out of a top rating of 300, I would give it about 180. Having never read the Frank Miller graphic novel this movie is based on, I cannot say how much this movie relates to that. How much does it reflect history? Not much. Oh, the classic historic lines are mentioned, and everybody has the correct names, but beyond that, don't talk about it over the water cooler and as if you want to show you know something about the true history of the battle. I just came from its first public showing and 3/4 of the way through I already felt disappointed. Not that I am a purist. I love Hollywood CGI eye candy as much as the next LOTR or Sin City lover. That part of this movie was quite outstanding, and it never ceases to amaze me where CGI will take us ultimately. It would just be nice if for once Hollywood could produce a movie that can be graphically artistic and beautiful, yet stick to a script that was already written by history. Don't throw away your copy of ""The 300 Spartans"" yet. Cheesy aspects of the movie and not spoilers if you know anything about the history of this battle: Leonidas from above at the end pierced with a bazillion arrows, looking sacrificed, crucified and Christ like; and the final scene of Delios (one of the original 300 who had to leave Thermopylae to deliver the famous ""Go tell the Spartans"" line, or something like it, to the rest of Greece) leading a charge and yelling ""For the 300!"" or something like that, even though it was 299 without Delios. Elephants, Rhinos????? Ephialtes and the Immortals as freaky mutants???? No mention of the Thespians either (the Greeks, not the actors), even though possibly more of them historically died than Spartans at the pass. And what the hell is with the 7 foot tall belly dancer Xerxes??? I have to admit that the little kid in me liked the big fat guy with the bologna slicer arms. Is this Oscar material? no. Is it historically correct? well, kinda. Is it great CGI? hell yes. If you want fantasy, you might rate this movie higher than I did and think it is the greatest movie ever made. As for me, I originally couldn't wait for this movie to open and began making plans prior to seeing it for seeing it again on the big screen. But now, I'll probably just wait for the used DVD in the budget bin, or get it for $2.99 on pay per view. See the movie for the art. It's worth the matin√É¬©e price.

","This movie did not cost a lot to make compared to other epic movies, yet it deserves its place among them. A grand epic adventure with loads of fighting and lots of blood. Yes, this film truly delivered the goods. Shot using blue screens and the like almost all the backgrounds and scenery is computer generated, this however does not detract from the film, but instead gives it a surreal quality. This movie is about how 300 spartan warriors stood against the massive Persian army and held their own. The story goes by quickly as this one is nearly pure fighting. The scenes without fighting are good as well as is the whole story, told back to us in narrative form. I was surprised how quickly though the Spartans set out for their battle. The battle itself was of epic proportion as you got to learn the advantages of troop formation and fighting as one and as comrades is a much better way to go about things than just charging and fighting more out of fear for one's life. You also get to see some of the best spear and shield fighting ever in a movie. The battle scenes are more graphic than those in the Lord of the Rings trilogy and emotional too, cause I was pulling for the Spartans all the way. Just something about their conviction you had to admire. All this and it was done on a rather minuscule budget, you also have to admire the director and producer as well. Though I just knew that one guy would be trouble for the troops."

And I enjoyed it! For character development I really have to say that if you read the comic AND watch the movie then it all fits nicely together. This is definitely a movie for the fans. Which is a good thing as too many good movie ideas are wasted on the types of movie goers who'd rather pay to see a movie just so they can hate it. If you couldn't feel an emotional tie to Leonitis at the climactic end then you definitely have no emotions. He loved his son very much and for him to never see him again because he died defending his freedom is extremely moving. As a father of two I feel a huge connection with Leonitis on a parental level. For a movie that was so bad it sure got a number of standing ovations DURING the movie. I was one of the many that stood up and applauded the amazing scenes. It was a truly amazing feeling during the many battles.

"Paul_Deane","2","1","8","26 March 2007"," Frank Miller Time
","Frank Miller is two for two in successfully adapting his graphic novels to the big screen. Although Sin City still sets the standard, 300 exceeded my personal expectations and undoubtedly works; it pumps adrenaline through spectacular visuals, a plot that gets the job done and breathtaking battle scenes. Based on visuals alone, 300 is and will be the best movie of the year (watch for the scene with the Oracle (Kelly Craig), which I found to be particularly stimulating.) Unfortunately, how good a films looks does not necessarily correlate to how good it actually is. 300 is not without its shortcomings, but I found myself trying hard to forgive the few missteps combined with middle-of-the-road acting and a lot of dumb-downed dialogue simply because I was constantly entertained by the beauty of the picture itself.<br/><br/>300 asks us to sympathize with a barbaric society, the Spartans, where babies born with deficiencies are ""discarded"". Children lucky enough to make it past inspection are raised with one objective: to become killing machines (oh, also something about honor, heart and pride). The result is a magnificently strong, bare-chested Spartan army that we have no problems routing for. When self proclaimed king-god Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro), a wigless drag-queen on a power trip, decides to extend the boarders of his land into Spartan territory, he leaves protagonist King Leonidas (Gerard Butler) with the option of surrendering and becoming a slave alongside his wife and child or fighting for their land and glory against a Persian army of 200,000+ men. Fundamentally, Spartans do not surrender and thus, the Battle of Thermopylae ensues. The battle is of epic proportions, as legendary as it is gory, though not as gruesome as Apocolypto (2006), and strays away from crafting a historical account, but rather successfully attempts to recreate the graphic novel.<br/><br/>The Persians attack in three waves, each sublimely entertaining. I found myself worried that the countless number of fatalities by spear would become tiresome, but director Zack Snyder finds fresh ways of illustrating what become routine deaths. 300 is a bloodbath, but at no point does it become exploitive or tasteless (barring the machete-armed jabba the hut creature). The dialogue, like the acting, is straightforward and simple but is by no means poor and the music effectively works to motivate and inspire. 300 come across as though its appeal is limited to testosterone-filled young men, and I cannot disagree. While this won't hurt it box office numbers, it will affect its longevity. For my money, Sin City is Frank Miller's film to beat, but 300 is definitely worth watching."
"boxoftastymisunderestima","5","1","8","16 March 2007"," The voice of the few against the many...
","I wouldn't do so by choice, but if I was asked to describe 300 in one word, that word would be an odd combination of CfOlOaLt"".<br/><br/>It's a cool action movie with very nice effects, wickedly exciting battle choreography, great visual shots, rockin' music, and an yet untired theme... But if you're expecting depth comparable (as promised by one review I happened to overhear) to The Matrix, don't waste your time or money! 300 is raw entertainment with an added faux finish of glory just for a dash of emotional stimulation. With the KNOWLEDGE it's idealized and dramatized, R-rated for gore, and based on a comic book, you all should realize that the category of ""war-fantasy comic book"" is no excuse for being a flat-charactered, pathetically formulaic story wrapped in crappy Photoshop filters.<br/><br/>Overlooking the fact that the story was flatter than the screen it was projected on, 300 has a lot going for it. The dialog was cute (if most of the time spoken irritatingly slowly). The design was really really cool (especially in some of the bad-guys). The women were all way hot and scantily clad (though come to think of it, so were the men). And in honor of the Greeks, at least it made logical sense.<br/><br/>If you want to see a lot of splendid visuals, with flashing swords, splattering blood, and good intentions, go ahead and waste the $10 (that not everyone has) and enjoy yourself for 2 hours."

","I do not care what anyone says. I waited over a year for this movie, and it was the first time that happened and it wasn't a disappointment (e.g. the two towers, the new world, zodiac...). I watch at least 10 movies a week (manager of video store) and teach film to college students (gotta have two jobs to be a college instructor) and this film blew me away. I liked the video game aspect, the slow motion action, it was different and done very well. I loved the gray coloring and the way red, gold and white stood out so well. I loved the plot, even though i know it is not historically accurate (which it was not supposed to be). I love everything about this movie. The acting was superb and i haven't seen a film this good in a very long time. Thank you Frank Miller, Zack Snyder and most of all Gerry Butler, for an amazing film experience.

","I'm a huge fan of anything Ancient Greece, so when I saw the preview for this during SAW 3 months ago, myself and every friend that was there agreed that we would see this movie as soon as it came out, so needless to say my expectations were high and only grew as the released date neared. When we arrived and met other groups of friends, I was worried that with multiple rows of us rowdy guys, not to mention the rest of a packed theater, it would be very loud and very hard to understand and concentrate for certain parts of the movie. But as soon as the movie started it became quite clear that everyone else was as captivated as I had dreamed of being for months. The only time I even remembered that I was in a packed theater and not in the middle of Ancient Greece was when the well placed witty remarks were made. Very rarely do movies live up to my high expectations, but this particular movie blew me away."

"philio_01","7","1","9","25 March 2007"," Greatly over-rated, but still enjoyable.
","I saw 300 this evening and, I must say, I was bitterly disappointed. Don't get me wrong, it was well worth watching it on the big screen, particularly for the sublime special effects, and overall cinematography; however I thought it concentrated too much on the visual aspects, and less on a balance between aesthetic and discourse interaction.<br/><br/>From looking at the trailer you expect an epic film, however in my opinion it wasn't epic at all. Lord of the rings, Gladiator and Troy are epic films, however it seemed as though 300 ""borrowed"" certain ideologies from each of those films, producing a movie lacking originality.<br/><br/>The fight scenes were good, and the CGI was breath-taking, but there was a lack of great dialogue, as well as a lack of believability in the storyline. Personally the trailer for the film looks brilliant and gives the viewer the feeling that this could be one of the greatest films made in a long while. HOWEVER this is not so.<br/><br/>I'm quite surprised that it is in the IMDb top 250 films of all times. (Well, near the bottom end of the list). If you read the 'message board' comments under the FAQ's of other members you will see that most of them share the same views as me.<br/><br/>Overall 300 is still worth watching, as the acting is great, and there are some good quotes; however I feel as though it could have been so much better than what it was. It is nothing compared to other films in its genre. I give it 7 out of ten."

Gerard Butler reminds me of a young Sean Connery and after seeing him in this film you can bet his career is going to skyrocket. I also liked the narration from David Wenham who played Faramir in The Lord of the Rings Trilogy.

"frankwhat","10","1","9","10 March 2007"," ""300"" √Ç‚Äì An Epic of Even More Epic Proportions
","I really liked this one a lot. It wasn't the best film I've ever seen or even the best epic that has been made, but it was quite exquisite. I was actually blown away by the time the end credits started rolling and something happened twice that I absolutely love√Ç‚Ä¶a round of applause. Not only after the movie was finished did people clap but also at a powerfully unexpected event about three-quarters of the way through. These were very pleasing moments as I haven't witnessed a show of acclaim such as that since ""The Lord of the Rings √Ç‚Äì Return of the King"". The theater I viewed this in on opening night sold out quickly and since there were a good deal of younger people in the audience I was worried about having to deal with every distraction known to man. This wasn't the case though as ""300"" was so powerful that it had the ability to silence everyone and keep them that way until it was over.<br/><br/>The new film-making techniques were a very fresh look into what can be done now with today's technology and the way the script was written put a different twist on a historically true story. In a way I'm glad it wasn't completely accurate as it stated right from the beginning that it wasn't and it also made the plot more interesting. Frank Miller is such a highly creative individual and I think it's great how he uses such ugly fantasy creatures to really capture the aura of evil people. The use of slow motion was simply riveting and nothing like that has ever been done before for such a long duration.<br/><br/>As a fan of machismo cinema the battle sequences were my favorite part. It did take a little bit of getting used to with how they were done but they really ended up growing on me. In fact I was caught off guard by how much sheer hardcore violence is shown√Ç‚Ä¶ ranging from decapitations to every type of goring imaginable. However I didn't find it in bad taste because it goes hand in hand with the type of story it represents, I'm sure not everyone will feel this way though. Another great aspect was the comic relief. Some of the characters had such funny expressions and quotes in inappropriate moments, which really drew a surprising jolt of laughter from the audience at unexpected times. The score is also a huge strength as it blasts during pivotal scenes to really get the blood pumping.<br/><br/>The acting was great and I couldn't think of anyone else except Gerard Butler playing the title character, as he was so fitting that it was hard to imagine him as an actual regular guy in real life. Despite Gerard being in only a handful of roles before this I have always thought he was an encapsulating performer but he certainly took the cake here. David Wenham also did a remarkable job as both a warrior and a storyteller. The ironic part for me was the only one I wasn't too crazy about was Dominic West, who is usually one of my favorite character actors turned leading men. I will admit though that this might be since I'm not used to seeing him in a villainous role and he played pure weak sleaze here. Nevertheless a very robust cast was utilized that shows every emotion off imaginable to a remarkable effect, at least once.<br/><br/>""300"" is what going to the movies is all about and what has been lost as of late. This is what a trip to the cinema should be and it blew a breath of fresh air into an industry that needed revitalization more than it knew. Whether this alone will be capable of pulling off a new era of quality√Ç‚Ä¶probably not, but hopefully if it succeeds√Ç‚Ä¶which, I can't see how it won't, it will encourage more invigorating filmmakers to follow in director Zack Snyder's footsteps. There wasn't any aspect that was neglected and it was the excellent combination of sound, music, colors, contrasted cinematography, story line, and wonderful performances that blew my mind. The morals also were near to my heart as it taught how beneficial it is to work together as a team and why one should always do what they feel is right no matter how slim their chances of success are. Overall the best blend of movie-making meshed together in probably at least the last couple of years. If you don't take my word for it that this is a worthwhile view, well then do it, ""for Sparta!!!!"""
"TOMNEL","9","1","9","9 March 2007"," Very well done film, excellent action, good dialogue.
","When I heard a movie was coming out about the Battle of Thermopylae, I figured it would try to be about as historically accurate as possible. This was accurate in some ways, but also delightfully exaggerated making the whole movie feel like a live action cartoon. The movie follows King Leonidas and his army of 300 fighting and defeating the massive armies. Where slow motion action can often be boring, the many scenes of slow motion action is this were extremely interesting as we got to see exactly how this army of 300 was prevailing. The film really didn't have any shortcomings, except sometime it got a little too strange for it's own good, but coming from Frank Miller you have to expect this. Another small thing that this movie had was amusing dialogue, which is odd, in a good way, for a serious war film. My eyes were glued to the screen from the moment it started, to the great ending. I highly recommend it!<br/><br/>My rating: *** 1/2 out of ****. 112 mins. Rated R for strong violence, sexuality and nudity."

","300 300 - A film adaptation of Frank Miller's graphic novel, which was based on a movie ""The 300 Spartans"" that was based on the Battle of Thermopylae in 480 B.C.<br/><br/>Or to put it more simply, a bunch of guys with swords and spears go up against the big bad Persians. You either like this sort of thing or you don't. I do. My friends didn't, but they're a hard bunch to please (and lord, oh lord I know I'll get comments from them on this).<br/><br/>Gerard Butler stars and almost makes up for his turn as the Phantom in that Schumacher movie. He reminded me a little of Sean Connery, not just because of the same Scotsman accent (was there a genuine Greek in the cast?) , but also because of the same dry quip delivery, but with plenty of malice to go along. Lena Headey (funny last name) is the only important member of the cast without a Y chromosome. She's a good actress, but the lengthening of her part means a small sub-story that doesn't quite work, but does break up the fights a bit. And it wouldn't be an epic battle movie without a cast member from Lord of the Rings there (Orlando Bloom isn't to be found, strangely). David Wenhem, who played Faramir, is here as narrator and soldier, and sound support.<br/><br/>My only major complaint is the guy they got to play Xerxes. I tried to wrap my head around him, but it just DID NOT WORK. Yes, he's the big bad guy. That doesn't mean the big bad guy has to sound like Darth Vader with the bass amped up. It's just doesn't work when linked up with the black guy (who's not black in real life, funny enough) who's covered in jewelry and too much eye make-up. yeesh. it was meant to be other-worldly, it just came off as bad.<br/><br/>Plenty of naked women, though strangely for Gracean times they're all 0-sized models. Plenty of sweet sweet fight scenes, and really, that's what we're there for, right? And damn, are these fights gory, but I never felt it was gratuitous. There are those oh so great one-liners that Frank Milelr is well-known for. There are some monsters, to which my friends commented that it felt like Lord of the Rings over again. I will admit that yes, 300 is not the freshest kid on the block, but it is very pretty, very bloody, and very very fun.<br/><br/>A solidly fun swords and shields movie, 300 gets a B+"

","From Frank Miller (Sin City), this is another perfect adaptation of one of his celebrated graphic novels, from Zack Snyder, director of the Dawn of the Dead remake. Recreating the Battle of Thermopylae in 480 BC, it is the simple story of King Leonidas (Gerard Butler) rallying 300 of his finest red-caped warriors from Sparta, all taught from childhood to have no fear and fight against the forces of the massive Persian army. The enemy includes men, immortals and creatures, all belonging to giant King Xerxes (Love Actually's Rodrigo Santoro). Dilios (The Lord of the Rings' David Wenham) is the one warrior who delivers the news to awaiting Queen Gorgo (Lena Headey), even the (for me) unexpected ending. Also starring Dominic West as Theron, Vincent Regan as Captain, Michael Fassbender as Stelios and Tom Wisdom as Astinos. The special effects are marvellous (especially the hunchback character), the sets, light and colour are lavish, and the use of bloody violence (including many be-headings) is fantastic, it could have been an 18 if you saw some guts and the blood spill on the floor. Very good!"

","300 is a visceral ,wonderfully over the top and stylish slice of comic book action.<br/><br/>What i found surprising about zack snyders film is how simple it is. While many ancient Greek epics are big sprawling historical soap operas, 300 is a straight forward showcase of the spartans doing what they do best : war. And its an entertaining showcase. The stylishly edited battles are frequent and exciting spectacles that just get more crazy and extravagant as the film noisily marches onwards.<br/><br/>Visually, 300 a sight to behold. With the aid of its CG imagery , we are consistently bombarded with memorable, powerful and shocking images : Spartan kids beating the crap out of each other, deformed wenches having orgies and persian soldiers falling from a cliff top are just a few of the crazy sights on display.Its like a comic book come to life - which is clearly what the films makers intended it to be. <br/><br/>Because of the plunder-happy nature of the characters , you may have a problem finding anyone to root for, but having a character to relate and latch on to isn't what this is about .300 is about larger than life ,musclebound warriors engaging in visually stunning ,massively entertaining battles and it on this level that 300 most definitely delivers !"

","Snyder's 300 is a bucket of filth that somehow manages to get praised by brainless Americans and by some bought and paid for professional film critics. Sure, 300 isn't the only bucket of filth that has been made in Hollywood in the last two decades. There have been many such buckets of filth. But I think that 300 is the film that is most representative of all of this filth. 300 is much louder, much more distasteful, and much more historically inaccurate than The 300 Spartans (1962), which is actually a fine film that's worth seeing. In addition, I noticed that it promotes militarism and oligarchical rule. Sparta, the Greek city-state whose citizens and customs are portrayed as being worthy of imitation in the film, had oligarchical and militaristic rule. But Classical Athens, the Greek city-state whose citizens are portrayed as weak and ineffective in the film, had democratic rule. In fact, Athens is the birthplace of democracy and the model of democracy. It also became the most prosperous Greek city-state after the Greco-Persian Wars. Now, if you want to know what a real democracy should be like, you should read some history books about Classical Athens or at least look at the Wikipedia page about Fifth-century Athens. It's quite different from the so-called democracy that exists in the USA. In addition, I recommend reading Carroll Quigley's books 'The Evolution of Civilizations: An Introduction to Historical Analysis' (1961) and 'Weapons Systems and Political Stability: A History' (1983), which provide even more useful information and conclusions about Ancient Greece. I think that this is important because most people these days don't know what democracy is supposed to be like, partly because of the fact that they get a bad education in school. This is why some middle class people fall for oligarchical swindles like libertarianism and why other middle class people think that democracy is a failure and thus become irrational pro-fascists. The overwhelming majority of Americans, for example, don't care about democracy. They don't even know what it is. What they do care about is the empire that the USA possesses. Therefore, when you criticize the American political system, they respond in a calm and apathetic manner. But, when you criticize the American empire and overseas operations, they respond in a heated and confrontational manner (even in a psychotic manner). The same goes for class structure in the USA. This is the case because they've been taught to think like this by the American ruling class. They've been taught to think that they have a right to trample on others and to stick their noses in every crack. But, when it comes to democracy and their economic rights under capitalism, they take a conservative and unconcerned position. This isn't true for all Americans, but it's undoubtedly true for most Americans."

"HaNzz99","8","0","3","25 September 2017"," What it lacks in depth, it compensates with creativity in spades
","300 is a unique film. When it first came out, it was met with a very polarizing reception. Some claimed it was a masterpiece, others claim it was an overrated pile of trash. This would latter prove to become a tentpole in Snyder's filmography. The visuals were hailed as majestic, the dialogue catchy and quotable, the action and violence exhilarating, relentless, and spectacular, Gerard Butler as King Leonidas one of the next big icons in cinema history. Others, on the other hand, found it to be exhausting visual noise with little to no depth or purpose to any of its stylistic action montages. <br/><br/>In my honest opinion, I think both sides are right. If you love the movie, I can totally see why. If you hated it, I can also see why. I guess your level of enjoyment with this film will depend mostly on two factors: your personal taste in movies, and your expectations when approaching this one. <br/><br/>Let's get out of the way the obvious points. The acting from everyone involved is great, with Butler being the obvious standout. Everyone looks believable as Spartan soldiers and truly help sell the epicness of the action (which is expertly choreographed, I should say). Rodrigo Santoro as Xerxes is both entrancing and downright evil, which is totally appropriate and fits the nature of this godlike character. Some of the best moments in the film are when both Leonidas and Xerxes are having an interchange, maybe because they are both truly mesmerizing actors, and moments like these allow their characters' personalities to shine for once. <br/><br/>Visually, this film is glorious, and it still holds up a decade after the film's initial release. Backgrounds, armies, cinematography, the color palette, the settings, the creatures, make up effects, and the carnage (oh god, the carnage) are all exquisitely made. The movie's visual aesthetic is worth the price of admission alone. It helps the film stand out as one of the most entertainingly brutal and creative war movies of recent times. The super-imposition chroma key filming technique is also admirable, as it allows Frank Miller's panels to come to life on the big screen. <br/><br/>However, and now we turn to the negative side of the film, when it comes to the story itself.. there's very little substance to match up with the insanity that is the stylistic nature of this movie. Basically the plot revolves around Leonidas gathering a group of 300 warriors to stop the Persians and prevent Sparta to fall under Xerxes' tyranny. That's it. There's no real plot twist nor inventiveness to it. Its just people fighting after people fighting after people fighting. <br/><br/>Now, one can defend this by saying the film is not interested in an innovative or a thought provoking story, but instead uses a relatively simple story as connective tissue for the action sequences, which are the real standouts. It was that way in the graphic novel, though in a way, the film's very loyal to its source material. I understand this, and if it wasn't obvious already (I gave the film an 8/10 after all) this bothers me little to nothing. That being said, when judging the film objectively, its lacking in the narrative department is something that needs to be addressed, and depending on whether you care for a well thought out story to accompany your action, as good as it may be, this will come through as a significant flaw for you, and a deal breaker before deciding if seeing the film or not. <br/><br/>300 is, once again, a unique film, and its definitely not for everybody. It is one perfect example of a film that's style over substance, and that may irritate the most demanding viewers. This is no Gladiator, no Braveheart, no troy nor LOTR. However, what it lacks in narrative depth more than compensates with amazing to behold action sequences, and a mesmerizing work in the visual department. Its story is more than enough to move the film forward, and the result is an engaging, entertaining, brutal, surreal and bloody war film that never gets boring, and eventually wins you over with the way everything comes together. In spite of its divisive nature, I do suggest that film buffs check this film at least once. Who knows, maybe at its worst it can come off as a guilty pleasure. As for myself, I do stand with my take on it as one of the most purely entertaining action films I've ever witnessed."

How a king comes into existence by killing huge beast. How a Queen governs her duties. How they handle the messenger. How the captain loses his son. How captain fights a after that? How they find out traitor. How the king and all associated soldiers lay down their life and invite other Spartans. Oracles and Ephors together was something I disliked. Oracles were beautiful.

Today, it is a prime example of a fun popcorn flick that has its own agendas but does not really need to rub it in so that the viewers can feast in what they truly wanted to see. A fun action film with equal parts raunchiness, adrenaline pumping action, over- dramatic camp and over-glorified sense of machismo, all of which encapsulated in Snyder's definite flashy style.

","A lot of noise has been made concerning the historical inaccuracies in Zack Snyder's adaptation of the graphic novel 300. But that's totally beside the point. This is not a WW2 documentary, everyone who fought at Thermopylae has been dead for 2,496 years. Both earlier historical war films Braveheart and Gladiator were crtiticised for their historical inaccuracies.<br/><br/>But while witnesses were present during the battles of those films, Herodotus never saw Thermopylae. He wrote about it years after the fact from unreliable sources, and then some Hollywood jackass wrote the movie script for ""The 300 Spartans"" in the '60s. <br/><br/>Comic book writer (And outspoken Islamaphobe) Frank Miller wrote and illustrated the graphic novel the film is based on after having seen ""300 Spartans"". Miller has been notoriously rabid in recent years for his anti Islamist views, which he pumped into his book, despite the fact that the Persians in 480BC lived almost 1000 years before Muhammad.<br/><br/>Then Snyder made a film based on the most convoluted game of history's Chinese whispers ever played. Not to mention that the narrator of the film (David Wenham) is a biased Spartan commander, whipping up his war hungry fellow warriors into a battle frenzy with exaggerated tales of Persian monsters. In defense of the film's portrayal of Xerxes, no contemporary portraits of the king were made, so no one really knows what he looked like. For all we know, he may have looked like an 8 foot tall Rodrigo Santoro, wearing more gold than Mr T.<br/><br/>The film is actually comparitively close to the events recorded, unlike the more recent (and rubbish) 300: Rise of an Empire, which is more He Man than Herodotus. I have a few complaints though. The portrayal of Ephialtes as a hunchback is cartoonish. The ephor's line to Leonidas "" This is August, Leonidas..."" is laughably anachronistic, considering that Roman Emporer Augustus (After which the month was named) wasn't even born for roughly 350 years. But I admit it's a nitpick.<br/><br/>The 300 Spartans in the film die just like Herodotus said. The details may have been changed, but the important beats are surprisingly close to Herodotus. And Gerald Butler kicks ass, even if he sounds more Scottish than Spartan. In short, it's a movie, if you want a serious documentary, watch Discovery Channel."

Also: -Jason Statham as Dienekes - Christian Bale as Maronn - Henry Cavill as Alpheus - Tom Hardy as Pantites - Daniel Day-Lewis as Eurytus - Daniel Craig as Aristodemus - First film about Ionian Revolt and Marathon - Second film about Thermopylae and Artemesium Straight - Third film about Salamis and Plataea <br/><br/>BOOM!"

","Based on the graphic novel by Frank Millar, 300 follows King Leonidas (played by Gerard Butler), who leads an army of 300 Greek soldiers to fight in war against the Persian army, thousand times their size. The film, as well as the novel, takes place during the Battle of Arthemis and Battle of Salamis which took place in 480 B.C. Zack Snyder, who would later go on to direct superhero flicks such as Watchmen (2009) and Man of Steel (2013) bring the artistic style from the graphic novel and brings it to life with amazing visual effects and a compelling story.<br/><br/>Let's start by saying Gerald Butler delivers an incredible performance as Leonidas and really brings the life and energy to the character. I would say it's an Oscar worthy performance by him. The story is also pretty compelling as it follows the main character as he leads an army of hundreds of soldiers against an army they are overwhelmingly outnumbered by, and the story carries on quite well. What really stands out however, is the amazing battle sequences. From the second the soldiers wield their sword and shield, we are treated with flashy comic book-styled sword-on-sword action with some slow motion shots of soldiers getting slashed, stabbed, and dismembered with CGI blood spray. The first battle between the Greek and the Persian soldiers can easy be considered as one of the greatest battles ever put together in a movie. The battle against the giant ogre is also pretty stunning as well.<br/><br/>300 maybe the best film by Director Zack Snyder and the best role by Gerard Butler. This action epic sets a prime example of how to adapt a graphic novel by Frank Millar into a entertaining thrill ride."
"Rickting","7","0","1","13 July 2015"," Brainless comic book movie fun
","300 follows King Leonidas as he leads 300 Spartan warriors in a battle against the Persians. As macho, loud and violent as the Spartan warriors at the centre of its story, 300 doesn't win points for subtlety or storytelling but succeeds as an entertaining spectacle that knows what it is and successfully washes out the traumatic memories of Meet the Spartans. 300, thanks to it being filmed on a digital back lot, inevitably feels artificial and video game like a lot of the time. Characterization is not the film's priority, although you do care about many of the characters and the characters seem to care about each other, so that underneath it all there seems to be human souls within the characters, which was a pleasant surprise. The ""This Is Sparta!"" scene is rightfully legendary and various other good movie quotes are heard during the film. The ending works well although the beginning feels somewhat slow. The story isn't that interesting since it's very one note and only goes the way it does thanks to a pretty stupid decision.<br/><br/>This is very much a blockbuster whose sole purpose is to entertain and give a good time. That it does, although it was likely better on the big screen. Visually it is undeniably a spectacle to behold and some of the fight sequences are brilliantly done. The film makes better use of slow motion than many films do and there are many memorable moments throughout the film. It doesn't follow a predictable plot and in general, it's a good time but not a lot more than that. I have no problems with movies just being a good time, although it should be noted that this is likely going to be pretty dull for many who aren't in its target audience. It has its dull moments and lacks the human touch that Sin City, which is similar to this, did although it boasts a good performance from Gerard Butler in the lead role. A good fantasy action film overall and worthy of its cult following. It's a good amount of fun although it never amounts to a lot more than that. Still, at least's it's memorable unlike many other films of its type.<br/><br/>7/10"

Also, I was not a fan at how the Persians were portrayed as sub-human and again I feel that taking a more serious and realistic approach could have made a stronger film.<br/><br/>Where the film did excel though was with some of the characters. Like with anything he is in, Gerard Butler is wonderful as King Leonidas and really captures the guts and glory persona but also gave a sense that he was simply going on instinct and did not always know what he was doing.

","Ahhh popcorn films. Sometimes we just like pure fun and entertainment. Who doesn't? But what's even better than just an ordinary popcorn film is a popcorn film with spectacular visuals that will go down in cinematic history. Zack Snyder creates the film '300.' A fantasized ""history"" film about 300 Spartans who battled the evil Persians out of Greece. Gerard Butler is King Leonidas, the brave and kick-ass warrior who leads the Spartans into battle. Gerard Butler is awesome in this film with his extreme physiology and intense battle scenes that he leads throwing his spear at Persians and stabbing them with his sharp blade. The violence is stylized in a special way in which the blood is unique looking and doesn't look real at all. The cinematography is spectacular, causing '300' to show epic battle sequences like no other film. It's just impossible to take your eyes off of. Many epic battle sequences and elaborate production design allow you to view the picture with some historical relevance, but not too much that it begins similar to text out of a World Civilization text book. Zack Snyder is a pleaser, and leaves you with pure visual miracles and fun classic dialog. Whether it be Gerard Butler getting angry at a Persian for insulting Sparta and yelling 'THIS IS SPARTA' before kicking him down a wall, or warning his fellow men about the dangers that awaken them by crying out 'Spartans, tonight we dine in hell!' It's just awesome. Popcorn films have been an important part of cinema since the beginning of this majestic art-form, and they are especially relevant when they contain strong elements such as awesomeness and magnificent visual miracles."

","(just saw 'Rise of an Empire' so I'm going back and reviewing this) This movie is how the world really became aware of the massive talent that is, Zack Snyder. Without this film we would not have the great Man of Steel, or even Watchmen the way it is. Snyder became known for his slow motion comic-booky feel of directing. I know many people who are in love with comic books who believe Zack Snyder is perfect for directing them because of the amount of detail each scene looks like its source material.<br/><br/>300 is great because it actually gave a back story to its lead male, instead of focusing on the villains. We got a fresh new take of Leonidas, who is of course known as one of the bravest and also most daring warriors in history. Its the underdog tale of those 300 men who for some reason thought they could win against more than 300,000 Persian soldiers, lead by the god Xerxes.<br/><br/>The battle scenes will go down in history as really starting the trend of ancient battle sequences being shot in slow motion and with as much blood as one camera can cover. There are some all time memorable quotes by Leonidas in some all time memorable speeches. So much so that professional athletes have referenced it when preparing for games. Its a really enjoyable movie from the ground up, and you have to realize how much this movie influenced its genre. The visual effects and photography are standouts, and so are the lead performances, even Lena Headey (lead female) has memorable scenes. As stupid as it was for them to battle the Persians, you do start to feel for them, in how depressing it is that no one came and helped. They did spark the beginning of the end of Persians reign. Good watch. 7.8/10"

","This is an exciting visceral film and is definitely a guy film. The film refers to the ancient battle of 300 Spartans taking on the armies of at least 10,000 Persians and this film portrays just how epic this clash really was. All the performances are good and when the battle happens you feel emotionally attached to these characters as they go on their quest. The main attraction is watching the action between these tough Spartan against the outmatched Persian's and how gory, thematic and over the top all the killing is in this film. The secondary plot also is intriguing and provides a little break in the film from the huge amounts of action and violence in it. The ending to the film is incredible and really fits the tone of the film providing a great climax.

First of all, Persians ruled that country and empire for like 150 years back then and secondly, The Immortals were just people who were like Spartans in a way. They were trained to protect the King and their training began from the time that they were kids. But faceless monsters is a bad description. Yes I agree Xerxes killed his own men and he was a drunken King so filled with wrath and anger and that's what made him the very first king who spoiled the empire with his dream of conquering Europe. But showing him this way, first of all, all Persian king kept and did not shave their hairs and beards EVER. It was a tradition. And secondly, saying that he said he was the GOD is wrong, too. He said he was so many things like ""King of the World"" or he said that his destiny was to take over the world but he never said he was God and such pictures and lies were never in a documentary movie or any kinds of movies except for Frank Miller's comics books.

He, Kurt Johnstad Michael Gordon carry the famous graphic novel of Frank Miller in the greatest perfection, and how Snyder directs is impressive. Such as the comic, 300 mixes a bit of history, action, sex and excellent characters. Transporting it from comic to screen could only have been the author himself, but that's where Snyder proves that even knows how to write screenplays (with help, of course) and it was with this film that Snyder was so recognized. The story itself I found very good, portrays the war of Thermopylae in a way so hardcore-badass. I can say that everything in the movie is BADASS, the screenplay is fantastic and gave us one of the most striking phrases of all time, ""THIS IS SPARTA!"". Speaking of which, the Spartans in the film are all badasses, the mens, the womens, even the kids. The scenes and scenery are fantastic, everything takes place behind a green screen, but are so AWESOME. The soundtrack is Badass, fits in every scene, some are dramatic way, but others are for action. The cast, also is badass, Gerard Butler give a great (and badass) performance as King Leonidas; Michael Fassbender is also a total hardcore badass; Rodrigo Santoro also gives a great performance as King Xerxes, pity that was not his real voice we hear in the film.

","A great example on how well you can tell a story without much dialogue.<br/><br/>A old saying is that a picture says more than a 1000 words, that is a saying, I very much find to be the truth.<br/><br/>The movie in a sense reminds m of another movie called ""The Fountain"". Both movies there is very little dialogue, it is all about that word again, picture. Pictures of men, pictures of battles, pictures of passion. Passion in men, and feelings scenery and music can stir up deep inside of us.<br/><br/>That is what this movie does, tells a simple, yet beautiful story, through very little dialogue, but through beautiful emotions shown in the actors and actresses. That tells us much more than words could ever do. The cinematography is simply beautiful and brilliant. Some would say this movie has too much slow motion, but like I already said the movie is more telling its story visually than any other way, and this is one of the very few times it really works.<br/><br/>To sum it up, beautiful emotional performances by Gerard Butler (his best showing I've seen) and fellow costars Lena Headey and David Wenham.<br/><br/>If you are one who can with simple, yet powerful storytelling receive enjoyment and excitement, this movie is for you. If you can only find excitement in character progression and dialogue heavy stories, this is not for you. For me it is a 9/10. Very close to 10.

"StevePulaski","5","0","1","22 October 2012"," A carnage epic and that is all
","300's biggest strength is not its performances, nor its special effects, but its capable, crisp direction from Zack Snyder. Snyder's previous directing credits on the Dawn of the Dead remake couldn't have set him up for the large-scale directing performed on this kind of film, so perhaps his directing ways have inherently adapted to large, spacious locations.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, with all the disposable action at hand, exhaustive yelling, and minimal depth, which can all be more noticeable to moviegoers than scenery and locations, Synder's talent may go unnoticed. I've been told that Frank Miller's original graphic novel is transferred smoothly to the film, in which case fans will most likely enjoy the film based on its loyalty to its source material. All I can say is I have no desire to read the series. 300is sort of similar to that loud, belligerent, and sloppy houseguest, yet due to his lack of self-awareness is oblivious to these facts and continues doing them, much to the dismay of his friends and colleagues.<br/><br/>The plot concerns the infamous Battle of Thermopylae, which pitted Spartan king Leonidas (Gerard Butler) and his three hundred ill-equipped soldiers against King Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro) and his massive Persian army. We see Leonidas in training as a fearless Spartan as a young child, and after kicking a Persian messenger down a deep, endless well, begins an almighty war between the two sides.<br/><br/>It's such a shame that writers Kurt Johnstad, Michael B. Gordon, and Snyder, respectively, dab more into battles and brutality on a grandiose-scale than the characters involved with such events. We spend so little time on Leonidas's motivations and development from a characterization perspective that he is nothing more than a faux-hero in this film; the one we side with because we're supposed to. The Xerxes character is the same way. His motivations and villainous behavior is depressingly shortchanged for excessively brutal, uninteresting carnage.<br/><br/>300, in some cases, plays like the instant replay shots from an ancient epic, with slow motions shots of spears piercing skulls, digitized blood squirting off the characters, and swords crossing in the heat of the moment. Speaking of the heavy digitization in the film, what adds to the artificial aspect of the film is the graphic use of computer animation. Some sequences are sweeping shots of hundreds of armed men (""armed"" meaning in low trousers, swords, and a shield for good measure) charging to another side of several more armed men. The effects instantaneously flashed me back to watching Wolfgang Petersen's Troy, and how, again, motivations and character complexity was traded for battles with hundreds of digitized warriors.<br/><br/>Another film this reminded me of was Ridley Scott's Best Picture winner Gladiator, a film I was decidedly mixed on when I originally reviewed it and have grown to dislike more it over time. It had murky, muddy atmosphere and large landscapes of brown as far as the eye can see. Not to mention, we're already watching choppy, repetitive action sequences equivalent to a lengthy, drawn-out video game cut scene so perhaps the atmosphere is fitting.<br/><br/>300 is a ""carnage epic,"" an epic where bloody, slow motion fight scenes are more valuable than interesting characters and identifiable motivations. It's a cold, robotic film, with no thought in its empty head and no soul in its shockingly toned body. Every part of the characters' deep and inner-psyche is as artificial as the CGI on their bodies.<br/><br/>Starring: Gerard Butler, Lena Headey, David Wenham, Dominic West, Vincent Regan, Rodrigo Santoro, and Michael Fassbender. Directed by: Zack Snyder."

","300 was one of my most anticipated movies of the year. If you've talked to me, you're not going to get anything new here as far as my likes and dislikes go.<br/><br/>Me likey: The stylized fighting. Green and blue screen work were so well done. It looked just like the comic book and that was something rare to find. Other than Resident Evil: Apocalypse (it's okay to lump comic books and video games together as a genre, right?), I don't think a movie has done justice to its source this well. While incredibly violent, the blood and gore was for the most part 2D - an interesting concept that deserves some kudos (M&M variety, of course). Recap: good fighting.<br/><br/>Me no likey: The acting, the plot. I know this was a lowish budget movie, but getting some good actors, or at least a narrator who doesn't sound like he gargles hot metal shavings for breakfast. The plot was true to the comic, but other comic movies have taken liberties with the story it make it a bit more palatable for movie audiences. The real story is well known by many people, and I'm sure I'm not the only one who showed up and though ""well, gee, this fake story would be made so much better by throwing in some historic truths instead of a bunch of weird monsters."" Also true to the comic style, every line was EPIC. That gets annoying fast. Last, sound design. I'm not even going to go there.<br/><br/>All in all, it was a very manly movie, what with all the men in leather thongs and covered in sweat. I give it a straight B+ and a gay A-."

","Short: This is opera. If you couldn't sit through an actual opera, you probably won't make it through this film. If you can accept the highly stylized and exaggerated aspects of that form, then you might. It is violent. It is simplistic. It is visually gorgeous. It is emotionally riveting. It is not for children. It will offend many and inspire many. It is opera. <br/><br/>Not so short: There are myriad specific reasons to take offense from this film, but most can fit into three categories. <br/><br/>{Political} If you tend to project your personal, contemporary politics into works of art and fiction, then you may be offended. The heroes are Anglo and the villains are Persian, and less explicitly, non-heterosexual. More specifically, since this came from Hollywood, many will characterize this as allegory for and propaganda in support of the US involvement in the middle east and Persia. If you're a serious pacifist, don't bother. <br/><br/>{Artistic / Esthetic} Though highly stylized, it is graphically violent, and it glorifies that violence. The plot is simple to non-existent. The dialog too is simple and predictable. The characters have zero guile, zero subtlety, 100% melodrama, bordering on the trite. Again, expect opera, for that's what it is. It does not have the typical happy Hollywood ending. If you're not inspired, you will be left depressed.<br/><br/>{Historical} While loosely based on historical events, the emphasis must be firmly placed on the word 'loosely.' If you are bothered by the taking of artistic license with historical facts, you will be disappointed. <br/><br/>On the other hand, there are a few reasons to like this film. <br/><br/>{Artistic / Esthetic} If your primary interest is beautiful cinematography, then you need to see it. The visuals are stunning and the entire package constitutes a new, unique aesthetic; unique as, say, The Matrix was. If you are just a fan of action / war / battle cinema, the combat is intense and riveting, and there's ton's of it. <br/><br/>{Philosophical / Moral} No matter your nationality or background, if you like the idea of any of these, you may like it. Free / independent men fighting against tyranny. A just and civil society. Individual moral duty/obligation takes precedence over politics of the state. Self sacrifice for a greater good. Respect among fellows. Protecting your family and community. Self discipline in the face of fear and adversity. The nobility of military service. Tradition. Honor. Glory."

It feels like a big budget flick that was shot entirely on a sound stage, and while some of the effects tend to be overwhelming, we just happen to live in an age where it takes much more than an abundance of computer imagery to truly entice us; and for a movie about Sparta, the special effects just aren't necessary."

","An epic drama inspired by the events of the Battle of the Thermopile, in which 300 Spartan soldiers fought to death against the overwhelming power of the Persian troops.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the film immensely. I loved the comic aesthetics of the film, the intensity of the war scenes, and male 6-pack and thighs! Wooo Hoooo! :D There are many gory scenes, which I usually I don't like, but in this case they beautifully put together in the fighting scenes, and reflect well the dramatic intensity of the story. The 6-packs also help to digest them better :D I confess, though, that, I couldn't stand some of them. Too harsh for me.<br/><br/>The depiction of the Spartan society was, although modernized and softened, quite good, a reflection of the severity of the Greek city-state and its people.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is great and alternates powerful rock tracks used during the fighting with others of beautiful lyricism to match personal and romantic scenes. Actually the music reminded me of Gladiator's OST.<br/><br/>I also liked the sex scenes, which were made with eroticism and class.<br/><br/>The worst thing about film is that the dialogs are poor, and that the real story is turned into a bunch of Manichean actions and people - right and wrong, heroes and tyrants, black and white, freedom and slavery, struggle for freedom and peace by using violence and war. Does it sound familiar? Of course it does. That's a quintessential Hollywood theme to justify war and violence in most movies.<br/><br/>It also caught my attention the fact that to distinguish some Greek people from others, the actors speak in English and Scottish accent. I found that shocking. They were Greeks! If we depart from the premise that their speaking in English is a cinematographic license, we can still leave the other people speak in English without any accent. The viewer will understand.<br/><br/>It is an enjoyable film, perfect for men and women. Full of action and hot men. What else do you want?!"

It's the images and imaginations you get when you listen to stories told in ancient times, where ""we"" were perfect, and the enemies were beasts and (almost) unhuman.

The blackness that fades one the face of the man that bribes the Spartan politician, until his eyes are the only thing visible. The jewelry and the makeup of the generals and god-king.

","Let's think about the aspects of 300 other than what it looks like.<br/><br/>It tells a true story, but twists some elements, omits others, adds fictional bits, and otherwise sacrifices veracity for cinematic effect. The story is not a complex one, by the way, but but it does have some emotional resonance.<br/><br/>The script is serviceable but not great. Dialogue which works in a comic does not always work on screen. Having said that, there is dialogue included which has echoed down the ages, and there are some effective bits of dialogue.<br/><br/>There are monsters added. They aren't necessary, but they are very cinematic.<br/><br/>The cast do tolerably well, although the male members seem mostly to have been selected for athleticism rather than thespianism (those Greeks! I don't know...) It is very violent. Well, I guess that if you're watching a film where 300 men with sharp implements fight thousands of others, also with sharp implements, you have to expect a little violence.<br/><br/>But what does it look like? There's the rub - this film is almost entirely about visual impact. A great deal of effort has been devoted to making 300 look quite unlike anything ever seen on the cinema screen. It is a stunning piece of work visually, although perhaps over-reliant on slow motion (and, particularly, intermittent transitions between slow motion and normal speed).<br/><br/>If you can stomach the violence, then it is worth seeing simply for how wonderful it looks."

","I quite liked this film. There was little else to it but graphic violence and the battle scenes were suitably gory. The situation should make one sympathise with the Spartans but, paradoxically, I found myself rather wishing the 'baddies' would triumph. Spartan society was pretty hairy by all accounts, hard, uncompromising, women didn't have much of a life, 'weakling' babies exposed to die etc etc. Admittedly the Persians had numbers on their side, but the Spartans were much better armed, with heavy infantry weapons - metal shields, spears and cutting swords while the Persians had lattice-work shields which the spears just went through. In a modern parallel it was brown bess muskets against kalashnikovs. Which, of course, evened things up a bit Re the film, there were some fairly questionable situations, though. I mean, would the traitor who was stabbed by the queen really go into the conference chamber with the actual Persian '30 pieces of silver' stuffed up his jumper? Unless he was mentally challenged in a big way I'd say probably not. Also (a common feature of all 'goodie/baddie' movies), why, when there are 15 baddies wanting to skewer one goodie, do the baddies form an orderly line and obligingly come at him one at a time? Why not all jump on him at once? In terms of the inevitable corpse-count it would seem to be a better policy.<br/><br/>Still, I have say I watched it all the way through with only a minimum of boredom (in the non-fighting bits at least). My fave character? Ephialtes the hunchback, of course - he reminded me of my old woodwork teacher after he'd had an argument with a lathe!"

","The pendulum has a long slow swing in Hollywood from bombastic style, histrionics and showy theatrics to hard-nosed realism, grit and verisimilitude. My generation of film makers would have been embarrassed to make this kind of movie, following on the heels of the early 60s overacted, over-saturated, over-orchestrated movies.<br/><br/>Young people of my generation were sick of that stuff. We celebrated directors like Scorsese, Nichols, Eastwood, Bogdanovich, and even Stanley Kubrick, John Houston who gave us very realistic looking dramas and period pieces, with actors speaking in cadences of everyday people. The more highly awarded and celebrated movies for several decades could be characterized this way.<br/><br/>But then I guess it always has to follow that another generation comes along and finds all of that boring. They want their movies to look like the animation that they've watched on Saturday or their video games.<br/><br/>So it is with this movie which really signaled that swing back. It employs a lot of CGG -- I mean what movie now doesn't. But it also employs a technique to an extreme: high-pass sharpening. Everyone looks shiny and over-modeled. It causes me to ask ""What is this film maker trying to hide?"" On top of that, every thing is dark and contrasty. Then, of course you have your actors speaking like the wooden-headed Mr. Heston again.<br/><br/>This is a great story.

It's a much better film with real substance. The action sequences are not as ""lively"" as those in 300, but you'll actually have an attachment to the characters and the story.<br/><br/>Characterization: I don't know why Hollywood thinks that the way to introduce and maintain a character's personality is by having him/her say something that ""sounds"" epic on paper. This movie is filled with ""epic"" lines spouted by empty characters who try in vain to force the viewer into believing that it is emotionally worthy. Also, the Queen's character comes into question when, in one scene, she allows herself to be raped through a method of blackmail and a few minutes later stabs the rapist to death in public. The transition from timid, black-mailed, rape victim to heroic, courageous, maverick seems to have occurred behind the scenes as the directors hand is plunged into the film to move it along and attempt to have ""something dramatic"" occur.<br/><br/>Plot: The original story is incredible. Why reinvent the wheel? Remember when you were a kid and played out in the backyard? Remember how your pretend world didn't have to make sense because you were enamored by your own BRILLIANT ideas? Yeah...that's this movie. The writers/directors/actors are so pleased with themselves, that they expect you to enjoy it without actually trying to please you.<br/><br/>Cinematography: Ugghh...the SAME scene over and over. A few guys in red capes murdering hundreds of Persians. Again...again....again....and again...... This film is packed with nonstop fight scenes that show little to NO combat strategy, but rather, guys in underwear jumping around and killing people?<br/><br/>Accuracy: Please! The Spartans faired so well against overwhelming odds because of superior military training, superior technology, and brilliant strategy - a fact completely overlooked in this film. Xerxes was actually not a 9 foot tall demigod, despite what the filmmakers would have us believe. And the Spartans weren't glorious because they had six-packs and screamed a lot about ""freedom"" and ""being glorious."" How about Hollywood actually try to show us why they were glorious without a fight scene played in slow motion.<br/><br/>This movie is little more than a blatant insult to your intelligence. If you like movies with guys in underwear running through the same choreography over and over while yelling about how ""glorious"" they are, then you'll like this movie. If you appreciate overly-dramatic, yet emotionally empty characterization, you will enjoy this film. And if you enjoy the twisting of great historical stories into tales of ""special effects"", you'll dig ""300."""

","OK, 300 will never become my absolute favorite but it's enjoyable. Lots of battle scenes, lots of gore (I think I'm pretty desensitized about violence in films; bad thing!) and some funny ""macho"" moments. Even the Persian creatures are interesting to watch. I would argue it is not the best thing to see 300 guys in thongs (maybe some loincloth would have been better; and where is the armor? should they advertise six-packs so shamelessly?), but still the visual aspect of the movie is breathtaking. The sepia and crimson red are used ad nauseum, but it gives the film a simultaneous comic book / epic feeling. I remember some critic saying ""I have never seen such beautiful chopped heads"". I think she was right; no doubt the film is ground-breaking visually.<br/><br/>But even with the stunning visuals, what probably takes this film to a whole new level is Queen Gorgo. She is, without question, a strong, beautiful, charismatic and smart woman. It's pretty uncommon (yet) in films to see such a strong female character; so it was about time this happened. It's good because it sticks to the historical notions of the Spartan queen and it also empowers women somewhat. I believe she is way more interesting than any other character in the film (even Leonidas); even her ""indiscretion"" is justified, and I lost no admiration for her, especially by the way she ""redeems"" herself near the end of the film. Queen Gorgo should be used more as model for strong female characters (I'm tired of gorgeous kinky bimbo girls in movies!); it's one of the things mainstream films need badly.<br/><br/>Because the story is not perfect (and because of the controversy about the depiction of some Persians), the film loses 4 points. But because of Queen Gorgo's characterization, it wins back 2 points. Verdict: 8/10."

","I watched the ""300"" on DVD without any real expectations other than thinking it might have a relationship to ""Spartacus"", hoped to get a little history insight, and that the HBO series ""Rome"" and the movie ""Gladiator"" were great.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, this reminded me of going to see ""Dune"", and not sure what to say about it to my date, who had read the book. I need more of a reality check. The problem is that there is always someone with something badder just around the corner in reality, but that is not much of a story.<br/><br/>Slaughtering people cartoon style by warriors who are far from heroic, just doesn't impress me as entertaining. Who knows what is around the corner for us, without trying to glorify a dog eat dog mentality. It left me feeling that spectators at a gladiator event would love this until they get dragged into the arena themselves.<br/><br/>In ""Rome"" and ""Gladiator"" you were able to understand the soul of major characters, what they lived for as well as what they fought for. They were flawed humans and not just machines guided by myth.<br/><br/>My heroes are Pericles who tried to establish and promote the first true democracy until being sabotaged after it worked too well, and the citizen soldiers, hopplites and farmers willing to fight when necessary to hold on to their freedom; not the imperial armies or the mercenaries."

","The scenes are amazing but the story is childish. There is a minimal wisdom in the whole movie story. Let me begin with one of the obvious ones: After the Spartans Queen killed Theron in front of Greek Senates, some Persian coins fell off from him on the ground. Why should he take the ""enemy's"" coins into the Senate Hall and where was he supposed to expense the coins in Greece?! One more inconsistency in the story is about the first attack by arrows to Spartans that made many holes on all of their shields and cloaks. Why later on we saw most of the shields and cloaks without any holes on them?! Let me continue by saying that the Persian army in the movie was a mixture of Arabic soldiers wit turbans, some Chinese style masking faces and some Indian elephant riders. Where are the Persian soldiers whose realistic uniforms are engraved on the Persepolise stones for three thousand years?

"Jacques98","4","0","1","17 September 2008"," Pretty cute.
","First of all, I'd like to say that I liked this movie. All the bad things I am going to talk about in a second don't mean that I didn't have a decently good time. 300 was enjoyable to an extent. Okay? Here we go.<br/><br/>The first big problem with 300 was the cheese. From the opening credits, it relives all doubt you had that this movie is meant to be taken seriously by giving you the cheesiest narrator in nearly a millennium. From that point, it delves into a cheesy butt scene, strait out of something you'd see in a comedy, which got me laughing. And if that wasn't enough to make you wonder if this is the same hardcore action movie that was advertised, the director appeases the penises of horny 12-year-old boys (who have never touched a chick in their lives) and 50-year-old men (who secretly find their wives more boring than the opening of this movie) enough boobs to hold them over through the boring, unnecessary characterization scenes.<br/><br/>That in itself is 300's second flaw. Every action movie and their pet cow seem to think they have to characterize their characters. Okay, pause with me for a second. When was the last time you saw a standard action movie¬ólike this¬ówhere you actually remembered the name of the main character, much less the names of the secondary characters and the names of the secondary character's wives and children? I can't, and I doubt you can either. We don't see action movies for characters, we see them for action. The characters are fodder. They die. We don't care. What we do care about is seeing the next pointless character explode and his guts go all over the screen, but somehow action movie directors don't understand their audience. Directors¬ólike Zack Snyder¬óassume they have to be ""good storytellers"" and take up 30 to 50 minutes of screen time to give their characters have some sort of characterization. The problem with that is the characterization is always shallow and they end up characterizing a clich√© that is flatter than if they hadn't take up all that time to characterize. In the end, it leaves you bored and you STILL can care less about the characters. 300 does this exact thing, just like every other action movie on the planet. The action scenes are few and far between. Most of the screen time is characterizing, and I still could care less who lived and who died. All I wish is action directors would LISTEN to their FANS and stop using this clich√©d, pointless method. If 300 was nothing but battle from opening to closing, I would have given it a higher score, but I can't because of the lame, boring attempt ad characterization.<br/><br/>The third main flaw with 300 is the lack of blood. I heard from all my friends that this was a gorefest, but it wasn't even close to one. Even the back cover promises ""BLOOD, thunder, and awe"". But where was the blood? I saw a few dots of it every few minutes, but nothing more. The decapitations, for God's sake, didn't even have any blood! People are stabbed, shot with arrows, cut apart¬óbut all the most blood that is show is a few dots flying across the screen. If it was up to me, I would have EASYLY given this a PG-13 rating.<br/><br/>Forth main flaw was the battle scenes themselves. Whoever honestly thinks these are some of the most epic battle scenes of all time are joking. The battle scenes are very stylish and fun, but to call them intense or epic is a joke. Compared to LotR: Return of the King, the battles seem minute. Compared to CoN: Prince Caspian, the battles seem slow-paced and lack any intensity at all. Compared to Braveheart, the battle scenes seem tame. With that said, I like them better than most of those simply because they were stylish and fun and visually pleasing, but they were nowhere near truly epic. A lot of them were small enough to have taken place in my backyard. The vast, expansive Persian army was broken up into bite-sized groups in every single battle, never once attacking with full force. Sorry, but that just seemed lame to me.<br/><br/>Overall, though, my opinion is positive. All the things I just pointed out could be overlooked if you had fun, and I did. After so many boring action movies this side of the new millennium, this one really stands out, even though it is pretty typical. It's visually stunning, and it isn't as toned down as it could have been. Just grab some friends and have fun¬óif you try taking this movie seriously you'll hate it. The story is cute, the action is fun and refreshing, some of the characters are memorable, and it has a nice soundtrack. If I wanted to, I could tear this movie apart even further with criticism, but I'm not going to. It's a breath of fresh air for the action fan, even if it's nothing new or innovative.<br/><br/>4/10"

","I hated this ""movie."" I can't say it any other way, I literally suffered through the entire ""film"" and was praying for it to end, and once it finally did, i was even more angry because of the garbage I had just been fed from so-called director Zack Snyder.

Though, I guess if you're a fan of movies like ""XXX"" and ""The Fast and the Furious,"" you'll probably like this too.<br/><br/>I hate Zack Snyder. I've hated him ever since he shamelessly remade my favorite movie of all time, Dawn of the Dead, and turned into a Hollywood pile of trash. His direction is no better in this ""film"". It has no story, horrible characters, and just a bad feel to it in general. I'm also very sick of people saying how visually amazing this ""movie"" is. And I'll admit, the colorization looked really good and is the only thing that kept me from giving it a 1/10 rating but the CGI was awful!

","Do you like to watch thickly muscled beefcake slicing swarthy enemies to ribbons under a copper colored sky? Then '300' is for you. Otherwise, stay far away from this cornball pseudo-epic that falls flat in nearly every facet.<br/><br/>This is a flick that takes itself way too seriously while shamelessly borrowing from superior movies; among them 'Braveheart' and 'Lord of the Rings.' From the opening scene viewers are besieged with hollow speechifying and colloquial dialogue. Forget about any history lesson, '300' is all about the spectacle of slow motion CGI bloodletting, makeup effects, and the fine art of facial piercing.<br/><br/>Cardboard characters predominate the green-screen, er,landscape...plot twists are as subtle as a spear to the gut. It's hard to care about these Spartan warmongerers when there is nothing to a well-toned deltoid interesting about them. Meanwhile, the evil ""god king"" Xerxes wears purple lipstick and is about as threatening as Prince during his ""Purple Rain"" era. (Great album, though. Listen to that instead of watching this.) <br/><br/>Yes, there are a couple of cool fight scenes. The best early on when the Spartans literally push a horde of enemies into the sea. However, any political subtext, i.e. ""freedom isn't free,"" is lost in the rest of this silly excuse for a war epic."
"irish23","4","0","1","1 July 2008"," This *so* wanted to be Gladiator
","I think this picture is best watched on fast forward. Lots and lots of slow-motion battle/blood sequences and ""vista"" shots, punctuated by dramatic narration and occasional bits of dialogue. It was nice to see Miller translated to the screen, and I really enjoyed seeing so much of Spartan history restored, but overall the picture is about visuals derived from Gladiator and (less so) The Matrix.<br/><br/>Where they went wrong on history, they *really* went wrong, such as implying that only the Greeks (Athenians) practiced pederasty. It was actually part of Spartan training. And this whole idea that Spartans were free and democratic while everyone else was a slave is just plain wrong.<br/><br/>I *loved* the queen and thought they got the role of Spartan women more accurate than most historical films do. Unfortunately, they did fall quite short of reality. The whole ""come back with your shield or on it"" is true but overall, Spartan women were much more tough than portrayed in the film and just as comfortable in their bodies as men. Athenians were scandalized at Spartan women's assertiveness, flashy dancing, and short skirts (legs were apparently more scandalous than cleavage).<br/><br/>The problem with pictures that try to base everything on a single historical event where there isn't much documentation is that they have to come up with something to ""build up the padding,"" so to speak. Like so many before it, 300 fails miserably in this regard, with thin, predictable, and even bizarre minor story threads. ""Troy"" (Brad Pitt version) had the same problem.<br/><br/>A special effects extravaganza -- a study in set/costume design & cinematic technique straight from Gladiator -- a *lot* of frames filled with wheat -- these are not things to tempt me. The standard ""oh-so-decadent"" Persian court was just ridiculous. Pretty much everything about the Persians was ridiculous. You'd think an empire that gobbled up much of the ancient world would have more going for it.<br/><br/>Anyway, I'm glad to have watched it so I know what all the fuss was about, but it's not one to see again."

","I was actually really happy when this film came out, and not just because of the hot, sweaty half-naked men the entire time. It was because this was a real movie coming out at a time when there were tons of very dumb chick flicks and this movie filled a need for a hard movie in a time when the box office had gone soft. The film may not have been historically accurate, but it makes up for that with its beautiful CGI and acting with a stellar cast of Gerard Butler, Lena Headey, and David Wenham (Lord of the Rings), and the slow-motion throughout added an interesting allure to the film that hadn't been seen before. This was a fantastic film and I defy anybody who says otherwise."
"teenagezombie555","8","0","2","22 June 2008"," Exciting, intense...insulting?
","Firstly I'm going to say i do not believe this rubbish about racism, as many people with an IQ have already stated it is told from a Spartans point of view so the narrator is not going to be fair to his enemy now is he? Anyway I'm grateful for this film, the high fuel action, the artistic scenery, score and costume and of course the overacting and dedication to Miller's original comic. It really captures this fantastic depiction of a war in a way thats never been done before. However, i feel that it perhaps simplifies the Spartans to some testosterone injected metal heads. I hate seeing people write about how ""cool"" it would be to be a spartan as if their life was a big rock and roll festival, i would have loved to have seen some complexity, or the reasons as to why the Spartans are the way they are. It does make me sad to see these fantastically skilled unique and dedicated to their cause people be parodied in terrible ""films"" (meet the Spartans, seriously what is with that?) But in the end maybe I'm looking to far into a film that is quintessentially an action film, and a fantastic one at that, and i cant blame the film for these morons going around shouting SPARTA!! all the time, guess ill have to wait for a gates of fire film..."

"Enchorde","8","0","1","15 June 2008"," This is Sparta
","Recap: Sparta, an ancient Greek state where the highest glory is to die for land and country. So from the day they are born Spartan boys are raised as warriors, producing the finest army ever seen. But now Sparta is threatened by a mightier foe than ever, Xerxes and the Persians. Xerxes has assembled the greatest army ever seen and now turns his attention to Greece. But Xerxes long arm has already reached Sparta with the promise of gold, wealth and women and a few Spartan do not support their king Leonidas anymore. So Leonidas is forced to bring only his bodyguard, 300 of the best warriors in Sparta and with them try to repel Xerxes. But above all they will abide by Spartan law. Never retreat, never surrender.<br/><br/>Comments: This is Sparta, and there will be blood. A lot of it. Actually it will be abusive amounts of blood spilled in this movie, so if you don't like blood, choose something else to watch. What makes this move so good (but also its major weakness ironically) is the monumental sense of wonder. Nothing is done half-hearted, every thrust with the spear, every stroke with the sword every line delivered is done so to the fullest. This makes it a great movie to unwind to, to relax to. To get caught in this fabricated sense of heroism and glory. It is easy, and it is very enjoying.<br/><br/>But to have everything yelled, every line delivered as their entire fate depended on each syllable, makes the move very monotone. There is no levels, no subtleties. Everything is brutal. This is in part due to be honest to the story, as it is told that there is no room for any softness, any weakness. But to raise the level of the movie even further you really need to be able to handle all aspects.<br/><br/>There are a lot of special effects, and they are really good. The action is massive and each and every adrenalin full moment is well choreographed and full of blood. You see this for the action, and it never disappoints.<br/><br/>And there is an interesting question, a hint at a more complex thought beyond the action. The Spartans, the good guys, are all perfect. Even the slightest flaw and you're discarded. On the other hand, the tyrant Xerxes is very accepting of flaws and disfigurement, unintentional or intentional. But he is also very obviously evil. But the accepting stance is mostly associated with good, although not here. Something to think about? I don't know...<br/><br/>Still, and all in all. This is a very entertaining movie.<br/><br/>8/10"

","It upsets me that people take cinema so seriously. I read some of the comments, and many people had an issue with the film's dedication to historical truth. Anyone could tell you this story is based on a graphic novel, which originally put a dramatic spin on an ancient battle. Ever play telephone, people? The he said-she said thing tends to kill fact as embellishment takes over, and this sort of cinematic filtering is no exception. That being said, what on earth is the big deal? You should know you're not going to get a history lesson out of this sort of film, so why bother griping about it? If you want a history lesson, yank out a text book, not a comic book, or watch the History Channel. They give you (guess what?) history. If you want a good movie experience with some historical ideas thrown about, check this baby out.<br/><br/>The deal with this film is that it's like Sin City: same creator, similar editing, great story, awesome color schemes and great composition. It's like watching a moving comic book.<br/><br/>Understand going into this film that it is nothing if not epic. Everything is DRAMA. It should be epic though. The back story is insane. 300 men take on a gigantic army in defense of their homeland. 300. That's probably less than the amount of people you could fit into your local mall, less than the amount of kids in my graduating high school class. The odds were epic; the film is epic. And oh boy, does it deliver.<br/><br/>You want romance? Check. Action? Check. Absolute gore? CHECK CHECK CHECK. This movie is everything it should be, and the fact that it was low budget gives it a great feel in my opinion: relatively B-List actors proving why they should be upgraded to nothing less than headliners. And, I'm sorry, when I watch gore in some sort of epic battle, why would I NOT want to listen to intense, hard rock and see everything go into slow-motion so I can catch every bloody (literally) detail? I was absolutely giddy with excitement the first time I saw this movie. It made my day. <br/><br/>And while some scenes may be borderline cheesy, again, epic. It calls for it. The whole point is that for this movie, you know how the story ends, because despite what picky people say, it is loosely based on history. They all died. This movie doesn't lie about it. So why do we know about this ridiculous battle? This movie sort of gives you a reason. Because it was a kind of fairy-tale, you-can't-make-this-up story about mighty, brave men who fought with brawn as well as brain.<br/><br/>As for plot, DUH. Are you brain dead? The movie recounts a battle. What caused it to happen, what happened during the crazy battle, who was involved, what came of it? That's why it's called 300, and not Sparta or something like that. It focuses on the before, during, and after of an insane multiple-day battle and everything surrounding it. If that's not enough plot for you, then you shouldn't watch this movie. Go develop your open mind, then come back and try again.<br/><br/>Anyway, long review short, this movie is as awesome as it is intense. I loved it. So long as you go in with an open mind and an appetite for gore, you'll love it too."

People tend to agree with me on this one.<br/><br/>There is a weak plot and character development, and I agree with this point, but its that good that it doesn't need a plot or character development and still it worked for me.

","People looking for an ""authentic historical motion picture"" should look elsewhere. 300 is a fantasy movie about three things: Action, visuals, and morals.<br/><br/>The action scenes are amazing, the visuals are stunning, and the moral stand of the righteousness of defending one's home at any cost against totalitarian regimes is also appealing.<br/><br/>Amusingly enough, the movie's morals have brought forth an enormous amount of vitriol here on IMDb and from liberal reviewers such as Roger Ebert. This usually happens with blood-filled movies, though it's usually loud cries for censorship from the Christian right. This time, however, the vitriol is from the extremist left who somehow find Saw and Kill Bill more acceptable than people fighting to defend their home.

","There are many who pretend and then there are many who pretend.This film was viewed by me perhaps as many as 7 times within 6 weeks and even perhaps viewed more often than stated though it is even now still very viewable.I watched this film that often,as both Ancient Greek History as well as the attention these many reviews engendered required it.It is almost unusual to suggest that it was not this movie that made this worth watching but the defense of thermopylae that did.I did some research and even more so to learn that though this very emotional and power packed plea of the defense of Themopylae was a truly inspiring story.Its amazing underpinning lived on, as its king,King Leonidas said, ""Go Tell the Spartans what happened here"".It was more than a mere battle cry but a call from the heart of a King in King Leonidas to all of Greece to prepare for battle.This defense and its heroes provided for the kind of ferocious fighting that was to exemplify the ultimate victory that was to finally come when Xerses was defeated by a Greek Army force outside of Athens.This film had that much going for it and that its history was one of the more inspiring moments in all of military annals as well as the annals of the history of the world.What was to occur months and for a time to come, from that time on, was a series of small to very large engagements in which if there was death to its defenders it was committed with certainty as to glory.No defense was given without the taken of the life of the slave army of Persia.It should be further stated that this was not the only major battle that was to occur whereby the outcome was as the result of secret passage accessed by Xerses forces.There is only the echo,""Go tell the Spartans""This film became more and more a film to know, its subject matter required a better and better understanding as it did become both a demand of history and of the value of this particular motion picture.It would seem that the history cannot be denied and it is history that has made this film worth watching all these times and will allow for the watching of this film again.The 300 is characterized by excellent story telling,a most certain leader in the portrayal of King Leonidas and a demand to be up to the challenge that all freedom loving peoples should be aware of that ""free men stood up against a tyrant""It is in these sentiments that this film provides its most enduring quality.It is raw and it is present and neither will it fade away.This is a permanent quality,a everlasting voice unto all of time to, ""Go Tell The Spartans""This is not only an emotional appeal it is as well an inspirng story as to the very basic underpinning to the word which translated from the Greek means Democracia.This is the kind of interest that this film engendered as its place however humble is made glorious with and because of its pedigree.A natural place, a worthy chapter in the History of Civilization and never to fade even unto glory.A bright star is born in the Defense of Thermopylae.The 300 has the everlasting to thank as time will provide all the help this offer could ever require.This film is its pedigree,without it we are mere mortal with it we live forever."

","I have just finished watching this film on A Blue Ray. It was better than I thought it would be, and I did enjoy it. However, even if you say this is created from a graphic novel, in no way is this film not a propaganda movie. Perhaps Zack Snyder, the director is trying to make it obvious, I think that he might become our American Sergei Eisenstein, or want to become the new D.W. Griffith.<br/><br/>First, the parallel between this film with Alexander Nevsky and Henry VI should not be lost on viewers. In each case, they're was an enemy on the horizon, In Alexander Nevsky, made before world War II, it was Russians battling the Teutonic (Read German) barbarians who would invade their land. In Henry VI, the Olivier version, the invasion of France was imminent, (Perhaps it had already happened) and I believe that they beat the French during that historical period on French soil. With ""300"", we have a Greek nation Sparta (Read U.S. and Britain) fighting a lone battle against the Persian Empire (read Iran or anything Islamic). George Bush says Iran and the Islamists want to change are way of life, which is also stated in this film as well, they even talk of the conquest of Europa.<br/><br/>While Sparta goes and fights, the rest of the Greek Nations are portrayed as old, and fearful of war. remember Rumsfeld calling Germany and France Old Europe. They are portrayed as ignorant of the threat that Persia possesses, and even worse, possibly treacherous. the king of the Spartans as portrayed by Gerald Buttler, the one traitor says that he is leading us to Anarchy with his stand of the 300 against the Persian army. Isn't this the way many feel about President Bush around the world? Yet in this film, Sparta is shown to be correct, and the other Greeks wrong. It is only with the sacrifice of the 300 in this film, that the Greeks rise up to defend Democracy, in the film, against the Persians. Listen to that last bit of dialogue by the only one of the 300 to survive, as he leads the thousands of soldiers with the charge at the end of this film. John Wayne never did it better.<br/><br/>Some have commented that we never feel for any of these characters of the 300. I don't think we are meant to, since we know they are doomed. The last scene of Gerald Butler as the King dead, is like a crucified Christ figure. I also got a kick out of his performance, on some occasions he would sound like Sean Connery, and ironically looks a little like George Clooney, a man I'm sure would never have agreed to do a film like this. Perhaps an intentional dig at Clooney who has shown his distaste for the present American foreign policy.<br/><br/>One of the troubling aspects of this film, is the use of Black Actors as major villains. Some have commented that blacks would have been part of the Persian Empire, and have been addressed as Persians, however they are shown at the leaders of the Persians. I was hoping that the audio commentary on the disk I viewed this movie, would addressed this, but the director and Screen Writer chose to avoid this, as they did about the anger of the Iranian government, which I thought was too bad, at least what I heard, did I possibly miss something. Has the original creator, Frank Miller addressed this? By the way, My Girl friend who is African American was not offended, and neither were her sons. I haven't heard any African American groups have a complaint against this film.<br/><br/>The film reminded me a little of the Road Warrior, and I think it has elements of that. I probably enjoyed this movie because of what I did see in it, the obvious to me propaganda element, and their-fore being able to recognize the film being more than a entertainment tool. Also it is a visually artistic beautiful film to watch, and may be paving the way with films like Sin City and Beowulf, towards a new world Cinema."

","This is a good movie that opens the door to controversy. That is what makes this film so good. My youngest daughter saw this film at the theatre and said afterwards she had to own it. The action sequences are a bit fake (because of, no doubt, high tech animation) and the bodies of the soldiers are a bit too honed to perfection via computer graphics, but otherwise this is a racially charged, designed to excite, argumentative-type movie. The emissaries are black (sent hurtling to the depths of the centre of the earth), King Xerxes is a Barak Obama look-alike and King Leonidas is someone obsessed with keeping Greece ""white"" (all barbarians to be kept out at all costs). I wonder how much subconscious material in this film was based on the current immigration policies of European countries, not to mention our own, that might have influenced the message in this screenplay? Whatever the intent of the filmmakers, this film has generated a lot of anger and controversy that I thought could never happen nowadays in our ""politically correct"" environment. I am glad to see that some movie makers have decided to wake some of us up out of the doldrums of a ho-hum dreary existence into an angst of vigour that might translate into some constructive balance in the views expressed in the public forum.

On the negative side there really wasn't much of a plot - this could be forgiven if the story line had followed the historical facts, but it didn't. The characterisations were a bit thin and I didn't feel that any attempt was made to get under the skin of Leonidas and explain what made him tick. Having said all that, the action sequences more than made up for all the other shortcomings and almost despite myself I was gripped and enthralled by it.

"Pelintra02","5","0","1","21 January 2008"," Fantastic Art Direction and a Good Performance from Gerard Butler Cant Save this from Being a Disappointment
","Remember that visually breathtaking trailer, you know, the one with the excellent Nine Inch Nails track ""Just Like You Imagined"" It came crashing along like the thunderstorm it promised to be back in 2007, but sadly promises can be broken. That said trailer should only be watched if your wanting to avoid this, at times inspired but often mixed baggage of a fantasy film.<br/><br/>The main problem with 300 is the pacing and overused CGI, but it doesn't help that pretty much every character here is immensely stereotyped in terms of gender and moral code. The actors led by a charismatic turn from Gerard Butler do a fair decent job at fitting into these roles, but one cant help feel a tad bit unsympathetic for these 300 men of Sparta. This combination of pacing and stereotyping results in a dumbing down of sorts, which is not Frank Millers fault.<br/><br/>The original novel this film does indeed stick close to, but things feel claustrophobic when the genre shouldn't be and the art direction whilst fantastic is rarely shot in full view by director Zack Snyder. This was a similar complaint I had with Sin City ,but I suppose for some, its suburban location benefited the film in a better way. Snyder leaves the art for the visceral shots but this is not what an ""epic"" fantasy novel is about . There is no artistic compromise to the film and there is nothing ultimately new here that will distinguish it from its other genre titles. Action, which was 300's main selling point is also something left to the imagination.<br/><br/>These rough and tough warriors clash, but that's actually all they do. After the same ""push them back"" formula is continued three times it gets damn monotonous and you wish that these Spartan boys would just whip out there sabers and get on with it. This does eventually happen, but only once. The rest of the time Snyder treats the action with too many slow motion effects and thus tension is reduced to a nought. It is here I find myself entertained but to a mind numbingly extent. A high rating it may have in 2008, but time, I believe will not be kind to this disappointing film."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","8","0","2","16 January 2008"," Innovative visuals give ""300"" unique appeal
","If you think about it, ""300"" really is very little more than ripped men in loincloths cracking one-liners and killing everything in sight despite the fact that it's obvious that they all will die. What give it its appeal, however, is the way that a story that could be told like any other classic world war film (maybe ""Spartacus"" is a good example here?) is told with a unique 21st century twist.<br/><br/>In actuality, to be fair, the movie is based on a graphic novel of the same title and tells the story of King Leonidas (Gerard Butler) and how he rounded up 300 men to fight the Persian empire who was planning on taking over all of Greece and how the principle was more important than the obvious outcome of the battle.<br/><br/>What director Zack Snyder does is give the film a more artsy look, something more focused on images and contrasting light and dark. The result is a somewhat superficial look, but that's the idea. The story is told from the one man (David Wenham from ""Lord of the Rings"") who is personally asked by Leonidas to go back to Sparta and tell the story before they all end up dying. He of course, trying to convince the rest of Sparta to fight, glorifies the telling. It is an incredibly wise choice then, for Snyder to glorify the telling in the movie, with excessive blood, slow motion and a variety of strange middle eastern music. The actors are mostly British or Scottish to seem more classic (if ""Gladiator"" can pick Russell Crowe, ""300"" is allowed) so clearly the goal is to be over the top. Butler, by the way, gives a commanding performance that with a more serious film would warrant much praise.<br/><br/>Without these choices, Snyder would have a boring piece of unmolded clay on his hands. He brings the life into the film. It's not remarkable nor should it be award-winning, but it certainly is entertaining and proof that there is more than one way to shoot an epic war movie. If ""300"" was trying to be more than cool or even just cool with a proved formula, Warner Bros. would have released it in December or over the summer. Instead it's a breakthrough in unique film-making."
"Jakethemuss","9","0","2","15 January 2008"," Rule No. 1: Never threaten a Spartan with death or slavery
","This is another of Frank Miller's graphic novel adaptations, with Zack Snyder (Dawn of the Dead remake)in the driving seat. Similar to ""Sin City"" it is all shot in a studio under a dark filter and relies hugely on CGI and special effects, this is not necessarily a good or bad thing, but something worth noting.<br/><br/>It is set in ancient Greece, Sparta to be exact, and tells the bold tale of King Leonidas and his 300 elite warriors who set out to defend Sparta from a vastly larger army of Persians. Only 300 march out as the authorities have ruled out the possibility of a full on war. 300 may not sound a lot, but these guys are not your average man. It quickly becomes clear that the Persian's have their hands full with this fiercely lethal, combat effective unit of sword wielding warriors.<br/><br/>This film does not set out to be a perfectly weighed, factual, historical documentary on an ancient battle, but does set out to provide a powerful, energetic, gripping story of valour and sacrifice....and succeeds. The many battles scenes are gloriously bloody and graphic, with countless impalements, limbs flying, be-headings and more. The more you see the steadfast Spartan's achieve against vastly unfavourable odds the more you inspired you become, at least that was how it was for me.<br/><br/>Great performances help make this film what it is. Gerald Butler is outstanding as the growling, fiery eyed, fearless Leonidas. His battle cries sound authentic enough to send a chill down the spine, and his unquestionable dedication to Sparta wins more than a little respect. Lena Headley gives a solid performance as Leonidas's wife and Queen, Gorgo. The love between the 2 is a true, pure love, and this is proved in her constant support to send re-enforcements to help her King defend whats their's.<br/><br/>I remember the huge internet hype surrounding this film pre-release, and can say after 3 viewings, it is worth it.

","300 is not your traditional war movie. The battles, characters, colours, story and action are different and unique. The battle sequences are the some of the best I have ever seen and they have been filmed in very interesting ways. The use of colour is extraordinary. Whether this is historically accurate I don't know, but at times it can be very fantasy like. The choice of using unknown actors makes the movie even more special. However the only downside is Gerard Butler as King Leonidas. He continuously changes his accent. The first half of the movie he's English, then speaking with a thick Scottish accent, and then back to an English accent. What's that all about?

","""More a man the more stripes he wears, glory seeker trends. Bodies fill the fields I see, the slaughter never ends.""<br/><br/>Such is the case with ""300."" One of the most testosterone fueled flicks to ever come out. There is literally enough machismo here for every Clint Eastwood movie to have ever come out. But is that a good or bad or bad thing?<br/><br/>The bad of ""300"" are the incredible historical liberties it takes. The way the Spartans are portrayed, the way the Persians are portrayed, the way good and evil is portrayed, it is all very simplistic and doesn't at all merit the actual historical event. Basically good looking equals good and ugly equals bad. Many of the Persians are even shown as being monsters or mutations of sorts. Then the Spartans, people in peak physical and mental condition are filled with honor and respect. At one point King Leonidas even laughs at the Athenians for being ""philosphers and boy lovers"" despite the fact that ""boy loving"" was standard in Sparta and life in Sparta was from from democratic of tranquil. In fact for many residents it was dangerous and outright unfair.<br/><br/>If fact the film, and Frank Miller's graphic novel, takes so many liberties with history and portrayal that it would be better served in a fantasy universe with allusions to the real 300 Spartans. Walter Hill's ""The Warriors"" does something like that and it served the film well. As a result, the creative liberties then wouldn't seem excessive and much of the offense many people take from this film would be gone. I found the fact that people are offended by this film kind of silly as the exaggerations are obviously intentional and not ignorant stereotypes. On the flip side that fact that ""300"" takes place in a real historical setting is also silly given all those liberties it takes. It would simply better better served in a fantasy setting like ""Lord of the Rings"" (which contains many allusions to Europeans history).<br/><br/>The good of ""300"" is the incredible production value. Shot on three blue screen sets with one actual outside location (just like the Star Wars episodes I, II, and III), yet it gives George Lucas a serious run for his money. This is what blue screen is all about, folks. The cinematography is spellbinding and the action sequences are nothing short of a series of jaw dropping spectacles of first-rate choreography and special effects. Many shots are taken directly from the graphic novel's static images, but are translated onto screen and put in to motion amazingly well. Simply put, the movement that you imagine while reading a graphic novel is realized here with startling accuracy.<br/><br/>Also good are those historical liberties. I know I said that they are bad a paragraph back, but these liberties do serve a critical purpose. The idealistic portrayal of the Spartans and the monstrous portrayal of the Persians is the result of one key thing: the story is told from the point of view of a Spartan soldier. Thus, of course, he will praise his brothers in arms and the people listening (other Spartans) will be pleased to hear that their king defended their land. Whether this is nationalistic and fascist propaganda or the stuff that legends are made of is ultimately your call. It can be seen both ways. If you watch ""300"" with historical context in mind (and are annoyed at all the inaccuracies) you'll see it as militaristic propaganda with disposable heroes. However, if you watch the film as a fantasy that shows sacrifice and honor you'll see it as a legend being born with heroes that are sure to be praised in the generations to come. --- 8/10<br/><br/>Rated R for violence and sexual content.

","Clearly the most popular R-rated flick of 2007, 300 proved to be one of the biggest hits of the year as well as a definite career booster for stars Gerard Butler and Lena Headey and director Zack Snyder. In less than twelve months, the sword-and-sandals epic has already cemented a place in modern day pop culture. It's not very hard to see why the picture became a monster hit. For starters, it was based on a popular graphic novel from Frank Miller, a name that became mainstream once the Sin City movie proved golden at the box office a few years ago. Plus, the fact that R-rated action films (or any R-rated films) are getting harder and harder to come by definitely got a few more people into the theater. Perhaps the biggest reason the theaters filled up for 300 were the visuals. Visually, 300 is ground-breaking. It may look similar in some ways to Sin City, but this is much more fascinating and colorful to look at. Judging from a visual standpoint, 300 is practically perfect. Unfortunately, from a writing standpoint, there is a lot left to be desired. The changes made to Miller's graphic novel were unnecessary and mostly completely gratuitous. The dialog, whether intentional or not, is extremely cheesy, taking away any emotional impact from scenes that are supposed to be dramatic. While the ineptness of some of the writing makes for a fun viewing, it doesn't provide the audience with strong characters. That said, 300 isn't a complete failure. It's just not a particularly good movie, certainly not deserving of the 8.0 IMDb rating it currently holds, especially with all the unintentional comedy (""This is Sparta"" always get a huge laugh in addition to cheers. 5/10"

","300 is in short, an epic. It may be a Graphic Novel/Comic Book turned into an epic, but it's a modern day epic for sure. While some of the critics find it hard to enjoy the film as its action movie plot and criticise the ""lack"" of acting, plot and superb dialogue. It is still nevertheless an epic.<br/><br/>Many viewers find it hard to see through all the muscle to see the acting, but it's all there.<br/><br/>The Plot is relatively simple and while the film isn't a high class film, it suits it's story through brilliance in simplicity. Just three hundred of the worlds best soldiers go to defend their democratic-country against one of the largest armies ever seen and do a brilliant job at it. So it's no surprise that the film is filled to the brim with blood, with slow motion ""speed ramped"" flying bodies, heads, legs, arms and other flying limb's goodness for a good portion of the film. Luckily this doesn't get too repetitive and the film ends before the audience puts up peace-banners and screams ""stop the fighting!"".<br/><br/>However, obviously some people think otherwise and say it's a terrible film that has too much fighting in it and is terrible, with bad acting, a simple plot, and is made for a MTV-crowd audience. I wonder what these people thought that the film would be like when it was made about the battle of Thermopylae and 300 Spartans in war. But for the story the film has the perfect amount of action.<br/><br/>As 300 is made from the graphic novel ""300"" by frank miller, it's no surprise there's a fantastic amount of detail and the shots are all carefully placed to mimic the graphic novel. The contrast is upped so the film has a golden dusted look that makes the whole film shine and the near royal red spartan cloak stand out fabulously on film.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, that's all thats left in interest of the film, the dialogue and epic speeches are great too, but only the first time you hear them with a great sound system.<br/><br/>But that doesn't mean the film isn't fantastically entertaining, amusing and a visual work of art.<br/><br/>I give it 8 out of ten, it's not Gladiator, but it's fabulously entertaining for what it is."
"thebengalimafia-1","10","0","2","20 December 2007"," One of the Year's Best!
","300 is one of those movies that's everything you've seen before mixed with everything you haven't. Yes, it's a swords and sandals film. But this is no ordinary swords and sandals film. We're not talking about Brad Pitt looking for excuses to take his clothes off, here that's almost apart of the narrative. Yes, there are larger than life battles, but the unique visual approach to this film makes it so much more than Gladiator. Inspired by Frank Miller's coffee table graphic novel of the same name, 300 is a unique blend of fact and fiction, of terrific acting and top notch action, and don't forget the look of the film, which makes you feel like you're inside the comic book.<br/><br/>Faced with slavery and the destruction of his country, Spartan King Leonidas (Gerard Butler) takes 300 of his best to fight against a million soldiers of the Persian Empire. The story was simple enough, and if you saw The Last Samurai then you know how the movie ends. As it turns out, Leonidas has to fight the battle on two fronts. He's facing off with the forces of Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro) and at home, his Queen (Lena Heady) is fighting to send Sparta's army to help Leonidas. The queen has an up hill batter in getting the council (a room full of old fat men) to send the troops to aid the king. There's a nice balance of Leonidas' fight against the Persians and everything the queen does to help him.<br/><br/>What made this film unique was the look and feel of it. Every frame is touched up and colored in some way. The Persians wear clothes and armor that belong in a costume drama meant for the stage. And the prosthetics mixed with CGI gives us some of the most hideous monsters ever to grace the silver screen. And let's not forget, the sword fight scenes between Leonidas' 300 and the forces of Xerxes. Some of them seem to be uncut for extended periods of time but I'm sure there are probably a few well hidden cuts in those battle sequences.<br/><br/>Some of the films controversy is not without reason and it becomes quite obvious how the narrative could be read through a modern lens and pinned on the socio political context of the world today. The Spartans represent the United States and the Persians represent, well, Persians. Leonidas has a considerable amount of dialogue where he tells the Spartans they are fighting for freedom; fighting against tyranny. The actual portrayal of the Persians is anything but accurate. The only ""Persian looking"" actor in the entire film is in fact, Arab. The Persians and Xerxes forces seem to be a combination of African, Asian, and Middle Eastern stereotypes all put together for the sake of the film. I know that no one goes to movies like 300 for the educational value, but the point is, this is one of the year's most watched films. Sadly though, media stereotypes are what people use to educate themselves these days. I've been saying lately that many people's source of education about the world outside America is mass media and Wikipedia, neither of which paints a very accurate picture.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, this is a great movie. Gerard Butler's portrayal of King Leonidas is incredibly idealistic while Leonidas is borderline insane. The pacing of the film was great, and the ominous intro about Spartan warrior culture leads us into a spectacular movie. This is one of the year's best films!"

","This movie was pretty much what I expected. The story is rather thin, but the main attractions of the movie are the fighting scenes and the style. For most of the movie the pieces fall together pretty well, although I'm not too fond of David Wenham, who did his part in LotR pretty well, but just doesn't seem to be a good ""Spartan"". His voice lacks the power you'd wish in a storyteller. Gerard Butler fits his role and really seems to have a good time playing Leonidas. There are a little too many slow-motion shots if you ask me, but in general the fighting scenes are awesome. It's not much of an epic movie, you can't compare it to Troy, people who expect epic and huge battles will be disappointed."

","That is a good question to ask any one and I think that it is a little overrated. When I first heard about this movie I was in big battle films and loved that kinda action so I just had to see this movie. This movie around right around my birthday and that made it more special that I had a choice what me and my family do for my birthday and we saw 300. This was a great a 10! But after a while this movie started to get kind old really fast. But I must say that this film has one of the best direction of all time and it being by Zach Snyder, he should get an Oscar nomination. The acting was better good and the special effects and the cinematography was just superb and should get an Oscar nomination. The bad thing about this movie that it had to much things from the graphic novel and strand why to far from the actual history, also the film had some very strange things in it that were not needed at all. The thing that really didn't like about this movie that it had kinda of a bad storyline and it ended quite poorly. The film would always switch from the battle to the city at the worst timing and just got me out of the battle and then straight to city life and just would always destroy any mood. The only thing that saved this movie was the superb directing and some of the greatest film battles of all time. This was a somewhat a great movie and kinda surprise the it is not in the top 250."

The acting was overall convincing, but a lot of the dialouges seemed a little out of place and forced into the movie in a bad way to explain events and relations. I really found myself bored with the main plot and I know that it is derived from supposedly historical events and I can't really put my finger on exactly what makes it uninteresting but I think the plot could've been tweaked just a bit more since it's not that historically accurate to begin with. HOWEVER, the battle scenes in this movie, Leonidas' speeches and everything connected to them is absolutely fantastic, just top of the line.<br/><br/>I would definitely recommend that you go see this movie, the plot is OK, the acting is good and the battle scenes are without a doubt the best ever made bar none."
"im_veritas_photo","8","0","1","3 November 2007"," Great Graphic Novel Adaptation, But the Director Did NOT Really Hang the Moon
","I thoroughly enjoyed watching ""300,"" acknowledging all the while that it is a graphic novel (a.k.a. Comic Book) by Frank Miller, brought to the silver screen, albeit, apparently, fairly faithfully.<br/><br/>Even though the film ""300"" contains little that is truly historical fact, and much that is completely outrageous fiction arising directly from insanely fevered ""graphical imaginations,"" it is, nonetheless, quite inspiring. One fine example of a fevered vision in the film: The Uber-Immortal! Watch for him!<br/><br/>And yet, despite all that, this film made my heart fill with real admiration for those 300 Spartans who defied Xerxes at Thermopylae (480 BC), only to die in glory there. If your heart does not react in this way, then you are letting your preconceptions get in the way of enjoying life.<br/><br/>Did you know that, when the body of the Spartan King Leonidas was recovered by the Persians, their King Xerxes, in an uncontrollable rage, ordered the head cut off and the body crucified...? Xerxes the Great reigned for 15 years more. It was not until 40 years after the battle that Leonidas' bones were exhumed and returned to Sparta, where he was buried again with full honors. Afterward, funeral games were held every year in his memory. None of this appears in the film... <br/><br/>The acting is Over-The-Top Fine (because it deserves to be over the top). But this film is completely unlike, and so much better than, the laughably despicable 1962 flick ""The 300 Spartans"" (see my review, or rather total pan, elsewhere)...<br/><br/>Now let us discuss the sickening display of self-aggrandizing hubris (a good ancient Greek word, so useful here) brought forth by the Director. I am quite sorry I listened to that special audio track; it has caused me to seriously lower my rating of the film, and has reduced my enjoyment and admiration of it, even though the final result would have been close to tops without hearing it.<br/><br/>Yet there it is, a Director's track, like so many disgusting Director's tracks on DVD, arrogantly ignoring the real need of the audience to learn how such a film is made. He describes each scene in gratuitous, needless detail, using insider-terms and unfathomable acronyms which few outside Hollywood can understand. Nor need they understand them! He could have said one line: ""Most of the stuff you see in this film, as is only to be expected for a film made from a comic book, was painted in using computer graphics."" And then he could have given praise-worthy details about the actual actors and real people who helped him make the film we see. But, for the most part, he doesn't. One acceptable detail: the ""Crazy-Horse"" three-camera method of slow-and-fast-motion zooms; this was cool. But honor here should go to the Director of Photography, I'm sure. So, in my opinion (the only one that really matters in this case), this Director's track stinks to high heaven. He is definitely NOT the guiding genius he would have us believe... That title belongs only to the creator of the graphic novel, Frank Miller.<br/><br/>My heartfelt advice: See ""300,"" you should enjoy it... And skip almost everything the Director has to say."

Portraying Spartans as fearless, free, supermen, Frank Miller has one large imagination that so far has suited the green, uh, silver screen very well. Of course, plenty of blood and gore litter this over-stylized Battle of Thermopylae, but Miller's imagination is not without some fantastic views on Xerxes, his Immortals, the traitor Ephialtes, the Ephors and the Oracle among others.<br/><br/>A messenger convoy from Persia to Sparta brings word that their king Xerxes comes for earth and water. The king doesn't buy it, or any doomsday prophecies for that matter, and enlists the best 300 soldiers to meet up with other Greeks to confront with Xerxes at the ""Hot Gates.""<br/><br/>300 could appeal to any inner comic book fan. Comic books have always had a faithful following in movies and 300 is an easy example as to why the genre will continue to remain strong. Making history look sharp and cool, no matter how silly the script, props or choreography, will sell. The impressive post-production made an entire film set on a green screen backdrop into a rugged, dark and gory terrain. That in itself deserves notice."

","For my ninth review for IMDb (this includes ones that weren't posted), I'll tackle the smash hit film ""300"". I was looking forward to this film quite a bit, and fortunately it didn't disappoint me.<br/><br/>The Positives: -The film looks drop dead gorgeous. I just can't describe with words how stunning this film looks. Like Frank Miller's ""Sin City"", the frames of this film look like they were ripped right from the comic book. -The battle scenes (which take up most of the film's second half) are great, as they're both stylish and entertaining to watch. The final one is actually moving, as the 300 Spartans sacrifice their lives. -The acting is solid, even when the dialogue isn't (though that's not too often). Gerard Butler and Lena Headey stand out the most, and Rodrigo Santoro makes an effective Xerxes.<br/><br/>The Negatives: -The plot is very simplistic, and we know from the beginning that the 300 Spartans die. However, it doesn't seem as if the film needs a more complex plot, and the graphic novel had a simple plot to begin with, so I'm not going to be overly harsh about that. -Like the graphic novel, historical accuracy is thrown out the window, so don't be surprised when you see rhinos, giant elephants, and the uber immortal.<br/><br/>My 3 choice words: Beautiful, Bloody, Abmazing"
"PaulLondon","6","0","1","7 October 2007"," War as visual spectacle
","This visually arresting and very enjoyable adaptation of Miller's graphic novel about the Spartans' stand against the invading Persian armies is a lot of fun, even though plot and characterisation take third seat to visual spectacle and sound design (this is one of those films were a spear won't clatter to the ground when a speaker-blasting BOOM will do!) The look of the film is great - steely cold blues and greys dominate (even though we are told it is August in Greece) - and helps compensate for some melodramatic acting and lack of plotting. At times the film teeters on the verge of camp and there is no denying the homo-erotic element of the film, but, overall, this is a straight forward fantasy/actioner which will have wide appeal.<br/><br/>Although it is based on a graphic novel with its endless parade of eye-popping battle scenes the film seems more like a hi-tech video game bought to the screen, but, again, the sheer visual power of the piece ensures that you hardly notice the lack of structured plot."

Makeup was very nice as well the immortals were dressed as The Masque of the Red Death by Edgar Allen Poe, dressed with mystery. <br/><br/>All in all, a good action film, when there was a drought of good action films, with a weak plot"
"maatmouse","7","0","1","6 October 2007"," Historically inaccurate but looks really good
","What an extraordinary looking film! When I saw the trailer for 300, I was amazed at what a 'look' had been achieved. And then there were the battle scenes. Wow! 300 recalls the Spartan battling the Persians at Thermopylae. Xerxes the Persian King moves towards Greece with an army counting thousands and comes across, probably one of the harshest regimented armies in the ancient world. Not for nothing is the term 'Spartan' used to describe harsh conditions.<br/><br/>300 is stylised storytelling. It is not historically accurate. The Spartans fought with far more armour instead of the almost naked soldiers in the film, the Persian king Xerxes did not have numerous facial piercings and a bald head (although he probably had very eyelined eyes) and his women probably didn't sport nipple rings either. But then, who really watches these films for historical accuracy? Very few. If you want historical accuracy, then watch any of the documentaries on the History Channel or read Greek and Roman historical accounts of the Spartan way of life.<br/><br/>Gerald Butler not only looks the part but acts it as well, taking to his role as Leonidas with relish. David Wenham, whose distinct voice also provides a kind of 'storytelling commentary' also acts and fights very well. Lena Headey and others give remarkable performances.<br/><br/>But the star of the film is whoever provided the movie with its fascinating 'look'. Swopping the usual epic look which is reserved for films such as Troy and Gladiator, 300 has, instead, gone for a very dreamlike visual with careful slowing down and stop-motion style editing in the battle sequences which owe something to The House of Flying Daggers style employed by Zhang Yimou and his other film, Hero.<br/><br/>All in all, a visual treat and an extraordinary telling of an ancient tale. With embellishments."
"dunk_2001","9","0","1","26 September 2007"," 300 Strong: From Comic to Film
","For centuries, story-telling has provided an imaginative portal into past cultures. Whether they're pictures on cave walls or just tales around a campfire, stories assure that an event is remembered. Frank Miller, for example, published a graphic novel to portray his take on an important piece of history, the Battle of Thermopylae. The book tells the tale of three hundred fearless Spartans along with other Greeks who fought for freedom in the face of tyranny. Taught never to retreat, the Spartans and their king, Leonidas, were forced to defend their homeland from the annihilation of King Xerxes and the abundant Persian army. Zack Snyder, director of ""Dawn of the Dead"" (2004), brings Miller's vision to life with his adaptation of the comic ""300"".<br/><br/>In this particular work, Miller displays his fine ability to tell a story. He uses a dynamic, over-exaggerated style to make every moment seem dramatic. The graphic novel is not necessarily accurate, but instead focuses on getting across the main ideals of the tale. This story is all about standing up for what one believes in even against impossible odds. The film, on the other hand, refers directly to the novel with the exception of a few changes. The script is almost word for word, and at times it seems as if the book is simply coming to life right on the screen. Snyder wanted the film to represent Miller's comic with his own aesthetic and imagination filling in the holes.<br/><br/>If anyone knows how to tell a story, it would be Frank Miller. For example, Leonidas and the wolf in the beginning of the movie may not be historically accurate but it displays Leonidas's strength and ability as a king and a warrior. Each of the graphic novel's pages have beautifully drawn pictures of what Miller envisioned, and the reader can make up the rest. It's really interesting to read the comic and see the movie. It's a completely different experience. The novel lets the reader think of what comes in between scenes, while the movie just shows each scene. The movie, however, does do a fantastic job at not only adapting the comic to film, but using a very stylized and modern technique. Snyder has really changed film-making with his effective use of breathtaking backdrops, unique color patterns, grotesquely choreographed action scenes, and fast and slow motion throughout ""300"". The only difference between the movie and the novel is the role of women which involves Queen Gorgo and the politics in Sparta. In my opinion, the reason for this was Frank Miller's desire to focus on the Battle of Thermopylae. Zack Snyder believed that this addition to the movie would beef up the plot.<br/><br/>Regardless, whether they are boldly dynamic or modernized, stylized cinematics or spreads of art, Frank Miller's novel and Zack Snyder's film both effectively tell the inspiringly true tale of three hundred men believing in something right, and they will be remembered for centuries to come."

","""300"" provides a highly imaginative depiction of the battle at Thermopylae. The film outlines the story of the 300 Spartans who held the pass to the end until overwhelmed by the Persians (and a little Greek treachery to boot!) The film is visually stunning and is certainly worth viewing if you are a fan of great visuals. You must keep in mind when viewing this film that this is actually a fantasy version of the events at Themopylae. The Spartans are depicted as maniacal supermen who disdain all the other Greeks and the Persians even more. I think this is carried too far, since the Spartan only comprised a small portion of the total Greek forces in the original battle. However, the Spartans did go down fighting (with the Thebans and some others). I'm sure this film is very popular in today's Sparta. But I'm sure it ticks off most of the rest of Greece!"

(It also failed to annoy and offend me, if that was the intention of its makers! OK, it did cause me to react and write this down though.)<br/><br/>If one is so in love with the business of film-making that one is ready to do anything for it at any costs then one could as well try making some ""decent and humble"" porn you know, without having to stress so stubbornly on history and cultures of the past or present in the name of comic and entertainment. Porn can be ""entertaining"" also, educational even, and it makes good money too! (Or does it these days with 'so many hands in the business' on the Internet?)<br/><br/>Curiously, as a hard to impress Persian who had lost his trust and liking in his own country and culture for a long time, I have to admit now that I am a little bit moved if not impressed! I think I have to review my opinion about my homeland as well as the entire area of the Middle East.<br/><br/>Yes, I know, this is not a historical movie, only a famous and successful comic story turned into a mediocre film, for entertainment purposes alone, but please, you are using actual historical figures, names and events in the movie, which is fine but then you are also demonetizing certain characters in the story while turning certain other ones into super-human divine beings in a 'fun movie' that is not supposed to be very serious. But you are doing it very seriously!<br/><br/>As for the sfx of this movie, contrary to all remarks (negative or positive) made about this movie that nonetheless admired its CGI and technique, I should say, ""good, but I've seen better indeed!""<br/><br/>Why do Persians in the movie dress in a way that resembles Arabs? Nothing wrong with Arabs as a great nation in their own right (and in olden times, an ally of Persians or other nations in hard times too once in a while) but comparing any nation to another in a clumsy way, and to undermine one or the other in such a manner as this one is an insult to both!<br/><br/>The depiction of Xerxes as a nine-foot tall (eight and three-quarters to be exact!) monster yet an androgyny super-human figure, to probably de-humanize him rather than to deliver a godly shape, although a little bit too harsh, it seems not so far from a symbolic representation of a non-democratic Eastern state headed by some 'un-manly' and autocratic sovereignty. But as some others have put it so rightly too, and this movie also does it, the more democratic Western states in comparison, have not been doing any better!<br/><br/>Something that even many Persians and Easterners fail to understand about God-Kings of the Achamenid dynasty (to which Xerxes belonged also) is their 'inner goal of attaining a state of asexuality' so to say. This is probably what the makers of this movie also failed to realize although they somehow did manage to transfer the image in so bizarre a manner no matter how unsuccessful they were at delivering the original idea.<br/><br/>Now, something we know as ""mysticism"", which might as well have been a 'gift' going from the West to the East (Plato?) and not vice versa in those times, being kind of ridiculed and even hated in so bizarre a manner in this movie, is something that calls for a deeper digging by psychology and sociology scholars as well as other experts in related fields.<br/><br/>Not very much by contrast to how Xerxes is pictured as an other-worldly demonic figure in the movie 300, King Leonidas personae and looks resembles more an Arab Muslim rebel from the brutal Palestinian Hamas or savage Iranian (Persian) Hizbollahy forces or a desperate Iraqi insurgent (albeit for a rather handsome one one has to admit!) rather than a brave and self-sacrificing Westerner Spartan who cares so much about democracy and freedom that commits an undemocratic and most politically incorrect act of pushing the delegates from a potentially dangerous and enemy country into the well just because ""his queen, his wife, his love,"" nod-approves him to do so! <br/><br/>There have been Greek guys who did not like the movie and felt offended in more than one way! There are people from other nations too who did not like this movie at all. Just check their comments on this very list.<br/><br/>Check this link, and other posted short videos by some Greek and Persians on some YouTube pages or elsewhere:<br/><br/>Greek Answer to Hollywood nuts (300 the movie)! http://ie.youtube.com/watch?v=FhOXOnEqWdY<br/><br/>Or check this one too; only please forgive the rather poor English used in it:<br/><br/>330-movie, With respect to my Greek friends ¬ñ This is Persia! http://ie.youtube.com/watch?v=FhOXOnEqWdY<br/><br/>Perhaps this would be worth a mentioning in here too:<br/><br/>Last Stand of the 300 http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0892737/<br/><br/>For the worth of it, Xerxes attack on Greece and the West was a big mistake on the Persians behalf since day one anyway and eventually they had to undergo a great defeat paying for their own mistake.

It makes you want to pause the film a lot as almost every scene is an artistic masterpiece.<br/><br/>As far as directing & acting goes, everything was solid and where it should have been. Casting was solid, and all actors/actresses played their parts very well. The dialogue, while some say it was ""lacking"", was to the point, and the cloudy ""haze"" of attempts to make accurate recreations of language & dialog from that time period were left behind...which is extremely refreshing and only further made the movie an enjoyable experience.<br/><br/>Fans of films like Braveheart should definitely not miss this film. However, the film has much to be appreciated by all tastes in film."
"dfranzen70","8","0","1","26 August 2007"," Cry ""Havoc"" and watch this film of war
","Remember those commercials for the US Marines, wherein some ripped young recruit is climbing a mountain, and then he almost falls as he reaches the summit, so he reaches out with a muscular arm and, gritting his teeth and emitting some sort of war cry, he reaches for the mountain and hoists himself up? That's sort of how the entire two hours of 300: men screaming as they stab, fillet, garrote, gut, and impale their enemies on pointy things. It takes two hours because there are so many enemies, and because they're using spears and swords instead of guns.<br/><br/>300 is loosely based on a real-life event, the 480 BC defense by a small band of Spartan soldiers of their homeland from a marauding Persian army, led by Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro). The movie is more directly based on Frank Miller's graphic novel about the battle itself, so some liberties are taken, but more importantly the use of the comic as the basis allows the blood and gore to be shown in an almost-surrealistic format, thus enabling the normal (read: not bloodthirsty) viewer to enjoy the film without feeling guilt at seeing so much mayhem.<br/><br/>King Leonidas (Gerard Butler) has a tough decision to make. An emissary from Xerxes meets him and tells him that Sparta must bend its knee to its new ruler. Leonidas will have none of this, and soon the messenger and his companions are thrown down a deep pit. Okay, that was an easy decision. Now Leonidas must decide whether to wait for Xerxes' army or to take the fight to the edge of the sea, meeting the enemy there. The trouble is, Sparta is a society with touches of democracy: in order to go to war, Leonidas must get approval from the Council, which isn't inclined to give it. This does not stop our hero-king.<br/><br/>The last time I saw an adaptation of a Frank Miller graphic novel, I was extremely unimpressed - Sin City, I thought, was terrible both technically and creatively. But 300 is different; the blood, which is omnipresent, is stylized, wonderfully imagined, and incredibly detailed, even on a ten-year-old, 27-inch TV set. You can literally see individual drops of blood as they fall from each wound! Some of you are already shaking your heads - ""Um, that's not a good thing, seeing that!"" - but you're wrong! Or, you're not wrong, just not the intended audience for 300. The movie, particularly the battle scenes, can be best compared to the fight scene in Kill Bill Vol. 1 in which Uma Thurman takes on the Crazy 88. In that scene, Thurman's Beatrice slices and dices through minions after minions, lopping off limbs with aplomb; it's much the same here in 300, and in each scene the violence is raised (or lowered) to an appropriate cartoonish level.<br/><br/>Butler gives a truly commanding performance - perhaps on par with Russell Crowe's turn as Maximus in Gladiator or Mel Gibson's in Braveheart, a true, fearless leader who is well prepared to die to save his country and his land. Leonidas is terrifyingly strong and courageous, an imposing figure even in the eyes of Xerxes, who fancies himself a king-god (at the time, the Persian army was the largest in the world). Leonidas must inspire his countrymen not only to fight for their families and homes but also to follow him to their certain deaths. I mean, come on - 300 soldiers against tens of thousands? It's not an obvious victory. Butler is truly up to the test as the tenacious warrior king, a man who would rather die than be subjugated - a fact that eludes Xerxes until the battles are nearly over.<br/><br/>On one level, too, this is a chick flick. I mean, every male actor is bare chested, and he's totally cut. (The actors had to work out using some pretty intense, tortuous methods to get those six-pack abs.) So if you're of the female persuasion and like well-built men, this is a movie for you. Sure, they stab each other a lot, so that might put you off, but look! Half-naked men! You gotta love that, right? And for the men, there's sweet, sweet death of numerous characters, some named, mostly not. In fact, according to IMDb, 585 deaths occur in the movie! Sweet indeed.<br/><br/>While Leonidas and his 300 battle to the death, a battle of words takes place back at home. Queen Gorgo (Lena Headey) tries valiantly to persuade the Council to send the full Spartan army - Leonidas wasn't permitted to take them, obviously, since the Council hadn't granted permission for war - to help back up their king. To do this, she must work her way around the conniving Theron (Dominic West, who looks a lot like Harry Hamlin and acts like Han Solo gone way bad). And that's fun and all, and Headey is wonderful - and gorgeous and wise - but thankfully these scenes are short and small in number. The battle scenes are the real draw! HA-OH! Although the violence may turn some people off, those who like that sort of thing will be enthralled at its exquisite detail and poetic beauty. Butler is so superb, you want to leap into your TV and follow him to the ends of the Earth."
"blakinsey","8","0","3","22 August 2007"," An amazing movie
","As many can tell from the previews, 300, is a stylish epic/action movie whose imagery is unique and breathtaking. I will start by saying that this movie is not completely historically accurate. For the most part spartan customs are portrayed accurately. However the number of Persians that the 300 soldiers fought was not one million. It was approximately 250,000 according to historians. Therefore, those who are not open to variation of historical fact should not see this movie. Also, the controversial depiction of Persians as deformed and ugly people is due to the fact that the story is told from the perspective of a Spartan.<br/><br/>With that said, 300 is a masterpiece in many other ways. The plot revolves around Greek King Leonidas's last stand against an approaching Persian army. Due to the fact that an ongoing Greek festival prevents him from sending an army Leonidas is accompanied only by a small army of Sparta's finest warriors. The movie also cuts to scenes with Leonidas's wife, Gorgo, attempting to persuade the senate to send more soldiers to aid Leonidas.<br/><br/>The imagery is probably the best point of this movie, where CGI is used to render backgrounds into unnatural shades of orange and brown. The action sequences compliment the imagery well and utilize large amounts of slow motion. Many people may say that the slow motion is excessive but I believe that it helps to create clear and artistic battle sequences. For example, 300 is one of the few epics where every slice of a sword, throw of a spear etc is uncensored and easy to discern. 300 fully utilizes its R-rating to show imagery that Troy and Alexander did not.<br/><br/>The acting is superb, especially from Gerard Butler(Leonidas). He manages to be a caring father and husband as well as a fierce leader. I have heard people say that there is too much yelling from Leonidas, however, if those people paid more attention they would realize that Leonidas only yells when he is on the battlefield.<br/><br/>I must admit that certain lines in the dialogue could have been improved. Also, there was nudity and sexual scenes in this movie that I thought could have been toned down. By that, I mean that the nudity or sexual scenes were sometimes unnecessary and didn't add that much to the story. Some of those who have seen the sex scene between Leonidas and Gorgo may agree with me when I say that it dragged on for too long and could have been less explicit."

","I believe this movie to be something that you would either love or hate. No in between.<br/><br/>First of all, the acting was brilliantly done, beautiful cinematography and the dialogue was...wow (for lack of a better word)<br/><br/>Gerard Butler made it believable that he was a true leader in the film and his Queen was a true feminist. With her witty remarks to her unpredictable actions...she kept you wondering.<br/><br/>The narration was very well done, and throughout the film it was as though you were taking the same journey every Spartan man went through.<br/><br/>The bad side of this film is that the nudity was sometimes offending, but one would have to consider that that is how it was in those times. With the Oracle girl (who actually brought tears to my eyes due to the fact that she was held there against her will by the Ephors), or Xerxes' women.

"tenthousandtattoos","7","0","1","21 August 2007"," A LEGEND, a MYTH, a bedtime story Spartans told their children
","Wow was I hesitant to see this film after reading the pretty much 50/50 split of people on here who loved/hated it! Despite all that, I managed to go into it with NO expectations whatsoever. And lo and behold, I am now firmly entrenched in the ""This...is...SPARTA!"" camp on this one...while not a fantastic, nor great film, it is certainly worthy of the praise it has received and absolutely UNdeserving of being called a ""racist"" movie, or a ""US army recruitment film"" or in any way degrading or insulting to modern-day descendents of ancient Persians. Um...it's a dumb action movie...get over it! In theory, the historical truth of the tale of the 300 Spartans is very exciting, however translated to film, the Battle of Thermopylae would be...in a word...BORING.<br/><br/>Hence the artistic licence taken here. C'mon, would you really sit there watching wave after wave of Persians assault an impenetrable line of Spartan shields and spear points? Coz guess what? That's what ACTUALLY happened at Thermopylae for the first 2 days...Xerxes just kept sending troops against the Spartan phalanx, each unit meeting the same fate as the one before it. That's a valiant and effective defence...but would make for an incredibly dull film.<br/><br/>We must also remember that this ENTIRE movie (besides the first 2 and last 2 minutes) is NARRATED by a SPARTAN, so of course he's going to embellish and exaggerate, he is, after all, giving a speech to men about to go into battle. What better way to inspire them than with the story of their great fallen King Leonidas? Thus, this film is NOT an historical epic (nevermind that it NEVER claims to be, you lefty weirdos) but a LEGEND, a MYTH, an epic bedtime story that Spartans tell their kids...<br/><br/>Only ONE MASSIVE PLOT HOLE bothered me...and that is, why on Earth would you insult someone who could (and actually DID) tell the enemy a way to totally surround and thus annihilate your forces? I could not forgive the character of Leonidas for that...it was plain IDIOCY. It was OBVIOUS what Ephialtes was gonna do! But...moving on...<br/><br/>The film is nothing short of a visual feast, it's stunning. I'm a big fan of ""battle movies"" but this came very clsoe to blowing me away. I only wish there had of been more ""big battles""...for instance the one at the end...where we see 10,000 Spartans gathered...what a bloodbath that battle would have been...anyway...I'll stop rubbing my hands together with macabre glee and get on with typing now... I'm also not a great fan of over-use of CGI, but here it is used almost entirely, which means that I was able to see this movie pretty much as an animated battle film with some live actors in the main parts, coz that's technically what it is. I think 90% of it was shot in a green/blue screen studio. But so what? As LOTR demonstrated, CGI, when used WELL, is a fantastic tool to tell ""BIG"" stories that otherwise would not be practical to put up on screen.<br/><br/>Now to the cons...and there is a few unfortunately...the first being that moment of stupidity on the part of Leonidas in refusing to at least let Ephialtes ""tag along""...or maybe kill him...ANYTHING to keep him away from the Persians, you idiots. This made it damn near impossible to feel any sympathy when - shock horror - Ephialtes defects to the Persian side and the ""300"" are surrounded and wiped out. In fact (and I'll be unpopular in this view no doubt) I was cheering for the Persians from the get go, not just because I know they win...but because aside from Gerard Butler's and David Wenham's characters, the Spartans were a pack of forgettables who wouldn't be out of place as extras on Baywatch. The Persians also looked heaps cooler (those flowing robes, and the shiny face masks of the Immortals...beautifully-realised characters all, and heaps cooler-looking than buff dudes in red capes and sandals, although the Spartan phalanx scene looked really good, I must admit. As a whole, I cannot fault the film for visuals...every scene is a work of art. Story-wise it could have been heaps better, historically it's pretty inaccurate and omits a lot. But hey, for a big-budget spectacle action film, it certainly fires on all cylinders, and it's certainly one I'll be viewing again."

","A long time ago, on a continent far, far away, 300 (give or take) Spartans held off the advances of the invading Persian army. They did this by choosing to make their stand at Thermopylae (the Gates of Fire), which channeled the Persian army into anarrow, more manageable form. The efforts and sacrifices that the real 300 made WERE heroic, selfless, eternal, and all the other larger-than-life concepts that this movie is not.<br/><br/>That's not to say that I didn't enjoy it, cuz I did. It was several hours of beautiful, well-done, empty distraction, which made me appreciate my home theater setup. It's just a shame that they took something that really IS great, and turned it into something that is satisfied by telling you how great it is. It's a lot like comparing the great pyramid of Giza, with the Luxor casino in Vegas. It just feels like a cheap (while still completely enjoyable) knockoff instead of a tribute or homage. Read Steven Pressfield's ""Gates of Fire"" for the real(er) thing."

","The one thing that will grab you from the start of ""300"" is that it is visually stunning in telling it's graphic tale. There's no way around how amazed you'll be at this interpretation of the battle. Then there is the story. A story that is left up to you to interpret whether these 300 Spartans were brave or just plain idiots to put their lives out in that way under their King. These warriors and their King were indeed products of their lives and environments - and this is a theme that is being told time and time again...without much new spin on it. That's the ideal of this film and a good one to observe at that.<br/><br/>Much is being aid about ""eeeing the film, but in listening to the film, you are told a tale - a historical tale - but instead of the ""usual filming"" that accompanies things of this nature, I was treated to a fascinating piece of art, ballet, music, strength. That is what makes this film heads above the rest in a graphic telling of a tale you know would not have the positive of endings - but an interpretation of what one thought might have been within the tale. And it was visually stunning of a feat to tell. I picked up very important details in this battle that fit the ""time"" - primitive weapons (to our standards of today) but used skillfully and well and choreographed in a way on screen where you knew that's all these weapons could do in the battle situations presented. These were men who were born to die, so to speak and they knew their call. Frank Miller gives you his perspective of how graphically he envisioned such a tale.<br/><br/>""300"" isn't for everyone, and this graphic telling may have many cringe - but if you do watch, you cannot escape how visually stunning it is, how artful it has been done and how people will do what they need to do to save themselves, those they love - while others will do anything to be superior, take over everything and be more than what they think they are for fame, identification and power."

You just never get the attachment to the characters like you do in Gladiator or Saving Private Ryan. Both of those stories have a similar story line. The story is there, but the movie just doesn't get you there. Yet, it is not a bad movie. The movie has all the ingredients; it just doesn't mix them properly. The story is certainly an epic, the actors are good, and I remember being in awe of the stories about the Spartans as a kid in 7th or 8th grade when I read about them.

","I saw this on hi-definition Blu-Ray disc and probably had a better experience than I would have done in a full-scale cinema. The disc reproduces the intentions seemingly perfectly - it has a luscious strip-cartoon-ish, almost video-game look, and grain, black crush and bronzing of colours are there when they should be. If you take the story on its own premises then you couldn't fault the visual rendition of it here. <br/><br/>The soundtrack is equally good. I listened in DD 5.1. The full surround is made use of almost constantly and effectively. Low bass is used when appropriate. One caveat: since the whole thing is processed or coloured in an artificial way in order to convey the spirit of the source, it is important to resist the temptation to twiddle with your projector or TV settings. <br/><br/>I'd call it demo material for hi-def across the full AV spectrum, though I wouldn't choose it as the only material because of its relatively extreme aesthetic and look. It's a fine example of a film that deserves a big screen and full-on AV system to convey its epic scale."

","The Battle of Thermopylae was the basis for this film, but more accurately, as some have so emphatically pointed out, it was Frank Miller's fictionalized graphic novel that provided inspiration. The film has drawn flak for its supposedly racial bias against the Persians, although I don't see what the strum and drang is all about. There aren't any Persians in this millennium to speak of, at least not as portrayed in the movie. Today they are called Iranians. Do you see any nose-ringed, bodily-pierced,almost-naked Iranian running around (or aloft in golden thrones carried by cowering slaves) claiming to be a god-king and ruler of the world? Do you see a vast number of armed men wearing iron masks and call themselves the Immortals? Its a historical piece, people, and back then the lands of the Greeks were most coveted by almost any marauding tyrant for their verdant and fertile fields. That's why the Spartans were created. Their country lived under the constant threat of war. What would you do but create the most efficient, fearless and unyielding army no one dare have the misfortune of crossing? I have no beef with filmmakers who take a few liberties with factual or historical portrayals, even in the most blatant sins of commissions (Genghis Khan=John Wayne??), or portray several races as they were then, political correctness be damned, so as to induce in his audience the coveted ""suspension of disbelief"" experience.<br/><br/>But on the merits of a film, on the storytelling side of any movie you decide to spend time watching, there is a tacit agreement I believe is inviolable. When a filmmaker convinces you before you seat yourself in front of a screen, by media hype or some well-edited trailer, that he has a story to tell, you ALWAYS hope its good.Entertaining.Engaging. Or at least disturbing enough you want to scream about it (think Michael Moore). But the worst reaction to have is to feel insulted. And along with 300's actor's wooden and B-grade performances, this film has an elephant's load of instances. Take this prime example. The narrator is a soldier asked by his king to return to Sparta, as a witness of all their valor and deeds. But he has left the scene of battle just before a major skirmish ensued, one that would eventually take the lives of every Spartan left there. How then could he describe in detail the king's actions from taking off his helmet and throwing down his spear and dropping his spear when he wasn't even there? Which brings me to my critique. This film was over-narrated, its actors' performance tepid, its script mildly comical. I wish the Spartans were portrayed better, because they stood for something more than gorgeous choreography and clich√É¬©d lines. The 5 points I award it is for cinematography and costume."

Persia grew from the growth of other societies and won by scale according to the movie. I did not understand the king's denial when the deal was offered for Sparta to keep its own land and expand in exchange for use of services like their army. I guess there is a need for politicians.

I found myself, several times' yelling at the TV ""for god sakes stop prancing around in your leather Speedo and kill someone!"" The director Zack Snyder did throw in some scenes with nude woman in it to offset the beefcake parade marching across the screen. But, one of these scenes did include a naked guy, testing my concentration abilities not to let my eyes drift towards the dude. The scene represented the yin and the yang of sexuality while the rest of the movie centered around 300 well chiseled yangs. I'm not too familiar with Zack Snyder's body of work, but I'm sure it involved gay porn.<br/><br/>The cinematography is very good with stunning visual effects. Zack Snyder shows the beauty of a dismembered bloody limb as it floats gracefully through the air to the sweet sounds of a classical sonnet; breathtaking.

The backdrops are so amazing, that almost every frame looks like it could be paused and slapped back into Miller's graphic novel. The acting in the film is also spot on. I'll admit its probably not too hard to play Spartan warriors or Persian dictators, but all the actors do so convincingly. Even the story, amidst all the highly stylized battle sequences, is pretty inspirational. 300 men extremely outnumbered, fighting for their freedom and their families, even though its been done a million times, Zack Snyder manages to make it fresh.

This movie is all about being a super guy, a super macho and a super patriot. It's the perfect fantasy for a thirteen year old teenage boy with no brains and jumpy hormones. Athenians of course were sissies and idiots. It doesn't matter that in the process they changed the world and established the foundations of Western civilization. If you were not good at killing others you were a big loser in this testosterone-filled universe. Our ""Spartan heroes"" can't shut up for a second about how brave they are, how strong, how good at killing, how willing to die, blah blah blah.

I knew this had originally been a comic book and was loosely based on the Spartan battle of Thermopylae. I was mesmerized by the way many scenes contained images that could've been lifted right off the page of the comic book. The artistic talents of the team that made this movie are quite evident. The battle scenes, while graphic, are done beautifully. The creatures are hideously delicious. Xerxes is bigger than life. The queen portrays the strongest of women, but is still feminine and ultimately vulnerable. The whole movie is wonderfully NOT politically correct.

The truth is that without this brand or kind of bravery, the world would be different, in fact, in this particular case, the democratic or free world might not be... or would at least be different that it is. It's interesting that Xerxes actually threatens to burn every Greek parchment. This truly would be a hit to any free society of today.<br/><br/>It's possible that watching ""Last Stand of the 300"" is a prerequisite for this film. It wouldn't spoil it (if you're wondering). If nothing more, it imparts much gravity to the events of this movie. The true back-story is really something that changed the world, and is in most 10th grade history lesson plans.<br/><br/>I liked the cast of relative unknowns (I wouldn't dare say B-listers!). The physical appearance/tone of the characters and the presence they relate to the audience is very important. In fact, type cast actors or the possibility of bringing reference to other movies into this film could have ruined it. The only character I might have considered recasting with a better-known actor would be that of the Captain (I would have voted for Tom Sizemore).<br/><br/>I only have two negative comments (maybe robbing the film of a star each): 1. The splattering blood/wet sponge foley art that is in many scenes really drew the quality down to that of a complete graphic novel knockoff, or the surreal environment of Sin City.

I'm glad that at LEAST there were were no Schwartzeneger one-liners.<br/><br/>I don't know or care where Zack Snyder came from, but his work is already legendary by my estimation... and I get the feeling he's just at the foot of the mountain.<br/><br/>Watch ""Last Stand..."", Then get this movie."

","The battle scenes are visually stunning. The adaptation of Frank Miller's book is faithful to what matters...the gory graphic violence.<br/><br/>If you are a person that loves to see limbs dislocate while their victim screams in agony. If you enjoy blood cascading like rain drops on a battlefield. The beauty of heads dislodging while they still have a expression on their face. This movie IS FOR YOU ! And my favorite part is blades traveling in slow motion to capture the graceful destruction of their victim. Man I just kept watching in anticipation of new characters just to see them die.<br/><br/>The only part that Frank Miller claims to be historical is the 300 Spartans that fought to the death against the Persians. So if you are going for Oscar winning performances, perfect subplots or a history lesson...this is the wrong movie for you. <br/><br/>The only have 2 complaints: 1 I wish there were less scenes filmed in near darkness or night, makes it difficult to watch on normal TVs and hard to appreciate the cinematography. 2 They should have spent more time with the battle scenes and less with goofy drama going on in the senate.<br/><br/>Worth owning used."

The violent scenes are so fun to watch, so beautiful that you don't care about the simple story ( a little too simple.) The performances are quite strong, and the film is gloriously over the top, just how Miller wanted it to be. This isn't a boring, paced Historical epic...it's history as if written by a maverick comic book writer, and animated by a pro. If you love action, style and gore...then this is awesome.

","Eversince I've watched 300, there have been these comments saying that it's a hidden message of America's depiction of the people of middle east, in this case the Iranians who descended from the Persians. I have to say IT'S OUTRIGHT NARROW-MINDEDNESS! There have been a lot of posers trying to pass themselves off as politically correct. My dear, misguided friends, I think you should go back and read Frank Miller's explanation of the comic book where this movie is based. This, people, is HIS interpretation of the Battle of Thermophylae and he admits that he intends not to stick exactly to what the history books tell about the battle and the tribes and empires involved in it. To the imbeciles who felt they were insulted because they were of Persian-descent, I tell you it's not worth your pride. The Germans admit that they will forever carry Hitler's mark in their history and yet they carry on with their lives. The Americans, admit it or not, have a very long history of atrocities in other countries and these brutalities continue to this day--and yet, they couldn't do anything because they know they can never erase of what was done. The Japanese know that they may kowtow forever to other Asian countries for the menace they showed during WWII but they know it will never bring back the dead or turn back what has happened. Same with those offended by this movie, you may rant or rage but you can never turn back time and deny the mistakes of your ancestors."

For me it transcended the feeling you get from reading old sagas (like Hercules or Odysseus), full of heroic people fighting and defeating monsters and demigods, the slow-motion and all those other effects all seem to serve as a means to making the movie seem more epic and it certainly succeeds at that.<br/><br/>9 / 10"

Despite the hate from habbofags and furfags of PETA, this movie is designed for entertainment. First of all, this movie is not a nonfiction movie, so even Pedobear approves! Who cares about what really happened! All we care is that it's entertaining, it's even suitable for lolis. Also, beware of the gory scenes, this movie is not for weak hearted. We all know Spartans DO NOT WANT human emotions, they're just fictionalized characters. As for Nazi feminists, the representation of females isn't that bad. It's not they're yelling at females ""BAK 2 KITCHEN"" or something like that. Finally, this movie is made of epic win, and it successfully closed the pools of uninteresting war films (Saving Private Ryan and etc) for AIDS to an end. For politics, I don't see any links between politics and this movie, and I can care less if Iraqis get slaughtered as long as it doesn't affect my tax and oil price (ironically it do).<br/><br/>So, if you haven't seen the movie already, I recommend: 1.

Sadly it let me down."" <br/><br/>STOP TRYING TO MAKE PEOPLE THINK YOU WERE SO LET DOWN! It is obvious you are just doing that for dramatic flare to make it look abysmal! They also followed it with..<br/><br/>""Had plot holes, is predictable, bad acting."" They don't even explain WHY the acting was bad! They also don't explain what the plot holes were. AND It is a film about an historic event! Of course you will know what is going to happen! I even saw people say that the whole elephant rhino killing thing was ridiculous. One person said ""I learned that elephants and rhinos are easy to transport and kill."" Making an implication that is isn't true. Let me say this. THEY ACTUALLY DID THAT!! Almost EVERYTHING IN THIS MOVIE ACTUALLY HAPPENED! Okay let me move on to the movie itself. This movie is in one word. AWESOME! I have never EVER seen a movie with so much action. I Literally wanted to just watch it forever. The fight scenes were AMAZINGLY CHOREOGRAPHED! The CG was phenomenal, and the acting was incredible! When one of the soldiers lost his son and was angry, I actually felt bad for him. There were MINOR historical inaccuracies. For instance, they would NEVER let women walk around in the streets without a man. Also the Spartans were Homosexuals. They had sex with boys as part of their culture and only mated with women for procreation. (This is true.) But that would make a ""gay"" movie. (Pun intended) All in all this movie was spectacular, probably my favorite movie of ALL TIME!"

I don't mean that is a war hawk sense, but in a way that it just jacks you up for anything. Frank Miller is a master of writing and this has to be his best work that does not focus on his love for call girls. His skills here are brought to full power in this masterpiece of the written and spoken language.<br/><br/>Of course, these speeches and quotes are only as powerful as the person giving them and Gerard Butler delivers them like no one else ever could.

","After seeing the film, reading comments from its makers, and digesting the reviews of my fellow viewers/critics I have some things to say that might clear up confusions on more popularly criticized points.<br/><br/>It is plainly obvious many people went into to this movie not expected the right thing and misread it almost entirely. It is not a historical fiction like Troy or Gladiator, it is a historical fantasy. The clothing, idealism (though modernized), and portrayal of the era are quite accurate. The physics of the fighting and the story as told are the fantastical parts. <br/><br/>The Persians are displayed as monstrous in the movie to create stark contrast with the Spartans, simply to add cinematic emphasis, not as an insult or political comment. Bodys are portrayed in the pinnacle of classical Greek form, while the blood is used as an extension of digital art. The lighting and color scheme is shot to mimic that of the graphic novel, which was done well.<br/><br/>Character dimension is narrow but deep. An off-shoot to a theatre technique call 'the alienation theory', Snyder does not want the audience to connect to the character's entirely but the idea that is 300, displayed through its characters. <br/><br/>The point of 300 was to create a true recreation of Frank Miller's graphic novel, which it did and very well. Along with it come amazing cinematography, a menagerie of digital artistry, a driven idea and story that is short and simple, and truly a movie that captures the beauty of the human form in movement; a celebration of the Greek artistic ideals in many ways. However, it is a completely uninhibited view of this both in violent and sexual content. In fact my only dilemma with 300 is its nudity and sexual content. With or without it, 300 is still an 8 in my rating and I hope this review helped you see 300 in a different light that changed or expanded your incite about this film."
"mnotogo","6","0","1","10 July 2007"," Well-done animations and style, so-so story, some re-used elements
","I really enjoy unusual artistic styles when it comes to films. I feel that 300 was done very well, with great detail, camera angles, shots. Very good use of lights, darks and color. However, I couldn't help but draw parallels to movies of similar theme - especially Gladiator and Kingdom of Heaven - especially with the grain shots and when creating an effect of ""feeling."" In terms of the story, I don't look for full trueness and correctness. That is what a documentary is for. However, I found that perhaps there were too many elements that were used to create an image of tiny Spartan vs huge Persian, and also when it came to deviations and creatures. I almost felt like I was watching Lord of the Rings at times. The only element of magic that I felt was done well were the alchemists and their bombs.<br/><br/>What the movie did do well is show an image of the mercilessness of Spartans and their relationship to young boys, the harsh training. Well done was also the use of moral deterrents through a wall of dead soldiers and the tree. Using a narrator was an interesting idea, though I felt like at times the narration was overdone. Choice of music at times was also too clich√©, at times re-used, at times very appropriate. However, the film does show well the softer, more humane side of the soldiers.<br/><br/>Several themes were also clich√©, such as the betrayal from within that was clear from the very beginning. The friendly talk between the two young soldiers reminded me too much of Lord of the Rings's interaction between Legolas and Gimli. Some elements were easily predictable, such as the second betrayal, which was clear that it was coming up, but the movie did give hope to the viewer that it may or may not occur. To some, it may be a huge downfall, even though there is some attempt afterward to make it up.<br/><br/>Overall, a good movie, and everyone will find something that they are looking for. The dry humor sometimes works well."

Unlike Gladiator where the audience had a good understanding of the bad guy and came to hate him by the movies end, I felt no real animosity against Xerxes. The plot as it unfolded and the so called reason for the 300 fighting the Persian Hordes made no sense whatsoever. I read somewhere in a history book that it was a delaying tactic to hold the Persian hordes up while the Greek army could form up and prepare. That makes more sense than the reason given in this movie. The fight scenes have all been done before and much better(Troy, Braveheart, Gladiator, and the latest Bond movie). Unlike Braveheart and Gladiator I was not left feeling sad at the hero's demise, as the movie did not have that magic that makes the audience care about the characters."

","Dear Zack Snyder, After witnessing your 300, I would have to say I would have to drink about 300 glasses of Guiness just to numb the pain of what I have witnessed.<br/><br/>In order to enjoy all the special effects and needless screaming of the Spartans, one can go to any movie theater and watch the three-minute trailer saving them about 114 minutes of utter boredom. It would have been nice if you told us that Zack.<br/><br/>The movie focuses on King Leonidis being threatened by the Persians to give up Sparta to them, the King refuses and takes 300 soldiers from his army to stand up to the Persian Army lead by Xerxes. Along the way, there are some battle scenes that go on longer than they need to, and there's a neat scene with some elephants trying to stomp on the 300 men.<br/><br/>The graphics may have been neat, the music fits, but the plot of the movie is absolutely ridiculous. In the real world when it is 300 versus thousands, do the math. In Greece, I guess one stands a chance according to you Zack and Frank Miller, author of the graphic novel. A real disappointment for someone who was a fan of Sin City, which Miller was able to help take his vision from paper to screen. Perhaps it was because he was more involved in the Sin City project. .<br/><br/>By the way, did I mention that there's a needless sex scene in the movie? I can't stand needless sex scenes. Perhaps you jerked off to it and it worked for you. Me, had nothing to do with the story and I didn't believe the marriage of Leonidis and Gorgo, the queen.<br/><br/>Mr. Snyder, I am sure you have talent as a director, but the way this movie was put together, the pacing, the story, was all so terribly flawed. The trailer was cool. Find a way to make the rest of the movie even cooler and you will have me at hello.<br/><br/>Until then, here's two beers for you.<br/><br/>Regards, Michael Jae."

","Based on the Frank Miller (he of Sin City fame) graphic novel of the same name, 300 is set in ancient Greece. An army of 300 Spartans battled with a million-trillion-bajiillion Persian hoards long enough to save their modest city of Sparta from being pillaged. A cast of no-names, led by Glaswegian gladiator Gerard Butler, carry the film through the bloody battles, but it is the gory details of the film's visceral visuals that take centre stage. None of 300 is meant to be taken seriously, as made apparent by the blatant lack of any substance to be found in the film. It is certainly true that, once the battles stop, the film stops too. But those battles are pretty sharp all the same."

","First of all I don't understand what type of expectations all the nay-sayers had when they entered the theatre, especially since most of you probably knew that this is movie spawned by the same brains that came up with sin city.<br/><br/>I expected a epic battle depicted in a up to date style suitable for the year 2006. Which is what I got, and I enjoyed it throughout the whole time. If it is not clear that this movie is far from an accurate history lesson, then it should be so from the first few minutes of the film (and crystal clear at the end of the mountain scene). Realism is sacrificed for the sake of visuals and artistic freedom. And it is a good thing.<br/><br/>Everything i see just looks so damn cool through the red black and gold coloured film grading, The camera angles are cool, the red capes look cool on the pumped spartan bodies. The CGI backgrounds (mostly) look marvelous. And that is just before the battle scenes starts, which is probably the coolest looking and best crafted CGI battle scenes I have ever seen, with bizarre gruesome villains that look insanely cool, and woderfully unrealistic.<br/><br/>So with that in mind - the criticism the movie has received regarding the depiction of the persians, The only offensive fact here may be that they are called ""persians"" - come on, This is a movie created by open minded visual artists, under the inspiration of a historical event.<br/><br/>...And then finally we have the script and dialogue, it keeps the story going but sadly we have the main flaw of movie here with its holes and poorly developed subplot. It brings my score down with two stars."

","Firstly, I must state that my initial reaction after watching this movie was, well, not quite ""wow"", but it was quite fantastic! Okay, so what was it? A highly exaggerated and lavish account of the Battle of Thermopylae in which King Leonidas and 300 fellow Spartans defended their land from the Persian invasion. Sounds exciting, doesn't it? Well, it is. Very. For much of the movie I found myself tensing and sitting in unease, and for much of the movie I also found myself laughing at the Laconian wit expressed so very effectively throughout.<br/><br/>The visuals were much at the centre of 300, making heavy use of CGI and choreographed in total accordance with the style of the movie. it was bold, it was relentless and it worked. There is no denying that I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.<br/><br/>The acting..well, Gerard Butler held his character perfectly and pulled off a stunning performance. The expressions he used conveyed many emotions and at times he held everything together. In fact, all main characters had noteworthy performances (well, for all there was to their characters).<br/><br/>However, despite everything I just said, anyone who watches movies on a deeper level than the gloss and style of the visuals and the action-packed storyline will be slightly, if not overly, disappointed. Perhaps not disappointed, but aggrevated or even just slightly annoyed. The fantastical style adopted may well have been totally in aid of storytelling and embracing the mythical nature of the events at Thermoplyae, complementing an extraordinary story with extraordinary extras. However, this is not my gripe. The level to which the credibility of the story has been stretched is my gripe. Between elephants, rhinos and ridiculously disfigured beings participating in warfare, the battle techniques used and even the gross overuse of homophobia and racism in the movie was quite unsettling and at times totally farcical.<br/><br/>This movie, like most action movies, can be viewed on two different levels. One will leave you amazed by the aesthetic values and sheer style of the battle scenes. However, the other will uncover a sensationalist tale of myth rather than Ancient History."

It is one of the few times that I've actually cheered in a cinema (involving a certain scene with a certain Spartan woman) and it really hyped me. The cinematography was amazing, and had a certain sense of being detached from reality, while still retaining some realism. I've never seen so many deaths in one scene, yet see so little blood.<br/><br/>There are criticisms however. One was that there seemed to be some not-too-subtle political points. For a nation based on martial discipline and slavery, they used the word 'freedom' far too many times. Also the exaggerated grotesqueness of the Persians seemed a little....weird, along with the suspicious lack of body hair among the Spartans.<br/><br/>I'm still not sure about why many people refer to the Spartans being all manly though.

For example the Spartans fighting against giant monsters and other creatures.<br/><br/>The war against the Persians is forbidden by the gods, but the Spartan King Leonidas (Gerard Butler) does not want to see his people enslaved or killed. Breaking the law, he leads the 300 best Spartan warriors to battle in order to make a statement strong enough to persuade the rest of his countryman to go against the gods and declare war.<br/><br/>""300"" is directed by Zack Snyder. This is a director to really keep an eye on. His two films ""300"" and the re-make ""Dawn of the Dead (2004)"" have been excellent. Snyder has shown a mastery of his craft.<br/><br/>What Snyder does tremendously is recapturing the art of Frank Miller's original graphic novel. Just as ""Sin City"" did in order to mimic the frames of the graphic novel, ""300"" was entirely shot with a blue/green screen.<br/><br/>This allows Snyder to articulately copy the pages of Miller. The backgrounds of the film are vibrant with color and resonate with the ominous blues of the night and the ceremonious golds of the day. This will please many the fans of the graphic novel as it has striking similarities.<br/><br/>Snyder also meticulously shows scenes in slow motion. Many times this would cause me to complain as most films either overuse slow motion or misuse it. Slow motion has thus become overdone. Alright, it is probably overly abused in ""300,"" but the film develops a specific style from slow motion shots that makes the film what it is.<br/><br/>The slow motion used by Snyder also allows the viewer to see what is being displayed during the action scenes. Too many times movies show rapidly cut action scenes where the viewer did not comprehend anything that happened. In ""300"" most of the action is shown in slow motion and the viewer can see the action in all of its bloody glory.<br/><br/>Plus the slow motion is just flat out cool. Slow motion has not been used this well since ""The Matrix."" ""300"" is obviously not a film that is going to build deep characters. Just about all of the soldiers are interchangeable and blend in with their exposed and ridiculously defined muscular chests'. Seriously, some of those muscles probably don't even exist.<br/><br/>Without a doubt, ""300"" caters to a specific audience. If you are not intrigued by intense action at a breakneck pace with blood gushing from every direction ""300"" is probably not for you. If that does intrigue you then ""300"" will satisfy your bloodlust."

","I was fortunate enough to study Ancient Greek at school, but was not familiar with Frank Miller's cartoon books in general, or his work on this story in particular. I have to confess that I thoroughly enjoyed this imaginative take on a famous tale.<br/><br/>The Spartans were a legendary warrior state, and the battle of Thermopalae arguably one of the most famous ever. The fact that Herodotus faithfully recorded these events in some detail provides a firm base for a fantasy with two feet firmly placed in fact.<br/><br/>Boldly, the majority of the films almost two hour running time is indeed taken up by action sequences. As such, the blood and gore count is of Tarrantinoesque proportions - but it's fantasy portrayal allows much more to be shown than might otherwise be acceptable.<br/><br/>Gerard Butler gives a Mel Gibson inspired ""Braveheart"" performance as King Leonidas and is ably supported by Lena Headley as his wife and Queen in what amounts to a cameo role. Don't be put off by the snobbish put downs of some commentators - she has a role to ply and does it in caricature style. His opponent, Xerxes, is curiously played by a Julian Clary lookalike,Rodrigo Santoro,in comic book style.<br/><br/>The music and imagery coasts dangerously into ""Gladiator"" territory, but the battle set pieces are tremendous with the fantasy portrayal allowing maximum scope for dramatic license. And lets not forget that the Greeks loved a good story. Leonidas response to the Persians threat that they will block out the sun with their arrows -""Then we shall fight in the shade then"" is stirring stuff and reflects a mock pompous script which is lively without taking itself too seriously.<br/><br/>Not as epic as ""Gladiator"", or as Fantastical as ""Lord of the Rings"", this film still scores within its own agenda - don't let the purists from either the Historic or Comic Book factions put you off. Great story - well told."

","The hype was mounting in the months leading up to the release of 300, the film adaptation of Frank Miller's (Sin City) graphic novel of the same name. Even following the release, the publicity kept rolling. It was virtually impossible to go anywhere without hearing people praise the movie. Never skeptical, but always vigilant, I brought my critical eye to the theater to put 300 to the test.<br/><br/>The film tells the tale of the ancient Greek city-state of Sparta and its impending decline at the hands of the Persian Empire. After being called to kneel before Persian King Xerxes, Spartan King Leonidas calls on the Ephors, Sparta's executive council, to send the army to war. Corrupted by Persian gold, the Ephors decline, forcing Leonidas to build his own small army of 300 men to take on the vast thousands of Persians.<br/><br/>As was expected, the battle scenes were extremely well done. The cinematography was fresh and stylish, but the editing was very subtle, straying from the modern technique of short shots and quick cuts. This greatly improved the look of the film, allowing the audience to immerse themselves in each shot.<br/><br/>Narration is a wonderful tool in film-making; it allows the director to show and tell simultaneously. 300 is a fine example of how narration can be used to detract from the story. Narration was necessary for this story, but it was poorly executed. There were several cases where the narration described the action on the screen. The viewer does not need to be told what they are seeing, especially when it is something as easily understood as an adolescent Leonidas fighting a wolf.<br/><br/>Simply stated, 300 is not the Jesus Christ of modern cinema. Though beautifully shot and edited, the film fails to deliver much more substance than the standard Hollywood gore-fest."

","To put it in a nutshell, I think that ""300"" was probably one of the best movies I've ever seen in my life. That's a pretty big statement considering that I've got films like ""Lord of the Rings"" and ""Star Wars"" to compare it to, but I've never been quite this impressed before. The film is a visual feast for the eyes...a masterpiece of modern cinema.<br/><br/>I'll try to put the movie in a nutshell here without too much of a spoiler...but I may slip up a bit, so read with caution.<br/><br/>The movie takes place back in the days of ancient Greece at the time of the rise of the Persian empire. The Persian Emperor cum deity Xerxes has begun his acquisition of Greece, and has demanded that the Greek city of Sparta pay him fealty, in a sense. Xerxes really doesn't demand much, only that the Spartans must bow to him and honor him as the god he is. If they would do this, then Xerxes will have no need to march his billion man army on the city. The Spartans are a proud race of hardcore warriors, and Spartan King Leonidas refuses to bow to anyone, much less a Persian.<br/><br/>Leonidas decides to attempt a preemptive strike against Xerxes armies, but is unable to do so due to it being a holy time in Greece--a period where the armies are not allowed to march by the order of the Gods. This being the case, Leonidas gathers a band of 300 of his best warriors to march against Xerxes, acting not as the Spartan army, but as proud, independent Spartans.<br/><br/>This movie is the tale of all that happened during that march...and a few other choice tidbits that went on back in Sparta while they were gone. And that's pretty much all I'm going to give you on this story...<br/><br/>Everything about this movie shows excellence. Acting, editing, art direction, adaptation, costumes...it's ALL perfect. As a plus, I've never seen so many perfect bodies gathered together in one movie before ever, so lovers of the human male and female forms alike will certainly have their fill of eye candy. The flick even has the required Hollywood gratuitous sex scene...and it doesn't take away from the film, not one bit.<br/><br/>To try to compare this movie to another is next to impossible. If I had to do it, I would have to say that it's ""Gladiator"" meets ""Sin City"" from within ""The Matrix"". It's an incredible visual experience and it's not to be missed."

","First, let me start by saying it is a movie.<br/><br/>Why does everything have to turn it into an allegory for the war on terror or it represent Americans' real feelings about Iran? Take a break and relax! Yes, this was based on an actual event from history. While I think the actual version, or what we theorize to be the actual account, would make for an incredible film, I also like this version. It is a break from reality.<br/><br/>If we truly want to be technical, let's not forget that those swords would not have done that much damage to the Persians. However, the blood would spurt from the necks of the men who just had their heads severed.<br/><br/>Whether you like the movie or not, do not turn it into something it is not, a political statement. Is that what we are going to do to every fantasy or epic flick? For instance, Lord of the Rings had no people of color, Troy was a political statement about homosexuality, and 300 was an attack on the Persians. Everyone knows the Greeks went to war with the Persians just so Americans could bash the Middle East 2,487 years later.<br/><br/>See the movie, enjoy it for its cinematography, the semi-unique story, the beautifully-muscled men (unless Queen Gorgo is your thing), the incredible battle scenes (well, unless you are a pacifist, then just do not go see it), laugh at the lines, or vow to use them in your everyday life.

","300 is a visually stunning film adaptation of writer-artist Frank Miller's graphic novel 300 which is essentially a retelling of an important historical event during the Greco-Persian War. This event is the Battle of Thermopylae which took place in 480 B.C. where 300 Spartans lead by King Leonidas took a stand against the massive forces of the invading Persian army (which was estimated to be between 200,000 and 2,000,000) lead by the God-King Xerexes.<br/><br/>Being that the movie 300 is an adaptation of Frank Miller's graphic novel do not expect this movie to be a totally accurate depiction of everything that took place during the Battle of Thermopylae. For instance there are a few monstrosities on the Persian side to aide in making things even more interesting than the standard type of battle you would expect to see in a film like this.<br/><br/>Also the battle wardrobe for the Spartan heroes is something else that isn't accurate. Their battle wardrobe is barely existent (cape, Speedo, helmet, sword and shield) and no I'm not complaining. I'm just pointing out the fact that it's certainly not the sort of battle uniform the Spartan army would have worn during a real battle being that it offers very little protection for the heroes. To me the ""so called"" battle wardrobe that is present in the movie is a plus especially if you're a woman or an appreciator of the physical beauty of the well toned male form. Also if you don't care for all the violence in the film then you might find looking at the heroes' abs, ripped biceps, and sculpted chests, and muscular legs to be a very good distraction.<br/><br/>On the other hand if you're not interested in the heroes' washboard abs, ripped biceps, sculpted chests, or muscular legs you also won't be disappointed either because there's plenty for you to delight in as well. This movie delivers on the blood-gore. You can consider this movie to be an uncensored ancient battlefield being that the director shows the gruesomeness of war in all its bloody details. This movie also features plenty of well choreographed battle sequences. You won't find any of the amateurish action sequences or confusing direction of the action as seen in the film Alexander or Gladiator. This is topnotch stuff equal to Mel Gibson's work in Brave Heart, Wolfgang Peterson's work in Troy, and/or Peter Jackson's work in the Lord of the Rings Trilogy.<br/><br/>If these elements aren't enough for you still or if none of the aforementioned things appeal to you then you will also find that this movie offers plenty of topless women for men to stare at or others who enjoy seeing bare female breast. There are larger than life heroes featured in the film to be captivated by. Men who are loyal, brave, selfless, strong, well-trained, and honorable and a queen who is as equally strong as her husband King Leonidas. There are also well done special effects which create this ancient-dangerous world in a stunning fashion that is sure to please many.<br/><br/>Story- King Leonidas played by Gerard Butler learns news that Xerxes has amassed an army of millions to conquer mainland Greece and eventually all of Europe. Instead of simply surrendering King Leonidas decides to face possible death to fight for Sparta's independence from Persian rule. Being that he has decided to go to war he seeks out the Oracle. Unbeknownst to him the priests of the oracle have already been bribed by Xerexs and so they interpret the oracle's message to mean that King Leonidas should not go to war because it will interrupt the Carneian festival.<br/><br/>Realizing that it makes sense to act quickly rather than wait around for full military and political support King Leonidas decides to take a small band of men: 300 Spartans, some Arcadians, and some other Greeks to meet the Persian invaders at Thermopylae which is a narrow valley adjacent to the sea. They choose to meet the Persians here because it allows them to block the only road that the massive, multicultural army of slaves lead by Xerxes can pass through. It also allows the Spartans to use their much smaller army in the most efficient way. It is during this standoff at Thermopylae that majority of the action take place delivering spectacular battle sequences, passionate speeches from Gerard Butler in the role of King Leonidas, and stunning-violent visuals."
"icurays1","8","0","3","26 April 2007"," A visual spectacle worthy of a $9 theater seat
","300 was a visually spectacular and overall stunning work of stylized cinema. The storytelling, which was of course entirely representative of Frank Miller's graphic novels, was clever and surprisingly concise (thank god this movie was less than 2 hours). Although some find the film's stylization annoying and excessive, I found the slow motion, grainy texture and high contrast to go hand in hand with the manner of the film. This was not intended to be a historical reference, or a romanticized candy coating like some period/history movies tend to be. It was intended to be a dramatic, entertaining stylization of a historical occurrence - and although some 'facts' were probably more like fantasy, and much of the story inferred or even invented, I didn't let that stand in the way of this truly enjoyable movie experience. My only disappointments come in the area of the acting; although it was somewhat necessary for the characters to be over-the-top, I felt some were simply trying to hard - Gerard Butler as Leonidas especially. Sometimes minimalism can be more powerful than excessiveness (Spartacus is a decent example).<br/><br/>If you are not offended by stylized, realistic gore and lots of death by spears and swords,, (which really, we all should be - sick lot we are) then 300 will give you a real thrill. What it lacks doesn't bring it to a screeching halt, and what it excels in makes it great. Worth my $9. 8/10."

An ultimate show for horny ladies, who still dream of one hot night in the company of Chippendale strippers. The Troy was a warm-up, while 300 is a spectacular show, a show in its true meaning of the word, which will make even nuns and the most up-tight women cum. God damn it, it is a show, which will make even men cum like crazy. Namely, every one of these warriors is drop dead gorgeous, hot, has a perfect body and is topless the whole time. They could even be put on a stage and given a crazy ass sexy seductive music accompaniment. No sweat, 300 is not only a pathetic posing a-la The Troy. 300 is a one great movie. Breathtaking spectacle full of action and a very special interpretation of the well-known Greek-Persian battle, which was taken directly from a graphic novel by Frank Miller, author of Sin City, which has the same amount of style, elegance and originality. What you are about to see in 300, you haven't seen anywhere yet. And you will love, what you see. A brilliant mixture of blood, sex, violence, courage, action, spectacle, history and apples, which will not be easily exceeded by any similar movie. OK, the so-called blue-screen dominates the actual movie, but that does not bother the dramatization, which gives the impression of watching a real movie. A real movie with balls.

","Films that are creatively fresh and different deserve certain praise in my book at the outset, and 300 soars in this regard. It's entire approach to bringing Frank Miller's comic book/novel to the screen is stunning from a visual point of view. The coloration and stylizing are absolutely unique. ""Sin City"" is similar in ways, but this film has its own metallic, epic, wide angle, heroic take and cast to things. 300 is a genuinely rewarding visual experience just for its cinematic creativity. Beyond this, one needs to have a degree of sophistication to affirm that this IS a comic book/novel approach and it would be foolish to look too deeply at plot holes or character development. This seems to be at the heart of most criticisms I have read of this film. Lighten up! This film is meant to be taken tongue-in-cheek and on its own terms, not over-analyzed for what it isn't even intended to be. That's like critiquing a comedy for not being a serious drama. This is supposed to be action viewing and visceral entertainment, larger than life ¬ñ not a deeply-nuanced psychological experience. This film should not judged nor dissected in that way; it's meant to be taken lightly and enjoyed as great escapist entertainment BASED ON real events and real characters. Sure it takes liberties! It doesn't purport to be historically accurate, so why get upset about it? It isn't meant to be reality; it's rousing live-action comic book film making at its best. I honestly feel that a fair degree of depth-of-character WAS achieved irregardless of 300's intentionally simplified format. I thought the acting was just fine. I loved the sardonic humor. I loved even the bad guys, even though I know damn well that the Persians weren't like that. It's all right-up-front and in you face and melodramatic and over simplified for fun's sake! 300 is fun. It's also super violent, but in the same over-the-top, exaggerated fashion. The tremendous battle sequences at the heart of the film are terrific and very originally choreographed, both physically and cinematically. Filming doesn't come more visually creative than this ... fast-riding entertainment doesn't come more fun than this. For what it is and sets out to accomplish it is impeccable."

","this movie has the stupidest Persian enemies ever. Black sheep's..big rhinos..? 50 foot elephants??? The only disappointing thing is that the city of Rome did not back up King Leonidas in the fight. The funny part was the Persian king. He was so tall and my friends thought he was retarded when he tells the Romans to kneel to him. The dumb part was that hunch back character..he was ugly as hell. The fight scenes were awesome especially, the formation of the Spartans during the battles. Each men helped the men to his left and right so they fight like one unit.

"mwhite_81","4","0","1","19 April 2007"," Can you go too far with special effects?
","The fight scenes were masterly choreographed in this movie however the thing that let the movie down so much was the background and the movie makers over use of Special effects. Watch the movie and i guarantee there are very few times when the characters aren't standing against a green screen with computer generated graphic behind them. Having read the story of the battle at Thermopylae it instantly jumps out as the father of all tales of courage in the face of adversary. There are countless tales in history that see a repeat of this tale where a group of men stand their ground against all odds knowing that their sacrifice is for the greater good. Now with this in mind i was pretty keen to see the movie ""300"" and see how film would portray the characters i had created in my mind. To say the least i was sorely disappointed. Special effects do enhance most movies. Lord of the Rings, Matrix and Gladiator are excellent examples of when they are used. The mastery of these special effects is the tweening of computer-generated effects to real life scenes to trick the eye into believing something is real when it clearly is not. I do realise that this is an adaptation of the comic and therefore many of the characters are taken straight from the comic pages (i.e. Xerxes and Ephialtes the traitor). However by doing this it distorts the reality of the story so that an audience watching is numbed into a fantasy version of the events that took place. The fight scenes become more palatable as sitting in the comfort of your armchair your brain is constantly reminded that this is not real. I think this lessens the impact this movie could have had on viewers. Im not going to even talk about the lack of a story line however the intro and explanation of Spartan culture was good. My advice if you had a second crack at making this movie would be to set it on location and make it properly. Otherwise you could have saved your money and just made an animated cartoon."

","The highly enjoyable film 300 has unfortunately been bashed by some for its historical inaccuracies. To those people I say that this movie never set out to be a historically accurate portrayal of the Battle of Thermopylae in the first place. The movie 300 is an adaptation of Frank Miller's graphic novel 300 which is loosely based off of the movie ""The 300 Spartans"" which is about the battle of Thermopylae. It is not a movie about Herodotus' history book VII (Polymnia) or any other historical account of this great battle; however, it still manages to keep the most important aspects of this great story intact. For instance this movie captures the courage and self sacrifice of the Spartans in great detail. It also highlights how their sacrifice served as a moral victory for the Greeks which ultimately lead to the Greeks driving the Persians out of Europe.<br/><br/>This movie has also been wrongly labeled by some as being racist because the Persians are the villains of the movie and Persia just happens to be modern day Iran. The bottom line ladies and gentlemen is that this is a movie about the Battle of Thermopylae and it was fought between the Persian Empire and the Greeks. The Persians were not simply thrown into the film to bash Iran. The historical facts as to whom this battle was fought between was not altered in the least. Also lets not forget that this is a movie about the courage and self sacrifice of the Spartans and not about how the Persians won the Battle of Thermopylae by killing every last man who remained on the battlefield (If this was a movie that had centered on Xerexes campaign to conquer all of Europe beginning with his invasion of Greece and eventually his killing the bold 300 Spartans would you really want to see a film like this? I know I for one would not). I encourage people to keep these things in mind before they starting making unsubstantiated labels.<br/><br/>Some have also tried to make the weak argument that the look of the enemy is part of the racism because there are some non-human enemies in the Persian army. Again I must point out the fact that this movie is an adaptation of a graphic novel. Being that this is the case the whole look of the movie has been structured to create a surreal world. In this world things like monsters are possible. So it makes sense that the enemies can have monsters in their ranks that they can unleash whenever they feel it necessary. It is all a part of the visual presentation of the story it is not a secret plot to attack the Iranians. Think about it. Would you really be as interested in what would happen next if the wonderfully fit Spartans just fought against other wonderfully fit humans? No, you wouldn't. The monster element makes things much more visually appealing."

","Two things annoyed me most about the film (and hence the 2 missing marks). First was the over-the-top rhetoric and all those hyperbolas about Freedom and Justice. I think the filmmaker did an excellent job in portraying visually the fact that the civilised world (symbolised by Spartans) was standing up to an evil oppressive system (symbolised by Xerxes and his army of mutants). There was no need for the dialogue to refer to it CONTINUOUSLY. I'm sure the audience didn't need that amount of indoctrination. And referring to Thermopylae as a battle ""against mysticism"" was a bit outrageous, given that everyone, including Greeks, had some sort of mystic system.<br/><br/>The second thing that annoyed me was the somewhat low-key ending. I think that a character such as Leonidas deserved a more fitting death. A cool battle to the last, and only then should we have had the rain of arrows that slaughters him. What we had is a very short battle that pales next to the initial ones, and so leaves one slightly disappointed. Together with this I found the soundtrack to be slightly limited. Personally I would have added some more rock riffs.<br/><br/>Other than that it was a good epic film. The battles in the first half of the film were visually stunning, with time speeding up and slowing down to achieve better effect. Good Good stuff.<br/><br/>Let us hope that the lessons learnt at Thermopylae will never be forgotten."

","This is a movie version of a graphic novel version of the Battle of Thermopylae, where 300 Spartans held off a vastly superior Persian army. You don't go to something like this expecting accurate history or geography. Anyone not literate enough to understand this is a highly stylized retelling should do other movie-goers a favor and stay home. And the only way you can come out of this film seeing it as a metaphor for the present Middle East or the War on Terror is to go in already determined to see it that way. As any number of historically informed reviewers have noted, most of the most jingoistic and ""rah-rah"" scenes in the film are quoted directly from the ancient Greeks who wrote about the battle.<br/><br/>There's tons of action but not much suspense; we know the Titanic will sink and we know the Spartans will be betrayed and overwhelmed. Some of the visuals are unintentionally hilarious. The old priests visited by Leonidas at the start of the film look for all the world like Emperor Palpatine and Xerxes looks so much like one of the Borg I all but expected him to say ""Resistance is futile. You will be assimilated."" And apparently Xerxes had a personal bodyguard of ninjas.<br/><br/>Anatomical discovery of the day: hack off an arm or stab someone in the gut, and blood sprays everywhere. Hack off a head, sever the carotids and the jugulars, and it barely drips.<br/><br/>Even allowing for the stylized story, the historical inaccuracies grate after a while. What's missing more than anything else is why we should care. Persia, to be sure, was an autocratic empire but Sparta was as regimented as North Korea. If North Korea were to duke it out with Iran I'd make a big bowl of popcorn and cheer for both sides as I watched it on TV. Also, the Persian rulers Cyrus, Darius and Xerxes, all mentioned in the Bible, were competent and fairly enlightened rulers. We can be certain Xerxes was not the hermaphroditic freak he's made out to be in this film. Why did the Persians try to conquer Greece in the first place? How could people in Sparta, which was both ultra-militaristic and brutal in its treatment of its children and its slaves, talk about freedom? Obviously ""freedom"" meant something to them, but what? Why would they identify with other Greeks instead of accepting the Persian offer of overlord-ship? Why would other Greeks identify with the Spartans? Obviously there were complex motivations and modes of thinking that cut across our categories, and the film makes no effort to explore them.<br/><br/>The closing credit graphics are colorful, dramatic, and worth staying for."

The alternation between warm and cold tones really balances the film out. The choreography of the fights is amazing, like a gruesome ballet with carefully calibrated slow-motion scenes alternating with quick jabs of striking action that will have you exhaling only at the end of the scene. Another aspect I enjoyed is the almost fairytale-like portrayal of good as handsome and evil as grotesque, over saturated with fat or pride or greed. Exceptionally well cast and acted the movie never once gave me time to remember I was in a cinema being entertained. As for flaws¬Ö well I can't say I glided over them too easy. If I hear the words ""the beginning of a new era¬Öof freedom"" again it will be too soon. Sometimes I feel like it's just one man in Hollywood writing all the monologues for all the movies. And the last motivating speech given by Dilios is long winded to say the least. Also the plot sideline on father-son family values seemed both redundant and quite diluting to the main message of the film but alas Hollywood doesn't have the guts to make a pure message-movie without a human interest story anymore.

","This is no ""Gladiator"" by any means but meh, it still delivers some decent fun.<br/><br/>""300"" takes the epic genre to a new dimension. It does not conquers it but it gives it a new face; the face of popcorn cinema with plenty of action and spectacular CGI. Now I can imagine how, to name some examples, ""Clash Of The Titans"" impressed and haunted millions. In these days with the advance of technology and more, it was necessary to make an epic movie that could exploit the benefits of this new millennium's technology. I watched this movie with high expectations and with the sole purpose of having a blast; I mean, an entertaining evening. I expected spectacular epic battles, heroic speeches, excellent f&x and I got all what I wanted. Don't take the movie too seriously and you might enjoy it big time.<br/><br/>My main problem with the movie is the plot which is not even historically accurate or isn't interesting enough but I don't mind because you get candy for the eye all the time. <br/><br/>300 is spectacular in all the sense of the word. It makes you feel powerful at some points. Even if it's not historically accurate, you should keep in mind that the main purpose of the movie is to entertain audiences and renew the epic genre. I can understand that modern Iranians feel insulted with the movie's display of the glorious Persian era, but they need to understand that this is only a movie and so is the right of expression. At any moment the movie offends directly Iran's culture and past.<br/><br/>The action sequences are mainly battles between the Spartan and Persian armies but there are other scenes such that display the lust and atrocities of the Persian empire, some ""heroic"" speeches and more. There's glorious gore, exciting battles, great acting, and an amazing score. What else can you ask for? <br/><br/>The performances are sui generis. I mean, Zack Snyder directed talented actors to display heroic characters based on a comic-book. So plenty of people could consider the acting as over-the top but I say that it is just perfect for the movie's tone. Gerard Butler plays masterfully King Leonidas. He does what he has to do; and that is to create a brave, powerful, strong King that would do anything to defend his kingdom. His acting was simply amazing. The same for Dominic West, David Wenham,and Vincent Regan. The three of them were powerful on their roles. Lena Headey was hot as hell and also delivered a brave performance. Rodrigo Santoro truly impressed me with his performance as Xerxes. The rest of the cast is just okay. <br/><br/>Zack Snyder's direction is outstanding. He truly created a new fightning system in cinema. The movie is epic but also feels like a powerful comic-book. The f/x are part of the new generation and the cinematography is also impressive. This is the complete epic movie because it has all the winning elements. Be sure to watch it on theaters.<br/><br/>This is an example of how money can entertain."

","300 is the latest in a line of films that is proving the value of CGI environments to enhance a visual aesthetic that is new and refreshing to the world of cinema. Like its Frank Miller adapted cousin Sin City (though with a palette more visually akin to Sky Captain & the World of Tomorrow), 300 is a feast for the senses that dazzles the eye and entertains wonderfully.<br/><br/>Hearkening back to the days of grandiose cinematic efforts such as Ben Hur, the Ten Commandments and Cleopatra, but with a sense of brutal realism that is reminiscent to Braveheart and Saving Private Ryan, 300 tells the story of the Battle of Thermopylae and how a small group of Spartan warriors led by King Leonidas stood alone against the Persian army of Xerxes I. Legend has it that the Persians numbered in the millions, though this is disputed by modern scholars who believe they were in the tens of thousands, still an overwhelming number against the 300 Spartans who held them off for three days of intense combat.<br/><br/>300 is exactly what one would expect of a well crafted film about an ancient war. With costume design and digitally crafted scenes and sets, and cinematography that is unique and awe-inspiring, director Zakk Snyder has fashioned a film that he can take great pride in. And with a cast led by Gerald Butler and Lena Headey that captivates the audience with their demanding screen presence, 300 certainly provides an engaging cinematic experience.<br/><br/>While the narrative and how the film paces itself is certainly well done, the dialog does tend to sound very modern and not very convincing as a recreation of the time period. The films largest flaw resides in the fact that -- at times -- the humorous interplays between characters are given very modern choices in phrases that sound out of place and thus tend to pull the audience out of the illusion that they are watching ancient Sparta and not modern day North America. While sarcasm certainly isn't anything new and likely had as much a life in ancient Sparta, the stylistic approach that is used does not come off as believable. As well, while there is a great deal of bloody combat, the fact that the Spartans in this film walked away from every second of graphically bloody combat without a drop of blood on their clothes or bodies does tend to draw one out of the action that is taking place.<br/><br/>Overall, 300 is a fantastic action yarn that is as enjoyable to watch for its artistic accomplishments as it is an entertaining take on classical war cinema. Where it lacks in believable dialog it more than makes up for in its stunning beauty and intense action sequences.<br/><br/>I would only warn that this film is certainly not for young audiences or those who are squeamish at the site of blood and dismemberment. 300 is true to its subject matter and does not hold its punches in the graphical representation of sword based combat (regardless of how clean the soldiers look afterward). 7.9/10"

","I personally find this a much more rewarding film than the other recent Frank Miller film Sin City. The characters in Sin City were very cold which may have been deliberate, but it left the viewer with the same detached cold feeling. Whereas Sin City had a well known cast, the cast for 300 are less well known, but for the large part they put in some good performances. Butler and West in particular put in good performances.<br/><br/>The story and film title focuses on the 300 Spartans as they fight against the overwhelming forces of the Persians. It seems to me like the Spartans must have had some very impressive gym equipment judging by the definition of the soldiers. With scantily clad women the eye candy factor of the film is high. I suspect the film will mostly appeal to red blooded males who love plenty of fighting garnished with battle cries and nude women. Having said that women who like muscles will also have plenty to keep them occupied. For the film connoisseur the photography is a pleasure although the script is a bit clunky in places. Better than expected!!"

"spooly_montana","9","0","5","10 April 2007"," Most thrilling visual cinematic experience of the year!!
","The phenomenally successful worldwide box office smash '300' has earned almost as much globally as it has domestically, bringing in a whopping total of $323 million dollars so far! '300' is based on Frank Miller's graphic novel of the same name, and while taking some artistic license, the story is based on the Battle of Thermopylae in 480 B.C. in Greece, between the Spartans and the Persians. Many of you (myself included) are probably not involved in the graphic novel world, but may recognize Frank Miller as the one who wrote the graphic novel Sin City, which was made into a hit film in 2005. As a massive army of Persians, led by the megalomaniacal Xerxes, nears Sparta, Xerxes sends an emissary asking for the submission of the city-state to his will. Xerxes wants to simply conquer the world, and is a self-declared god. In a show of defiance, the Spartan King Leonidas (Gerard Butler) kills the messenger, inciting the anger of the so-called divine leader, Xerxes. In preparation for defense of the country, King Leonidas consults the Greek council, which has been infected with political opportunism. They do not want to fight but instead negotiate. To make matters worse, the local oracle, which he is forced to seek permission from, consists of a young drugged woman, held by corrupt priests that do not allow the release of the full army to battle the Persians. King Leonidas, a true Spartan, cannot take this assault lying down and rallies together 300 Spartans to take on the impossible role of putting themselves at odds with 250,000 plus of the Persian army. It is interesting to note the definition of the word Spartan in the dictionary states that they are ""rigorously self-disciplined¬Ö courageous in the face of pain, danger, or adversity."" King Leonidas takes his army of 300 professional soldiers, to fight off the advancing Persian army, choosing a strategically advantageous position in a narrow mountain canyon 12 meters wide, a corridor set in the steep cliffs off the Aegean Sea that the Persians would have to pass through. In the movie this place is referenced as ""the Hot Gates"" (the literal translation of ""Thermopylae""), where the large army trained to fight on Asia's open plains, cannot take advantage of their full numbers, giving an advantage to the Spartans. The hope for reinforcements is always there, but they stand their ground with no certainty of any relief, until death if need be. These Spartans possess courage, self sacrifice, and camaraderie, not fighting as an individual but as a unit for a common purpose ¬ñ their country. Back home King Leonidas' equally strong wife, Queen Gorgo (Lena Headey), navigates the home front perils of crooked politicians and backstabbing. This story is decently wedged in, giving females in the audience more of a reason to see this film (besides the shirtless men with muscular superhuman abs on display throughout most of the film). As the Queen's husband fights the foreign invaders, she struggles to get the backing at home to send the entire army and keep Greece free. The scene in the film's beginning when the King and her part ways is fascinating, with the Queen handling it with a real stoic strength and resilience, knowing to spend a moment on sorrow would be a tax on her energy which she cannot afford. The famed Battle of Thermopylae, the epicenter of this film, is said to have inspired all of Greece to band together against the Persians, and help usher in the world's first democracy. The texture of the film is not meant to create the reality of the historical event, but to make the bare essentials of the story explode on screen in an entertaining fashion. This is not history verbatim, rather an artist's interpretation on those actual events. So you have fiendish monsters, and tinted landscapes that are so beautifully designed with CGI your jaw drops as if seeing a large painting suddenly come to life right before your eyes. '300' does stay away from being campy, because of the display of real grit and conviction in each actor. The glory of Greek stories such as The Iliad, which seem far fetched, is suddenly mounted up on the wall of your local cinema screen on a glorious widescreen canvas! This is the stuff of legends, one of the most famous rallying stories in history, of a stubborn group of fierce warriors who engage a massive army, at the expense of their lives. ""It's a place where great and glorious things happened,"" Frank Miller describes. ""We are talking about the crucible, the epicenter of the battle for everything that we have, for everything that is Western civilization. There's a reason why we are as free as we are, and a lot of it begins with the story of 300 young men holding a very narrow pass long enough to inspire the rest of Greece."" You are so effectively thrown into this world Frank Miller created, that you almost want to reach for your shield as a spear flies through the air, pick up a fallen comrade, and bare your own sword against the oncoming enemy. The fast and slow motion camera effects warp reality, adding an enjoyable twist to the film. '300' is the most thrilling visual cinematic experience of the year, do not miss this one."

","...but genius it's not. Understand that and you can open your eyes to what is, in effect, a good movie - not a great one.<br/><br/>I've yet to meet someone who's watched this movie and not been impressed or enjoyed it immensely. It's got stirring speeches, easily identifiable good/bad paradigms, human faults aplenty (temptation, greed, egotism) and jaw-dropping action and visuals. What it is lacking is one simple thing: Menace. The antagonist here is an 8ft drag queen with a penchant for piercings and an unnaturally resonant voice - one that certainly doesn't complement his choice of lipstick. The most evil thing Xerxes does in the whole film is make Ephialtes wear a silly jester's hat. For me, the whole thing was let down by the fact that we never fear the Persian horde. They allegedly burn down a village (which we don't actually see) and make a tree out of the corpses (which we do). But their army appears to consist of wet blankets and 'trick or treaters'. Such a shame because it makes Leonidas's last stand seem somewhat disproportionate. <br/><br/>I also felt that the visual explanation of how the Persians cutting off the remaining Spartan unit was really lacking. It's almost as though the big final battle was played on fast forward (sic). There's just no sense of climax about it.<br/><br/>Great to see 'real' (possibly meaning bearded) heroes are back en vogue. <br/><br/>All in all, it's a good film. The subplot back at Sparta adds a suitably cloak and dagger conspiracy feeling to the film, which is totally appropriate. The symbolism is a little heavy handed and dialogue is occasional pure pantomime (""Let's hope nobody tells the Persians about it"" - it's behind you!) but let that all pass you by and you will have a great time watching it and getting sucked into the world of 300.<br/><br/>It's a great feast for the eyes, ears and heart. It's a light salad for the brain.<br/><br/>You want our hard earned coins from repeated viewings at the multiplex? Molon lave."

Outraged and offended at their behavior, King Leonidas and his guards throw the messengers into a pit, resolving to face the Persians. Leonidas then visits the Oracle, explaining his plan of war with the Persians and offers a customary payment in gold. The priests of the Oracle, having already been bribed by Xerxes, interpret her message to mean that Sparta should not go to war, so as to not interrupt the sacred Carneian festival. 300 is a 2007 film adaptation of the graphic novel 300 by Frank Miller, itself partly inspired by another film based on the Battle of Thermopylae, The 300 Spartans.

Why should they remake the good old classics when... they can make something different, stylish, state-of-the art. When you go to the theater to watch a graphic novel and you get it, why should such experience be blamed?

"dstaten","10","0","5","8 April 2007"," Simply put... perfect
","I've been using IMDb for as long as I can remember, but I've never posted a comment before. However, I just wouldn't be able to live with myself if I didn't say a few things about this movie...<br/><br/>First of all, this movie is perfect. Yes, I know that's a strong word, but acting, the special effects, the cinematography, the choreography, the color filters, the battle scenes, the use of slow motion, the dialog, the scenery, the costumes, the sound effects (including voice alterations), the music (from beautiful classic style to metal), everything... perfect. Leonidas is the perfect king, the perfect man, and he and the queen have the perfect relationship. The Spartans were perfect soldiers with perfect fighting skills.<br/><br/>It's a love story, it's a mini epic adventure, it's a gore fest, it's a war movie... It's a movie you can take a date to or invite your buddies over and get loaded and watch on the big screen.<br/><br/>As far as the acting goes, first rate all the way. Every character is believable and passionate about something. And although you are only with them for two hours, it is enough time for several characters to grow on you. By sight and sound, you are bathed in the omnipotent presence of Xerxes, you feel Leonidas' strength, you see the loyalty and courage in his eyes, and you witness the greatest camaraderie in history.<br/><br/>I could watch this one over and over simply for the battle scenes. Gladiator was revolutionary in its battle scenes, but 300 kicks the bar up a notch (or two). It doesn't go for total realism, it doesn't follow the emotions through the battle, what it does is it sucks you in and makes you feel like every swing of the sword is yours, every hit is a small victory, it's glorious eye candy for the medieval barbarian that's inside us all, hungry to get out. It's the most beautiful train wreck you'll ever have the honor of seeing. The next time you're really ticked off, just skip to the first battle scene with the Persians. Watching the Spartans kick butt is the next best thing to taking out the aggression yourself.<br/><br/>My new favorite movie of all time. 10 out of 10 (cause they won't let me do 11 hehe).<br/><br/>Just watch it. You'll thank me later."
"spartacus533","7","0","2","8 April 2007"," Madness? This is, well, yeah it's a bit mad
","Let me just start off by saying this... this is no Gladiator. This is no Braveheart, and this is definitely NO Dances with Wolves. The acting is laughable at best, the characters could have been cut out of cereal boxes, and Gerard Butler, as able and gruff as he is, doesn't do anything to distinguish himself from the Maximus's or Achilles of previous war epics. In fact, you will walk away from the cinema with the rare privilege of having watched a 2 hour historical epic without learning anything, well, historical. But by golly is it 2 hours well spent. You will not, and I repeat NOT, see a more manly film this side of the millennium. What 300 lacks in the brains department, it makes up for in the ""I-didn't-know-it-was-possible-for-mere-mortals-to-do-that-and-live"" factor. The film sticks closer to the Frank Miller graphic novel than the real story, and it is all the better for it. The film is visually stunning, raising the bar in a way that will probably remain untouched until another Frank Millar adaption. And, guys, this is not the film you will want to take your girlfriend to see, unless she has done a 5-year stretch in Alcatraz. Heads are lopped off and blood is spilled in the yearning reverence that is normally reserved for the ballet. Eyes are gouged, every outward body part which is detatchable is hacked off... let's just say that a lot more than 300 people die in this film. It almost makes you want to cry when the 300 Spartans, inevitably bite the dust in the heart-pounding finale... almost. For this is the film's biggest disappointment: human emotion. You just don't feel connected to the men in the film as you did to Russell Crowe's Maximus or, dare I say it, Brad Pitt's Achilles. When the men are brutally brought down by the sun-blotting arrows shown in the trailer, a drifting shot over the corpses should make you well up and hug the nearest person to you in the cinema, but it doesn't. You should feel the pain of Queen Gorgo as she weeps for her husband, but you don't. Ultimately, the noticeable lack of emotion in the film stops a great film from being unforgettable."
"pablofen","10","0","5","3 April 2007"," This is Spartaaaa!!!
","I am so amazed of what i just saw, this film is an excellent adaptation of the Frank Miller comic, the ambiance, the photography and the acting are great, the special effects are amazing, like the sound and music. The only ""but"" of this film is that if it is supposed to recreate an historical event like the battle of the Thermopiles, OK is not exactly what really happened. But i don't think the author wanted to have historical fidelity, just offer his personal vision of the Spartans. But anyway,this is a great movie i can guarantee that you will have a great time with. I will give it a 10 because it was the first time in months i really had fun in the cinema."
"stelpower","8","0","5","2 April 2007"," More man power, less emotions
","***MAY CONTAIN SPOILER RELATED CONTENT!!!!!!!!!***<br/><br/>Around 9/10 comments think this movie sucks.<br/><br/>I don't. I say take it for what it is... It's not an epic war movie... it's not a historically correct movie. It's just a simple good versus bad movie told in a comic Universe. The plot is weak, yes, but that is what this movie is about. NOT WHAT THE ORIGINAL STORY IS ABOUT, don't ever compare any movie to its origin, no matter the movie 'cause then you'll end up with a whole bunch of crap.<br/><br/>This movie simply shows a battle between Persians and Spartans in a comic Universe. Spartans = Good glorious, hardcore warriors. Persians = Evil, corrupt, lustful, impure people.<br/><br/>The acting is quite poor, but it matters less due to little talking. I do however seriously dislike the side story where his wife stands up and utters in the Counsel and where she reveals that corrupt politician for what he really is. It's so corny that he just hid his money which he received from the Persians under his cloth.<br/><br/>This story is supposed to be hardcore man power, yet it drops it. They should totally have cut out his love to his committed wife and generally the whole love thing.<br/><br/>More man power, less emotion and feelings."
"eternallonewolf2000","9","0","5","2 April 2007"," Violence Galore
","If Sin City taught us anything, it's that we are drawn to brutal and graphic violence. Frank Miller knows how to portray the kind of violence that can not help but draw our attention. This movie portrays an historical event in such a unique and frankly awesome way that there is little wonder it rocked the box office! Butler's performance as a king facing invasion is certainly memorable, but the true draw to this movie is the awesome, graphic, and bloody action/violence and the ever dominant question, ""Can 300 truly stand against a million?"" Considering the unfair reviews that have been given to this movie and how it has done in the box office, I can only say this: You better believe it!"
"lee_a_scott","9","0","5","2 April 2007"," The truth is NOT the point
","First things first: this film rocks! And it rocks hard. Visually stunning. Viscerally exciting. Seemingly shot not, as claimed, digitally, but in fact assembled out of pure testosterone, 300 is a hard case and no mistake. One review that I read suggested there was little by way of character development, but that misses the point ¬ñ this is history as myth, so archetypal characters are painted with broad strokes ¬ñ there is no need for nuances. The story is this: 300 immensely tough guys fight off 1,000,000 less tough guys for three days. And that's it. What's their motivation. Well, conquest for the million and not being beaten despite ever-so-slightly unfavourable odds for the 300. Who needs backstory? Another criticism I've seen is overuse of slo-mo, but my assumption was that this was in homage to the graphic novel, allowing some scenes to come almost to a standstill, a tribute to Frank Miller's art. Again, I felt it worked well. Another criticism is that it promotes a USA/western European agenda against Iran. Clearly this makes perfect sense as the Persians didn't sweep across Europe conquering everyone in their path and there is no room in art for telling stories from one perspective¬Öhang on, that's stupid! Once again, this is history as myth. It is not an accurate portrayal of facts, and makes no pretence about this. If you see a subtext that involves the Spartans sneakily thieving Persian oilfields you are an imbecile.<br/><br/>Whilst primarily I'd say this was a guy film, my girlfriend thought it was great too. Simply, if you liked Sin City and are able to appreciate different forms of storytelling you'll love this. Go see!!!"
"bryan_andrew","10","0","5","2 April 2007"," ultimate man movie
","A must see in the theaters. while i don't typically waste my time watching a movie in the theaters, this proved to be one of the ""most see's"" while the dialog and plot are are a little far fetched at times the action more then makes up for it. I am not a typical male in the fact that i would rather spend my Sunday watching a chick flick over an action thriller, this movie came along and showed it is OK to be a man. Have unneeded violence and excessive blood and gore and feel free to yell hooray in the theater. The colors are vibrant and the screen is so action packed that one can't help but feel they are in the midst of the battle themselves. While the blood does'nt stay past a few seconds the over all feeling you walk away with last for weeks. Spen the money and watch it once in the theaters, then once again to make sure you did'nt miss anything. then by the DVD for all the extras that are sure to come."
"Neenee-b","10","0","5","1 April 2007"," 300 outa 300!!
","This is one of my picks for film of the year and it was finally released in Ireland last week and I have finally gotten to see it! There is no doubt that the trailer for The 300 is one of the best trailers out there. It looked fantastic, although fantastic trailers sometimes turn out to be much better than the movies themselves, for a reference see Miami Vice.<br/><br/>I was not disappointed.<br/><br/>I was also not at the battle of Sparta myself (although towards the end i was so into the film i nearly got out of my seat and joined the Spartan front line), so I don't care that it was not an accurate historical account of the battle.<br/><br/>OK so the scenes with talking, mostly those involving the Queen and the Council (there is clearly deleted scenes, one of which will no doubt involve the Queen and the Traitor, and will probably be included in the extended edition, after we have all bought the original DVD), were used by the vast majority of the cinema audience for bathroom breaks and the dialogue was a bit cheesy in parts, but it didn't matter. The battle scenes, backgrounds and music more than made up for it. It was one of the few movies that i have seen where i could have just watched them fight without any talking at all.<br/><br/>As with all sports movies, we only focus on a few of the team and to follow that rule we only get to know about 5 of The 300. The King, The Captain, The Quiet One, The Comedy One and The Young One. All of whom were great in their own roles. The Persian leader, was freakishly tall and covered in gold was scary looking and had wonderfully plucked eyebrows and some of the characters like the Deformed Spartan who looked like Gollum's ugly cousin looked great too. Although at the end Deformed Spartan wore this ridiculously pointy hat which caused a giggle to run through the cinema There was a fantastically choreographed fight scene involving The Comedy One and The Young One, it was like a dance. All of the battle scenes were great. From Rhinos, to elephants, and the scene where the Spartans pushed the Persians into the sea where just so well done. The film really worked with the stylised look.<br/><br/>the whole rock music theme really worked. The was a scene where the Spartans were all walking toward the Persians with the music blaring loudly was stolen right out of any football movie you care to chose Some of the great lines from the Trailer where there. The ""Tonight we dine in hell"" one was my favourite from the trailer but when The Comedy One said his ""fight in the shade line"" i think that i actually swooned. The ""no retreat, no surrender"" line brought a smile to my face as its the title of a bad Jean Claude Van Dam movie and can also be found on some old murals which lurk around over here (Ireland!) One of my friends complained that the Spartans were all Scottish. I didn't mind. If you want to pick a group of tough people who will fight to the death to protect their country and family you might as well pick anyone with a Celtic background (Celts never back down from a fight!! lol).<br/><br/>One of the downsides was the fact that with the exception of the Queen, all the women whether they be oracles or slave whores all had to have at least one breast showing. There were that many overly pointy nipples on screen at one stage i thought about going to A&E afterwards to make sure i was normal!!! I also appreciate that slow mo makes battle scenes look more impressive and there was a lot of slow mo used in this film and all of it worked don't get me wrong, but the film only lasted about 1h45mins. If it was all played at normal speed we would've been finished in about an hour. Not exactly value for money.<br/><br/>I like the fantasy element of the battle. I didn't mind the big dumb ogre and the big fat thing with spikes for hands but i draw the line at Sitar playing Goat. It looked so bad it could've been an extra from the Jabba the Hut dance scene in Star Wars.<br/><br/>Overall I would give this movie a 9/10. Just for the look of it. The writers aren't going to win any awards for the dialogue etc but the movie worked better when no body spoke at all. There was some comedy throughout the film and I would've liked more screen time for The Comedy One but only because he was my favourite Spartan. It loses a point for the sitar playing goat only because it was so out of place, even in this film! I will buy the DVD when it comes out, but this is a film that will only work best when you see it in the cinema, my tiny 6 speaker surround sound will not do the film justice at all."
"cmwilliams1964","10","0","4","1 April 2007"," 300 Spartans battle the Persian masses
","I absolutely loved this film, the cinematography was superb, the acting excellent. Based on a graphic novel, it portrays the last stand as such of 300 Spartan warriors together with about 700 thespians in their attempt to prevent Xerces from subsuming Sparta into his empire. King Leonidas, superbly portrayed by Gerard Butler, leads the way as he assembles his finest warriors for the Battle of Thermopylae. The lead up is slow but detailed in setting the scene, but unlike some other films it isn't enough to deter you from sticking with the plot. The battle scenes are awesome, shot in slow motion to emphasise the brutality of the bloodshed, the effects supporting the scenes are first class and I found myself glued this film, if not mesmerised. It portrays the camaraderie of the Spartans superbly and leaves you following their every move, thrust, parry and ultimately death and sucks you in. Highly recommended, brilliantly acted, superbly shot, a definite 10/10"
"ohmyheavens","Null","0","3","31 March 2007"," Mixed Feelings
","On one side I thought this movie was great and on the other I had so many problems with it. Let's start wit the things I liked: buff men running around half naked, lots and lots of testosterone, the action sequences, and visual graphics. Now the things I didn't like: buff men running around half naked, lots and lots of testosterone, the action sequences, and visual graphics, historical inaccuracy, political overtones, and subtle racism. While I liked the half-naked men oozing testosterone I couldn't help but ask why are we reinforcing the message that men need to fight and yell be manly? If I heard one more whooorah!! I was going to scream. It's weird because while I was happy to see the father cry when his son died I also asked myself would a warrior have really cried in ancient times infront of others on the battle field? I liked the action sequences but then again there were really unrealistic no one can kill a rhino with a single spear, then again it is just a movie. Also why were there so many visual graphics, did that oracle girl really need to do that translate dance to get the point across, then again it was really pretty. However, the one thing that really stuck in my craw was the historical inaccuracy, while I know, no historical movie is 100% accurate, this movie knows it is terribly inaccurate and it doesn't even care. Also there was a little subtle racism. I mean why exactly were all the good guys white and the bad guys colored. They either looked black, Hispanic, or Asian, except for the traitor who was just plain ugly. You have to forgive me because I am a realist and very cynical and also a little wishy washy, but who isn't."
"tagureanu_tudor","9","0","4","29 March 2007"," 9 over all
","The film is great, I haven't seen such a good film in a while. The only problem I think, is that it shouldn't have been in English, Greek or Latin maybe, it would've been best. (like Apocalypto) The actors are quiet good, and also the special effects are great. The best special effect is the one with the cloud of arrows :). Have fun watching the movie, you must understand that it provides us with a great legend, the legend of the spartan's, their believes, their culture, the way they raised their young. I gave the movie a 9 not because it's not worthy of a 10, it's just that it would be better not in English. :) The story is about king Leonidas and his 300 spartan that fought to the death in the ancient battle of Termopile. The bravery and courage of Leonidas and his men is visible through the movie. The are also some aspects of politics and treason. The women, especially the queen is well characterized as strong and determined as their husbands to do anything for their country, for their water and earth. The women of Sparta are almost equal to men because they are the ones who bring to life real men (spartan men). The only thing mothers , wives etc (women) tell to their men before the battle is to come back with their shield or on it. Feelings of love are only felt not shown."

","See this film on the big screen!!! If you don't you will regret it. The film is violent but in a comic book way and has a real theatrical air to it. The cinematography is superb and I would certainly like to see this up for an Oscar on that basis alone.<br/><br/>The fight sequences are fast moving and non linear, which aids in drawing the viewer right into them. There are some great one liner that really will get any red blooded males testosterone flowing. <br/><br/>Warning!! This movie is based upon a comic book which was based upon the historic ""Battle of Thermopylae"".. This film may not be factually accurate account of those events but it does drive interest in that history... <br/><br/>Gerald Butler and the whole cast put in a top performance. <br/><br/>This will be one of those films that I will purchase on DVD when its released. 10/10 from me and I would surprised if it drops out of the IMDb top 250 in the next few years."

","Why so many people walk into the theater expecting a historically accurate movie is beyond me. So what if there weren't really any rhinos or elephants? So what if the movie was full of hunchbacks and strange looking people? The fact is that the cinematography and direction was superb. There hasn't been anything that revolutionary since The Matrix. The movie was made to entertain me not educate me. If I wanted a history lesson I'll go the library or watch the History Channel. If this movie didn't have the CGI or the exaggeration it would just be another Troy or Kingdom of Heaven. We've seen that a million times before. This was different! I was thoroughly entertained."
"i_know_i_die","10","0","4","29 March 2007"," The Best Comic Adaption Since Sin City
","If some of you still don't know. This movie is based on a comic by Frank Miller. The comic is base on the 300 Spartans story. Frank Miller added a little magic of his on to make it more interesting. So don't expect to see a movie which is accurate History. And for those who are complaining about the background not looking real, it is because they want to make it look like a comic. It is like Sin City. Sin City is also a comic by Frank Miller. So all Frank Miller fans will love this. Anyway, they make it look like the comic. And if you are still complaining, I suggest you to go buy the novel and read it. Then watch the movie. You will then appreciate the movie.<br/><br/>The story is like the 300 Spartans. 300 of the best vs an army of uncountable people. Only thing is that Frank Miller has added a little differences of his own. So don't expect to be surprise to see people who don't look like people in the film.<br/><br/>I have to say this. The computer effect is damn good. The action scenes is beautiful. Adding the slow motions it is perfect. The dance of the Oracle girl is a good example. The slow motion makes it look so beautiful. The costume is beautiful. I love the Immotal costume. Props is also an important thing here. The design for the swords, armors etc is nice. The way they did Ephialtes is also nice. He really look disfigured. Queen Gorgo is beautiful. The whole film is beautiful.<br/><br/>If you like the comic masterpiece, Sin City, you will love this comic masterpiece, 300. A must watch for all comic book/Frank Miller fans. For people who are watching this for some History lesson will be disappointed because it is not historical accurate. I said this in pathfinder and I will now say it here. It is just a movie. It don't have to be accurate."

","The summary comment is for the fellow who complained that the battle scenes were not realistic...<br/><br/>Uh..., so like, go watch 'SAVING RYAN'S PRIVATES' then, okay...<br/><br/>GEEZ, REAL bright one there...<br/><br/>Anyway, sorry about that. So, I'm gonna sound like all these studio 'PLANTS' who rave and rave about films in their posts, but I'm not : ) All I can say is simply... WOW!!! I believe this is the VERY first time I've ever given a movie a '10'. The film was visually stunning; I liked the way that it added in just the right touch of mysticism and supernatural elements to give it a nice Mythical flavor which made it REALLY great and satisfying for us imaginative people out here who would NOT really be all that interested in a STRAIGHT War film with standard, 'realistic' battles. VERY, VERY nice!!! I have honestly NEVER seen a film quite like this one (maybe I just don't get out much, I don't know...) But, I'm telling you, it was something to behold...<br/><br/>And, as a side point, I REALLY appreciated the restraint in the gore; not so much that you didn't see a LOT of people shredded or impaled, you most certainly do. But, I really admired the way that even though this was necessary because it IS a film about a VERY hairy battle, STILL, the 'gore' was very 'clean' really. When people were beheaded it was very 'clean' is the only word I can think of. And the 'blood' flying all around during the battle was kind of 'standardized'. The film makers didn't go out of their way to show explicit, extremely realistic gore, innards, etc. They just showed kind of a homogenized, generic brown-like spray when people got sliced and diced. Sort of like how Spielberg did it in 'WAR OF THE WORLDS', where people kind of got shredded by those rays, but it didn't really look nasty...<br/><br/>Not to make TOO big of a deal of it, but NOT being a true fan of gore, per se, I REALLY appreciated the fact that the creators and director did NOT go out of their way to make it as nasty and realistic as possible. They kept the emphasis on the story, the characters, and the battle itself, rather than super accentuating the gore which in my opinion would have SERIOUSLY detracted from the primary strength and power of the film..."

Having said, it's supposed to be downright superb.<br/><br/>But aligning this with LOTR, Braveheart or Gladiator, all of which I rated 8-10, is just too much. These mentioned flicks offered us real feelings from the major to the minor charactares, complex and detailed story lines, etc. 300 could have been so much better with a little more depth and complexity to its resources.<br/><br/>I guess, the IMAX experience was just too overwhelming for me that every thing else became irrelevant -- the fact that Im usually intrigued by periodic flicks.<br/><br/>Is it just me or this film did not bring out everything it could have?"

But it is still a good movie, at least according to the effects that I have seen which is really kind of revolutionary. When I first time saw the trailer of this movie, I was quite clear about what I would be looking for from this movie, which were the Colors and the Contrast. But later, after I watched this movie, I found that there was something else which totally interested me also, which was the Slow Motion. I am not sure if it is really called in that way. But the slowly moved camera could really capture the details and to make me have that feelings. Normally, I quite dislike to see this kind of slow motion in an action movie. But in 300, it was perfectly repeatedly used, and it really made all of those ""moments"" quite overwhelming and breathtaking! Just go to see it, if you are into seeing the difference that the colors and the contrast could bring to you, if you would like to see how the slow motion could shake you!"

","It is one of the best war movie i have ever seen. The war is based on only victory with power, glory and freedom. The Kings men have all foot soldiers with raw power leading to various victories. The soldiers who would die in the field of battle for the king and freedom. Though the Spartans never felt fear, they did give their enemies that feeling. The action scenes are brutal but hey, thats what war is all about. Never believed in making enemies their slaves but to give them a hell of a death. The action scenes are brutal but hey, thats what war is all about. Cant pinch an enemy to have them surrendered or kill them. This movie may get into Oscar nominations for best action and screenplay. The dialog's of the king are truly motivating - not motivating their soldiers for fight but to brutally kill all enemies. Fighting is their profession and they are the best at it."

","Now I myself am not one of these great movie critics, I do not possess the needed level of articulate language and omnipotent attitude to comment and find flaws with every film ever made. However, when i see people rating this film a 3.... my spartan gods that is just plain wrong. This film at worst is an 8 and that can only be due to the fact that they couldn't make it any longer. The casting I myself cannot find a fault with after reading the graphic novel. Gerard Butler as Leonidas displays the fury of a spartan king and carries the role better than anyone putting the needed emphasis behind tag-lines to give the surge of excitement following ""Imortals? We'll put their name to the test!"" and any other intense line he delivers with umph. The casting of Rodrigo Santoro as Xerxes again is superb as he displays the stoniness and power of his character just by standing atop his throne. It gravely saddens me to see how feminine the world is becoming seeing people rating this so poorly and I only use that word for lack of a better. So when compared to other films it is my strong belief that no-one will care who Spartacus is anymore because thanks to this new standard.... THIS IS SPARTA"

Second the idealism shown forth by all the spartan soldiers very much appealed to my imagination and my own value-system. Being fearless, without mercy and adamant in their resolve, they carried the ""spartan flag"" high upon their breasts.<br/><br/>Comments on form The landscape scenes (so what if its cgi?) are sublime beyond what words can describe. Although sometimes you see the blue screen looming its head (the part where the 300 walk away through the field of hay), the graphics are perfect! Subtle details which denote strength and insanity are carefully (e.g. where the monster, when attacking Leonidas, just gripped the sword at the blade instead of the hilt) hidden away but do arrest the attention in a subtle way. The fight scenes are very nice (e.g. integration of slow motion at crucial moments), not too cruel (not that I would've mind) and denote strength supreme.<br/><br/>In a nutshell: this is a must see for all who adore epic battles, very nice graphics and special effects! Two thumbs up!"

","I've always wondered how people listen to a song for the lyrics and completely miss out the music, and then I understood that music was too abstract for them and they had to hook onto something superficially meaningful, and these were the lyrics, either good or bad, it does not really matter. Why am I talking about music, commenting on a movie here? Well, if some of you forgot, movies are not about the lines pronounced, or the realism of the plot or about the faithful rendering of the era. These are the things that can help a movie, but, if it lacks in producing this gut feeling, known as catharsis from the ancient times, it misses the point. So, all the objective dissecting is completely misplaced in this sort of movie-going experience because this is the movie you feel inside your guts. It is not supposed to be intellectual. It is not a study of human behavior, it is just a piece of film-making that either stirs you or not. It definitely stirred me. I felt it. It was good. That's what a movie should do. No rationalization, just that feeling inside your stomach."

","'300' is almost a non-stop m√™l√©e of swords, arrows, and blood-splattering violence.<br/><br/>It's great if you love repetitive brawling. But the movie needed more subtle moments, and definitely more character development and dialog.<br/><br/>I also wasn't thrilled with the artistic idea of the grainy photography. I kept waiting for the movie to become clearer. It was like watching a VHS tape versus a DVD.<br/><br/>There are moments in the movie that are not suited for kids. Other than the decapitations and blood squirting out of body parts... There's a touch of female nudity; females getting aroused and engaged in kissing other females; and a brief sex scene showing different Karma Sutra positions. It wasn't needed -- but hey -- whatever sells your product.<br/><br/>Take the great computer-generated graphics from Lords of the Rings; combine that with the combat battles from Gladiator; add doses of blood; then delete the characters development... And you have '300'."

","I'm not too much of a typical 'chick' - I don't own a lot of makeup, I think 2 pairs of shoes are sufficient, and I love action movies. However I knew I would hate this movie for many reasons: <br/><br/>1) I hate historical/war-type movies. I barely made it through the LOTR movies, I hated Gladiator, and after six close-ups of Brad Pitt's 'deep, far-off stare' in Troy, I was feeling nauseous.<br/><br/>2) I hate gory movies, especially when there's no point to it. Long, drawn out close-ups of heads flying off? No thanks! <br/><br/>3) I hate going to the movies. Stuffy, cramped theatre; you can't talk to anyone; overwhelmingly loud volume. Plus, its hard for me to last 2 hours without a bathroom/cigarette break.<br/><br/>For all these reasons, I was not thrilled about seeing this movie. The only reason I did was for my fianc√©'s birthday, since he'd been salivating over this movie for weeks.<br/><br/>After seeing it, I have to say - WOW, WAS I WRONG. 300 was a fantastic movie, from storyline to visuals to dialogue. Everything was wonderful. Even the gore was portrayed in a rather gorgeous manner. During those 'long, drawn out close-ups of heads flying off', I was thinking, ""this is the most beautiful movie I've ever seen"". I felt excited, and passionate throughout the entire film, and was fighting off tears at the end.<br/><br/>And, as an added bonus, this movie has great female roles. There aren't many shown, but they are strong characters! I'm usually fine with typical comic-book movies where the women are pretty dumb - ""Ooh, who is that mystery man flying around in tights? Oh well, I guess I'll never know..."" - but in this movie, women are just as strong, loyal, and 'Spartan' as the men are.<br/><br/>For anyone else, female or not, who is dreading '300', I guarantee you will be blown away. I can't put into words how amazing it is, except that it really is a work of art."
"alainenglish","7","0","5","26 March 2007"," Gory, exciting but lacks tragic edge
","""300"" is based on Frank Miller's comic book about the Spartans - 300 soldiers who made a brave stand against a marauding Persian army. I am familiar with neither the comic book nor the legend on which it's based, but I was watching an action movie and I judged it on that basis alone.<br/><br/>On an action level, the film is a great success. I found the battle scenes gory and exciting as the Spartans use technique, teamwork and ingenuity (as well as sheer brute force) to tackle their adversaries. There was also a healthy dollop of wit in this scenes as well. I never tired of hearing Gerard Butler as the Spartan leader barking orders at his troops or offering up clever one-liners to friends and foes alike. The presence of trolls, man-wolves and deformed soldiers add fantasy overtones to the proceedings.<br/><br/>It is in the character stakes I found the movie wanting, but not by too much. Due to a lack of depth in the characterisation, I found it difficult to really care for the soldiers as people. The relationship between Butler and his lieutenant, played by David Wenham, was particularly underdeveloped. More depth would have accentuated the Spartans' bravery, and made their inevitable fate more tragic and moving.<br/><br/>However, the movie has a strong female character in Lena Headley's Queen Gorgo. While her husband is off to fight, she must stay behind and bargain with the Senate to give her man more backing. She generated a round of applause at my screening when she rammed a sword into the belly of the sleazy Senator who uses her. But again, there was a lack of emotional depth to the relationship between her and her husband. I never got the feeling they truly cared for each other, and in that the movie was robbed of further tragic dimension.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, for stylish, harmless escapism, you can't really go wrong with ""300"" and in that the movie is well recommended."
"jashandeepsingh","7","0","7","26 March 2007"," Magnificent!!!!
","This film can be summarised in one simple word; magnificent Although on some occasions not historically correct (e.g. Europe and Asia did not exist yet) the cinematography is absolutely breathtaking and makes up for it. The colour scheme fits perfectly into the film's context and adds a certain class which sets it from other films of the sort.<br/><br/>Throughout the Persians are portrayed as barbarians and often have monstrous features, to which many people disagree, this only illustrates the symbolism of the Persian psyche. Therefore there is no need for slandering the film on this basis. <br/><br/>One thing I was particularly delighted with was the Spartan appearance: brown/black hair and the muscular bodies. This may seem trivial, but in films like Troy the main character (Achilles played by Brad Pitt) had blond hair. Thebrown/black hair adds a sense of reality and the flawless appearance is true to Greek legend. <br/><br/>All in all, this is an absolute must-see for film lovers and I would highly suggest you see it in the cinema to appreciate it most. DVD will not do it justice. One of the best films released in a long time span, and certainly the best historical film ever!"

","It's always been said don't let the truth get in the way of a good story. More often than not, fiction is more entertaining. That's the great thing about Greek mythology, it has historical basis though we shouldn't forget the mythology part. With the 300 it should not forget the based on a comic part. Following in the vein of Sin City, the 300 was written for the page by Frank Miller and brought to the screen by Zack Snyder (The Dawn of the Dead remake). It tells the story the Battle of Thermopylae in 480 B.C when 300 Spartans engage in battle with the advancing Persian army. Led by King Leonidas, (Gerard Butler) the Spartans are vastly outnumbered as the Persians number in the millions. While most armies would be crushed, the Spartans have the finest warriors in the world who have been bred to fight which results in much bloodshed. Shot entirely in blue and green screen the 300 is extremely stylish and looks every part a live action comic book. Snyder has no reservations in shedding as much blood as possible with the claret spraying the screen at every opportunity. Butler appears to be having a ball playing the Spartan King as he continually boasts how superior his men are to enemy King Xeres (Rodrigo Santoro) whilst butchering his men. He commands the screen with a ferocious look that makes you believe that his men can actually beat any number of men, his Scottish accent adding to his assertiveness. The Spartans also look the part, each actor going through a punishing exercise regime in order to achieve the look of the men said to be descended from Hercules. The sub plot of Leonidas' love for his wife Queen Gorgo (Lena Headey) shows that he's not a one dimensional character, however the 300 works best when the blood flows, and it flows a lot. Violent, bloody, stylish and fun, the 300 may not be the Greek epic audiences are used to, however it may be the one that future films are measured against."

After reading some, I just had to sign up and make a comment myself.<br/><br/>I can't believe people can't suspend their belief for just a couple of hours! Why are so many people slating the film for not being realistic?! I read a comment earlier where someone was moaning about the accuracy of the fighting, scenery, colours used etc. etc. (sigh).

","Do not watch this movie with the expectation of receiving a complex plot that intertwines itself around you and draws you in. That is not what makes this movie great. Rather, think of this as an illustration of a great story.<br/><br/>You have to remember that Frank Miller is a comic book writer and illustrator, so, much of his talent lies in showing the reader what is in his imagination, rather than writing a gripping script to hold you. The imagery is the focus of the movie. In fact, very little dialogue is required because of the amazing images that are used to tell this story.<br/><br/>Is it brutally graphic? Yes, but, so is war. Is it realistic in it's portrayal? No, but who wants it to be? The only negative comment I have is that it just kind of stops at the end. It's hard to say what is really disappointing about it because up to that point you're basically saying: ""Holy crap that was badass!"" every five minutes."
"jackstat","9","0","3","24 March 2007"," Just Saw 300.
","Just saw 300 last night and even though i know the story of the 300 Spartans from history, i also knew that this was based on Frank Miller COMIC which was based on the premix that 300 Spartans held up the Persian army of 10,000's plus, over 2500 years ago.<br/><br/>The film was absolutely amazing and the 2hours flew by with all the action being breathtaking and visually outstanding.<br/><br/>From my point of view it was not based on any interpretations of modern wars, or any racial aspects. It is based on a comic that was drawn because someone decided it would make a great comic. 330 vs 10,000s etc.<br/><br/>(The following is how i remember the story goes from my history, sorry if any of it is inaccurate but this is how i remember it).<br/><br/>The story goes that with the Persians conquering everywhere, when they came to take Sparta, the Spartans didn't give in so easily, unfortunately due to the time of year, a certain holiday/festival was taking place, the ""council/elders"" wouldn't let the spartan army go and fight because of the festival, so the king took his own personal bodyguard, some 300 men off to hold back the Persians until the army could go.<br/><br/>They were joined by other soldiers (some say 700 some say 1000's, though these are supposed to have left before the final part of the fight) from neighbouring countries who aided them in the defence of the small pass. This pass was the ONLY way into Sparta, unless the Persian army wanted to go weeks out of there way to go around the mountainous area. They couldn't climb the cliffs to get around or above them. (there was a goat path that was discovered by the Persians at a later date, thus enabling there forces to get behind the Spartans) This meant that even tho the Persians had the overwhelming odds stacked in there favour, because of the narrowness of the pass, only a small group of soldiers could attack the Spartans each time. Thus they lost that advantage.<br/><br/>The Spartans were brought up and spent there whole lives as soldiers, this is that they did for a living, where as most of the Persian army were captured slaves from conquered countries, (they had their normal army and the kings own ""Immortals). This just meant that the Spartans would have been better warriors than most of the army that was sent against them.<br/><br/>Back to the film, the elements of the Persian army sent against the Spartans were basic infantry, conquered barbarian races, some elephants (these were used around that period in wars), and a giant rhino, a large/giant man (someone of this statue/size might not have been unusual to find amongst all the men commanded by the Persians, look at some sportsmen nowadays who are 7ft tall!!), archers, and the immortals.<br/><br/>The Spartans were all ""adonis"" type with ripling muscles and a physique that would make any bodybuilder proud, this would have come from hours each day of exercising and a commitment to keep in that shape, again something that the Spartans would labour at endlessly from when they were big enough to hold a sword or learn to fight.<br/><br/>Again, the film is based on a COMIC so a lot of the characters are larger/weirder than in real life, ie the executioner with two swords/blades for arms.<br/><br/>But having seen the film i know just have to get hold of the comic.<br/><br/>If you want a film that will keep you engrossed for the entire time you are in the cinema, go and see 300, you wont be disappointed."

"Robert_duder","8","0","4","23 March 2007"," For the first blockbuster of the year...it gets a deserving thumbs up...not perfect but perfect for the red blooded movie goer
","300 has everything that you can expect going into it having seen trailers and the name ""Frank Miller"" attached to it. As far as Epic Blockbusters go I am almost certain 300 is the most violent film I have laid eyes on. Whereas most historical battles whether fictionalized or based on reality imply more of the gruesome death and gore of battle 300 brings it to blazing life with brilliant well done CGI and over the top brutal effects right where you'd expect them to be. The film is a non-apoligetic blatant gore fest and satisfies every teenage males desire for blood. You sit there thinking...damn it'd be cool if his leg flew off and spun in the air with blood spurting...and the film makers said...yes, yes it would...so they did. Heads coming up, beasts of all kind being pierced and falling, arrows slicing through bodies like butter. All of this is done in the best possible way to fit the story but that's the major part where 300 fails is the story or lack thereof. I mean of course there is the necessary and fairly well known historical beginnings to Sparta and their 300 soldiers that hold back Xerxes until they can't anymore and are slaughtered but there is little story beyond that and 95% of the film is just one big constant battle. The film is not a historical epic by any means but Science fiction based on a historical event...hence the fictional fairy tale like creatures and mythology involved and even the Spartan fighting style was changed from realistic to completely different by the film makers in order to make it look better on screen. There was no attempt to make 300 appear historically accurate and that's okay but it will fall victim to those who want it to be.<br/><br/>Gerard Butler is the well trained reigning King of Sparta Leonidas. As the King Butler is the perfect Alpha Male. Brutal and strong, and powerful and well spoken and respected and yet has this soft, romantic, gritty style to him. Butler has always been one of my favorite character actors and has had some really great and diverse roles and he is quite good in this role considering the story and character depth isn't great. Butler should be a bigger star and hopefully this enormous success will launch him further into the lime light. Lena Headey is his beloved Queen Gorgo who is also a very strong female considering the time of the film and masculinity in it. Rodrigo Santoro is absolutely fantastic as the evil leader of the Persians Xerxes. The very disappointing fact is that they completely underused him despite making him look like an absolute towering, evil, god-like monster. He spends maybe ten minutes on screen and you desperately want to see more of him and a battle directly between Santoro and Butler would have been incredible. The supporting cast are all very good in their respective roles but aside from a very few small story arcs the characters are not focused on in any great manner.<br/><br/>That is truly 300's only and major downfall is the lack of any story or really major, enthralling epic plot. I mean, I realize that they made 300 to be exactly what it is...an enormous, gruesome, terrifying and artistically created masterpiece battle and they succeed in that 100%. You aren't likely to find another epic battle sequence like the ongoing one in this film and it's well worth seeing for that alone but I personally wanted so much more depth to it. I wanted more story, and more romance, and more characters with bigger stories. I wanted this to be the Spartan legacy that Lord Of The Rings was, or Braveheart and instead they made a mainstream action film with heads rolling. Nonetheless two weeks into release and well over 100 million dollars 300 is the first major smash success of 2007 and it truly is easy to see why. This film could be seen again and again and blow you away every time. Go see it on the big screen or the IMAX would be incredible!! 8/10"

What I am a little miffed at is the use of Frank Miller's name before the title of the film.<br/><br/>Sure, the movie was made because of Miller's great graphic novel, but film buffs may recall another film made in 1962 called ""The 300 Spartans"" which preceded Miller by decades. Obviously, many of you reading this will be thinking, 'oh, so what...there was another film made on the same subject matter...big deal.' Well, it seems Mr. Miller may have borrowed many of the ideas of the original to make this film. Again, big deal...right? Well, in addition to borrowing ideas from the original, he also may have borrowed dialogue directly from the original as well, in fact, there is very little to be found in ""Frank Miller's The 300"" that could, in fact be called Frank Miller's...except perhaps for the sword design. Perhaps next year, we'll see ""Frank Miller's Casablanca""."

","300 is a feast for the eyes. All the things that are good about this film is solely to the credit of the technicians who brought the stunning visuals alive on the screen. Rest is just an effort to justify those visuals.<br/><br/>At the outset, we are briefed on how a Spartan is prepared from childhood for a life of combat. For him, the highest glory is to sacrifice himself for the cause of Sparta in a battlefield. King Leonidas is no exception. Not much time is then wasted on building up the premise for an epic battle. Rest of the film is the epic battle itself.<br/><br/>Zack Synder, the director, no doubt has given us a film with visuals like none seen recently. It is a spectacle the holds the audience in thrall till the end. But he, otherwise, is not concerned with injecting any novelty in the storyline. There is the usual rejected soldier who defects to the opposition, the usual pain at the loss of a close one for an important character, the usual politics away from the battlefront, the usual unsung sacrifices of the women - all in all the usual storyline of any battle story. Not to say that these usual helpings are irrelevant, but they are all such an integral of part of any historical battle drama that there is a deja vu throughout.<br/><br/>During the early years of cinema, the film backgrounds were usually just painted out - mountains, trees, skylines. There was no on-the-location filming. The cars would stay still and the background moved, usually a film running on a screen behind. When you look at those old films, all that seem quite funny. Apparently, the audience of those times did not mind it. Films always depend on what the audience intelligence of the times accept. Similarly, the whole of 300 is a computer graphics painted brilliant battle scenery. Our intelligence of the day is awed by it. We cannot guess what will happen ten years from now.<br/><br/>Witnessing the sepia 300, my senses today had a great time. As the Spartan King Leonidas says,'We're in for one wild night'!"

","To those who have seen Sin City or are familiar with his work, this film's claim to fame is summed up by the name of its original creator: Frank Miller. In other words, what we have here is a so-so story wrapped up in very tasty, bombastic sugar coating. To its credit, unlike Sin City, this film at least tells one unified story and serves some purpose as a whole. Unfortunately, while it makes for entertaining viewing and may wow many film fans with its powerful style, it doesn't have much to offer beyond that.<br/><br/>The main problem with this film is that it follows an over-used formula (""tragic epic with hope out of the ashes"") and doesn't give us anything to set itself apart and make it worthwhile in its own right.<br/><br/>Think about it. Once you strip away the visual flair and comic book stylings, what's left? A bunch of shallow characters who behave predictably and a tried-but-true plot that will always work on some emotional level, but does nothing on its own to separate an epic movie from the pack.<br/><br/>Worse, the over-the-top nature of the film, intended to be the main individualizing element of the movie, serves in many cases to distance the viewer from the emotional impact of the story. The death of a certain character, for example, was shown so graphically that the viewer could not help but sit there and gawk at the gore rather than feel the emotion intended for the moment. As with Sin City, the graphicness of this movie becomes almost pornographic, and it creates a combined effect of shock and distance. The shock, of course, releases endorphins, which is why people keep coming back for more (and more intense) films with this kind of graphic brutality; it's a physical addiction. The distance, though, is what really damages the film. When the attention is drawn so consistently by reactions like ""holy crap, what did I just see"", how could anyone pay much attention to pithy concerns like story or character?<br/><br/>But you know what? I have a soft spot for epics. And this one does have all of those great spine-tingling epic moments; my personal favorite is the part where the hero roars a powerful speech before pointing his weapon at the enemy and urging his troops onward. It is also visually and aurally excellent--that is undeniable. So I won't lie and say that I didn't enjoy it, because I did.<br/><br/>Frank Miller's 300 is an experience, to be certain. It's entertaining, and it has flash and style. So what if it doesn't offer much more than that? It's still worth your six bucks, especially while it's in theaters. Go see it, but don't expect it to have the depth or staying power of a great epic."

The intensity of the Spartans was solid throughout the entire movie, and the emotional reactions of the Spartans was very real in a time and place where emotions were a sign of weakness.<br/><br/>If this movie lasted an hour longer, I don't think a single person in the theater would have stirred.

Or perhaps, you want to take it another step further and see the IMAX experience. Either way, you'll want to see this one.<br/><br/>The plot is simple: King Leonadas and his Spartan army of 300 are left no option but to defend Sparta from being taken over by the Persian army, consisting of a million soldiers. The Spartans decide that the only way to win (or kill as many as possible) is to wedge the Persians into a small gateway in the mountains so they can't get surrounded. There's more to the story than that, but that's all you really have to know.<br/><br/>""300"" is truly a guy movie. The beginning is somewhat slow, but halfway through until the very end, it's just non-stop, graphic, brutal violence. Not that I'm complaining, I liked it. What makes the violence bearable and not over the edge is the fact that none of it is real; all of the blood and gore is computer generated, making it look more comic-book than ""Saving Private Ryan"" this-is-what-the-insides-of-a-human-actually-look-like graphic imagery.

You become desensitized to the violence, and say ""Well, they already killed thousands...What's wrong if this half-naked guy kills another 1,500?""<br/><br/>What puts asses in the seats for this movie really is the visual effects and cinematography. I remember two or three shots that really made the movie: they were 60 second, slow-motion, uncut shots during the battle sequences that reminded me of the bullet-time shot used in ""The Matrix"". Those shots alone made me want to watch the movie again; the choreography was just awesome. As I was saying before about seeing ""300"" in a good theater, the sound was very good and a huge screen would be appropriate for watching this major spectacle. Another plus is that the new trailers for ""Grindhouse"" and ""Spider-Man 3"" appear before the film. So in the end, everybody wins.<br/><br/>My recommendation: if you love blood and guts and ""Gladiator"" or ""The Matrix"" are one of your favorites, you have to see this gore-fest. If you're in the mood for a passionate, provocative, intelligent thriller with a fantastically good script, stay home and rent Borat or something."

","I'm a bit disappointed by this movie. I expected more after I saw the trailers. The movie visually entertained me, but hasn't touched my feelings. The movie really lacks deep and entertaining story along with characters development. I haven't felt that this is a real movie ¬ñ it's just a comics adoption and, unfortunately, you have to treat it this way. I've never been a fan of comics, maybe that's why the movie didn't impress me much. Other movies in this genre such as Gladiator or Troy kick this movie ass easy, in my opinion. However, visually this movie looks beautifully. Cinematography is done excellently. You will see Matrix-like effects of moving camera. I saw the digital version of this movie and counting the visual beauty of this movie I suggest see it digitized. The backgrounds in the movie are really catching eye. They are enjoyable. Every single shot detail in the picture looks sharp, bright and beautifully art-designed. Make-up on actors is excellently done as well. Rock music in the movie during the battles really rocks! But in my opinion the music could be more aggressive to correspond to the movie's brutality.<br/><br/>Overall, I give to the movie 8 of 10 supporting visually excellently done work."

"ThreeEleven311am","7","0","4","12 March 2007"," 300 Good! But not great.
","First of all, 300 is a good movie. It is definitely worth seeing on the big screen. I'd suggest seeing it on IMAX if it is available near you.<br/><br/>Frank Miller's new graphic-novel-turned-movie is just as expected. Beautiful-yet-violent images and scenery with lots of action. There are a handful of fight scenes and they are all pretty cool. There is very little ""real"" blood in the movie, as it is nearly all CGI... but with most all of the movie filmed with blue screen, who cares? 300 is based on the story of a group of 300 Spartans that set out against the Persian army using a strategy that would ensure an eventual victory. Surprisingly, Frank Miller's retelling of these events is fairly accurate. Of course, there are the few Miller-esquire twists that don't make sense, are out of place, are just there to be weird, or are there to make the detail of the scene that much more beautiful... but the ones that don't seem to make any sense are few and don't hurt the original story. Aside from these, the story follows along with history pretty close, which is, at least, a big plus in my book.<br/><br/>The fight scenes are action-packed when they show up and there's hardly anything missing in terms of ""how can I make this action sequence that much more amazing?"" But within these fight scenes is also where this movie lost points with me. I'd also like to say I'd personally give it a 6.5, not a 7.<br/><br/>While the fight scenes are definitely full of action... they are also very repetitive. There's hardly a change in formula from fight scene to fight scene and some of the camera styles (slow motion for the most part) are overused. I understand that is was literally a frame-by-frame recreation of the book... but come on guys! You are allowed to Hollywood it up a little for the sake of the film.<br/><br/>A very small gripe I had with the film is that there were a few characters that were introduced but were not elaborated upon. I was left saying ""Hey! I wanna know more about that guy! What does he do? Can he fight? I wanna see him fight!!"" Disregard anything about overzealous violence or gore. There are a few chopped off heads and limbs but nothing worse. There is really only one scene with questionable sexual material but it is a short scene and it isn't overdone by any means.<br/><br/>Overall, this was a good film with great art direction. A little heavy on a certain group of effects and quite a bit of repetition within the fight scenes but there is enough interesting material between the repetition and familiar effects to keep you interested for close to 2 hours. Well worth the $5-10 to see it in theaters on a large screen.<br/><br/>6.5 out of 10."
"satiricalharpy","8","0","3","11 March 2007"," If you have a penchant for gory films, an enjoyable way to spend two hours.
","I have to say, had I not seen this movie opening night in a jam-packed theater while sitting next to a group of Spartan-armor-clad-fanboys, I would have probably witnessed something that did not live up to the hype. However, for that night and that audience, it completely did, and really... isn't that the point? When an audience cheers after every decapitation, catcalls during every soft core sex scene, and lets out a collective ""OH!"" when a faceless Persian gets skewered in his nether regions, you're going to have a good time.<br/><br/>And all of that is due to the fact that the movie lived up to its promise: deliver two hours of highly stylized and obscenely bloody battle scenes with the occasional bit of humanity and humor.<br/><br/>In my opinion, Gerard Butler's acting carried the majority of the film. Even when facing the unintentionally comical Xerxes, he brightens the screen with his witty delivery and fierce passion. A far cry from the past movies I've witnessed him in, but still unquestionably talented.<br/><br/>Less responsible for my enjoyment of the movie was Lena Headey. While I wouldn't go as far as to say she was miscast, I felt she fell short of her own ability. She seemed weak in her delivery, falling victim to her bland and overused clich√©s (""freedom is not free"", ""what would a free man do?"", ""fight for liberty, justice, law and order, blah blah blah), whereas Butler was able to make his similarly unoriginal dialogue seem fresh.<br/><br/>David Wenham, per usual, was fantastic, providing an original and interesting voice for the narration.<br/><br/>The cinematography, the CG effects (except perhaps a few slip-ups with Xerxes' height and point of focus), and particularly the score all worked in harmony with the story to make it an enjoyable and at times exhilarating two hours.<br/><br/>If you're expecting an epic, a break-through film, or anything remotely historically accurate, you'll be sorely disappointed. But if you've got an open mind, a penchant for violence, and a few hours to kill, it'll make for good entertainment."
"sullibrandon","7","0","2","11 March 2007"," A Bloody Epic Battle
","The new Frank Miller graphic novel epic brought to life on the big screen can be summed up the three B's on man movies: Blood, Boobs, and Bangin.<br/><br/>To call 300 anything more than what it aspires to be would be a disgrace to its filmmakers. If anyone, at any time, during the production of this film, honestly said to themselves, ""you know, we could win an Oscar for best picture for this movie!"", then I'd honestly hand over my left kidney to them. Anybody with a brain knows that 300 is not about the heart, but the brawn. The film takes place in ancient Greece, following the Spartans and their king, Leonidas, as they struggle to push off the yoke of an oppressive Persian Emperor. One day a messenger from the Persian emperor comes to Sparta reminding Leonidas that he must pay tribute to the oppressor. Leonidas refuses, killing the messenger and thus angering all of Persia, who come to his doorstep to return the favor. Leonidas is meant to come off as brave, valiant, and a true warrior, but much of the time he merely comes off as foolish. When he is about to kill the messenger, the messenger says, ""This is madness!"" to which Leonidas defiantly replies, ""THIS IS SPARTA!"" while I thought there thinking, ""Okay, impressive, but still, kind of stupid of him."" As most anyone knows, 300 is about a valiant group of Spartan warriors who stood their ground against thousands for Persian forces, ultimately losing, but paving the way for a defeat of Persian armies later. Without the sacrifice of those 300, the defeat of the army would have been impossible. All these themes of sacrifice, memory, honor, and courage serve well to somehow justify all the blood being splattered in our faces, and they do get a rise out of the audience, but they are still quite clearly slapped on there. We can't kid ourselves. It's all about the ass-kicking.<br/><br/>And unfortunately, 300 doesn't get truly ass-kicking until about an hour or so in, which is a strong detriment to the film. I came to see Persians getting the crap kicked out of them, and yes, though I do appreciate a backstory and a build-up to the main action, much of the emotional posturing could have been done without. The audience knows they didn't some to see some powerful Shakespearean love story of war and betrayal. They came to to see blood flying and unabashed gore. 300, on this front, does not completely deliver. True, there is a lot of sweet action and fantastic visual effects, but it takes a long time to build-up to them, and whenever the action diverges back to the town of Sparta or to the camp of Xerxes, the Persian emperor, I got restless and wished they would just move on with the action. Political movements behind the scenes in Sparta abounded, but they seemed entirely pointless, and even if they weren't, we did not need to see that much. Xerxes's base camp was laughable in it sheer lesbian debauchery. I just sat there shaking my head at the silliness of it all, wishing I could get back to what I had come for: blood.<br/><br/>All this being said, what relatively little action there is is done amazingly well. The many battle scenes are breathtaking, captivating, eviscerating, and mind-blowingly spectacular. They are not hampered by a PG-13 rating like Lord of the Rings, and thus, there is no limit to where they can go. A man's head can be sliced off directly in front of the camera, fall off, and go tumbling past so that I can see flesh and bone fly by. There are several sliced heads, severed limbs, and plenty of interesting splatter effects from the blood, which I never got tired of seeing. And it's not just constant splattering either. The choreography and camera-work in the battle scenes is quite well accomplished. Every single man in the 300 is digitally enhanced so that they have six packs and pecs like Arnold Schwarzenegger - quite the accomplishment, though sometimes I just laughed at how ludicrous it was. This, though, combined with the blood spatters, the cool cinematography, and the color-palette, all combined to make a visually fascinating experience.<br/><br/>The acting was surprisingly good, too - nothing Oscar-worthy, but every performed in a rousing, screaming, bloody, melodramatic way that it fit the Spartan world perfectly. Gerard Butler as Leonidas portrays the Spartan king perfectly, screaming all the way. He carries a LOT of charisma, too, and steals every single scene that he is. Dominic West as Theron, another main warrior, is well played too, but of special note is David Wenham, who played Faramir in the Lord of the Rings, and plays Dilios to perfection in 300. Every other performance is everything you'd expect from this type of movie - boring, over-the-top, and predictable. Rodrigo Santoro is almost laughable as Xerxes - he comes off as a flamboyant jewelry-obsessed pansy more than a powerful world conqueror.<br/><br/>300 was based on a graphic novel, so the reason for its visual style is clear, a graphic novel that was created by the same man who penned and drew Sin City, the film version of which I found far less satisfying than 300. I always found Sin City to be nothing more than black and white hedonistic trash. Nothing was special about it at all except its style. It didn't even have cool action. It was all just a depressing and decrepit picture. 300, on the other hand, manages to contain BOTH style and amazing action. The story is still nothing special, but it's only a vehicle for the violence, so who really cares? Like I said, blood, boobs, and bangin'."

"LadyLiberty","8","0","6","11 March 2007"," 300 Makes (Movie) History New Again
","300 takes us back to about 500 years before the birth of Christ to a time when men who dreamed of conquering the world ¬ó at least what was known of it ¬ó could actually do so. At that time, the all powerful conqueror was Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro), a man whose ego may have been the only thing bigger than his substantial army. As Xerxes made his way across the Mediterranean leaving subjugated peoples in his wake, he set his sights on Greece.<br/><br/>The city-states that then made up modern day Greece had varying reactions to becoming targets. A few simply agreed to annex themselves to Xerxes' rapidly growing kingdom. But among those that refused Xerxes' emissaries was the small region called Sparta. Ruled by King Leonidas (Gerard Butler) and his Queen, Gorgo (Lena Headey), Sparta was known for the caliber of its fighting men as much as for its pride.<br/><br/>King Leonidas petitioned his priests for their blessing before battle, but the priests consulted with an oracle whose confusing message was interpreted by them to mean Sparta should not fight. Because Spartan law required that the king obey the priests, Leonidas gathered up a few hundred of his best men and called them his ""bodyguards."" Tongue in cheek, Leonidas announced that he was ""going for a walk,"" and he and his bodyguards departed for the coastal ""hot gates"" (named for the hot springs nearby) in the hopes they might funnel Xerxes' army into the narrow pass there.<br/><br/>Allying himself with a few men of like mind (some 700 Thespians among them), Leonidas commanded a force that might have totaled 3,000 at its peak. Formulating a battle plan, he prepared to face an army whose numbers are estimated to have been anywhere from 200,000 to two million soldiers strong.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, back at home, Queen Gorgo is doing all that she can to urge the ruling Council to send forces to bolster her husband's stand. She maneuvers with the politically-astute Theron (Dominic West) to gain his support for her efforts, but even as Leonidas faces betrayal from within, Gorgo also has to deal with those whose greed outweighs all else. She is among the few who, along with the king, knows full well that a victory for Xerxes means far more than a change of allegiance. Instead, it means the loss of everything Spartan, including first and foremost real freedom.<br/><br/>Gerard Butler is as loud and defiant as you'd expect King Leonidas to be, and Lena Headey presents a flawless portrait of a wife who is really just as brave and stoic as her husband. Vincent Regan and David Wenham are terrific soldiers under Leonidas' command, and Andrew Tiernan manages despite substantial prosthetic effects to convey the desperation as well as the twisted greed of the deformed Ephialtes. Rodrigo Santoro, meanwhile, is transformed with the aid of make-up and computer magic to a man one might actually believe has some godhood running through his veins.<br/><br/>Director Zack Snyder does a good job (though there are moments I felt Leonidas' mood was too instantly volatile and some edits too abrupt), particularly when it comes to some of the most amazing camera techniques I've ever seen. There are repeated instances of slow motion that are jaw-dropping, and camera angles that add immeasurably to the scope of the battle scenes. When you put that talent together with a good cast and CGI work unlike anything I've ever seen, 300 is more than a little impressive on screen. The CGI is so good, that even the water looks real let alone the stony cliffs of the ""hot gates."" The battle scenes are flawlessly rendered amidst background action you'd swear was really there; the graphic wounds and deaths are as real as can be (with a couple of lamentable exceptions which, in the midst of so much brilliance, are almost forgivable).<br/><br/>The only real flaw I saw in 300 is a script (co-written by Snyder) that could have been quite a bit better. The dialog is often stilted in its attempt to sound something like the ancient Greeks might have spoken (though there are moments of sheer genius), and the story occasionally proceeds in something of a ""herky-jerky"" fashion. 300 could have been better, I think, its message was as good as it gets.<br/><br/>King Leonidas rallied his soldiers in the film by saying, ""A new age has come, an age of freedom. And all will know that 300 Spartans gave their last breath to defend it."" 2,500 years after the fact, we still know. That's one hell of a legacy for liberty, and one I think not enough people can know enough about.<br/><br/>FAMILY SUITABILITY: 300 is rated R for ""graphic battle sequences throughout, some sexuality and nudity."" 300 is unequivocally not for small children. The blood and gore alone is substantial, and much of the subject matter is quite adult. Remember, though, that 300 is based on a graphic novel which is often the bailiwick of the teen-aged boy. Given their pre-existing exposure to such pictures and plot lines, I believe that most 14 year-olds would be perfectly fine.<br/><br/>That being said, given the lessons offered up by 300, I'd hope that the movie gets a broad exposure and that you take what you learn to heart enough that you take the time to learn more. Leonidas died a long, long time ago, but his courage can still inspire. Here's hoping that it does."

The real Spartans were a strange bunch. They were a harsh warrior culture coupled with a latent sense of ancient Greek enlightenment, and the movie did a good job of portraying this dichotomy. OK, so maybe they concentrated on the warrior culture part, but like I said, this is a comic-book movie. And those battle scenes were absolutely beautiful in a gory, flesh rending way.

Some facts are told,like how every baby who was deformed was thrown of a cliff, and the male children were sent to a barracks at age 7. Spartans were the best soldiers of their time.

","I just got back from seeing 300 in a sold-out theater.<br/><br/>They got the culture of the Spartans right: Boys are taken from their families and serve in the military with only minor contact with their families until they are 30. They are often married in absentia, visit their wives for short overnight visits. They sometimes didn't know their sons, as sometimes the sons turn 7 before the fathers reach 30 - the lives of young trainees and soldiers didn't cross. The great leaders stay on in the military as generals.<br/><br/>The rights granted to Spartan women were a source of friction between Sparta and Athens, Spartan women could inherit land and speak in the Assembly, mostly because the men were so busy being soldiers there was little other choice. They even had a ""Women's Olympics"" and trained the women in defensive fighting - a rather realistic people they were, the women could defend themselves if they have to. Sparta's treatment of women was highly uncharacteristic of the time or region.<br/><br/>I thought the film was a great comic-book re-telling of a historic battle. They went a little overboard with the ""make the enemy into monsters"" thing, rather literally. It was more LotR Orc-type fantasy than history, but it worked for the story.<br/><br/>Gory. Way, way gory. But somehow all those half-naked Spartan soldiers with the incredible pecs and six-pack abs never got any blood on them. Unless of course the storyline calls for it.<br/><br/>300 has an epic fantasy feel to it, the filmmakers never bothered to try to make it look real, it is a comic-book come to life. It is not a film that cares about details, the Persian Army is a mass of distant figures and lights and tents. It is bigger than life, and grittier than dirt. 300 is a film that is about the big picture. The distant Persian Army is massive, so massive it's numbers and individuals don't matter. All that matters is these few Spartan soldiers who stand between the Persians and their home."
"john-quel","8","0","3","10 March 2007"," Porno-history -- it works, but there are problems
","First the good news. The movie looks every bit as good as you would have hoped. The performances are surprising effective, with Gerard Butler doing an outstanding job holding the film together. If he had faltered, the 300 would have been in big trouble. Butler brilliantly conveys the impression of a first-rate leader, a man whose men would follow him anywhere. This is acting that never gets nominated, but it is still great acting. Note to casting: every time you are thinking of George Clooney, get this guy instead. You'll have a much better movie.<br/><br/>Finally, while people can and do complain about the historical accuracy, it's actually close enough so that the essence of the story comes through and to be fair (this movie must have just missed an NC-17), and there's no reason to be squeamish about it -- the real battles and atrocities must have been every bit as gory.<br/><br/>And yet, for all that, I was disappointed. The subject is so inherently dramatic, I have to wonder why Miller felt compelled to put in so much pornographic imagery, including his signature composition -- the beautiful girl being ravished by the hideously ugly creature(s). Psychologically, I think I understand the gimmick -- the readers of such graphic novels being mostly adolescent boys or such ""at heart"" that they are eager to have it both ways: being ""shocked and indignant"" at such repulsive actions while at the same time wondering: ""How can I get such a deal?"" A little bit of this stuff goes a long way, but it seems that Miller piles it on. Admittedly, I kept hoping the Oracle would return. She (an enthralling Kelly Craig who really needs to get more work) was awfully cute and her advice couldn't be any worse than what your broker gives you.<br/><br/>But the bigger issue may be that these images are so overpowering as stills, that they impede the movie's flow. This is a serious problem for a movie like this where flow and movement is everything. It is a credit to everyone involved, and I am especially singling out Butler again, that they keep the thing from stumbling upon the grotesque. 300 was often like a meal with way too many spices. Palatable, but it could have been better."

The plot was so-so leaving some boring scenes. The acting is good enough to keep you into the movie. My only problem is that none of it was great! Just before the movie my friend was saying that he hopes there's a scene in the movie that's better then the opening scene in TROY when Brad Pitt strikes his enemy in the shoulder/neck area. After seeing the film, I have to say it is better then Troy but it lacked great scenes like the one mentioned above. I was expecting more from the visuals especially since I know how creative the man behind Sin-City can be. The acting by the king was phenomenal however after him the acting can be described as good but for the most part was only so-so. In the non-action scenes I found myself bored just waiting for the next battle sequence. I think my main problem with the movie was lack of character development, it's hard to really care for the characters when you don't really know them, its the problem with most epic movies! In the end many people will love the film because of the great action, but if you care about more film aspects then you'll find many flaws with the film."

","Finally, a movie worthy to stand next to Braveheart and Gladiator in Americans' DVD collections, and a performance by Gerard Butler that will be remembered on the same epic scale as Mel's and Russel's. 300 tells an awesome story in an awesome way. The cinematography is unprecedented. Frank Miller's dialog is tight and powerful. Every person who sees this movie will remember a quote worthy of repeating in real life. Beyond that, the message the Spartans send to the Persians, as well as the one this movie sends to the audience, is as important today as it was 2300 years ago. Anyone who gives this movie anything less than 8 stars is a liberal trying to suppress viewership. See 300, even if you have to hack through 10,000 Persian Immortals to get to your seat. Also read the novel about the battle of Thermopylae written by Steven Pressfield, called ""The Gates of Fire."""

","If you like bloody and gory movies, go see this movie. If you like the old Greek wars and warfare before guns were invented, go see this movie. If you don't like either of these, don't see this movie, but you might want to reconsider. Possibly one of the best movies I have seen in the last 3 years, and the special effects and stunt sequences are amazing. The tone of the movie really sets the mood and the characters suck you completely into the plot of the movie itself. Some of the scenes in the movie aren't for the faint of heart, either, as there is blood and gore galore in this movie. Yes, I'm talking decapitation and blood everywhere, but surprisingly, there was little to no swearing- or if there was, it is so well done, that it seamlessly integrates into the conversation so that you don't even realize that the character cursed. <br/><br/>The Bottom Line: GO SEE THIS MOVIE, RIGHT NOw"

","I loved the movie and looking back on it I cannot think of a single thing about it I did not like, but somehow I cannot give it higher than a 7. The action scenes were beyond amazing and I actually enjoyed how much historically accurate some of the stuff was. Everything from the quote ""come back with your shield or on it"" which is an actual phrase Spartans said to each other when they went to battle, to the battle formations that they used. The acting was what I expected and everything lived up to my expectation, but the movie did not seem to flow as well as it could have. This may be the first time that I think the editing actually took away from the movie. All of the action sequences were beyond bad-ass, but the scenes did not flow into each other that well. The scene where Butler's and Headley's character make love seemed over the top, but looking back at it I realized it was them saying good bye to each other, but it was not obvious in the moment. I did not expect the Spartans to leave the next day and it seemed as if they could have made the impact of their final good bye more powerful. I have to mention that this is one of the best looking films I have seen in a long time and it did an amazing job of creating an entirely new world based in our world and went well with the tone of the movie. The movie being loosely based in reality, but the movie was more of an excuse to have some beautiful images (some of them extremely gory) set to some powerful emotions. I think everyone should see this movie, because it is one of the best looking films out there, but it did not quite do it for me and I think it was the editing."

","The superlatives are almost endless and much can be said for the dynamics of the visual effects. This is a most enjoyable film. Cast and script are superb not to mention the fact that this was filmed in an aircraft hanger with ""blue screen."" I think that sound , music and visuals to be best appreciated, one must go to ""I-MAX"" and get the most of it. Only one complaint...The movie devotes much to much attention to the battle scenes and left out significant historical info that could have made our appreciation of it all the more elevated. Definitely one of this year's best. Along with the timing of this film several documentaries have been released that give the viewer the added facts that make this viewer wanting of the film-maker to tie together more of the history that would have made the ""300"" a much more appreciated docudrama. All in all I still have nothing but praise for it. Go see it!"
"kim-andrewj","9","0","6","10 March 2007"," Best Greco/Roman Film since Gladiator
","Not since Russell Crowe delivered a knockout performance in 2000 as Maximus in Gladiator has a movie that takes us back thousands of years in history been so fascinating. This movie has stunning visuals; it almost seems surreal with the shading/lighting and special effects but regardless it looks great. Gerard Butler has catapulted himself into the higher echelon of Hollywood actors with his great and forceful portrayal of King Leonidas. Although it was a great movie with some epic battle scenes that keep you tuned in all the way, I thought it was a bit slow going at points but other than that it was awesome and should not be overlooked. (which would be nearly impossible with all the hype it has been getting for a good reason)"
"jzappa","7","0","6","10 March 2007"," The Official, Undeniable Setting of New Standards
","I have never seen such battle sequences as riveting, emotionally engulfing, as wonderful as the ones that make up three hefty quarters of 300. For example, most epics have grandiose shots of men with shields and sharp weapons, seen from this perspective as a cacophony of blemishes, clashing together and fighting to the death. In 300, we are brought face to face with the very heart of the clashing itself, everything around us rumbling to a deafening degree, every clanking of heavy steel heard as clear as crystal, and we experience the true savagery and raw, bare-faced absence of any sort of grace, knowing each character's fear as much as they are feeling it. Each battle sequence draws pure hatred from us, the audience, for the enemies, and desperate worry for the defense of the three hundred Spartan men. The film is a lush, passionate painting of historical and fantastical violence. It provokes emotion, desperation, and teenage appreciation for its extreme cool.<br/><br/>The film sets new standards for cinematography. Seamlessly interwoven with computer- generated images, the grittiness, the chiseled, perpetually tan-gold-and-red-scorched screen is a wonder to look at. It's difficult to take your eyes away for any reason. As a lover of atmosphere in any art, being film, literature, paintings, et cetera, I found 300 to be incredibly juicy, oozing with some of the richest moods and visually emotional backdrops ever captured in a movie that I've seen. I have never seen a movie so in its own world and hypnotic to the audience, drawing us into this very unique place.<br/><br/>Gerard Butler, the dark, magnetic actor who plays the lead role of King Leonidas in a career- making performance, is almost as dazzling to watch as the landscapes and battle sequences. This film marks an inscrutable breakthrough for him. However, it is his presence that in a way may be what draws the sporadic corniness, mostly early on, of the Spartans being directed in a way that makes them cool in that way that makes pretenders out of teenagers.<br/><br/>It's always made me furious to see soldiers killing enemies' horses to immobilize the enemies. When the majority of the time is spent spearing men so that they fall off of their horses, it is made perfectly clear that there is not good reason to cut down a horse for the sake of immobilizing, and even having yet to kill, the rider. Also, If the Spartans' iron shields are not deterred by powerful attacks of enemy swords and spears, then how can arrows make gaping chinks in them?<br/><br/>Overall however, 300 is unforgettable. In a time when you forget even a great film that you saw last night once you've awakened the next morning, 300, while not a great film, is that brash and immediate contradiction."

","300, an amazing feat, and a very well done movie, it will keep you enticed, and you will find yourself extricated from your seat to a place where myth was origin, and origin was life or death.<br/><br/>Spartans as a whole were ruthless and this movie fully grasps their brutality and displays it beautifully on the big screen. Captivated I felt myself moving closer and closer to the screen, just as the major battle occurs.<br/><br/>Gripping and compelling, this movie is one of those rare amazing movies that anyone can watch. If you love ancient Greece and Spartan warfare, this movie is for you.<br/><br/>The movies special effects and scenery were absolutely well done and textured very well, almost letting the viewer feel like he is part of a war.<br/><br/>The acting was also very well done and the actors and actresses gave a sense of occlusion as to their lives making them seem very brutal and sickeningly macabre.<br/><br/>9/10 Turner, over and out"
"user-13543","10","0","5","10 March 2007"," Film Review: 300
","Wasn't it just a little while ago that so-called ""green screen"" movies, movies shot entirely on green sound stages so as to add completely computer generated everything later on, were regarded as unusual? I remember when Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow's very existence was owed to the fact that it looked like nothing you'd ever seen. Ah, but then came Star Wars II and Star Wars III and most importantly Sin City and it was no longer enough to look like a barrel of gold monkeys, now you had to tell a good story to boot. Because, all complaints about the Star Wars films aside, they were exciting action films and Sin City, that's some kind of freakin' masterpiece that is. Finally, the actual look of a comic book had been translated perfectly to screen, not just some goofy over-colored, camp nonsense they called ""comic book"" but the REAL look and feel of a graphically original set of stories.

"muzzah2004","10","0","4","10 March 2007"," From Greek History to Comic Book to Big Screen
","The story of the 300 Spartans that fought against Xerxes at Thermopylae has always been my favorite story from just about all of history. From the time I first saw a tidbit of a trailer for this movie to the time I saw the movie I was very excited about this. I praise Frank Miller for not allowing this story to have a 'deus ex machina' ending, rather it stuck to the story of Leonidas and to how he portrays it through his comic. The fight scenes are amazing, great effects, and I loved how the movie was shot. Great cinematic effects, speeches, and casting. This movie is a home run smashed out of the park in a bloody mess of violence and great story telling."
"surf_boy73","9","0","5","9 March 2007"," A film that will set the tone
","I saw this movie opening day in IMAX, and i must say that is spectacular. The acting isn't as good as i would hope from a movie like this, but it sufficed. Gerard Butler and Lena Hedley did an amazing job among the actors and actresses.<br/><br/>When i first herd about how most of the film was going to be in slow motion i was a little skeptical, but after seeing the film i realized the amazing dramatic effect that it added to the movie.<br/><br/>This film has made me realize how pathetic our civilization has become. We fight battles with no skill except the ability to press a button, when Spartans have trained a life time for a cause that they deeply believe in and cause that would make them happy to die for. And i think that it takes a huge shot at political systems as well. Promoting ability for man to be free.<br/><br/>The only thing left to say is to watch this movie, you will leave the theater with more then you payed for. Especially if you see it in IMAX"
"msterkek6969","10","0","5","9 March 2007"," Best Movie Ever! Without a doubt.
","From beginning to end, this was the best movie I have ever seen. Not even one thing was wrong with this movie. I'm not going to sum up the plot or tell about events, but just my opinion of how everyone should see this movie. I saw it in the IMAX theater on opening night and it was the only movie in the theater I have ever spent money on that I truly don't feel ripped off by the $15 or so it cost(about $5 more than in local theaters). The battle scenes are amazing, just the coolest and most action packed fights. Full of gore and fighting, and even truly great ""speeches"" about the spartan way and justice that should be absorbed into everyone's beliefs as they are talks of true justice and doing what one must for freedom. If you don't like this movie I don't even know what to say to you, unless it's because of the ""violence"", which I would call ""necessary violence""."
