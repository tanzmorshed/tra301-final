","People have complained that this is a horror movie filled with horror movie clichés. But how could it not be? I mean is it suppose to be a horror movie at the local shopping mall? No, of course it is in a haunted house, were else would it be? As much as this movie drew on the horror standards, I found it refreshingly different from most horror movies. Part of what I want from a movie is something different, not more of the same, and I think in that respect, all things considered, this movie delivered.<br/><br/>While it did make use of the standards like jump scares, I really felt the suspense of this movie. I mean, at least for me, this movie was wound very tight. The suspense was ratcheted to the limit.<br/><br/>While I'm still not past Daniel Radcliffe's voice, I still hear Harry or Daniel, his face and body language were spot on, and greatly added to the tension of the movie.<br/><br/>In the end, it is what it is, a suspenseful horror movie that gets the job done. This isn't a genre noted for 'Academy Award' performances. But as suspenseful horror movies go, I was very satisfied with this one, and thought they did have a new approach to an old genre.<br/><br/>Steve B"
"hitchcockthelegend","9","142","187","12 February 2012"," Old fashioned spooker delivering on its perilous period promise.
","The Woman in Black is directed by James Watkins and adapted to screenplay by Jane Goldman from Susan Hill's novel of the same name. It stars Daniel Radcliffe, Ciarán Hinds and Janet McTeer. Music is scored by Marco Beltrami and cinematography by Tim Maurice-Jones. Plot has Radcliffe as young London solicitor Arthur Kipps, who is sent to the North East village of Crythin Gifford to clear up the affairs of deceased woman Mrs. Drablow. When he arrives he finds that the memory of Drablow, and her remote house of Eel Marsh, holds the village in a grip of fear, particularly those who have children.....<br/><br/>It's fitting that that bastion of British horror, Hammer Studios, should be behind this delightful period ghost story. For this positively oozes old fashioned values, harking back to all those wonderful spookers set around a creepy village that featured an even creepier castle or mansion at its core. More presently, the film has kindred links to the likes of The Orphanage, The Others and The Changeling, while the vengeful spirit acting out of Eel Marsh House is pumped by J-Horror like blood and Darkness Falls' Wraith bitch nastiness. So clearly The Woman in Black is not a fresh arrival to the horror splinter where the ghost story resides. However, great period ghost story films are in short supply, and Watkins' film most assuredly is a great entry in the sub-genre.<br/><br/>Propelling it forward is Watkins' (Eden Lake) excellent sense of mood and crafting of palpable unease. Quite often the better ghost story films are better because they operate on a what you don't see is what scares you more level, Watkins has managed to keep that aspect of his film whilst also giving us enough of the truly terrifying spirit to jolt us in our seats; often showing her to us and not to Radcliffe's Kipps! When the shocks come, and there are many and they are bona fide underwear soiling, they act as merciful releases from the built up dread, but then when Watkins doesn't deliver a shock, we are left waiting uneasily, darting our eyes all over the expansive frame, searching fruitlessly for a glimpse of something troubling. Did that wind up toy move? Is that a pallid face we just glimpsed in the shadows? That damn rocking chair is the scariest there has ever been! And on it goes....<br/><br/>A film such as this is only as good as the production design and setting for the story. Thankfully Watkins and his team have nailed it there as well. Eel Marsh House exteriors are Cotterstock Hall in Northamptionshire, perfectly foreboding, while the beautiful village of Halton Gill in the Yorkshire Dales gets a Hammer Horror make over to become Crythin Gifford. But it's with the interior of the house where the makers excel, an utterly unforgiving and upsetting place, brilliantly under lit by Tim Maurice-Jones for maximum scary effect.<br/><br/>On the acting front the film rests solely on the shoulders of Radcliffe, and he comes up trumps. Initially its awkward accepting him as the father of a young boy, and once he gets to Crythin Gifford he is dwarfed by all the other adults who live there, but once the Victorian setting envelopes him the awkwardness evaporates and the characterisation becomes more realistic and easy to sympathise with. The character is changed from the book, meaning Radcliffe has to carry inner torment as well as exuding an outer coat of trepidation blended with stoic fear. It should be noted that for much of the picture he is acting on his own, reacting to the house and the overgrown gardens and marshes, in short he is terrific and it augers well for his adult acting career. In support Hinds and McTeer are pillars of professionalism, with McTeer's Mrs. Daily a creepy character in her own right, but it's also another neat meditation on grief that sits alongside Arthur Kipps'.<br/><br/>The ending is also changed from that in the novel, and it's already proving to be divisive. How you react to it, and it is up for a two-fold interpretation, may dampen your overall enjoyment of the picture? Personally I have no issue with it, I was still sunk in the cinema chair breathing heavily at that point! The certification and the presence of Radcliffe ensures that a teenage audience will flock to see it, many of whom will not get the ""horror"" film that they are after. Hopefully the word will get out that this really is only a film for those who love a good boo jump ghost story of old, that's its target audience, and that's the people whose reviews you should trust. 9/10"
"DinosaurAct86","9","178","251","3 February 2012"," One of my favorite horror theater experiences
","I am vividly aware, as are most avid moviegoers, of the horror movie machine. It churns out Final Destinations, exorcism films, and at an even higher frequency, ghost films. At first glance, The Woman in Black appears to be yet another of these ""ghost films,"" where cheap scares, predictable plot ""twists,"" and horrible acting drag the viewer down into an hour-and-a-half maelstrom of mediocrity that can only end at the appearance of ""Directed by..."" <br/><br/>According to most of the reviewers thus far, The Woman in Black was a letdown. So perhaps it is because I went into the film with no expectations that I came out of it impressed and very, very shaken. I do not plan to explain the plot to you (many have done this already and there is a synopsis which does a far better job than I could), but I will argue in favor of how successfully scary this film was. Yes, it contains ghost film elements we have all seen before, but they are cleverly and patiently arranged so that the viewer becomes totally enveloped in atmospheric dread. Sure, there are ""jump"" scares, but these are also complimented by many shots which unfold slowly and effectively. It sometimes reminded me of the 1961 film, The Innocents, if that gives you a better idea. Radcliffe is also a worthy focal point of the film, keeping most of the fear and anticipation unspoken throughout.<br/><br/>I would not nominate this film for any kind of award, but it achieves what I believe should be the ultimate goal of all ""horror"" movies: to draw us in so close that when our fear manifests itself on-screen, it is already too late to turn away. It rates high as one of my favorite horror theater experiences, alongside The Descent and The Strangers."

","I can honestly say that I have really never been more terrified in a film. Not that I can remember. From the beginning of the film, the mood is set - something is horribly wrong. The screenplay was simply brilliant. The adaptation from stage to screen was highly successful, in my opinion. The scenic designer did a fantastic job with everything from the nursery to the town Kipps stays at. The directing was also something to be applauded. Over all, this film was wonderful and I would recommend it. And I must say, Dan Radcillffe did a great job. He may not be the most incredible actor, but he has really improved so much. It's most evident here because he could not hide behind words or a wand, he could use just his face and body language. They are an actor's tool after all. To be able to carry a film with body language is something to be commended. Few actors can.<br/><br/>On another note, I adored the fact they never hid the Woman in Black. They embraced her from the beginning, with little traces of a face in the windows as they were passed. The simplicity of the film was what I think made it so terrifying. There weren't blood and guts flying around with a poor sap strapped to an operating table while a deranged lunatic tries to connect him to the anus of another. It was a simple, yet effectively frightening, ghost story. I can say I loved every second of it.<br/><br/>If you love horror films, give it a go. This is the first film I've seen in quite some time that was worth my entire $10.00 to see it."
"yaegernick15","9","224","332","4 February 2012"," Finally a scary movie!
","I went in to seeing this movie after reading the book, and personally I thought it was great. Horror movies these days get loss in blood and gore and that's what the work thinks is ""horror"" these days, thankfully this movie took a turn to what horror actually is. There are plenty of scenes that make you jump and keep you on the edge of your seat and the storyline is great too. The only weird thing was there were just a couple scenes in which I just couldn't help but think of Harry potter but that didn't even come close to ruining it for me. I was nervous because I thought they Showed all the scary moments through the previews but they did not! Daniel Radcliffe did a great job and I would go see it again with out a doubt. We need to see more horror movies like this one!"

","The film did not disappoint! In a day and age where a scary movie is about ""how much blood can squirt out of a body and how far can it go"", it is refreshing to see this good old fashioned romp around a haunted house.<br/><br/>Things jump out at the right moments, the imagery is creepy and disturbing. All the right makings to have people of all ages pulling their hoodies down over their faces.<br/><br/>The ending was Hollywoodized, but the move holds onto it's simple scary imaginative fun.<br/><br/>...and the house is spectacular!...as is it's location."
"dfranzen70","8","91","142","12 February 2012"," Positive evocation of Dracula and other period Hammer films
","Creepy and off-putting, The Woman in Black really is a terrific thriller. It's intended to shock, and in many scenes it is successful. It's a moody, psychologically scarring throwback to the old Roger Corman movies based on Edgar Allan Poe stories, with an amazing adult performance by Daniel Radcliffe as a young lawyer out of his depth. <br/><br/>Arthur Kipps (Radcliffe), a down-on-his-luck attorney, is asked to travel to a remote village and find out if a recently deceased woman has left any heretofore unknown wills. It's Kipps' last shot at success, his employer sternly warns him. His journey to the village is eerily similar to that undertaken by Jonathan Harker in Bram Stoker's Dracula. Something's not quite right with the town, which clearly doesn't want him around, something to do with children being murdered and people blaming a dead woman. You know how it is.<br/><br/>Kipps' sleuthing leads to more and more questions. Who was the woman (ostensibly, his client), really? What relationship did she have with the town? And what of those treacherous marshes, and that long and winding road to the main house that is impassable when the tide is in? Why is it that every time Kipps turns around, a shadow darts away? Understanding that these are all staples of the great horror movies of yore doesn't mean that this film is stealing; it is merely authentically replicating the desolate atmosphere, in which a whisper can signal death.<br/><br/>I entered the theater knowing very little of the movie's content. Was it to be a mystery, and we'd find out who the titular woman was at some point? It is, and we do, but that is only part of the puzzle. The best horror movies, in my opinion, are the ones that build just the right amount of suspense and then pull the rug out from under the viewer. A slow buildup must have a satisfying payoff. Showing the evil the lurks in every other scene dilutes the fright quotient. This movie doesn't do that. It pulls no punches to our psyche. <br/><br/>It is so closely shot by Tim Maurice-Jones, who's best known for his work with Guy Ritchie. Maurice-Jones' style here is to capture almost every shot from Kipps' perspective, thus bringing the audience that much closer to the terror he's supposed to be feeling. Radcliffe, to his credit, never comes off as some innocent lad who's just starting out in the business, and although Kipps is perplexed - much like Edward Woodward's character in The Wicker Man - he is determined to see things through, even though he has strayed a bit from his original mission. <br/><br/>Something is definitely wrong here, and it involves the children. Are they to blame for the nefarious goings-on? Are their parents? No one is saying anything. To make matters worse for Kipps, he has a young son of his own, whose mother died in childbirth and who is coming to visit Kipps in a few days. The grief felt by the parents of the fallen children only heightens Kipps' own fears. <br/><br/>There are several moments that, on the Internet, would be called shock videos. Everything seems normal, and then BAM, something pops out of nowhere. In lesser movies, this might be seen as a crutch, a way to stun your senses to get a particular reaction, but here it all fits in, and it conveys mortal terror. The Woman in Black's identity is revealed very early in the film, so the mystery isn't who she is but why these events keep occurring. Is it all superstition, or is there something more to the spiritual aspect of the plot?<br/><br/>The ending is tidy and satisfying, but it is by no means conventional or predictable. In fact, it opens up even more questions. But more importantly, director James Watkins and screenwriter Jane Goldman (based on a book by Susan Hill) do not take the easy way out. People do not necessarily live happily ever after. Story threads are not necessarily sewn up tight. It is a riveting film steeped in a macabre atmosphere teeming with the potential of death with every slow approach to a corner or a locked door."
"robert_farrimond","4","30","43","27 February 2012"," The Woman In Black lacks one thing...
","I feel like I am the only person to feel this film was just okay. I so desperately wanted to like it but I couldn't get over one thing. <br/><br/>First of all, let me say how beautiful I think the film was technically, the visuals were a lot of the time stunning (despite children killing themselves left, right and centre). However, I struggled to get past the fact that it all seems done before, not that I mind this greatly, no but it really did hinder the film from being truly original. <br/><br/>When it came to the fact that 'The Woman in Black' was killing children, that's where I have a problem with this film. Whenever I watch a horror film, one of my favourite things is that visceral feel you get, feeling the character's feelings, being scared at the right points. Very early on in the film, it felt, we were told and realised that Daniel Radcliffe's character was effectively in no danger at all and that this 'ghost' was not after him at all. This to me, made it less scary, yes I did jump when the music became deafening and a woman's scream howled out to the audience but is that what really makes a good horror film?<br/><br/>Overall, I did not dislike this film but I fail to acknowledge the hype that has been built up around it. Daniel Radcliffe's performance is decent but nothing extraordinary, well done him though for continuing on in acting and not trying to be known just as Harry Potter, although that is already the case. The film offers many jumpy moments, which is to be expected but my favourite moment was the beginning, which to me, was the creepiest of them all."
"jackharding89-1","6","14","18","9 April 2012"," If there's one thing horror movies have taught us, it's that ghostly old dears and kids are a recipe for new underwear.
","30 years and several retools on from Susan Hill's now seminal pocket novel comes the big screen adaptation of The Woman in Black. Swapping the lingering, life-spanning impact of Hill's Dickensian book of the dead for a hollow yet effective house-of-horrors yarn that'll have you stirring in your seat- and out of it.<br/><br/>The film's set-up is more or less identical to the book but with a few baffling tweaks; Arthur Kipps (Daniel Radcliffe) is a solicitor and widowed father of one who's summoned to a remote town and manor on an eerie northern marshland where he's to settle the estate and will of a recently deceased old hag. Somethings wrong with the place, though. An ominous figure stalks and taunts and haunts the townspeople. A child falls whenever it is seen; a woman in black.<br/><br/>If there's one thing horror movies have taught us, it's that ghostly old dears and kids are a recipe for new underwear. And what do you know, The Woman in Black has them both in droves. All of which reside in a haunted, Victorian mansion in the middle of nowhere. The film charts Kipps' probe into the strange happenings from inside the damned estate in this simplistic yet effectual horror gem that's as playful and frightening as it is enjoyable.<br/><br/>As a stand-alone picture, director James (Eden Lake) Watkins' Woman in Black is as sound a horror of this ilk and purpose come; the haunted-house caper has been done to death then done again over the course of cinema's history. The Woman in Black is the best of its kind for quite some time. When measured against the book, though, it comes up short. Despite remaining faithful to its source through large parts and absolutely nailing the location, Jane Goldman's screenplay omits certain key scenes as well as the haunting bookends that made Hill's novel one the finest ghost stories of all time. Fans of the book will find it hard to fathom why these decisions were made. Maybe Goldman and Watkins wanted to stamp their own, uplifting mark on the tale. Shades of Kubrick's Shining? Not quite. I won't reveal what transpires in Hill's novel, but if the film had followed suite, it would've had greater substance and longevity.<br/><br/>Grafting Harry Potter onto its set-up ensured Watkins' film spun a profit before it hit a single screen. In an undemanding role that require Radcliffe tread cautiously and look scared, the boyish Brit does what's expected of him but fails to impress; to say he's believable as a father would be stupid. He isn't. If Radcliffe is looking to break free from his Potter persona, it's going to take a lot more than a 12A, British horror film to do the trick. Albeit a damn good one; the Evil Dead 2 a la Dickens without the gore, gut laughs and satire. Jumpy, jittery and fun. Yes, fun. The Woman in Black is by no means a black comedy but its clichéd set-up and slow-boiling pots of suspense are so well conceived and cooked you'll be scared silly and amused at the same time. Nervous laughter? You bet. Watkins' delays the unveiling of the shadow shrouded woman to the bitter-end but when we finally see the bitch, its no laughing matter.<br/><br/>Think The Shining without the depth. Think Paranormal Activity without the realism; a minimaliststic, nail-biting scare-fest primed for the big screen that joins the likes of The Others and The Village as well crafted mainstream horrors fit for young and old. See it."

","OK, I'll admit, I went into this film with not very high expectations, I left on the other hand pleasantly surprised and genuinely creeped out. Daniel Radcliffe, while not the best actor, also exceeded my expectations. The movie theater was packed and people really seemed to be enjoying themselves. People screamed when they were meant to and shivered accordingly. At the end the theater broke out in applause, and it was the most packed theater I've seen since the midnight premiere of Harry Potter and The Deathly Hallows Part 2. Walking out into the lobby people were still blown away, and I myself could not believe what just happened. So what I'm saying is, if you're looking for a fun night to be creeped out in an old fashioned horror film sort of way, go see the Woman In Black, you will not be disappointed."

","Daniel Radcliffe has definitely grown up from his days as Harry Potter. This movie is reminiscent of the 1970s Gothic horror films.

This is definitely a movie that has people jumping in their seats. It is not overdone, and each of the actors/actresses do a fine job. This is filmed on location at Layer Marney Tower in Essex England. The film was planned to be shot in 3D, but that plan was later scrapped. I am happy that it was scrapped because this film does not need that kind of theatrics. It's well written with a great plot and excellent acting."

His employer gives a last chance to him to keep his job, and he is assigned to travel to the remote village Cryphin Gifford to examine the documentation of the Eel Marsh House that belonged to the decently deceased Mrs. Drablow (Alisa Khazanova).

He also learns that the woman lost her son drowned in the mush and she seeks revenge taking the children of the scared locals. <br/><br/>""The Woman in Black"" is a dramatic horror film by Hammer with a good ghost story developed at a slow pace. The beginning is very similar to Bram Stoker's Dracula, when the young lawyer Jonathan Harker is sent to a remote village to a real estate business and has a cold reception by the villagers. <br/><br/>The vampire is replaced by the evil ghost of a woman in black that takes the children from the dwellers. The conclusion is a little disappointing but the film certainly makes the viewer startle many times along 95 minutes running time.

"RichardSRussell-1","4","50","92","8 February 2012"," Ho-Hum, Haunted House, Vengeful Spirit, Who Cares?
","The Woman in Black (1:35, PG-13) — fantasy: supernatural, 3rd string, formula<br/><br/>The Woman in Black is a standard haunted-house story (bereaved mother seeking vengeance for her dead child from beyond the grave), in this case with almost no dialog, just poor Daniel Radcliffe (as pre-WW1 solicitor Arthur Kipps) walking around said house looking grim.<br/><br/>During the course of the movie Radcliffe displays between about 0 and 2 days worth of Nixonian 5 o'clock shadow, not monotonically increasing, as one would expect, but rather coming and going to the point where I was spending more time watching that than paying attention to the plot. Really bad continuity here, making you wonder why they didn't think this thru in advance, or at a minimum clean it up in post. Also way too many cheap-thrill scenes that were more ""Ho-hum, what, again?"" than frightening.<br/><br/>What did it have going for it? An interesting setting, at big old dark Eel Marsh House, on a promontory accessible only via a causeway during low tide. Effective atmospherics. Lots of work for the foley artists. A nice non-existent twist when local burgher and ostensible skeptic Samuel Daily (Ciarán Hinds) DOESN'T turn out to be some kind of secretly malevolent deceiver but is instead genuinely friendly and helpful.<br/><br/>Opposed to this are the dreariness, almost complete absence of any cast or dialog, over-familiar premise, and my standard lament about all such movies, namely that they may tell us WHY the evil spirit is doing the wicked deeds, but they never show us HOW.<br/><br/>It's a sad commentary on the film when you find yourself thinking ""OK, if you want to kill off all the kids in the village, just do it and be done with it!"", but such is the impatience engendered by the petulant, dithering deader that I was hoping she'd finally get it over with so I could click my stopwatch off and bail out of the theater.<br/><br/>All of this combines to barely put The Woman in Black into the ""up to you"" range if you like this kind of thing."
"jack_face","Null","31","54","31 January 2012"," A lot like Dead Silence meets Insidious.
","The movie starts out slowly with a bit of humor. Actually, 3 girls died and some people in the theater found it funny. I kinda doubt that's what the film-makers had in mind. A drawing by Radcliffe's son in the movie drew the most laughs and it was a recurring prop that was later used as a plot device. The only other recognizable face was Ciaran Hinds from Above Suspicion. It has an eerie feel to it as if some sort of filter was used to make the movie feel like how the haunted house looked. Yep, it's one of those types of movies. To sum it up, Harry Potter is playing a lawyer who has to settle the affairs of the house and it becomes a cold case and if he doesn't, his job is on the line. This is more of a horror mystery. There wasn't much lawyer work going on. A lady lost a son, she's dead, her son is dead under mysterious circumstances, she can't move on until it's solved, you get the picture.<br/><br/>Radcliffe just happens to be the character who has to work in the house and you already know he uncovers the truth. During his discoveries, the plot begins to unravel and some of the antagonist's intentions, and supernatural powers, are revealed. The number one problem with this movie is the use of jump scares. There were just too many of them in my opinion. Not that the audience didn't react to them because that's what jump scares are supposed to do but there were some genuinely scary moments that didn't need to use that technique. Thankfully, some didn't. This really is a scary movie. There's a very long scene where Radcliffe is experiencing about as much Amityville stuff as one can handle. That scene in the house was very well done and suspenseful. It's just you, the house, Radcliffe, and all the various haunts. The director did a good job with that. Most of this movie takes place in the daytime like Feast 2 (not a good comparison, I know) but they still did a good job building suspense.<br/><br/>Without giving too much away, The Woman In Black lost her child and that means everyone else has to lose theirs, too. The girl setting herself on fire scene was good but I think the other death scenes should have been on par with the quality of that one for added chills. Props play a big part in the movie. Specifically dolls and toys. If you're sensitive to children dying or anything related to that, you don't wanna watch this. It will scare you. It's not gory or graphic but clearly the audience sympathized with what was going on in the movie when those particular scenes came up. The biggest error in the movie was the addition of the dog that accompanied Harry Potter into the haunted house on one of his return visits. What happened to the dog? You know what? Someone said exactly that out loud. Gimme a Napoleon Dynamite ""IDIOT"" for that guy!<br/><br/>But seriously, the dog was just forgotten completely. There were a lot of clues as to what would happen later in the movie. Lots of foreshadowing if you pay attention. You can figure out how the movie is gonna end if you do. Speaking of, it's a very good ending. Sad yet happy at the same time. And even then, some knuckleheads in the audience had to spoil things by saying the obvious right before those scenes started. The climax pretty much happens right at the end of the movie and it concludes shortly after that. The overriding theme is grief and how to deal with it. The Woman In Black's grief was resolved, or so it was thought. With that resolution, you think the movie is done but it's not. There's a very brief scene explaining why she continues to do what she does but prior to that, it's not really explained why.<br/><br/>All the minor details are there but there's just not enough exposition. 3-5 minutes more of an explanation about her son's death and her feelings towards those involved in his death would have made the final revelation of her intentions make more sense. Not that it doesn't but for this type of movie, it needs to be shown. The absolute ending is nice. We get a clear image of what she really looks like. It's very reminiscent of Insidious in that aspect. A new revenge horror icon has been created similar to Freddy Krueger in the fact that she kills kids. Yeah, yeah, I'm exaggerating but this was a very enjoyable horror movie that does its job by scaring you and keeping you interested the whole way through. It's not gonna keep you awake at night but you'll enjoy the ride. Solid acting, scenery, and special effects all the way around despite the minimal cast and budget. Worth paying for and seeing on the big screen but just make sure you see it with an audience that doesn't have the maturity level of a Peanuts character. Nothing happens after the credits. I give this 7 out of 10 stars. The movie poster ain't that great (yet still relevant to the movie) and it's rated PG-13 but those detriments shouldn't stop you from giving this a chance."

Everybody is so focused on how good or bad Radcliffe will do that they aren't paying attention to the plot (or lack thereof) in the film itself. There's a creepy house in the middle of nowhere with a bitter old ladies ghost in it. Yawn. Anybody who thought the ending was any good, I simply pity. I'm afraid you have to be on the left side of the IQ bell curve to think that. The film tries to compensate for its lack of plot by dragging out the scenes of Danny boy just walking around entirely too long. It really is a bad movie..."
"afh179","2","9","13","12 April 2012"," Dimmly lit snooze fest, literally almost fell asleep multiple times
","First off, this movie probably would've been more entertaining if Harry Potter was the main character. It's not like we weren't all picturing it already as we watched this, and honestly I would have rather watched the boy wizard romp around looking for clues to the ghostly mystery than watch boring Arthur Kipps try to. I was so excited to see this movie, as the trailers looked genuinely creepy, the set design looked spot-on, and I was intrigued by Daniel Radcliffe playing anyone but Harry. What I thought would be a dark throwback to the classic haunted house ghost stories of old indeed was just that, only a very poorly executed one. This movie really is just one big waste of a plot, a waste of the cast and crews effort, and a waste of my (and everyone else who went to see this snooze fest)time.<br/><br/>The plot is an awesome classic horror movie plot. A young businessman travels to do business, and in the process discovers strange occurrences in and around the house in which he is saying. He soon learns of the history of the town, and sets out to put all the pieces of the puzzle together. Yep, I thought it sounded entertaining too. It first hit me about 20 minutes in, when I began to realize I had been watching Radcliffe walk around since I sat down. Yes, it really does take a good 30 minutes before anything remotely interesting happens. And from there, it only continues to drag along at a snails pace. The scares are effective at points, weak at others. I was genuinely startled only twice the entire movie, and had trouble staying awake for the duration of it. This was the result of a combination of the near pitch-black lighting of the film and the crawling, dragging, stagnant pace of it. Also, stick-in-the-mud Kipps might possibly be the most uninteresting protagonist in horror movie history.<br/><br/>All in all, this movie is a waste. There is nothing positive that I can find to be said about this film. The only bright spot is the beautifully creepy house, the set design really as a whole is exceptional. Also, the movie shows that it is capable of inducing fear, but chooses not too in favor of jump-scares and quick disturbing images. The horror genre has reached a new era. The era is dominated by the found-footage sub-genre, and there has been a found-footage flick for just about every plot. I thought The Woman in Black would be the film that revamped the classic era, the era of straight up creepy ghost stories/haunted house thrillers. In reality, it was the film that made me lose almost all hope in the current state of the horror genre. The ideas are clearly running out, and I'm afraid that the genre might be on it's last legs. I hope I'm wrong, and that this film is simply a mishandled mistake and not an omen for whats to come for the genre. One things for sure though, The Woman in Black is a poor,poor film, and will soon be forgotten about and disregarded.<br/><br/>Overall: 2.5/10"

Lets get to the point...a woman sees her son die in a tragic accident (mainly just as much her fault for living on an island when tides cover the only road to their home) and then goes on a rampage as a ghost causing local children to kill themselves in violent ways. So what does our hero do? He figures it out (after all he's a London lawyer) but his solution...using a local's car (early 1900's England) to drag the ""marsh"" for the son's body...puts the body in in the nursery...and then buries it in the dead mom's casket. Everything's great, right? NOPE! The lawyer's son (his wife/mom died in childbirth 4 years before) arrives in the spooky town with the nanny as previously arranged and......The woman in black isn't satisfied she shows up at the train station (of course, with the appropriately made-up bodies of all the other dead children) and makes the lawyer's son walk into a train...BUT WAIT...the lawyer jumps on the track and grabs his son...AND THEY DIE TOGETHER! But it's a HAPPY ENDING!...the lawyer's dead wife meets them ""on the other side"" and escorts them to heaven while the woman in black looks on and screams...cut to credits.

"Bleulion2","8","22","39","3 February 2012"," True Gothic Horror
","I don't normally write reviews but with all the horror films coming out these days and so many opinions about them, I figured it was a good time to start. I think there needs to be clarification about what type of horror movie The Woman in Black really is. It is ""Gothic Horror"". We, especially those of us in the US, have associate horror with blood, guts and scary monsters. Gothic Horror is dark, suspenseful without the great amount of blood and gore. I've grown up on horror films of all kinds and it is rare that one will make me jump or feel creeped out anymore but The Woman in Black did just that. From the opening scene of the three little girls playing and to the end when, in a ending much like ""The Ring"", you know it's not over I was engrossed and yes, I jumped quite a few times. The dolls, which were period appropriate for the children of that time, added a good amount of creepiness to this dark story. The acting was well done. I was especially impressed by Daniel Ratcliffe's performance. The location and scenery were very well filmed. I highly recommend this movie, but be sure to go in with the correct expectation. Sometimes the scariest things are not monsters but the things that make us feel the most uncomfortable because we can identify with them."

","Without a doubt one of the most disappointing films I have watched in a very long time. Hammer came up on the opening screens and I should have realised it'd be on a par with the worst of the Hammer House of Horror trash. Surely film makers can do better than this these days!<br/><br/>If it was intended - as I know it was - to be scary, it failed, dramatically. I could (and did in many instances, by the time my partner and I were thoroughly bored of the movie) tell when and precisely where on screen the 'woman' would appear. There were incredibly poor green screen scenes (notably when the main character and his cohort were driving across the causeway) during which it was completely obvious they were in a car, in a studio, and the scenery was green-screened on.<br/><br/>And the ending was predictable from the middle, if not even earlier in the film.<br/><br/>I've heard folks say this film made them 'jump out of their seats', or even scream. Well if they enjoyed it, good luck to them, but for my money Tom & Jerry is more scary.<br/><br/>I fail to see any reason to write anything further as everyone has different tastes and some may well like this abomination. I also won't pull the thing totally to pieces. I'd have to watch it again to really do that and frankly I'd sooner pull my fingernails out with pliers."

I think the scariest moment in this film for me was when I realized that nothing was really gonna happen.I think that when movie makers produce films like this and dupe the movie goers they should be banned from making films for 1 year. What they did here in this movie was to have the music and sounds jump out at you. Now days a night out at the movies with your girl friend, that's 2 tickets plus drinks, and something to eat can cost you nearly $100.00. I saw nothing of any value in this movie, producers really need to be more responsible about what we are about to view. I don't appreciate being mislead and I don't like smoking mirrors.

"sashank_kini-1","2","47","93","23 February 2012"," The Woman in Black – predictable, derivative, tedious and clichéd commercial mess
","Night of the Living Dead, the independent horror film made in 1968 had perhaps the eeriest moment I have seen in film – the lady getting stabbed by her own possessed daughter while her screams are heard in the background. The repeated motion of the daughter's hand striking with the knife is seen, but I don't recall having seen the actual penetration of the knife. Although we do see the dead woman lying in the corner, with pain and shock on her face – this is true horror. Very few movies bring this kind of terror – Rosemary's Baby, The Blair Witch Horror, Carrie etc. The best part about them is how we are constantly aware of the imminent tension and are lead to it slowly, thus intensifying the impact when it hits us. Night of Living Dead kept me unnerved right to the iconic ending when it rained all its force with a sweep. How wonderful to have such movies among us!<br/><br/>Then there is The Woman in Black – predictable, derivative, tedious and clichéd. We are aware that there is going to be an element of horror because it written on Daniel Radcliffe's face even when he has not faced it. How many times do I have to see spooky children that seem to be controlled by some supernatural element? Their blank, expressionless faces their slow walk and synchronized actions. This time we have creepy dolls and toys as accompaniments; the mother who brings such toys for her children is an unfit one. Daniel Radcliffe plays Arthur, a young solicitor sporting some sideburns and a sweaty, haggard look, whose wife is dead and now lives with his four year old son who notices draws a stick figure of him with an unhappy look. Oh, such a clever boy (roll eyes)! He has to handle an estate which no one is ready to tread, especially the quiet, ominous country people, who believe the house is cursed. Daniel steps in and sights a woman veiled in black, hence the name. The villagers tell him to keep away as their children because of his visits to the place. But Arthur, for some reason known only to him, wants to unravel the secrets. Perhaps he may get a raise!<br/><br/>The movie is excruciatingly boring partly because Radcliffe looks tense when he isn't supposed to be and is relatively calm when he is supposed to be frightened to death. The direction itself is so indicative that it's a horror film, with the affected, spooked up style of talking, even in the exchange between Radcliffe and the lawyer. I don't like this senseless overstatement of fear, its shoddy. Radcliffe's Arthur smells a strange air in the village, with most of the residents being unfriendly and reserved. Everyone has that look which says 'Yeah, this is a horror film! Be frightened!'; I would not have been surprised if they had added Bela Lugosi's "" Be Afraid!"" monologue. The fear factor is close to nil; I swear the entire theater, mostly comprising of women and teenage girls, remained dead silent throughout. Even when the ghost's presence became more and more evident. And I disagree with Rotten Tomatoes' consensus that ""it may not provide enough of them for viewers attuned to modern, high-stakes horror"". It is a slighting remark since there are some viewers like me who are attuned to modern, high-stakes horror but appreciate more the horror that is subtly but effectively delivered. This movie was commercial mess.<br/><br/>I wouldn't recommend The Woman in Black to anyone – it is devoid of any unsettling moment and may be too boring even for 13 year olds.<br/><br/>My Rating: 2 out of 10"

","** out of (****)<br/><br/>After the abysmal trainwreck that was ""The Devil Inside"", I was looking for a decent roller coaster ride of chills and thrills. The hoopla for this movie certainly rose to such gargantuan heights, and a good chunk of top critics took a liking to this, so what went wrong? Everything.<br/><br/>""Black"" revolves around a young lawyer, who travels to a remote village where he discovers the vengeful ghost of a scorned woman is terrorizing the locals.<br/><br/>Being an avid horror fan, especially of the supernatural sub-genre (if you will), this movie basically shot up my adrenaline from the first shot of the trailer 'til the last. I was more than ready for this movie. So automatically, I am disqualified from the ""hater bias"" bullcrap you IMDb'ers like to toss around when us average Joe's get disappointed by a film, that we were actually rooting for from the start.<br/><br/>Well, first off, this film is just not scary. The first half of the film is conducive to cheap and generic jump scares, that just fall flat on their faces. Oh look it's some murky liquid leaking from a dirty faucet! Oh look it's just a bird! It was just all very cheap. From the first half, it is just tedious to endure. We don't establish a sufficient enough amount of character development and we really don't go in-depth with the premise. It is just a very stale first hour or so that's chock-full of filler, so as to consume most of its running time. Just lots of blabber about the town and tons of GOTCHA! moments that don't fully run their course.<br/><br/>Then we get to the second half which is a notch better from the first, but still don't bring us anywhere. Here we get even more jump scares, some which prove to be effective and others which are just tedious time-wasters. Here's a lesson to future filmmakers: You can use the cheap thrill tactic maybe about three times at the most. If you abuse your power, you're just downgrading your film and everything else just becomes that much more uninspired. But let's steer clear from my rant of jump scares. The story. From the trailer, the premise sounds bone-chilling and simple enough, right? The film overcomplicates everything and raises too many questions that are left too open-ended. And atop of that, the pacing is just way too slow. The whole film is just a slow-burn effect that amounts to absolutely nothing. And that ending? Oh boy, this movie is just a mess.<br/><br/>Well, there are a few good things I can say for ""The Woman in Black"". For one, the production crew did their homework. A lot of attention to detail is payed when organizing their pops and set designs. This is one of the most visually exciting horror films I've seen. And also, the performances are very strong. Daniel Radcliffe ditches his whole Potter affair and does something very worthwhile here. <br/><br/>All in all, ""The Woman in Black"" is such a huge disappointment. The scares go nowhere and are recycled, the pacing is just too slow and tedious that it's almost a chore to sit through, and the premise is even less than compelling. It's quite a shame considering it looked like a refreshing and nostalgic horror film that could've started '12 on a high note. Unfortunately, any potential it had was wasted. Well, I guess you can say it isn't terrible and actually raises a peak of interest here and there, but that doesn't amount to much when you're paying a hefty price for it."

I don't understand why it'd been hailed as something good and received good reviews here and there. Are we meant to admire the wardrobe, the locations, what exactly?

The film feels horribly rushed with barely any sense of foreboding or dread. Just cheap jump scares which wear horribly thin after a very short time.

"colinrgeorge","4","18","32","3 February 2012"," Horror by the Book
","Recipe for a Hollywood horror flick: pick a screenplay with a vaguely creepy-sounding title like The Woman in Black. Be sure the writer included one or all of the following: portraits with the eyes scratched out, little kids' drawings, antique toys, etc. Next, shoot everything at half exposure. Then pick a quiet weekend to release and collect your fifty million dollars. Repeat. It's a racket that works like a charm, and isn't going away until the audience does.<br/><br/>The Woman in Black stars 'Arry Potter 'imself — Daniel Radcliffe — as Arthur Kipps, an adolescent English estate lawyer bound unluckily for a haunted house in the boondocks. Kipps' job is on the line, which accounts for his eager beaver attitude upon arrival, and dogged insistence on seeing the property, even against the behest of, oh, everyone in town. You know where this is going.<br/><br/>Once inside the isolated island manor, Kipps can't seem to get any work done. A typical sequence of scenes plays out with the protagonist sitting down to study a stack of documents and being immediately distracted by some foreign sound or supernatural happening. And then the investigation's afoot; jump scares abound, though they fall too formulaically to conjure much anxiety or subsequent shock. After all, scares by appointment aren't very scary.<br/><br/>The screenplay is particularly disappointing given its author, Jane Golden, who spun genre into gold with Kick-Ass and X-Men: First Class. Too dour to pass as a throwback haunted house flick, and too clichéd to surprise anyone, The Woman in Black is caught in the nebulous nowhere between fun and frightening. Even if her writing were stronger, however, there's no guarantee it would be spared the blunt hand of James Watkins, a director with the finesse of a steamroller.<br/><br/>He brings not an ounce of aesthetic originality to the table, imbuing the movie with the same ugly, washed-out palette of six dozen other studio horror failures. The technique is intended to foster a mood, but it's a cheap substitute for good old-fashioned filmmaking. Mood isn't achieved in camera — it's an aggregate of art direction, camera placement, performance, music, etc. The obvious digital look of the film also hampers the believability of its period setting — the turn of the century never looked so bland.<br/><br/>Performances add little life to the landscape. Daniel Radcliffe manages not to embarrass himself, and that's being generous. Frankly, it's tough to buy the Hogwarts alum as a dad when he's been playing a teenager for ten years. It's equally tough to imagine him a widower, as he broods with all the emotional turmoil of an Olsen twin. Ciarán Hinds plays Kipps' sole confidant in the haunted hamlet, and fittingly enough, delivers the film's sole compelling performance. Still, his character never goes anywhere, a waste of Hinds' talent.<br/><br/>Effective horror is contingent upon a willingness to take the audience outside its comfort zone, and The Woman in Black is too creakily formulaic to creep us out. Because Hollywood is a business, it's more desirable to greenlight a derivative script and hire a yes-man director than to risk something edgier that might not pay off. The cycle continues. The Woman in Black follows that recipe to a T, but there's something lost in translation. Maybe the recipe wasn't all that good to begin with. Maybe the whole cookbook needs to go."
"rotex29","4","8","12","28 October 2012"," A Predictable, Overused Concept
","The premise of this film and story is about a ghost with a score to settle, terrorizing all those who enter a Gothic, uninhabited mansion separated from the town by a lake where the tides cut it off from escaping from it at night. This is very much like the concept of the remote hotel located in the snow covered mountains, cut off from civilization by snowed in roads in ""The Shining"". Except Stephen King is a master writer and a master of horror story telling, which is much better than this film or story. This film, set in the early 1900's, even with it's macabre and evil setting, backed by grey skies and even greyer landscape, is nothing more than ""bump in the night"" predictability layered through-out the film. The expectation that the lawyer (Daniel Radcliffe) sent to this home to sift through papers left by the dead occupant to settle a last will and testament, is going to encounter some scary stuff is just what it is; some run of the mill scary stuff one can see coming a mile away. The horror is overt and placating. The mystery is missing. It's expected. The plot line is thin. A long dead woman whose son had tragically died in a sunken vehicle and been left at the bottom of a marsh, meandered through the dark hallways of the house and cemetery outside to threaten anybody in its path. As the story progresses, until the dead son is retrieved from the bottom of the marsh, the spirit cannot rest. The plot finally settles in on the lawyer attempting to accomplish finding the dead son, as a result of some very astute detective work, as one would expect, in establishing exactly what the problem was. Again, its predictable, its too long, and if you want a good film with this imitated concept, watch The Shining. Its a better bet for the money, and surely will scare the hell out of you."

James ghost stories with a well meaning man unleashing a malevolent force, in this case the Woman In Black herself.<br/><br/>This is one of the creepiest, spookiest ghost stories ever filmed. Adapted from Susan Hill's book of the same title, the tale centres around a young lawyer sent to settle the estate of a deceased old lady. At the funeral, he sees what he thinks is another mourner, a woman dressed all in black. When he mentions this to others however, he gets a strange reaction and quickly realises all is not as it seems. Whenever this woman appears, so local legend says, a child will die. From then on, things become more and more tense as he becomes haunted by this mysterious woman. This production uses no special effects or fancy sets and to be honest, I think it would have detracted from the film if there had been. Instead, the viewer is left to concentrate purely on the story which becomes increasingly tense as it develops. There are several moments that will make you jump or send a shiver through you.

","The most interesting thing I found about this movie was the filming technique: A throw-back to the days of ""Dark Shadows"" and 1960's vampire movies. In fact, I was waiting for the vampiresses to enter a scene wearing the typical early 70's sheer long nightgown...it would have at least caused my eyebrows to raise where not much in this film did. In a film wherein the editing mistakes are evident throughout and the direction is less than acceptable, the filming technique is good...helped me to sit through this less than ""horror"" flick.<br/><br/>The best description I can come up for ""The Woman in Black is that it is like a trailer funhouse at the local carnival. The ""scary stuff"" is old and stale. The screams are the same old Banshee screams we've heard in movies for seventy-five years. The plot is an update of the original Frankenstein-ish movies of long ago, with very little variation in plot- line, including the riotess towns-people blaming the new smart guy for their problems. Having said that, the two male leads do a good job in holding the audience even though the script and direction were inferior. Without the talent of these two, it would be a movie fit for a drive-in second feature in 1971.<br/><br/>If ""The Woman in Black"" is a measure of this generation's ""horror"" movie, we need to send them back to school and teach them how to create, not just copy someone else's work and pass the test, because this film did not pass any test nor was it creative."

","Because of the excellent job she did with Kick-Ass, I'd forgiven screenwriter Jane Goldman for the absolute drivel that was Stardust, but The Woman in Black has just put her in my bad books again, a more predictable, pedestrian, derivative and utterly boring ghost story it would be hard to envisage. Likewise, director James Watkins, who impressed me so with his superb debut Eden lake, hasn't exactly gone up in my estimations.<br/><br/>For those who grew up with Radcliffe as Harry Potter—a demographic most likely still fairly unfamiliar with the horror genre—this might succeed in coming across as both original and scary, but trust me when I say that everything in The Woman In Black has been done many times before, and often much better. In particular, I was reminded of Ghost Story (1981) and Dark Water (2002), although the tricks employed by Watkins to scare his oblivious young viewers have been pilfered from numerous other films. As for the dumb ending.... always hold on to a young child's hand when on a station platform—it's as simple as that!<br/><br/>The fact that this nonsense was filmed under the Hammer banner makes me want to cry."

","I suppose I went into this movie with high expectations since Daniel Radcliffe was in it. However, I had many problems with this movie. They had a terrific plot and really could have utilized this. However my first problem deals with the fact I felt a lack of character development with the main character (Radcliffe). All we learn is he is a hard working businessman troubled by the death of his wife and left to raise their child. Then the movie seemed to take forever to progress and when we reach the climax, the movie ending sneaks right up and ends seemingly way too short. I didn't understand how he found the body of the dead child and nobody else did. They had a car. Big deal. Why couldn't other villagers get a group of horses together to pull out the wreckage? Like other reviews I have read they never developed the source of the ghost's power to force children to commit suicide. The only reason I decided to give this movie a 4 and not a 1 was because it did get one or two scares out of me, I just wish there was more plot/character development."

","In the spirit of the HAMMER FILMS of yesteryear, here's an old-school horror with a familiar premise: a handsome young lawyer's sent to a dark town that harbors secrets and winds up being stalked by an ominous presence. Using the implied method of building suspense, and never clearly showing the antagonist, does have its merits: except when there's more work than payoff.<br/><br/>Daniel Radcliffe embodies the right amount of clean-slate expressions for the story's gloomy pawn, narrowly searching through the main setting – a haunted house where the ghost of a shrouded woman resides. But save for loud music erupting whenever the titular wraith peaks her head around a corner, or sulks through the mist-laden exterior, his curiosity... the basis of any horror tale... seems in vain.<br/><br/>So by the time he attempts resolution for the menacing ghost, learning the motivations of her vengeful purpose to remain an active trickster in the doomed little villa, the audience is hoping for all those cheap, fun, and most important, scary thrills that are never realized.<br/><br/>For More Reviews: www.cultfilmfreaks.com"
"egor-malyshev","5","4","5","16 March 2012"," It's not scary, it's just so freaking loud
","I appreciated the setting, the dim colors in which the entire title is filmed, location, all other visuals—this is what makes up first half of any horror (well, any other, too), movie, so this is what gets it five stars in my review. Isolated estate that is accessible only when the sea is low, quiet town that is far away from any civilization, people that for sure have things to hide from strangers, this creates an excellent environment in which any twisted and horrifying plot can naturally unfold, so when you're watching the opening sequence, the hopes for an excellent thriller are way up. Well, as the story progresses, it's revealed to be just a bunch of clichés that are put together in a way that does not make any sense. It's like writers and director have clearly mistaken a bunch of trees for a forest. Scenes are scary in their own moment, and when it's passed, you're just sitting there and thinking, okay, now what? Another scene begins, and another loud sound is heard, or scary face is seen fading in from the dark, or sharply appearing from behind, and it's all repeating over and over again. Suspension is great, in first half of the movie, in later parts there is simply not enough time to build up the tension. Plot is also weak, as we're not given much insight preceding events, and this makes it very difficult to stay on the same page with protagonist, as you are completely clueless why they're rejecting him so aggressively right from the start (if they did not want him to come, they could just not accept any bookings in first place, and send papers to London by mail). All the work that is done at mansion is pointless, a bunch of papers is read, and a lot of effort is put in exhuming the dead boy, the said effort is fruitless, though, as it does not affect the faith of protagonist and his son—if he wanted to reunite with his dead wife so much, he might as well have killed himself without even going to that godforsaken place. The only excuse for all this action is that it maybe has made him to accept the fact that his family is going to be reunited after death, which is kind of alluded in the dialogue between him and Daily, but this looks too far fetched and way beyond the overall level of the film."
"emilie-556-954984","1","16","29","16 December 2012"," Bad!
","Really quite boring and at times so bad it was funny! Full of clichés; really nothing original about it. Radcliffe was quite wooden. He doesn't seem to have a very big repertoire of expressions. I nearly didn't bother finishing watching the movie and the ending didn't make it particularly worthwhile hanging on. I'll admit I am not really into Gothic, scary movies, so perhaps it was my mistake to rent this DVD. But seeing as this is supposed to be a bit of a classic and it has been on as a play in the West End in London, I expected it to be worth watching. However, I wouldn't waste my time if I were you, unless you want to have a bit of a giggle, which I'm sure wasn't the intention when this movie was made...!"
"omarstphn","1","21","41","26 February 2012"," Extremely cliché'd, borrows a lot from various other horror movies. Very predictable.
","I saw this movie in a theater and so in two parts. There was hardly any build up in the first half and you would almost forget that this is supposed to be a horror thriller. The second half however seemed very rushed as if the director was running out of film. The scare scenes were fun to watch though in the theater with good sound effects but the thing that bugged me was how unperturbed Radcliffe was at each scare sequence. Spoiler: He doesn't even scream once to things that would make me crap myself if I witnessed in real life. I've heard that British people aren't the most expressive and always try to maintain their composure. But this is ridiculous. I expect good horror movies to have a lot of subtle things apart from the scary scenes that stay with you after watching the movie like the 3:00am from Emily Rose or those faces in the exorcist that would pop up for a second. The story in this movie is nothing new and is very poorly made. It's very similar to Sleepy Hollow (not a good movie either). I gave it a 1/10 because I can't believe it's got a 7.7 which made me go see it. The movie should actually be a 3.5 or 4 out of 10."

","Watching Harry Potter- SORRY Daniel Radcliffe I was reminded on the old spitting image sketch about Roger Moore.<br/><br/>In it The Moore puppet's only facial expressions for all his emotions was either one or the other eyebrows lifting.<br/><br/>It appears young Mr Potter / Radcliffe prescibes to the same ""method"" acting school of thought. The guy just CANNOT do emotion!!!<br/><br/>With the sound turned down you cannot tell if he is happy, sad, angry, afraid, or indeed whether he needs the loo! To say his acting is wooden is doing an injustice to trees! I'm sure he tries hard but he simply cannot do emotion. He is trying to play a grief stricken widower, but you can't help yourself thinking 10 points to griffindor! He has made multi multi millions from that franchise, so will never have to worry about working again, which is just as well as from the basis of this pile of horse's business, he is going to find it hard to get work! No doubt Harry Potter mania got him this gig, but this guy is NEVER EVER going to get an Oscar! But he might earn a few rotten tomatoes!

","The setting for the movie is a spooky old house in a very strange village. Yeah the atmosphere is good but that's just about it. The acting doesn't get any marks either, although not awful you can feel they just don't feel the dread... as you aren't either. But the plot is even unworthy mentioning. It's the old classic ghost story with a vengeance killing innocent children in the process because she lost her child. Really stupid plot that would be barely OK in the 50's not in 2012! Completely unimaginative with a couple of screams to shock the most fainthearted and that's just about it! You will find no suspense and no horror here and really not worth spending your hard earned money to watch it. I admit I am not going nuts over horror movies because mostly they are just plain stupid but I enjoy good one's. This is ain't one of the good one's! I give it a 3 only because the picture is nice."

","Greetings again from the darkness. The quest for quality horror films is a never-ending project. Since low budget fright fests are the easiest way to make money in Hollywood, most take shortcuts that leave us feeling cheated. This remake of a 1989 British TV horror film actually has wonderful production design ... the Gothic mansion is a sight to behold. Unfortunately, the shortcut here was a story that offers little substance.<br/><br/>Daniel Radcliffe (yes, Harry Potter himself) plays a young, widowed solicitor named Arthur Kipps, who is still grief stricken, and now on the verge of losing his job. He is given one last chance to prove his mettle by going to a remote village to settle the affairs of recently deceased client. His young son (Misha Handley) and his nanny are to meet him in the village a few days later.<br/><br/>The local townspeople clearly don't want him there and are constantly trying to shoo him back to London. Of course, no one ever bothers to tell him why they are frightened and why they are so angry with him for going to the old house. This mansion is a work of art. It has the necessary creep factor to star in a real horror film. The furnishings and fixtures and decor are really the star of the movie. It's not giving away anything to say that every time Radcliffe sees this mysterious woman in black, something bad happens in the village.<br/><br/>The annoying thing about the film is that whenever we get a chill-inducing moment like a shadow in the background or a figure passing by a mirror, it is immediately followed up by a cheap parlor trick involving a sonic blast of music and an ear-piercing scream. It's as if the director (James Watkins) is convinced movie goers are too ignorant to know when to be scared, so he provides clues to say ""Scream now!"" Ciaran Hinds and Janet McTeer add a touch of class to the film as Mr.and Mrs. Daily, who recently lost their son. Mr. Daily has found solace in the bottle, while Mrs. Daily teeters on the brink of insanity. My theory that no film featuring Mr. Hinds can be all bad is tested here, and Ms. McTeer was seen recently as the best thing about the Albert Nobbs film.<br/><br/>On a positive note, this is a nice transition movie for Daniel Radcliffe. He has quite a career challenge as he tries to break loose of the Harry Potter clamp. He succeeds here with quite a different physical appearance, though he really has little to do but alternate between a distantly forlorn look and peering cautiously around dark corners. A couple of interesting notes: the boy playing his son is Radcliffe's real life godson, and the actor who played Radcliffe's role in the 1989 original is Adrian Rawlins, who played Harry Potter's father in those movies."
"Redcitykev","8","8","13","8 March 2012"," Hammer back doing what they do best!
","As a kid growing up in the UK the Independent TV sector was split into regions, with HTV being the regional channel where I lived. Each region had a good deal of control over their own programming, and Monday nights were always film nights in the HTV region. As these were relatively late night showings (around 10:30pm) these films were almost always horror films, which meant either classic Universal, American International Pictures or, of course, Hammer Horrors. It was the Hammer films that I enjoyed most - Christopher Lee, Peter Cushing, Ingrid Pitt etc etc, so it was sad to see the studio go into such decline. But now with this wonderfully atmospheric haunted house story (plus the remake of Let The Right One In, and one other whose title has escaped me for the moment) the studio - or at least the company that has taken over the legendary name - is back to doing what it does best, scaring the life out of film goers the world over!! This film has all the hallmarks of a classic Hammer film, the old village full of unwelcoming locals, the local pub with an even more unwelcoming feel (""We're packed to the rafters all week"" - even if Kipps is the only guest to be seen!), the bleak landscape, and, of course, the wonderful old house (usually on top a hill, but in this case on an island that gets cut-off from the mainland by the incoming tide twice a day).<br/><br/>Into this arrives the aforementioned Kipps (Daniel Radcliffe in his first big post Harry Potter role), looking into the estate of the late owner of the old house. As he looks into the papers etc he finds more than he bargained for, and then the ""fun"" really begins as the ghost of the title character starts to weave her evil presence over the proceedings.<br/><br/>As the mystery over the Lady In Black begins to unravel the atmosphere builds and the shocks come fast - although not so fast that you don't have time to catch your breath between screams! Daniel Radcliffe handles his role very well (and shows a lot of promise for a good post Harry career), and the supporting cast - full of good old British character actors like Ciaran Hinds, all play their parts to the full.<br/><br/>The ending has been described as ""Hollywood"", but personally I felt it fitted in well and showed a certain amount of redemption (impossible to fully explain without giving the ending away, which I do not want to do here).<br/><br/>This is not your blood and guts type horror, rather one based on character, story line and atmosphere, and is well worth a visit if you like being scared out of your seat! Whilst this may not be the Hammer of Bray Studios etc, it is good to see the name back emblazoned on the big screen again, and doing what Hammer do best... BOO!"

I felt the movie had a ton of un-needed filler which expanded the viewing time to 1hr 30 mins. This felt more like a TV show than a movie. I would not recommend this movie to anyone since it fails on all levels of entertainment.

The only thing i liked was the atmosphere. The acting was fine but there was no attachment to the characters. I couldn't care less what happened to them. I did feel that it had potential but it was wasted with overdone and over the top ""jumpy"" scare tactics. When i watch a good movie, it usually inspires me or somehow changes the way I feel when its over. This film didn't do anything like that.

"asmita-instablogs","7","8","14","25 March 2013"," ***SPOILER*** the documents should have revealed more
","the premise for the story is fantastic but the makers should have worked harder to make things clearer (than the play) as the movie progressed. this is my own theory of what happened in the film. (BTW i totally think the movie has a lot in common with Japanese horror flicks including the ghost who is determined to stay evil and all the dead kids). Anyways, back to my own theories now:<br/><br/>when Kipps stays at the house overnight. he had access to a tonne of documentary evidence that could have been used to expand on why jennet's sister took her kid away and why she wouldn't let her see him.<br/><br/>I'm guessing most probably because jennet was already mentally unsound before the child was born and the child was born out of wedlock because the father did not want to marry a crazy chick or the affair was broken off before the wedding causing her to lose her mind. (the father's surname is on the birth certificate). <br/><br/>at the house, Kipps finds a picture of the Drablows where jennet is seen in one of the windows which would suggest that she lived with them. also, she hangs herself in the nursery at the same house which cements the fact that she was living there when the child was alive. <br/><br/>so why does she send Alice letters instead of saying things to her face? <br/><br/>since she was already living there, jennet might have had access to the child though she may not have been allowed to have him call her mom or to even get to meet the child often enough which might have strained her unsound mind even more. <br/><br/>now they never really showed how Nathaniel was left to sink into the marsh when everyone else survived. a boy of 7 is definitely agile enough to be able to jump over the back end of a coach or to hang onto his mother's enormous dress to avoid drowning. <br/><br/>and his body is found right in the middle of the carriage too which would suggest that he was probably incapacitated or sedated/really ill and was already on the floor of the carriage and not moving when the carriage was sinking. <br/><br/>since he wasn't accepting jennet as his mother, perhaps she drugged him/made him ill before this mishap occurred and since his body was never recovered, they couldn't confirm a poisoning or grave previous injury. or maybe jennet tricked him into eating something poisonous or jump off a floor or some other way tried to make him kill himself and Alice and her husband were just rushing him to a doctor when the carriage fell into the marsh. this would explain why jennet hates kids and has them kill themselves. she did it to her own kid too. and the guilt and the insanity made her blame her sister and commit suicide.<br/><br/>and the reason why she hates her sister is not because Alice doesn't let her see the child or give him her cards, it's because she is jealous of her and wants a husband, child, house, the whole shindig which her poor mental health and premarital affair and having a child out of wedlock made impossible.<br/><br/>jennet kills kids to exact revenge on happy families because she couldn't have one herself. and the reason why she keeps the souls of the kids with her is because none of them accept her as their mother (the daily's kid keeps visiting his mother)<br/><br/>however, in the end, the joke's on jennet as Joseph's soul is saved by the soul of his father and the family is reunited in death. in the end she shows her face and that of the other dead kids to Sam so he too becomes a believer and possibly starts to take his wife's claims that their dead son contacts her more seriously.<br/><br/>in the sequel, I'm guessing jennet and the kids haunt soldiers and they (adults) die which means that her curse (kids will die) was broken off by Kipps."

","I honestly just thought this film was incredible. Parts of it were absolutely terrifying and I'm not one to be scared by films. I jumped so many times and even screamed at one point. Regardless of the terror it's left me with, I would watch this film again and again and again. Initially I was worried Daniel Radcliffe would portray Arthur Kipps in a very similar way to Harry Potter, but I soon found that he actually has far better acting skills than I realised and I was left in awe. The whole way through the film I was pretty much entranced. Even the ending, which was one I think would usually irritate me a little, impressed me. I'm almost lost for words. All I can really say is that it was amazing and I'd recommend it even to the wimpiest of people!"
"kdnor2011","7","8","14","28 February 2012"," A very creepy film
","Daniel Radcliffe's first film role after the end of Harry Potter is playing a lawyer in the early 1900s. OK, that's cool. This film is both an adaptation, and a remake, but I have neither read the book, nor saw the original film, so I went into this film with just one wish, please creep me out.<br/><br/>And for the most part this film does that pretty well. I was creeped out throughout a lot of this film, and jumped a descent number of times. I think the reason it works so well is because it has great atmosphere, there is a twenty minute long sequence with almost no dialog with Daniel Radcliffe just walking around the house. And for a PG-13 horror movie, there are some pretty terrible ways in which KIDS, get killed. The ending has balls, it is both sad and happy at the same time. The acting is good, and it has really good production value, it really looks like the early 1900s.<br/><br/>Now there are a few problems I had, the first twenty minutes have a few of the cheap jump scares, like a crow flying across the screen. Thankfully the scares get more real as the film goes on. There were a few times where I did feel kind of bored. And this may just be a personal problem, but Daniel Radcliffe, looks way too young to have a four year old kid. I mean he's 22, I know they had kids early back then but come on, but like I said, maybe it's just because I'm so used to him being Harry Potter.<br/><br/>The Woman in Black is the best horror film of 2012 so far, granted the only other one I saw was the Devil Inside, but I did enjoy this film, and recommend you check it out."
"babyhornetdan","1","11","21","31 March 2014"," Appalling!
","I was expecting a chilling Gothic thriller, but instead i was left very disappointed. The story is nothing like the book. Firstly, the story is actually told by Kipps as an autobiographical account of his time in Crythin Gifford and should open with Kipps recounting the tale to his grandchildren many years later. Secondly the ending is completely wrong! After he finishes his assignment, Kipps leaves for London where he marries Stella and they have a child. They then visit the park where the WIB appears and causes the Pony and Trap they are in to crash, killing the child and fatality wounding Stella. Moreover, Kipps' first meeting with the WIB is at Alice Drablow's funeral where he sees her sitting and attempts to talk to her, noting that she looks very ill. <br/><br/>Aside from the scripting flaws, the acting in the film was wooden at best. Radcliffe was clearly out of his depth and showed very little emotion throughout. He is meant to become more and more terrified as the film goes on, yet he simply doesn't."

","I'm happy that the $1 I paid to rent this movie went to a good cause in supporting my local library. That being said, it's one of the only positives about this movie experience. Dreary, dull, meandering and boring. A yawn inducing ghost story, that offers little more than long drawn out scenes, un-suspenseful build up, no pay off, not even jumps or scares. There was at no time that I cared or was interested in the ""story"". There were no characters that I really cared for, and nothing that particularly impressed me. Basically, an idiot stays in a house, long after anyone with any common sense would have said ""the hell with all this"" and left. <br/><br/>A CGI ghost that also shares a boring story, and isn't scary or believable....mind numbing. And some toys, which are easily the creepiest part of the movie.<br/><br/>The only remotely interesting scene I can give this movie credit for is the bringing up the carriage from the bog. There you go...that's the best 5 minutes of the movie right there.<br/><br/>I also did like Ciarán Hinds, who did the best he could with a boring story and a terrible script. It's hard to care for your movie when you just don't care about your characters, the story, or what happens in general. I am still mad at myself for wasting the time to watch this. <br/><br/>I think Radcliffe is a great actor, and versatile. I understand that he probably wants to try new things outside of Harry Potter. But the only ghosts he should stick with are The Bloody Baron, and Nearly Headless Nick. I cannot force myself to give this anything above a one, even though I liked Ciaran Hinds...sorry Ciaran."

","I'm not quite sure why they decided to remake this film - it's not really a remake when you change some of the storyline. I consider the 1989 version to be right up there in my top 5 all time scariest films, along with the original ""The Haunting"" and ""The Legend of Hell House"". I sat in the movie theater last weekend clutching the arm of the seat several times expecting to jump and was let down more often then not. No offense to Mr. Radcliffe, but it seemed like he was just going through the motions in this film. If you haven't yet seen it, stop reading - there are some ""spoilers"" in here. First, the name of the young attorney was Arthur Kidd, not Kipps - second, he was not a widower, which in the original was the whole point of how the picture ended. Third, the actress who actually played the Woman in Black was so much scarier to me than whatever special effects ghost the studio could have ever come up with. If the studios ever decide to put the original back on the big screen I think people who really enjoy an old-fashioned ghost story would cheer. I encourage anyone who's seen this ""remake"" to rent the original and you'll see what I'm trying to say - much like ""The Manchurian Candidate"",you don't mess with perfection."

Woman in Black did a really good job at keeping the tone of the book all the way through the film, and I do think that is the most important thing in a book to movie adaptation. There are some quite big difference between the events that happen in the book and the events that happen in the movie, but I appreciated the changes as they made it an all round better film. People seem to forget that if a film kept 100% faithful to the book that would not make a good movie, so I had no problem with any of the changes the film made. <br/><br/>Overall Woman in Black is a chilling film, it kept great suspense throughout and had me on the edge of your seat waiting to see what was around the next corner. A great film with good performances and direction, I really enjoyed it a lot. If your looking for an old fashioned scary horror film; which is hard to find nowadays may I add, watch WOMAN IN BLACK!"

This story occurs I'm guessing some time in the early 20th century, probably before WWI. But Spiritualism is mentioned, so it might be after WWI.<br/><br/>So an evil rich couple steals the child of her sister, and her ghost is killing all the poor people in the village's children.

","The Woman in Black (2012): Dir: James Watkins / Cast: Daniel Radcliffe, Ciaran Hinds, Janet McTeer, Liz White, Jessica Raine: One could say that this hokey contraption is about evil resulted from the acts of another. In this case we have a mansion being terrorized by some spirit hag who apparently lost her son when he drown in a swamp. She then hung herself because being part of this film was too unbearable. Daniel Radcliffe of Harry Potter fame is brought in deal with the estate but he begins to see haunting visions and hear loud noises. The locals are all complete morons who act paranoid. Apparently every time this bitch in black is seen one of their children commits suicide. Perhaps it is their punishment for not taking on better scripts. Every year we are cursed with about a dozen haunted house spirit movies and most are about as stupid as this one. James Watkins directs and aided by the ominous atmosphere and special effects but little else elevates beyond a joke. To his credit, Radcliffe transcends well from the Potter films and proves capable of superior projects. The supporting roles are not so successful. Ciaran Hinds plays a local land owner who carts Radcliffe about but the role is hardly a highlight. Janet McTeer as Ciaran's wife is one crazy imbecile who carves nasty images in wood. The most embarrassing role goes to Liz White as this ominous woman in black. With her shrieking and whispers she comes off about as scary as Peppy Longstocking on crack. Technically the film is well made but that doesn't save this pompous attempt to scare us as the joke that it is. Score: 3 ½ / 10"
"starsteamer","6","3","4","21 July 2012"," An atmospheric ghost story
","At last an atmospheric ghost story set in a haunted house with an unrealistic back story and creepy villagers! It is frankly a pleasure to watch a semi-intelligent ghost story without the pointless gore or the shaky hand-cam style. I am personally delighted that Hammer have returned to what they do best! The setting is so stereotypical of a ghost story it practically becomes a character in the film. And this is by no means a negative thing. The house is suitably isolated by geographic location, fog and the tide. The nearest village is filled with unwelcoming locals and strange tragedies. And the story is set in a time before modern cynicism. Saying that, it is not without its faults. Radcliff tries but it is difficult to accept him as a grieving widower and father. The story is at times too stereotypical and predictable. However, I am welcoming the return of a genre that the British film industry do so well. I hope to see many more."

","Attempting a creepy vibe, this movie doesn't succeed. Instead of building the creep factor, it only manages to build impatience.<br/><br/>In the first 10 minutes, the scene is set perfectly for a good old fashioned ghost story. And for some reason, the next hour is devoted to little except maddeningly tedious scene-setting ambiance. Blinking shadows, clattering mechanical toys, and faces in the window, during which the plot is not moved forward.<br/><br/>Radcliffe is OK, but he doesn't really show the rising levels of fright, frustration, or anything really that might have made the sequences useful. A better actor (or more experienced, if you like) would be able to come unhinged at least a little bit and make the movie more interesting, even if just for those 40 minutes. The role calls for someone who can carry this movie alone, and he's not there.<br/><br/>As for the ending, I'll just say this: the resolution comes all too easily and the ""plot"" seemed ultimately pointless, with the end a complete mushy letdown. Not spooky, not scary, not creepy, and worst of all, not interesting."

","When I watched that movie I was hoping to see an interesting film with some suspense and, to some extent, a story to tell... Well I didn't. This movie has nothing to be jealous of old horror b-movies. Suspense coming from sounds in an old creepy house, people knowing stories but not telling them and an innocent hero making his way through the corridors, and ... well that's all. No story plot that cannot be woven within five minutes and no clichés left out, from the old toys to the long corridors with the candlesticks. That's it. When finally one thinks that it is coming to an end, the hero and his beloved child predictably die and are reunited with the long-dead mother and wife. And of course the black woman is to be seen once again. No build up in the story, no catharsis, no character description, no suspense actually, and very mediocre acting. I understand Mr. Harry Potter tries to establish himself as a serious actor, but this film is clearly the wrong choice."

","This was one of the most generic and amusingly ridiculous haunted house films I've ever seen, but the scares do give you bang for your buck. I suppose it's kind of like ""The Grudge"" in that regard. Personally I was expecting more cerebral atmospheric horror than the choreographed staccato JUMP tactics, but it was very much the latter and they were relentless.<br/><br/>It just felt more like I was watching one of the those attractions at Disney Land, than an actual movie; 70% of the running time is comprised of Radcliff walking from one ridiculously cobwebbed, creepy doll-littered room to the next while the viewer waits nervously for a piercing violin chord and a scary face to jolt them out of their seats.<br/><br/>Radcliff is actually pretty decent for all that he had to do (basically stay wide eyed and tense). Ciarán Hinds was underused and the rest of the cast were just bleh... Not sure I can compliment the actress who played the ghost, but her makeup team did an exceptional job.<br/><br/>Entertaining distraction, but don't expect to even remember the character's names once the credits start rolling."
"shloozle_berry_man","5","3","4","22 February 2012"," I wouldn't *exactly* call it dull...
","First off, I found it very difficult to believe Daniel Radcliffe as a father of a four year old. He just looks too young. He also gives a pretty unimpressive performance through out the whole film, but I wasn't really surprised. The film isn't about him after all, it's really about the woman in black and the mystery therein. So anyway, there's all this build-up for the first forty minutes of the film where you see the locals are visibly scared by something and they're acting all queer-like. It never really says why they're so eager to get Arthur Kipps (Radcliffe) away from town and we're just led to assume it's because they're scared of the ghost. Yep, okay. A child dies. The town blames Kipps so Kipps, ever the motivated hero that he is, decides to spend a night in the haunted house working. The next twenty minutes is about as exciting as the film gets, but relies on cheap jumps and scares to do so. It's not really building towards something, it's just moving through the motions. Ultimately, the ending was just forced so that we might feel something for Kipps, even though his ultimate fate is by no means emotional and just feels, as I mentioned before, as if it's going through the motions. The only reason I gave 5 Stars (out of 10) was for the entertainment value of the 20 minute ""night in the house""."

","I was just taken to see this as a birthday present, and I must say that, although Radcliffe does some very good work in it, and the new ending they came up with was fresh and interesting (if a bit twisted), I really felt disappointed that the stage play, which I saw several years ago in an EXCELLENT local production in Los Angees, was so much better. Except for one moment in the middle (you'll know it when you see it, but you won't find any spoilers here), I didn't find it scary at all, and all of the interviews with Radcliffe have hopelessly built it up to be ""really scary"" (Radcliffe's words). It's not. The stage play made me jump SEVERAL times AND has the wonderful added layer of the actor being hired by the older Kipps to play his younger self (with the actor ultimately finding himself BECOMING Kipps in a never-ending cycle), which the movie completely dropped for some mysterious and unexplained reason. That said, the film does have some great cinematography and moody lighting effects, but nothing we haven't seen done to death (and better) in the ""Potter"" series of films."

","I don't recommend this movie as an outing to the theater because the cost to go just isn't worth it. The location was awesome! The storyline was very weak, but it really did have potential. Once you got to the end of the movie, the story didn't make sense and did not have resolution. It was a decent enough film, but did not rate the ""scary"" hype. I would suggest it as a rental because it would make for a fun girls sleepover where expectations are not high, because it wasn't a total wash. There were some moments of tension, where the scares were still scary even though they were expected and very clichéd. The actors' performances were watchable and in some scenes enjoyable.

","There's nothing to dislike about this new version of Susan Hill's classic ghost story, THE WOMAN IN BLACK, except that it's been filmed before (in the 1980s) and, inevitably, the earlier one was better. But this release of the story, made by the newly-revamped Hammer films, gets most things right.<br/><br/>First off, the production has a wonderful look to it. The locations are wonderfully bleak and isolated and the backdrops scream Gothic. The characters look and feel right, from the reliable Ciaran Hinds to, yes, Daniel Radcliffe as the youthful hero (I'm no fan of Radcliffe in the Potter films, but having seen MY BOY JACK I'm convinced of his talents).<br/><br/>The horror aspects of the story are where this new production falls down a little. Not because they're bad, because the scares are efficient enough in themselves...it's just that they're so, well, predictable. THE WOMAN IN BLACK is one of those films that suckers the reader into a quiet moment before startling them with a sudden movement or loud noise (and sometimes both together). And it does it over and over again. And again after that.<br/><br/>Still, for me, mood and atmosphere is everything, and at least this gets that right. The scares may be predictable, but in all other respects THE WOMAN IN BLACK is a film that pays affectionate homage to both its source material and the kind of glorious ghost stories of old."

","Before you write raving review for a movie, you should probably look at the film as a whole and not just give it a 10 because Daniel Radcliffe is in it. The plot is absurd - he's on a spooky haunted island, rustling up evil spirits so he can close a case he's working on? Really? And 90% of the movie is the same thing over and over. The main character is looking at the camera and in the background something creepy happens...LOUD NOISE! Why doesn't he just leave? If a REAL person experienced any of those things, they'd be like, ""F*** it, I'm going home."", but he never seems to be bothered. You can't have a realistic character that doesn't experience normal human emotion. It causes dissociation. Empty, ridiculously repetitive story. If you LOVED this film, you know nothing about storytelling. Watch it again, without thinking, ""Harry is so hot..."" and you'll realize the movie sucks. Why don't you just re-watch a Harry Potter movie, rather than wasting $8.50?"

If you've ever seen ""The Others"" with Nicole Kidman or ""The Innocents"" with Deborah Kerr you know what a good, old fashioned haunted house film can be. You don't need any fancy CGI or special effects. What you do need is a solid story that people can relate to. This film doesn't have that. <br/><br/>We were disappointed. Yes, there are a couple of creepy moments but it was more like riding one of those carnival rides that the car moves through on a track with animatronic, robot figures jumping out in front of you with loud screeching sound effects. <br/><br/>The sets are beautiful and I suppose the acting is OK although it was no stretch for Radcliff to play this role.

"Joe_Chadowski","5","11","24","3 February 2012"," Far from the masterpiece it could have been
","The all purpose point of a horror movie is to make you forget the reality around you, and make you buy into the alternate world it has created. It must do this using originality, or an improvement on an idea, because in a horror film, predictability is its worst enemy. It's is a deathly balancing act of reeling you in and terrorizing you, while not losing focus with the viewer. This is extremely difficult to do, and is the reason why there are so few horror masterpieces and an abundance of failures. <br/><br/>You are presented with Arthur Kipp, played by Daniel Radcliffe, who is a young lawyer, still struck with grief after his wife died in childbirth. He is on the verge of being fired, and his boss gives him one last job to prove his dedication to the firm. This last job is filing paperwork for a recently deceased woman in a unkempt mansion. After immediately being snubbed by the locals, he begins uncovering a ghost story.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Woman in Black is a failure. It falls trap to the majority of horror movie clichés, making it anodyne and gimmicky the point of anonymity. It is a film defined by what it is ultimately capable of doing, and nothing more. And what it is capable of doing, again, falls short. You are hit with an array of boom-bang-scream scares, and plenty of disfigured faces, but nothing progressive.<br/><br/>The storyline is definitely intriguing, but the shallow way it's carried out hints at budget cuts to increase the profit ratio. Daniel Radcliffe had his work cut out for him breaking the mold set by his decade long stint has Harry Potter, and the screenplay doesn't even give him enough time to flex his acting chops and show us what he's really got. It feels more like a showcase.<br/><br/>Ultimately, greatness eludes this film. The story feels watered down, and the characters are dry and undeveloped with no clear motives behind their actions, leaving you questioning everything they do. Despite plenty of tweaks and trinkets to catch the discerning eye, this film can, and will be easily forgotten. With a fresh sounding story, the talent of Ciarán Hinds, and the ability to show the world what Daniel Radcliffe is capable of, this film wastes it all, and is far from the masterpiece it could have been."

I suggest just looping a scary scene from the exorcist instead of wasting your money on this movie.<br/><br/>The atmosphere was predictable and it was clear when to expect a scary moment, which all followed the generic pattern of pseudo psychological thriller horror. <br/><br/>In conclusion really cheap and crude production without finesse or thought, which may appeal to those that just want to jump a few times.

And Harry Potter as Arthur? He still looks like he is 15, so no, not believable in the slightest.

Though most post positive reviews, I must be more honest in my critique of this film. I guess to start, I understand how the woman in black came to literally hate her sister & the sisters husband. So haunting them to death; completely understandable. What was unclear however, was the actual reason for why the vengeance was inflicted upon the whole town & visitors to the town. The synopsis on the movie cover speaks of a murder that was covered up ""allegedly "" by the whole town, which was suppose to explain or justify the actions carried out by our woman in black; but again this ""alleged murder""<br/><br/>fails us, if attempting to justify revenge against visitors to the town ""whom have nothing to do with what transpired before their visit."" Having stated that, well now, for me, the movie becomes illogical because I can't justify, with any stretch of my imagination, as to what poor, poor Mr. Kipps ever did to the woman in black, that explains how he was treated. Was this movie interesting? Absolutely! Was it scary? Heck yeah! Does it make sense, or does the plot hold? Nope. Because, outside of Mr. Kipps hearing what sounds like an accident when in the smog outside El Marsh house, nor during Mr Kipps reading of the letters & birthday cards, do we ever receive any insight of the so called ""murder that's covered up."" Being angry & murdering everyone for something that 2 relatives did to you, is illogical. Bottom line here, the covered up alleged murder needed to be addressed.

It was kind of a spur of the moment decision for a quick date night movie that I had to choose. I was browsing around Fandango and was immediately drawn to it simply because Daniel Radcliffe is in it. I was excited to see he was doing something else new and different from Harry Potter. There were definitely a few parts in it where I couldn't get past him being Harry Potter. Certain words he would say or a certain way he would look just takes you back to Harry. This however did not ruin the movie at all for me.<br/><br/>I grew up watching the good classic horror movies with my dad. So, naturally I feel pretty desensitized from scary movies. This one however, had me really scared. Did it leave me with any sort of lasting impression, not really just some really weird nightmares the night I saw it. <br/><br/>Daniel did an excellent job. Granted he isn't the best actor but you can tell he has grown up from his Harry Potter days. His use of body language was amazing and really helped to tell the story. The cinematography was wonderful. It really captured the time period and the foggy creepiness of England while also getting really beautiful shots to depict the English Countryside. <br/><br/>Overall, I would definitely go see it again and buy the movie. It is definitely worth the $10 ticket. If you miss the classic horror movies go see it. Finally, a horror movie that does what it supposed to do. It wasn't lost in gore and blood.

This was a traditional horror that played more with our senses, expertly throwing something frightening at us in subtle ways that caught us of guard, so that even when we anticipated a jump to come, we were still caught out by the direction in which it came. This was mainly due to some expert direction in the cinematography, having different camera angles suddenly showing us something that a previous angle failed to pick up on even though it should have done.<br/><br/>It takes a lot to make me jump, but there were at least two occasions where I shifted in my seat and uttered a profanity!

The haunted house conceit with all its creeks, cracks, and cranky toys is too old itself to creep me out. That the film revives the old Hammer film company is the best revision of all.<br/><br/>Arthur (Daniel Radcliffe), a young 19th century attorney, is given a last chance with the firm by going to an old Victorian mansion at the end of a vulnerable causeway to settle the estate. Leaving behind his motherless boy, Joseph (Misha Handley), an early part of the abandoned-child ghost motif to come, Arthur and we endure the loud bangs in the house when each door opens, the fuzzy ghost of the mother who long ago lost her child at the mansion, and a thousand other bumps in the night to make even the rude mechanical restlessly sitting next to me say, ""This is getting dumber by the minute."" It's not always dumb if you sense in the adaptation of Susan Hill's classic novel a theme expressed best by James Joyce as the ""melancholy unity between the living and the dead."" <br/><br/>The film pivots on the attempt of parents to connect with long gone or lost children, who return in either vision or reality, depending on your opinion of the occult. In that way the film is saved from being a repetitive vehicle for scary-movie tropes. I even found a visual reference in the long hall of sconces to Jean Cocteau's Beauty and the Beast. Thank goodness for cinema history in needy places.<br/><br/>Kave Quinn's production design, right down to the folk art toys, is noteworthy as is Tim Maurice-Jones's cinematography, be it bird's-eye shots of the mansion or dimly-lit corridors. In a better horror story, both artists would be better feted.<br/><br/>If you are anything of a realist, you'll probably chuckle at the ending, a lame attempt to reflect Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's belief in spiritualism.

"Ramascreen","6","9","21","2 February 2012"," Harry Potter meets Ghost
","-- www.Ramascreen.com --<br/><br/>THE WOMAN IN BLACK is a mildly entertaining horror film that rides heavily on the popularity of Daniel Radcliff. It's going to make a lot of money at the box office, not because it's attended by genuine horror fans but because it's attended by Harry Potter fans. But that doesn't necessarily mean a bad thing. Some aspects about THE WOMAN IN BLACK does work, it has enough fright to keep you alert. But the concept is nothing new and the ending is too convenient<br/><br/>Based on an '80s book, by Susan Hill, that was previously turned into a TV movie but this is the first time that it hit the big screen. And with the help from revamped Hammer Productions, which gave birth to a lot of classic Brit horror films, and screenwriter Jane Goldman whose contributions to X-Men: First Class and Kick-Ass I admired, THE WOMAN IN BLACK becomes a feature length horror film that lurks in the dark and frequently jolts you to your core. The film unfortunately suffers from unintentional humorous situations. Scenes that are supposed to be scary becomes slightly comical and scenes that are supposed to be dramatic becomes tacky for lack of a better word.<br/><br/>I enjoy the environment in which the story is set. It's gloomy, often foggy as well, and it features a massive landscape that could drown whenever the tide rises. The film has all the elements needed to tell an effective horror story, a creepy empty mansion, a vengeful, murderous spirit, a protagonist conflicted, and I think director James Watkins did a splendid job of maintaining the unpleasant, uncomfortable tone. The only problem is there are too many mcguffins that come into play. The film is obsessed with certain things way too often. I'm OK with horror films that give ghosts personalities and agendas but the lead ghost in this story is too erratic for my taste.<br/><br/>I know what you're wondering. So how did Radcliffe do in this film? I've gotta be honest with you, Radcliffe playing a father to a son is as unconvincing as Anton Yelchin with facial hair acting like an seasoned man in Like Crazy. It's as hilarious as watching Radcliffe played an older Potter at the end of Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows: Part 2. I just don't buy it. I understand that Radcliffe wants to move on and show the world that he can do more than just casting spells and waving wands, but I don't think he gives the audience enough time to be ready to see him in an adult role. Performance-wise, I think he plays Arthur Kipps with a certain composure, he knows his character is conflicted, part of him just wants to get the job done and return to his son, but part of him wants to believe in the supernatural because he misses his dead wife, which probably lead Goldman to writing an ending that gives you a reunion as the ghost's way of saying thanks. THE WOMAN IN BLACK is in a sense a very traditional ghost story because there's an unfinished business involved and the longing for reunion with restful peace. It doesn't leave much for further interpretation but if you love a good scare, THE WOMAN IN BLACK does the trick.<br/><br/>-- www.Ramascreen.com --"

","If you're a fan of horror flicks, this movie will eventually annoy and bore you. It's like the directors or whatever movie-powers-that-be just decided to throw every possible haunted house scary movie trick into this movie, pretty much all into one or two major haunting scenes, and then called it a day. Shadows that move? Check. Wild flying bird or rogue grounds-keeper rushing into the shot unexpectedly to induce audience screams? Check. Appearing and disappearing figures in the distance? Objects moving on their own, bumps in the night, sinister screams from the great beyond? Check check check. And YAWN. There was also not an original aspect of this plot, the ""what's the point?"" behind this woman in black. Not a one. It's going to be exactly what you suspect. <br/><br/>Now with all that said, there are a few (stress, FEW) things the movie handles pretty well. There's a LOT of darkness and silence in this movie which enhances the goosebumps of anticipation. That's good. Also the way the movie began and ended was satisfactory. You think you know what's going to happen at the end and you do. But when you REALLY get to the end, you're like ""oh, well that was unexpected and kinda cool."" But that's it. Just kinda cool, not even pretty cool and definitely not really cool.<br/><br/>Plenty of people left the theater declaring how awesome this was and how it's about time someone made a ""good scary movie"". Those same people also screamed at EVERYTHING all the way through. So I suppose that means if you scare easily, you'll like it. Otherwise, wait for redbox or something.<br/><br/>AustinInWonderland.tumblr.com @AustinFlowers"

The setting on the little island adds to the atmosphere of fear and loneliness. <br/><br/>I wish that we were able to see a flashback of the the antagonist during her mortal life. If I recall correctly, we only hear her voice when the lawyer is reading her letters. <br/><br/>The main character does remain abnormally nonplussed at times and the ending is somewhat saccharin, but I can forgive these perceived faults for an otherwise scary and thoroughly enjoyable flick."

","Fantastic movie all around, I was very impressed. Nearly everyone in the theater jumped right out of their seats. Daniel Radcliffe was very believable and great to watch. The Woman in Black is delightfully creepy and I will have nightmares for a few nights I'm sure. The movie gets right to the point with a great story and great characters. Not slow moving at all, I jumped and screamed like a girl nearly every 5 minutes. Not a cliché or stereotypical horror. The story was quite astray from most horrors and left a MUST SEE ending. The villain in this story is quite sinister and leaves a chill to the bone every time she appears. There was a serious, terrifying tone throughout the movie that never lost its touch. The movie setting was fantastic; every house, person, toy, or object was creepy and sinister. Some of the best characters I have ever seen in a horror movie. Also, horrifying sound effects were played throughout the movie, some that seriously bothered me and scared me out of my mind. To reiterate, Daniel Radcliffe did a superb job in acting believable as a non-Harry Potter character. Overall this movie is definitely worth the money to see in theaters, the experience is fantastic! An instant classic."

","If you like movies, good movies, you want to be surprised by the story, be grabbed by the acting etc.. If you like horror movies, you hope to see a scary (and hopefully a new and exciting) story with a certain mood in it. A movie that makes you think, a movie that makes you check every room in your house before you go to sleep. <br/><br/>Sadly this movie has none of that. The story is boring, the acting is mawh, the ""scary"" moments are predictable and the ending is exactly how you expect it to end (In the situation that you have at least half a brain and seen a ""13 in a dozen"" movie at least once). It surprises me very much that this movie didn't go straight to DVD. The feeling that i get when i watch a movie like this is that the makers think that the audience that sees the movie consists of a mass of people that lack any kind of intelligence and simply will love the film because the older version of Harry Potter plays in it. Apparently, seen the rating of 6+ out of 10, it works... <br/><br/>So if you belong to the last group i mentioned, you will just love this movie. But if you look for a good (horror) movie or simply a movie to pass the time i recommend to skip this one."

I wanted it to be better than it was; I am a huge fan of the Harry Potter franchise, and have found Daniel Radcliffe a superlative actor. This movie, however, fell a little flat. The story was simplistic but intriguing, but it was no where near scary enough to a horror enthusiast like myself. My American host family, who aren't fans of horror cinema were scared, but I found myself a bit bored. It did fake me at the end, and I loved the final scene.

Tacky gimmicks such as volume-cranked creepy music were used in an attempt to build suspense. Then when the suspense music was at it's loudest--a cheap, cheesy apparition would fly out of nowhere, shrieking and flying at the camera.

The scenes are predictable, meaning that you know exactly when there is going to be a scary moment, the obligatory camera close ups, dark corners, footsteps etc. The movie does add one or two 'edge of the seat moments' but nothing much more can be said in terms of 'Horror'.<br/><br/>Overall good casting, costumes and sets etc but otherwise VERY bland!!!<br/><br/>4/10"
"MosHr","5","21","63","1 February 2012"," The Daniel Radcliffe Exploitation Show
","How much you will enjoy this movie will rest heavily on how much you would enjoy looking at Daniel Radcliffe for two hours. For the entirety of the movie, he is either on the screen or a few seconds away from being so. Daniel Radcliffe is a handsome man; great posture, very well-dressed and the sideburns give him a completely new look that is far and away from Harry Potter. But half an hour into the movie, I'm already sick of looking at him. If it was Emma Watson for two hours, then that'd probably be good entertainment for me but I suppose there are lots of movie goers who would prefer Daniel Radcliffe and this should prove good entertainment for them.<br/><br/>The movie plot is a ghost story but really is an excuse to get Daniel Radcliffe alone inside a house where he cautiously walks from room to room with sudden jack in the boxes frights. We get long shots of him cautiously walking towards something and then BAM! something pops out and then we have another long shot of him reacting and adjusting. A large portion of the movie is spent simply looking at Radcliffe. I remember a few such movies where we spend half the movie looking at beautiful female leads but here looking at Radcliffe isn't as engaging for me.<br/><br/>As a horror movie, it's around par or slightly below par. The low budget really shows through and the unimaginative use of the limited budget really makes the movie grind. The scares are cheap and as the movie goes on, it only increases in frequency rather than in scale and so, the movie really never takes off instead just plodding along. On the other hand, by not being one of those digital camera horror movies, it has some clear beautiful shots but again, somewhat wastes it by staying indoors and only using glimpses of the beautiful setting and outdoors of the location. However, in my book, its biggest fault is that it is simply without many new ideas, if follows the horror genre recipe to the tee and becomes rather predictable.<br/><br/>The focus, the center, the star and the reason for the movie is Daniel Radcliffe and unfortunately, there is not much more. This is probably a good enough reason for a lot of movie goers. However, I found the movie dour, risk-averse and unimaginative."

"rebecca-ry","8","4","8","27 February 2012"," Better than I expected
","'The Woman In Black' genuinely is a really good film, it's had a lot of publicity but for all the wrong reasons.<br/><br/>It is Daniel Radcliffe's first film since the Harry Potter series ended and his performance is good, he doesn't stray too far away from Potter but there are interesting aspects of his character in this. For a start he is a father and is overall shown to be gloomy. I can't tell by Radcliffe's performance in this film alone if he will successfully distance himself from Harry Potter and be seen as a serious actor from here on. I think he will need to spread his wings a bit further if he wants to get rid of his type-cast. We will need to see some more future performances before we can tell. His and the other acting performances in this film were great.<br/><br/>The acting is overshadowed by the frightening aspects of this film, the director and scriptwriter have done well converting this novel and play into a film. There are moments where it can be very predictable which is my main problem with this film, although there are points where you do not expect to be scared or to jump so the film can catch you by surprise occasionally.<br/><br/>The ending is another problem I have but that is more to do with the story itself and is not really the film's fault so it's irrelevant. Overall, I would recommend this film if you are a fan of horror or thriller films and like films full of suspense. Don't watch this if you frighten easily and do not like films which make you jump."

","The cinematic year is off to an inauspicious start. Case in point: The Woman in Black. The whole first hour of the film is a mess, with a story that never reaches its full potential, and actors who feel like they're sleepwalking. Daniel Radcliffe feels miscast, especially since he feels so young to be playing a widowed father. Ciaran Hinds feels flat, and Janet McTeer gives the best performance in the film, but only has two scenes to her credit. On top of that, the first hour is overwrought with cheap ""Boo"" scares. Things are never really that scary. Startling, maybe, but since it's a human reflex to jump at loud noises like the ones that accompany the sudden images in the film, it just feels cheap.<br/><br/>And you also know that a movie is boring when the audience you're watching it with are a lot more entertaining. There were a bunch of people in the theater who would constantly scream at the silliest things. An image of the title ghost walking up to a window in a mansion had a bunch of young girls shouting bloody murder. One guy even dropped his phone and it set the audience on edge. It even got to the point that, when a few people were saying ""No! Don't open that door."" during one scene, a guy literally shouted at the top of his lungs ""Shut the *beep* up!"" The screams themselves still didn't stop there, but I was surprisingly having fun with my audience. Unfortunately, the dull moments don't stop there either...<br/><br/>...the last 30 minutes aren't too much of an improvement. The movie at least finally limits the boo scares to only a very few spare moments, suspense builds up, and things legitimately begin to feel creepy, and even haunting. However, the disappointing ending does take a turn for the absolute worse, indeed, making me regret the experience. Never watch this unless you're watching it with the right audience.<br/><br/>* out of *****"

Set in early 1920's, the period is wonderfully recreated - a time where séance and superstition is rife. <br/><br/>Opening with a creepy melodic score and an eerie children's party which ends mysteriously tragic you know your on somber solid ground and in good horror hands. There are plenty of scares, spine chilling moments and jump scares which have the quality to make hairs stand-up on the back of necks thanks to the fantastic sound design and visuals.<br/><br/>Lamp lit sets, odd grim town folk, rolling fog, graveyards, ghosts, creepy dolls and photos, this version of Woman in Blank oozes atmosphere. James Watkins delivers a slow burning chiller which allows the tragic character of widower Kipp time to breathe.<br/><br/>Based on Susan Hill's novel The Woman in Black's excellent writer Jane Goldman includes the old horror clichés in the screenplay but injects realism along side. It all comes together thanks to the great casting. A mature Daniel Radcliffe as defiant Mr Kipps is surprising effective, veteran Ciarán Hinds is on top form as wealthy land owner Daily and Janet McTeer, Sophie Stuckey, and Liz White are all wonderful. The supporting cast even down to the child actors are effective. Nevertheless, Radcliffe is very much the focus.<br/><br/>It's refreshing like the recent Innkeepers (2011) with it's back to basics approach of little blood and simple chills. Arguably surpassing the Haunted (1995), The Others (2001) and reminiscent of the Haunting (1963) Woman in Black harks back to the days of old school horror and scares with a modern slick execution.<br/><br/>The icing on the cake is its horrible, yet, brave heart wrenching downbeat or debatably upbeat ending which will stay with you long after the credits roll."
"bob the moo","Null","2","3","25 May 2014"," Obvious regarding the genre standards but still effective and surprisingly chilling
","I'm not sure why it took me so long to get around to watching this film – it sat in my queue for quite some time and never appealed. The plot is your standard ghost story / haunted house fare – a tragedy which has resulted in lingering horrors which a new person in town doesn't fully appreciate but, when he does, he tries to make up for the past to make it all stop. There is detail around this but essentially this is what it is and at its base it is familiar. The delivery follows a similar path in terms of what it does, because we have creepy children, creepy dolls, lots of shadows, static figures and half-seen movements.<br/><br/>All of this is very much of the genre but yet it is still effective and I was surprised by just how frightening parts of it were – it more than earns the 12A certificate it got in the UK because for sure the intensity and unnerving aspects of it do more than gore or language would do. The film opens with a strong scene of three children who seem compelled to calmly throw themselves to their death out of an attic window. From here the creepiness continues in a similar, understated manner in the way a good ghost story should. Okay it is not breaking new ground with half-seen faces in windows and lots of jump scares as things happen, but it still works well. I watched it with headphones and the impact of the sound design is also important – while it of course does the sudden noises well, the silence is very well captured because it is not just ""no noise"" but rather the stillness of waiting for something to happen.<br/><br/>Radcliffe leads the film well, convincing in his performance and making for a likable lead – although he has his Potter fame, he doesn't overplay here and (for me at least) his fame didn't distract from me getting into the film. He is well supported by good turns from the supporting cast, but the main work comes from the production design as the house is creepy and is well filmed, lit and captured to have a tangible sense of dread and presence – this is what makes the film as enjoyable as it was. It is still a genre film for sure, but it is one that works well with plenty of atmosphere, chills and scares."

The theming was very well done. The effects are OK but I would not recommend this movie to a friend. In the end is not a bed story and the Woman in Black spirit is not peaceful at final.

","My interest in TWIB was stirred when a friend suggested I watch his recently acquired copy of the 1989 TV Movie of this famous Ghost story based on the work of Susan Hill. Having chosen to start watching said copy at sometime past 11 at night I could not believe what I was witnessing. It was simply a masterpiece in storytelling, with a dark foreboding atmosphere, a gloomy and wild setting and a chillingly horrific spectre. In short all the elements of your classic Ghost story were present and after ""That"" scene (which was frankly heart-stopping) and with images of ""That"" face and ""Those"" eyes, plenty of uneasy nights followed with more than necessary rooms constantly lit around my house.<br/><br/>Needless to say I readily purchased a copy of the Book and was delighted to see that essentially the film had stayed true to the book albeit with a slightly different ending (although the same sentiment)and the odd cosmetic character change here and there.<br/><br/>Fast-forward 3 years to 2012, and this latest production supported by that stalwart of British Horror, Hammer and with an adapted screenplay by Jane Goldman. It is fair to say that with my previous experience of this story I have followed this film's development with some relish and could not have had more anticipation if I'd tried. Unfortunately, perhaps that was my downfall..... <br/><br/>I'm a firm advocate of the old adage ""If it ain't broken, don't fix it"" and for me this new version just tries to be too innovative. Far too many iconic scenes are either completely removed (The Drablow funeral, Spider's tangle with the Marshes, anyone?) or changed beyond recognition (The child's bedroom scenes). Both the book and '89 film gradually built the appearance of the actual Woman in Black with slow snatched glimpses/descriptions that led the reader/viewer to almost be able to feel the evil, not too much seen, just fleeting, haunting and dramatically unsettling images. This new version just reveals too much too early and frankly the whole suspenseful atmosphere just does not feel as genuine as the previous incarnations of this story. That is even before we begin to mention the less than convincing special-effects in use here. Low budget or not, as an avid horror fan, I have seen much more convincing Ghosts created on far smaller budgets. It seems that using heavy doses of black mascara on a real actress as they did 20 odd years ago would have been a much wiser choice.<br/><br/>And now the ending.... Ah, oh dear... What on Earth were you thinking Hammer? In the book - The ending WORKS. in the 1989 version, the amended ending - WORKS! Why, why, why change it for a mish-mash ending used 1,000 times before in almost every other Horror film out there????<br/><br/>It would be unfair to say that TWIB 2012 is a poor film. Far from it. It is still a good story, well recreated period scenes, relatively engrossing and Radcliffe is unrecognisable from his HP days. Honestly, you could think he'd been Potter 15 years ago, such is the drastic change of image. He also turns in a good performance and Ciaran Hinds, as ever is absorbing and masterful in his role.<br/><br/>But that's the problem Hammer and Goldman have combined to give a GOOD Ghost story that offers nothing new. The Book and 1989 version are GREAT and amongst the finest examples of their genres within their respected media. That is quite simply the difference. Now to try to track down a couple of tickets for the stage play to complete the set..."

He can either talk to himself, the dog, or the ghosts that pop up constantly (prompting shrieks from the 14 year old girls who are sitting directly behind us, causing us all to have to plug our ears and me to question if before the end of the movie whether my ears will be bleeding from the trauma).<br/><br/>This movie is based on a novel which I never read, or even knew existed; It's another vengeful ghost story, with lots of scares that everyone sees coming. But this one doesn't entirely make sense. I guess the writers figure a ghost or spirit doesn't have to be rational. But the vengeance The Woman in Black was taking seemed unrelated to her personal vendetta, and therefore petty. <br/><br/>The atmosphere set this movie up for some good scares (mostly ruined by everyone in the theatre), some delivered better than others. It did get a little repetitive after a while, which is sad for a 95 minute film. Daniel Radcliffe's character must not scare easily either. I never got any sort of read on his emotional state for most of the movie. He mostly just looked nonchalant, occasionally mildly surprised or curious. Not nearly the right reactions for the circumstances. <br/><br/>I blame the producers for this lackluster suspense They are probably guaranteed to make money, as most scary movies make more than they cost, and most people will tend to go to anything with Daniel Radcliffe. With the exception of maybe a couple of the secondary actors, it is clear that the cast did not require serious acting skills and were probably paid accordingly. But hey, they made a movie with Harry Potter; they can tell their kids that some day. <br/><br/>This movie is good for some thrills, and that's about it. If you're into that sort of thing, then by all means, check it out."

","Arthur Kipps (Radcliffe) is a young London solicitor still mourning the loss of his wife. Despite this he is forced by his employer to travel to the remote Cryphin Gifford (in order to keep his job) and leave his son behind with a nanny in order to finalise paperwork on a property sale. The property in question is the isolated and deserted Eel Marsh House, the former home of one Mrs. Drablow.<br/><br/>On the long train journey, Kipps befriends Sam Daily (Hinds) a resident of the village and he offers Kipps a lift to the local inn and guesthouse. Once there, as is usually the case with remote out in the middle of nowhere villages, he is met with a decidedly frosty reception and told in no uncertain terms that there are no vacancies. The landlords wife then offers up the attic which he gratefully accepts. The next morning upon meeting with a local solicitor, Kipps is told to return to London. Something is definitely amiss around here.<br/><br/>We soon come to find out though that the house is haunted and that whenever someone spots the mysterious 'woman in black' a child in the village dies. Suffice to say you know what will be coming next. Now as ghost stories go, this is certainly above the norm but in itself there is nothing groundbreaking or new. What it does do though it does rather well. The suspense is good and the whole atmosphere is rather bleak and grim. This is also not a colourful film, instead oozing with dark shades and shadows. This does suit the mood and style of the film though.<br/><br/>There are a couple of twists here and there and the story overall is reasonably well written as a screenplay, though the reveal isn't really that surprising. The ending is somewhat open to interpretation and I like how this finished. The directing is adequate and the use of CGI appears to have been kept down to a minimum given the genre. The set designs and costumes are very impressive as is the actual location and everything looks as if it does actually belong in the film. I suppose the only real slight negative might be in Radcliffe himself.<br/><br/>I certainly commend him on his move to help friends and to concentrate more on indie projects and unusual films in an attempt to move away from Harry Potter. While I personally felt he was a little weak here (compared to his brilliant performance in Horns), his meek and mild manner did suit the character. Overall this is a reasonable film, but do not expect to be blown away. Slightly above average fair that probably would have been a big miss without Radcliffe's name attached to it.<br/><br/>

"CinemaSerf","6","1","1","7 February 2020"," Some things are just better left to the stage...
","The problem with this whole concept is that it works so very much better on the stage. This isn't a terrible adaptation of Susan Hill's novel by any means, and Daniel Radcliffe does fine; but there is no suspense. The ghost is way too two dimensional; there is nothing eerie or scary about it - your imagination doesn't really get to run riot with this production at all. Marco Beltrami's score adds little to the tension either. Perhaps if you've never seen the play, then this might be better but for me it was a very poor relation."

He gives him a proper burial right next to the mother, and goes to the train station to go home to London. Next thing you know they are all dead. What a stupid ending.

","(2 out of 10 stars; spoilers only after the ***)<br/><br/>This movie is a gripping tale about loss and grief. A young, widowed parent is learning how to deal with losing a loved one and experiences terrifying events along the way. With a truly unnerving atmosphere, great actors, striking contrast cinematography and spot-on direction, this one has easily earned its place in the top 5 horror movies of the last decade, if not of all times. Jennifer Kent's directorial debut...<br/><br/>...wait, we are talking about The Babadook, aren't we? Oh, The Woman in Black, OK, here we go:<br/><br/>Watching this movie can be best compared to riding the ghost train at your local fair: You know, they will bombard you with loads of jump scares, loud sudden noises and scary faces. You can see the scares coming from miles away, even before the bend. Still, you flinch and jerk a couple of times. However, in the end you are actually rather bored, because there is no menacing atmosphere or anything that really gets under your skin. After all, you know from the get-go that you will never be in real danger. When it's over, you are rather relieved and soon you go on to never think or speak of it again.<br/><br/>Throw in a gothic look, acting as wooden as Pinocchio, uninspired direction, bad continuity and every sucked-out horror cliché you can find out there and you get: The Woman in Black, taa-daa!<br/><br/>It is simply astonishing, how truly uninspired a ""horror"" film this is (though, I tend to rather call it a mystery flick, as nothing truly terrifying ever happens and there is no gore). Want to go through the horror-text-book-checklist?<br/><br/>Grieving main character dealing with loss. Remote village with hostile inhabitants who refuse to interact with our hero except for ushering vague warnings. Even more remote haunted house that is temporarily completely cut off from the outside world. Dark, gothic look. Big deserted creep-house with baroque interior like paintings and chandeliers, covered in cobwebs. Creaking floorboards. Objects that suddenly move without outside interference (doors, even a freaking rocking chair, spare me not!).Haunting ghost presence, which cannot be at peace until reunited with its loved one. Strange noises, coming from whichever room our main character is not in. Stupid character always moving exactly toward that noise. Darks shadows and/or ghosts suddenly appearing or just standing in the distance which are suddenly gone when the camera cuts to them for the next time. Children who move as if remotely controlled, with empty eyes and slow, zombie-like movements. Old letters and newspaper articles, some scribbled with mad comments IN RED. Spooky children's toys and dolls with dead eyes, children's voices and songs. Impenetrable fog and heavy rain appearing out of the blue whenever handy for the movie's scare tactics. YOU NAME IT, IT IS ALL THERE (and more)!!!!<br/><br/>Nevertheless, none it this is scary as the director and script utterly fail to provide some kind of meaningful atmosphere or a story or characters to make you care.<br/><br/>***spoilers ahead***<br/><br/>Here comes, as always, a non-exhaustive list of the movie's faults and stupidities:<br/><br/>1. Probably the main issue with this movie: We know, at the latest after the second appearance of the WiB, that Harry Potter himself is not, and will not be, in danger, as the WiB targets only children. Hence, watching him stumble around from jump scare to jump scare loses even more of its tension - disregarding the lame execution which makes it boring to begin with - as you know that nothing is going to go down (on him at least).<br/><br/>2. The WiB keeps on appearing and scaring Harry Potter, but this never goes anywhere.<br/><br/>3. The only thing to go anywhere is actually Harry Potter himself. In the main and most agonizingly drawn-out scene which takes up at least a third of the film, he spends the night at creep-mansion. Slowly but surely things start to get freaky and ghosts start to pop up somewhere in Harry's field of vision but far away, either outside when he is in the house, inside, when he is out, in a room upstairs when he is in the main hall... you get the idea. And what does Harry do each single time? Frown a little and then start to walk towards the noise or apparition, but slooooowwlyyy step by step, so the camera has ample opportunity to pan back and forth and in and out to build up tension and then make us jump at the final scare. Each time accompanied by a loud bang of music or noise. He does that five or six times (instead of trying to get the hell outta there or at least doing something about the ghosts), the scene literally takes half an hour, until morning and his friendly saviour arrive to take him back to the village.<br/><br/>4. Only, where is the dog they introduced so prominently at the beginning of the scene? Just vanished.<br/><br/>5. I am going to have to say it: Daniel Radcliffe cannot act for the life of him!! He wears the same dull and slightly startled, stoic look on his face for the entire movie. You can't say whether he is angry, scared, tired, happy or just bored.<br/><br/>6. If the WiB hates all the town folk's kids so much, why not just finish all of them off right away? No, of course she has to take them slowly, one by one.<br/><br/>7. So, WiB's evil force is to have kids commit suicide. This logically means that the girl in the basement set the fire herself. While half the house already burnt down and everyone ran outside, she is still in the basement, unharmed. She only torches herself with the oil lamp in the very last second, when Harry Potter is there to watch it. Nope, not buying it.<br/><br/>8. Of course, the solution - which we all saw coming from miles away 15 minutes into the movie - is to reunite the WiB with her dead son who was so wrongfully taken from her. After this has been finally done, it turns out, this actually does not pacify the evil ghost and she still goes on to kill, not only Harry Potter's son, but also our hero himself. So they can finally both be reunited with their dead mum and wife. All good, evil ghost even twists a little smile (you're welcome, Harry), end credits roll. Does this mean that the solution to all this grief is just to botch yourself, so you can finally be at peace? Why did WiB kill all those kids, if she cannot be reconciled by delivering her dead son?<br/><br/>9. The WiB's sons body is still intact, after being sunken in the swamp covered by the thickest mud for years, while his mom has already rot to a skeleton in her casket.<br/><br/>10. Not a single parent in the world would actually let their kid's hand go, while standing on a platform when a train is approaching. Of course, Harry Potter, after witnessing several children suicides, and being well aware that WiB was after his son until moments ago, DOES JUST THAT.<br/><br/>11. The ONLY TWIST in the movie, I did not see coming, was that the friendly neighbour with the car is actually indeed the only decent human being in the film and DOES NOT turn on or betray our hero."
"arthur_tafero","4","1","1","10 March 2019"," All Atmosphere; No Substance
","Scary movies are supposed to be scary; this one is not. There are more holes in this story than a large portion of Swiss cheese. It does get an A for production values, however. Harry Potter gives us his best efforts, but he cannot possibly escape his child personna with his average acting ability. Three children suddenly commit suicide and that is the basis for beginning this tedius, (and sometimes boring) tale of supposed horror. I have had haircuts that were more horrible than this film.
The supporting cast is stilted and pretentious. Some of the scenes are stilted and pretentious as well. It was a good try at Gothic horror, but it clearly fails to deliver the goods. Harry is supposed to be a failing lawyer. He also has trouble paying his bills with the not so subtle scene of his bills in his suitcase. The film reminded me of a much more expensive version of The Blair Witch Project; another piece of contentious kaka, that would possibly only scare seven-year-olds; just like this one. As for an adult movie-goer, you would be well-advised to see Snow White and the Seven Dwarves as a rental rather than this tedius attempt at horror. ""That was a scary one, eh kids?"" (my apologies to Joe Flaherty)."
"Theo Robertson","6","1","1","30 March 2014"," Slightly Predictable And Repetitive But Good At What It Does
","A very easy film to market . Just tell everyone it's a Hammer production even though many production and distribution companies were involved in the production , stick in Daniel Radcliffe fresh from the Harry Potter franchise and use a poster that looks exactly like a Harry Potter poster and you're guaranteed to make a profit within a couple of weeks of the film opening especially if you're looking at a certificate 12 where some recent Harry Potter fans might want to see it <br/><br/>One should bare in mind that despite the association with Hammer THE WOMAN IN BLACK isn't an out and out horror film but more in line with a traditional English ghost story meets period drama .Did I mention this was a 12 certificate ? It does have that Hammer ethos where a young middle class gentleman arrives in a small village where they're not used to strangers and this newly arrived stranger finds himself trying to solve a mystery . It's interesting how many people who feel the need to comment on the film constantly use the adjective "" atmospheric "" to describe it and it's impossible not to notice this . It's also well photographed and the look of the film has a blueish cold tone to it and the film contains some very good set design . The downside to all this is that for long periods of the film there's not much happening narrative wise and gets a little bit repetitive as Radcliffe's character Arthur Kipps enters a dark , lonely room , looks around nervously then "" BANG "" a loud noise is added to the sound mix making the audience jump . It's a cheap trick , though an effective one but becomes very overused and the portent dread built up in the early half of the film becomes negated by the repetitive predictable manner as the film continues . That said having watched far too many recent horror films ( Usually on the Horror Channel ) whose only selling point is mean spirited graphic gore it is nice that occasionally a film like this comes along that isn't dependent upon violence in order to grab the audience and make money so here's hoping the somewhat dubious but successful name of Hammer continues with THE QUIET ONES and well in to the future"

","Now, this movie is god , but not that good. To start off, the plot is very confusing if you don't think about it too much. Especially the ending. So there's this woman who lost her son in an accident, and now, every time someone sees her, children commit suicide. Why? I don't know, someone please explain this.<br/><br/>There are also as you guessed from the title a ton of jump scares, and these are sometime minutes apart and more often seconds. Seriously the woman in black just screams or lurks. That's all she does up till the end. And half of these jump scares just come off as annoying rather than scary.<br/><br/>And I believe one of the main selling points of this entire movie was Daniel Ratcliff.<br/><br/>However, the atmosphere was dark and creepy, and there are some excellent effects, and great cinematography. Thankfully the actors acted rather well, including some of the child actors. The ending though does need to be thought about or explained, but once you get it, it's very satisfying."
"TxMike","Null","1","1","27 June 2012"," Young lawyer seeks to keep his job but lands in a haunted house.
","My public library bought this DVD so I just had to see it, as I do with most movies they obtain. It was good to see Radcliffe in a role past his 'Harry Potter"" days but horror movies are not my favorite genre.<br/><br/>Daniel Radcliffe is young London lawyer Arthur Kipps , whose young wife had died, leaving him with a young son and lots of grief. So much grief that he didn't function too well and was in danger of losing his job with the firm. He was given this assignment that he had to do well.<br/><br/>It involved an estate, the Eel Marsh House, on an island of sorts accessible by a road during low tide only, with a marsh on each side of the road. The old widow had died and the law firm was to execute her will but there were lots and lots of papers at the old house and Kipps needed to go through ""every last one"" to make sure the will was the most current. Kipps travels there by train and found all the locals in fear over the property.<br/><br/>The first and last parts of the movie are very interesting, the middle not so much as it moves slowly and relies on many close-up views of distressed faces and many loud noises to surprise the viewer. All-in-all a pretty entertaining movie. Especially since it cost me nothing! <br/><br/>SPOILERS: Kipps eventually deduced that a woman (in black) was haunting the grounds and the house. Her young son had been ""taken away"", adopted, then he drowned in the marsh but his body was never recovered. She hanged herself and there would be trouble, other people's kids dying, as long as she and her boy were not united. Kipps managed to dive into the marsh to find the boy's body, and opened the woman's grave to place the boy with her. He figured that set things straight, but when his own son with the nanny showed up at the train station, the boy wandered off onto the tracks, Kipps jumped down to save him, both were killed by the train, then they saw their dead wife/mother on the tracks, they were all reunited in death."
"geodrake-71-627198","5","1","1","25 February 2012"," These are the sort of windows faces look in.
","'The Woman In Black' is a tribute to the Victorian revival of Gothic-style ghost stories. Thus it concentrates on atmosphere and melodrama. Susan Hill's plot from her novel has been altered for the film to give Kipps (Radcliffe) a back story that creates more audience sympathy toward him. A movie that relies on atmosphere to build up the scares, it falls back on the clichéd 'scared villagers' and 'abandoned house' when it should have concentrated on tighter direction and better camera work. All the scares are of the 'boo, made you jump' variety. Nothing gets under the skin or lodges in the mind to unsettle or disturb the audience, which is strange given that the ghost preys on children and could have been played for those angles. Performances are uneven. Radcliffe doesn't have to do much apart from looking depressed and scared, his character is never fleshed out but that is the fault of the script rather than Radcliffe's acting. Mrs. Daily (Janet McTeer), is unintentionally comic when she's channelling spirits. I found myself actually starting to giggle when she was carving pictures into the table whilst in a trance. Overall, the film is like bread made without enough yeast, it fails to rise or fill out. The relentless use of obvious CGI for the ghosts starts to irritate as well. See if you can spot the blooper where Kipps and Daily (Ciaran Hinds) are shown driving along a modern day tarmac road."
"GoldenGoggles","7","1","1","22 February 2012"," Predictable & slightly disappointing
","I'll try and keep this a brief review.<br/><br/>To support my summary of 'predictable and slightly disappointing'; I thought it was predictable because it was advertised as a 'jumper'. By this I mean a film that uses suspense and load noises and imagery to scare the viewer or make them jump. This effect leaves no post-traumatic stress which only a few horrors and thrillers really cause these days. For example, the Paranormal Activity films, personally left some anxiety afterwards because of the realism in the film but also the way in which the events take place in bedrooms and the home in which we are expected to go to sleep in after watching them (with difficulty).<br/><br/>The sudden flashing imagery and screaming to cause jumps in the film were effective; most likely of which for myself, was the woman screaming in the reflection on the window whilst the protagonist is looking down on the graveyard. However this is a little predictable for enabling fear or a jump in the audience and resembles a 'ring girl online game' or 'zombie girl' in which the user is scared spontaneously whilst viewing or interacting with a video by a girl or woman screaming suddenly appearing on the scream with use of audio to back up the suspense and scare.<br/><br/>Whilst it sort of celebrates Daniel Radcliffe's diversity as an actor, and I don't doubt the quality and commitment he gave to the role, for an hour and fifteen minute thriller I was disappointed. I appreciated the narrative and storyline (which ironically some people didn't) but the execution of the premeditated reaction in which everyone expected from this film did not deliver.<br/><br/>JWL."
"TheLittleSongbird","8","5","12","19 February 2012"," Not entirely perfect, but very atmospheric and genuinely scary
","There are a few assets that drew me into seeing The Woman in Black in the first place. One was to see if Daniel Radcliffe had grown as an actor and whether he would acquit himself well in a cast-against type sort of role. And there is also the support cast, Ciaran Hinds, Janet McTeer, Roger Allam and Shaun Dooley are quite a cast don't you think, and especially that I loved the book, the 1989 TV version and stage play so much. I went to see The Woman in Black a few days ago with my 3 sisters, but I wanted to think about in depth what I thought about the film before writing about it. It was a film that I still can't get out of my head and even just yesterday my sisters and I were having this big discussion about what we liked and comparing it to its other mediums.<br/><br/>Regarding this 2012 film, all of us thought it was very good. It wasn't perfect, no, and it has received and perhaps continue to receive inevitable comparisons to the book which has many engrossing and telling chapters, the stage play which is the most chilling thing I've seen on stage since seeing The Mousetrap and especially the TV version which I regard very highly for its atmosphere and unforgettable conclusion. On its own though, it is a very solid and worthy film and adaptation. For one thing, The Woman in Black is very handsomely mounted. The Victorian period is very evocative in detail with beautifully tailored costumes and meticulous-looking scenery and settings and genuinely effective in atmosphere with the dark old house, spooky sea fog, foreboding marsh and faces at the window. The camera work is also very good with the close-up shock cuts particularly good, and the lighting is dark and atmospheric while never being too dark you can't see what's going on.<br/><br/>The music score I also took to, there is a haunting and hypnotic quality to it that suits the film's tone very well. Likewise with the sound effects mostly, the sudden loud noises and the starting quiet and crescendoing contributed much to the best scares of the film, though the earlier ones were a little obvious and predictable and had the audience laughing rather than biting their nails. Dialogue-wise, it is solid, staying loyal to the period generally and it kept me engaged with Arthur's predicaments and the mystery of The Woman in Black. After my viewing of the film I did have some questions such as why the Woman in Black still took revenge even when the body of her son was returned, but having the discussion with my sisters really helped.<br/><br/>When it comes to the story, it is a timeless one with a chilling atmosphere. The Woman in Black(2012) does a much better-than-expected job with adapting it in a short running time, a vast majority of scares are very atmospheric advantaged by the purposefully glacial pace, more the making-you jump kind than the gory kind, with the Woman in Black gliding down the corridor, the screech at the window, the hanging and the brief glimpse of the woman in black in the creaking rocking chair faring the best of them. Of the children's deaths, the most effective was that of the Fisher Girls, especially in a choreographic sense, just look at how perfectly in time their walking is and how their eyes absolutely make you believe they are in a trance. McTeer's ""momentary mental instability"" scenes were also very intense and heart-breaking.<br/><br/>Only two scenes weren't so good for me, other from one or two earlier predictable jump scares. One was the death of Lucy, while tragic in circumstance it was clumsily staged and lacked the magnetic quality the choreography of the very first scene did. The other scene, and I think the biggest let down of the film, was the ending. In a sense it was grim but there was also something uplifting and bittersweet to it, for me it juxtaposed too much with the film's overall tone and it was nowhere near as satisfying or as memorable as the conclusion of the 1989 version.<br/><br/>I also think two scenes from the book could have been added, making the film even better, Alice Drablow's funeral which introduced us to the Woman in Black and was one of the book's more telling scenes, and the Whistling scene which is the single creepiest and atmospheric scene of the book, just how it is written is enough to make your heart go in your mouth. This film was fine enough without them, it's just that I was wondering how incredible those two scenes would have been if they were included. The characters engage, Arthur Kipps is likable enough, but I found the Dailys and Woman in Black the film's most interesting characters, Sam Daily is so sympathetic and the Woman in Black is evil incarnate even evoking fear in the scenes she doesn't feature in.<br/><br/>The acting is very good. Daniel Radcliffe while I initially had reservations of whether he was too young for the role acquits himself quite nicely as Arthur, a role that is very cast-against- type, showing melancholy, sensitivity and genuine fright throughout, and this is in the facial expressions alone. Ciaran Hinds is excellent as Sam, and Janet McTeer gives a very moving performance. Roger Allam, Tim McMullan and Shaun Dooley are good in small roles, but other than Hinds and McTeer I was most impressed by Liz White as Jennett/Woman in Black, in a role that is so evil and so omnipresent whether in scenes where she's featured or where she is talked about or in thought White is absolutely terrifying.<br/><br/>All in all, a very good film, not perfect but atmospheric, scary and more than stands its own even if the book, TV version and stage play are superior. 7.5/10 Bethany Cox"

","This movie scared the willyknockers out of me. There are the scenes with ""jump scares"" but there is so much more to this film.<br/><br/>The melancholic and depressing town, the mysterious and paranoid residents, the story of the ""Woman in Black"" and how she preys on children, the rainy weather that adds an ominous effect, and the Woman in Black's house all combine to create an intense atmosphere.<br/><br/>The foreboding nature of the setting is relentless on your nerves as the story starts out with three little girls and doesn't let up on the tragic consequences that accompany Arthur's (Radcliffe) arrival.<br/><br/>Lack of music amplifies the constant feeling that something bad is going to happen at any given time. Your ears search for anything to cover up what might scream, screech, or jump out at you but there's nothing. The naked feeling is unsettling as you wait for the inevitable piano bang or drum strike, but there's nothing.<br/><br/>The acting is solid as Daniel Radcliffe proves he's more than just a lucky boy who was cast in Harry Potter. He really gave it his all as most of the time, it was just him in the house. The other actors were just as great and lent to a real feeling of paranoia throughout the story.<br/><br/>This film reminds me as to why people get creeped out by looking at old photos from the Edwardian period. There's something otherworldy about this era in time - whether it's the clothes, the expressions on people's faces, the look of it all, I'm not sure what causes the unsettling feeling. But it was pure genius to set such a dark and suspenseful tale in the middle of this already creepy time.<br/><br/>There were far more scary moments than I thought there would be. It doesn't rely on cheap tricks such as Arthur turning around and there's someone in front of him. This is much more subtle, but in your face. I couldn't believe how scared I was! The creepy moments were constant and hardly left me time to process the first scare before the second came up.<br/><br/>Altogether, I still can't watch this movie. It is genuinely one of the scariest films I have ever seen."

For a horror, it did well in the ""take your high school girlfriend to scare the crap out of her"" scary moments but the plot was somewhat weak. Not a lot of thought was put into this movie and I felt it was created more for the ""scare a minute"" factor than actual storyline substance.

"Lyra-gp","8","3","6","2 March 2012"," Frights that taste like antiquity
","The Woman in Black comes from the past, in any sense. From the best selling book by Susan Hill, written in the 80s, it tells a ghost story that accurately respects the ancient tradition of the genre. The attempt to bring to life this kind of novel, about ancient manors and ghastly appearances, might, at a first glance, seem rather risky and unnecessary. This is definitely true if we think of the nature of the movie that, in fact, does not bring any new innovation to the genre. Fortunately, if we focus on the way the movie is made we may find lots and lots of reasons to watch this movie.<br/><br/>First of all, the 19th century atmosphere of the Woman in Black completely swallows you up. Many times, while watching the movie, I totally empathized with the protagonist. I cannot tell whether that's good or bad, as in many cases I was glad I wasn't really in the protagonist shoes. The whole setting (costumed people included) is so well-created that every time manages to make you feel anxious/worried/scared according to the circumstance. This is one of the greatest points of strength of the movie.<br/><br/>Secondly, the movie knows how to scare you. I am not claiming that it will give goose-bumps even to the bravest man on the earth, but that it successfully manages to give you a general sense of sickness by an intelligent use of every detail present in the movie. And here we have scary dolls, frightening toys, spooky objects. All of them accurately created, aimed to make you feel uncomfortable and worried. Of course, this may vary according to the type of watcher but I really appreciated the way the fear was orchestrated. <br/><br/>The most appealing feature of the movie is, undoubtedly, the presence of Daniel Radcliffe. Daniel's interpretation is highly satisfying and provides us with a great expression of his real talent. Along with all the other remarkably capable actors, he's exactly what we expect from a movie like this.<br/><br/>Finally, even if you're not particularly fond of ghost stories, why don't you give it a try?"

","A young lawyer travels to a remote village where he discovers the vengeful ghost of a scorned woman is terrorizing the locals.<br/><br/>Nowadays, scary movies are pieces of crap. They rely on overused gore and sex to lure people in, but the one thing they don't provide is scares. People believe that they're in for something great, but they come out disappointed. When I first saw Woman in Black, I was secretly intrigued. Although it looked cliché from the trailer, and even a bit stupid, something there wanted me to see it. After hearing how it was based of a famous play, the expectations grew slightly more. After hearing this and that, the expectations grew even more! You get the point. I finally got to see the film, and guess what! It was great... Woman in Black finally takes thing back. What I mean is, the film doesn't take place in modernized times, which could be good.. or bad. The film perfects the time setting and makes you feel how the people lived way back then. Every time the main character showed up on screen, I instantly started to think of Harry Potter. Not a problem, because Daniel did a great job in the film. He looked a little cheap sometimes, but for his first role is something OTHER than that, I liked it. The film progresses and the chills began. Great news for all, the movie was actually pretty scary! The film relies on tension sometimes, but others the movie can break out and show you something horrifying. They each balance each other out, and I thoroughly felt each one. Especially in one scene, where the main character walks around the house, probably scaring us 10 times in a row. The movie seemed to slow down sometimes, and maybe even got a little stupid, but I was amazed at how good it was. Horror movies are bad sometimes, but thankfully I think this brings back the true, classic horror films. The plot, acting, and tension were all engrossing and I give kudos for the director for finally creating a true horror film. Then the ending... I hated the ending, and maybe that's why the score was dropped by 1, but it was really bad. If you've ever seen Insidious, and that whole one scene where the person goes into astral projection, you'll know what I mean. The movie begins kind of realistic (not really, but you know what I mean) but the ending made it seem like a fantasy horror story. I understood the point, but I think it didn't belong there. Otherwise, I recommend. If your a fan of true Hitchcock films with actually a plot, and no use of gore, then this is your film to see. And yet again, I'll say it! It's pretty damn scary. 8/10."

","Despite always hearing the studio get mentioned when ever something is made about British Horror films,Hammer's Horror movies are something which I have somehow completely missed seeing!.<br/><br/>Around a week or so ago,I began to hear that for the third attempt of bringing the studio back to life,Hammer had made a co-production of a ghost story called The Woman In Black,and since having found the US ghost/demon film Insidious to be something really spooky, (although it did perform one huge ""jump the shark"",to get to its admittedly strong final shock)I decided to take my first ever look at ""Hammer Horror"" <br/><br/>The plot:<br/><br/>Being told by his boss that he has one last chance to prove that he can be a useful solicitor,recently widowed Arthur Kipps is ordered to pay a visit to a town in the north east of England,where the estate of Alice Drablow (who also owned a house placed on a small connecting island near by) needs to be sorted.Shortly after arriving to the town,Kipps starts to hear almost all of the residents plead for him to leave the town at once,and to not pay a visit to Drablow's old house.<br/><br/>Meeting a resident called Sam Daily, (whose wife has never been able to fully get over the strange death of their child) Arthur breaths a sigh of relief,due to feeling that he has at last found someone who is welcoming towards him.Deciding to ask Sam about why the rest of the town's people are acting so agitated around him,Sam tells Kipps that the main cause of the problem is that almost all of them believe in some ""paranormal mumble- jumble"" about the ghost of Alice Drablow going around the town causing the deaths of the areas children.<br/><br/>Still feeling slightly uneasy about what he has heard and seen around the town,Arthur decides that he should pay a visit to Drablow's house,so that he can at last sort out all of her financial details and then get as far away from the town as possible!.Unsurprisingly not being able to find many people willing to take him to the house,Kipps pays a good amount of cash so that he can be taken to the front gate of the house.<br/><br/>As Arthur starts to work through the night at the isolated house,he takes a look outside a window,and for a moment sees an image of a ghostly-looking woman dressed in black. <br/><br/>View on the film:<br/><br/>Viewing the credits of director James Watkins,it is very interesting to see that instead of sticking to an ""old faithful"" and making a second version of his ""Chav Horror"" Eden Lake, Watkins instead took a risk that has paid off handsomely.For the haunting Edwardian setting of the film,Watkins and Guy Richie's former cinematography Tim Maurice-Jones cover the film in a bold white and grey mist,which along with creating a tense atmospheric sense of mystery also makes the moments when ""the ink"" spills across the screen stand out very strongly.<br/><br/>While he does show that he can create a fantastic mood,Watkins also shows that when it comes to spine tingling shocks he can truly deliver.Despite having seen the film around a week ago,almost all of the terrifying moments are still fresh in my mind, (and also still making it pretty hard for me to get some sleep!)thanks to Watkins building a huge amount of oncoming dread and tension up to the maximum point,where a vessel is open to give each shock maximum impact.<br/><br/>Whilst the elegant screenplay by Jane Goodman (who interestingly,has written an ending for the film which almost looks like a more cheerful take on the ending of Sam Rami's Drag Me To Hell) only gives a rough sketch to the main characters life,I found that this actually made me really connect to the film,due to the experience Kipps has of attempting to make sense out of all the chaos around him being something that I felt whilst getting gripped by this tremendous Horror film.<br/><br/>As the opening scene started in the film,my initially first (honest) reaction was that ""Harry Potter"" was back on the big screen.Luckally,as the films excellent plot really started to get going any memories of a certain ""boy wizard"" soon started to disappear,with Daniel Radcliffe giving a good performance as Arthur Kipps.Along with showing a fear of ""things that go bump in the night"",Radcliffe also impressively shows Kipps increased feeling of being an outsider in the town.<br/><br/>Although Radcliffe does get top billing,I strongly feel that one of the most under-rated parts of the film is the performance of Ciaran Hinds as Sam Daily,who along with showing a real natural friendliness towards Kipps also does brilliantly well at showing the pain of all the residents who have lost their children to the woman in black."
"birchyboy_01","9","3","6","17 February 2012"," Do you believe in Ghosts?
","When the trailer for this came out a few months ago I had my doubts. Daniel Radcliffe in a horror? It just didn't seem right, but I thought it would be interesting to see how he did outside of Harry Potter. <br/><br/>I thought he did brilliantly, he caught the character of Arthur Kipps very well. I would say he acted better in this than he had done through out Harry Potter (certainly the early stages anyway!) Even when he wasn't speaking his body language was perfect. <br/><br/>Not only did some of the actors impress me but I also enjoyed the fantastic camera work. It kept you on edge, waiting for that moment when something was going to appear and make you jump, then just when you thought may be nothing was going to happen something did happen and really caught me by surprise. <br/><br/>The romance in it was also very believable and the twist at the end was very touching and unlike some horrors, I thought it worked really well.<br/><br/>One thing I must say is that for a 12A this was very scary indeed, I would have put it at a 15 for sure."
"holburns","5","3","6","11 February 2012"," TOO much suspense can be disappointing...
","I give The Woman in Black a 5 out of 10. Watching the trailer and being impressed; I expected a lot from this movie! With an incredibly intriguing beginning, it most definitely gets the audience interested. It leaves a lot of unanswered questions which we are keen to find out in the rest of the movie. A little slow paced than some other movies of the same genre; it takes a while for anything incredibly gripping to take place. There is an incredible amount of suspense which takes place in this movie, maybe...a little TOO much. We see more suspense than action. Suspense is good but not when it turns into the audience actually 'wanting' something to happen. A lot of suspenseful scenes end with an abrupt cut; leaving a slight disappointment. Due to all the scenes not being clearly defined; if not explained to the audience at the end...I'm not sure 50% would get it if we walked into a cinema not having a vague clue about the storyline. The positive? The time period of this movie is definitely felt through the direction, scenery and use of language in the film. The crispness of the sound and the slight cold chill in the cinematography is good - helping us to understand the fear in the characters! As for Radcliffe, it is a little hard to shake off that 'Harry Potter' character he is known for. He does do a OK job, however, cast too young for such a strong character. Some actors can play all sorts of roles and some should maybe just stick to one kind."

I was slightly afraid I wouldn't be able to see Daniel Radcliff as anything other than Harry Potter, but I had no issue separating the two in this film. He did a wonderful job embodying the character! All in all I have to give this movie 10/10 stars because despite the cliché tricks, I was actually frightened because the movie drew me in and made me feel like I was in the creepy old house with Arthur, feeling the same terror he was feeling.

"Chris_Pandolfi","8","4","10","3 February 2012"," A Hotbed of Haunted Hammer Horror
","An early twentieth century setting. English marshland shrouded in fog. Rain, thunder, and lightning. A graveyard shrouded in ivy and dead twigs. A decaying mansion high atop a hill. Rooms blanketed in dust and cobwebs. Dark hallways faintly lit by candlelight. The sounds of whispers and crying bouncing off the walls. A shadowy figure stalking the premises. From the first frame to the last, ""The Woman in Black"" looks and feels exactly the way a horror movie should look and feel. I would expect nothing less from Hammer Film Productions, which gave us the British horror films of the 1950s and '60s, many starring Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee. Here is a film that oozes atmosphere from every pore and keeps us on the edge of our seats in suspense.<br/><br/>Adapted from the novel by Susan Hill, the plot never ties to be anything more or less than a Gothic Victorian ghost story, which in this case is not a drawback but a loving gesture on the part of the filmmakers. We're not assaulted with crude slasher tactics like relentless gore, masked serial killers, and naked teenagers; instead, we're made to savor the apprehension as it slowly gains momentum. Some of the pressure is relieved with an occasional pop out scare – throwaway gags to be sure, but effective nonetheless. Most of the time, however, it just keeps building, even when the story reaches its conclusion. When our hero slowly creeps his way down a dark passage with only a candle in his hand, we might think he's crazy for even being in the house, but mostly we cling to our armchairs in sheer anticipation of something scary happening.<br/><br/>The hero is Arthur Kipps (Daniel Radcliffe), a young lawyer from London. He has a four-year-old son named Joseph (Misha Handley), who can never draw a picture of his father without giving him a frowny face. Indeed, he has had good reason be miserable since the death of his wife, whose memory haunts him as surely as the title character eventually does. But I'm getting ahead of the story. He's sent to a faraway village to settle the legal affairs of a recently deceased woman. The villagers look on him dourly, as if he were a harbinger of doom. One man immediately scuttles his children inside their home as soon as he passes by. Upon meeting a landowner named Sam Daily (Ciarán Hinds), Arthur becomes aware that there has been a disturbing pattern of local children inexplicably killing themselves. It becomes more apparent when he meets Sam's wife (Janet McTeer), who appears to possess the ability to channel the spirit of her son.<br/><br/>Arthur settles himself in the dead woman's sprawling, dilapidated estate, which can only be accessed via a winding dirt road that disappears every evening with the tide. It isn't long before strange things begin to happen. Noises are heard off in the distance. A door, which was locked at first, suddenly opens and reveals a nightmarish nursery, complete with a rocking chair that rocks on its own, mechanical toys that suddenly spring into motion, and a collection of dirt-caked dolls with dead, glassy eyes that stare off into space. Initially intact family portraits are obscured when the eyes of each subject are scratched off. Strangest of all is the continuous appearance and disappearance of a woman in a black dress. Sometimes she's outside the estate, off in the distance by a makeshift cross sticking out of the mud. Unbeknownst to Arthur – for a time, at least – she will sometimes appear right behind him.<br/><br/>This woman, whom we know to be a ghost, has been woven into the fabric of local legend, her appearance signaling the impending death of another child. She does, of course, have her own tragic back story that's right in line with this genre. No need to spell it out for you. Chances are you already have a pretty good idea. Regardless, the secret of the Woman in Black endangers not only the remaining children of the village, but also Arthur's son, who's scheduled to join his father at the end of the week. Despite the fact that Sam doesn't believe in ghosts, he teams up with Arthur in a desperate attempt to stop the Woman in Black before it's too late.<br/><br/>Although Radcliffe is given his fair share of dialogue, much of his performance is spent treading cautiously down hallways, slinking into creepy rooms, and running after figures hidden in fog or shadow. It all depends on his ability to react. And yet he never tries for the exaggerated pantomime of a silent movie actor; he relies almost entirely on his eyes, which perpetually express grief, surprise, fear, or any combination of the three. Through his gaze, we understand how we're feeling at any given moment during the film, and it's quite possible we will continue to feel that way even when the movie is over. ""The Woman in Black"" is not about cheap thrills, which are anonymous and fleeting. It's about stirring within us the very fears we cling to as children. The fact that you're older now doesn't make the dark any less scary.<br/><br/>-- Chris Pandolfi (www.atatheaternearyou.net)"
"ZombiGurl","8","4","10","3 February 2012"," Classic Gothic Ghost Story
","Hammer Films returns to classic Gothic Horror with a ghostly tale of revenge and regret. The film is based on a book by Susan Hill written in 1983 about a ghost that only appears just before a child dies. Hammer Films is best known for their beloved Gothic Horror classics from the 1960s and 70s with such titles as The Horror of Dracula and The Evil of Frankenstein. Hammer Studios churned out numerous classics before having to close up shop in the 1980's. The film studio returned last year with Let Me In, the remake of Swedish film Let the Right One In. The Woman in Black has that Gothic Hammer feel that fans of the classics will love. It delivers lots of thrills and scares with loads of atmosphere. This movie is in no way a remake of the 1988 TV movie version of the same story. The film is dark and scary and reminded me most of one of my favorite Ghost storiesThe Changeling. Daniel Radcliffe is fresh from filming the hugely successful series, Harry Potter. He plays a much more serious role in this film as Athur Kipp, a young widowed Father and Lawyer. His employer sends him to a small English village to complete the task of sorting through an estate left by a woman who lived in an old haunted mansion on a remote island. The townspeople do not welcome him except for one eccentric couple. No one is willing to take him out to the abandoned house for fear of the evil on the Island, but he does eventually find a ride out to the house. As soon as he arrives at the Mansion, the Ghost appears and starts to cause serious problems for the small village. The only way to solve these problems is to unravel the mystery of why the Ghost appears and how to make her at peace. The Woman in Black is essentially a classic Ghost story in a haunted Gothic Mansion. The set design of the house is very realistic and detailed giving the film loads of atmosphere and character. The story is gripping and tragic with one of the scariest ghosts ever put on screen. This movie would be the perfect choice to introduce a non-horror friend to the Genre. It is beautifully shot and has the goods to deliver the scares. Seeing that Gothic movies, ghost stories in particular, are one of my favorite types of Horror movies, I thoroughly enjoyed this film and am looking forward to what Hammer will be releasing next."
"rojidodge","8","3","7","27 September 2012"," Best remake I've ever seen
","The original movie made in 1989 was not really that scary, a bit creepy, but not very scary. This new version really takes on the scare factor. It does get the hairs on the back of your neck standing up. Daniel Radcliffe is perfectly cast in this chilling ghost story. I suppose what may come naturally to the viewer is that we are used to seeing him stare danger in the face as Harry Potter as he does in this film, except he's playing a much more mature role now. (Interesting trivia fact - The main role in the original version is played by Adrian Rawlins who plays Harry Potter's dad). <br/><br/>The main problem with the original other than it was not really that scary, is that it did not make much sense. What the story was behind ""the woman in black"" was too subtle. This newer version is much more clear and true to the movie's title. It's essentially the same story with a few changes, but it makes for a much better and scarier story.<br/><br/>If you've seen the original and that's kind of put you off seeing this one, then ignore that and see this. I'm not a big fan of remakes, but this one took a relatively dull movie and made it something great. Also, it has a completely different ending, which the movie is much more deserving of."
"confidencecharm","8","3","7","4 March 2012"," Aspects I didn't like, but a decent horror flick.
","Okay, so just got back from seeing the Woman in Black. It's nothing spectacular, nothing terrible, but above average. So, it starts off with Daniel Radcliffe the widowed lawyer leaving his son with his nanny, who will both rejoin him in two days, to do work in a sleepy English town. This town is inhabited by a ghost, and whenever this ghost is spotted by anybody, a child dies. Radcliffe the widowed lawyer spends the night where the ghost's sister used to live, and discovered that the ghost's sister took care of the ghost's child, as she was seen as unfit to raise it. The child died, and the ghost killed herself. The ghost now controls the minds of children whenever she is seen and makes them commit suicide. We spend about 20 minutes in the haunted house with some pretty cool scares and back story, before moving onto the third act. This... is where it goes downhill. Radcliffe wants to reunite the ghost with her son, as the life of his own son hangs in the balance. He does this, and assumes that she is gone for good. His son and nanny arrive, but the son sees the ghost and jumps in front of a train. Radcliffe attempts to save him and they are both reunited with Radcliffe's wife. <br/><br/>The positives: It's a decent Halloween flick if you need one, and the premise is pretty damn interesting. The jump scares are pretty good, and it builds up legitimate suspense. The acting is pretty good too, except... we'll get to that. I also really enjoy the time spent in the house, as we find out about the ghost and of course, the scares are really good. <br/><br/>The negatives: Daniel Radcliffe and the ending. Am I the only one that thinks Radcliffe was stunningly miscast for this? He looks at least ten years too young for the part of a widowed lawyer, and frankly does not act 'scared' very well. There is a scene where Radcliffe tries to wrench a door open, and goes downstairs for an ax. When he comes back up, the door is opened. He acts as if this is completely normal! EMOTE, DAMMIT! And the ending: it is built up that the ghost will be set free once reunited with her son, and it is implied that Radcliffe will communicate with her. But instead, we get the cheap ""he's reunited with the wife we never actually knew that well and don't care about"" cop out. And also, Radcliffe lets go of his son's hand by a railway track in a town where there is a psycho ghost that wants to kill his child, and he has proof of this. Bad parenting or bad parenting?<br/><br/>However, the first two acts are a lot of fun, a fantastic thriller. However, some elements could certainly have been missed out, but for what it is, it's decent. I recommend seeing it on the big screen while it's there, so go and enjoy Radcliffe's latest non-Harry Potter project, guys. :)"

Daniel Radcliffe proves that he's more than just a glasses-wearing, wand-yielding Harry Potter, he's an amazing actor ; not just with words but with facial expressions and body language.

But I should have stopped watching it from the opening scene. I should not try out of curiosity to watch the whole thing. I do not know what happened in this case. I have watched quite a lot scary movies including movies like the Exorcist, Saw, Scream, the Ring, the Grudge, the Eye, etc etc. OK someone might tell that those are not so scary compared to others. BUT the woman in black shocked me. My boyfriend came to see me after I had just watched the movie (plus I watched it with low sound and my hand almost covering my eyes 'cos i could not watch it otherwise) and he found me shaking out of fear. I told him I had watched a really scary movie, he insisted on us re watching it together in order for me to overcome that irrational fear but i could not. The next day he watched it alone out of curiosity and he said he was not scared at all. I do not know what to say. I say so many movies with exorcisms, ghosts, vampires, serial killers etc but this one marked the end of me watching any kind of creepy staff again.

None of the villagers seem welcoming and it is clear they just want him to turn round and return to London. Not put off he goes out to Eel Marsh House to sort out the woman's papers but while there he sees a mysterious woman dressed in black. He goes to report this to the police and while he is doing so three children enter the police station; one of them has ingested poison.<br/><br/>It appears that a lot of children have come to grief there; the widow's son died in the marsh and the son of Sam Daily; the only person locally who welcomed Kipps unlike the villages he doesn't believe the story that a child will die after each time somebody sees the mysterious woman in black. When another child dies Kipps starts to believe and worries as his son is due to join him in the village and it is too late to cancel the trip. If he is to have any chance of saving his son he must return to Eel Marsh House again and try to bring peace to the woman in black.<br/><br/>Given this film's twelve certificate I was surprised at just how chilling it was it certainly gave me goose bumps! There are some jump scares but mostly the film relies on an almost constantly creepy atmosphere to keep the viewer on edge. Lead actor, Daniel Radcliffe, demonstrates that he is more than just 'Harry Potter' as he does a fine job as Kipps; a character who is rarely off screen. He is ably supported by the likes of Ciarán Hinds, Ciarán Hinds and Roger Allam although the last of these only appears briefly. There is very little gore although the one scene were a young girl coughs up blood and dies is somewhat disturbing to say the least! There are quite a few other scenes that could disturb viewers and given its theme of a vengeful spirit who kills children it is probably not a good film to show to younger viewers. Overall whether you think a film like this is any good depends on whether or not it manages to scare you it certainly scared me more than many horror films that I've seen."

","I would put this in the thriller category. I put off watching this for a while because Daniel Radcliffe was the main actor. I would like to point out this was a mistake as he is excellent in this film and not once did i think of a wizard. So the film centres around a young lawyer(Radcliffe)from London who is sent to a small village to deal with a dead widows estate. The film is set in the late 1800's -early 1900's. The widows house is on a creepy house secluded from the village and reachable only at certain times because the road crosses the sea. When in the house he sees and hears strange noises on numerous occasions. Without giving too much away he goes through the film uncovering a mystery. There are good scare moments in the film but it isn't going to give you nightmares however, the story is a good one and fairly gripping. As mentioned the acting is good as is the sound effects. overall i enjoyed this film and would recommend it."

","I must agree that I am not a big fan of horror flicks but this one compelled me to write a review. To begin with, the atmosphere of the movie right from the first frame holds up till the last, it being sombre with undertones of a dark humor. The plot is simple and conclusive without any added spices for the sake of glamor,the movie operates on creating an ambiance rather than utilizing grotesque sequences. The acting is fairly good, Daniel did a fine job playing a rational figure with a melancholic look on his face, his persona is quite credible, all the supporting parts are also well executed. The story unfolds in a somewhat methodical way enabling the viewers to grasp it rather than entrapping them in an intricate maze of subplots which most horror flicks immaculately succeed in doing. Not adorned with special effects which so often are relied upon to create the horror element. Overall, the movie is quite captivating and keeps one thinking about it for some time (somewhat of a personal moviemeter for me, good movies stay with me and become a part of the thought process). If i have to define it in three words, they would be; classy, intriguing, and mellow( something quite rare for a horror flick)"

","I had high hopes, and low expectations. I liked the story idea, a hint of a more classic ghost story, but just knew in my heart that modern film making can no longer pull that off. I was pleasantly surprised. There were a lot of wide angle shots where you can just barely catch a ghostly figure looming in the background. You sit for a minute and think ""is that a person, or a shadow?"" I love ghost stories, especially those creepy kid ones like The Changeling and Haunting of Julia. This one meets that mark, though not exactly in the same league, but the closest of any modern movie in a while. I like the fact that the overall concept of the film and the camera work is scary enough to stand on it's own with very little use of the startle effect that is so predominate in what is considered horror today. Although there are a few scenes where the loud noise and abrupt insert is used, it was properly placed within the story, not just to get the audience moving. There were a couple downfalls that I noted. Mainly the fact that the woman in black was c.g. which is disappointing. Also, Daniel Radcliffe is not a bad actor,yet he is not a great one either. I just couldn't buy it. It may be because he just looks too young for the part, or the fact it follows too close to Harry Potter to see him any differently. I would have preferred a more aged and mature actor. I did like it a lot and enjoyed the residual creepy feeling afterward."

","Stating how awkward it is to see Radcliffe doing something other than Harry Potter is something I'm not doing since I can imagine how many people already did that, so I will stick to the film itself. ""The Woman in Black"" is a poor movie that uses the concepts of various recent horror flicks. The haunted house is from ""The Haunting""; the strange 'person' behind the scenes is from ""The Strangers"" and the small village investigation with only one cop thing are from ""The Wicked Man"". By that you can clearly see this film has NO originality at all. I can't say anything about the photography direction since the place I've seen this film doesn't have great quality. Directing does it's job in trying to scare, but it is not easy to scare the spectator when he has nothing to be afraid of. In fact, the woman in black is an irrelevant character that could not exist and the film wouldn't be any better or worse. All in all, in my humble opinion, this is a big failure that won't be remembered in a matter of months."

","I saw ""The Woman In Black"" on the London stage in 2009. Then, it was a two-man show, although the two men didn't play nearly as many parts as appear in this picture. The sets were very spare and I thought the whole production was a tribute to the ingenuity of the stage director.<br/><br/>The movie, however, is like ""The Woman In Black"" on steroids, with many added characters and a great deal more plot than it needed. Instead of creating the terrifying moments in your imagination, this movie is loaded with visual ones in almost every scene. Some are manufactured - movies today like to 'sneak up' on audiences with a sudden apparition accompanied by a sudden blast of loud music, which I feel is cheating. It gets tiresome after a while and I couldn't help thinking they had it right in the play; leave some of the horror in the audience's mind.<br/><br/>The mood of the play was of an engrossing ghost story, related by one of the principals who lived it. This movie is a relentless downer - doom and pathos throughout and with no comic relief anywhere in sight. No one smiles or strikes a cheerful note and there is no uplifting message to be found. This makes it hard to find a rooting interest in any of the characters.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, if you like scary movies, this one is for you, because it is one of the scariest I can remember.

","This movie turned out to be a bit of a disappointment. It was being far too formulaic with its approach and story and it was lacking any true great creativity or originality. It besides is even a lackluster one, with only just a couple of false scares in jump scares in it, that really shouldn't surprise any of the horror fans out there.<br/><br/>I really don't like it when a horror movie gets stretched out, by not telling you anything, for the longest time. The viewers are being left in dark for too long by its mystery. You have no idea what is going on or at what direction the movie is going with its story. In my opinion this all is just a lame excuse and a cheap way for the movie to be filled with as many jumps scares as possible, before finally revealing its twist and reveal what its mystery was all supposed to be about.<br/><br/>And when the movie finally reached that point, I had already lost interest in it. I just wasn't taken at all by its story, or any of its characters. Perhaps if the movie had some more excitement and originality in it, it could had still interested me and that way I could had also enjoyed this movie more for what it was; a typical atmospheric ghost-story.<br/><br/>The movie now instead came across to me as all buildup but without a decent enough payoff to any of its buildup. It really all makes ""The Woman in Black"" a disappointing watch.<br/><br/>It's also sadly miscast. I'm not saying that Daniel Radcliffe is a bad actor but he was obviously not the right choice for his role in this movie. He's far too young to play a convincing enough widower, with a young son. It just doesn't feel and look right, seeing him interacting with other adults, that treat him as equals, while they are obviously all, at the very least, twice his age. It worked far too distracting for me and often took me out of the movie, especially when he's doing scenes together with Ciarán Hinds.<br/><br/>Now, the only thing that does make this movie somewhat watchable is its good and dark atmosphere. It's a good horror atmosphere really and it also still handles some of its horror well.

","I went into this film not knowing anything about it, and found it to be a very captivating; a beautifully woven gothic tale of horror and sorrow, reminding of such written pieces and film adaptions, such as Bram Stokers 'Dracula', and Washington Irving's 'The Legend of Sleepy Hollow'. The acting was done convincingly in The Woman in Black; I thought that Daniel Radcliffe, Ciarán Hinds, did a wonderful job with their characters. Janet McTeer, is worthy of a mention too, and Liz White. The musical score of this film was done so well and beautifully. The composer name is Marco Beltrami, and he does well to create an unsettling atmosphere, and create further tension. The setting of this film have been chosen well for this period piece, - very beautiful parts of England, very good use of cinematography have made it feel all the more haunting. As for the story, each individual will respond differently to it, but I personally thought it was strong enough in plot, and tied up (as well as acted) tastefully, beautifully, that I do think post script direction, this is still a very good film. One last thing I'll share; I actually found this film to scare me at some parts. Granted I did watch it alone in the dark, and I love an old fashioned ghost tale."

","The Woman in Black is a great relief at times where blood and gore depends on whether a film is scary or not. Daniel Radcliffe delivers us a mighty fine performance. The best thing I felt about this film was, the atmosphere which remained dark throughout the 90 minute runtime. The first thirty minutes or so depend a lot on jumpscares that are somewhat effective but bland. In fact, the terrifying moments in this flick, are rare. It focuses on the content, and everything that makes a film perfect. However, the entire subject of children walking to their own deaths is rather unsettling. The film scares a person based on how they define 'scary'. If you are the person expecting a lot of gore and messed up faces and things like that, turn away, this film ain't for you. Watch this one for stellar performances, a great story, and fine scares that are actually the epitome of 'actual horror'

"benjamineliasheitmann","6","0","0","29 January 2020"," The Horrors of the Uncertain
","When it comes to horror movies nowadays, many fall into a deadly trap that has consumed and utterly destroyed the horror movie territory. In earlier years, horror was viewed as a distinctly frightening genre with the movies using slow-building tension and creepy athmosphere to make you scared of what's to come. Horror movie filmmakers have entered the Jumpscare territory in which this ""true"" horror is removed in favor of sudden noisen and views that negates all tension. Thankfully, despite its few shortcomings, the Woman In Black directed by James Watkins based on Susan Hill's 1983 novel of the same name manages to be a solid ghost story told with a bolt of efficiency.
Perhaps the single greatest element this movie offers is the lead performance from Daniel Radcliffe, an actor who was made forever famous in the Harry Potter movies. He needed to find a way to take off those glasses and move on and thankfully he delivers a bang-up performance that really made this movie a joy to watch. He is also accompanied with a pitch-perfect supporting performance by Ciaran Hinds who plays local landowner Sam Daily.
One thing i will also give this film is its disturbingly creepy setting that is litterally one of the creepiest horror movie settings we've ever seen. A house isolated on an island that is partially flooded and removed from land, surrounded by a graveyard and a killer bog. The house itself is a living example of a horror movie house, its large and nearly in ruin and has a dark history behind it.
When it comes to the scares themselves, this film is not short on fitting scares. Although there are a few cheap jumpscares here and there, this movie excellently builds up horror and suspense to make for a very unsettling and uncomfortable experience that really irches to the bone. The film genuinely feels like a horror movie.
The titular character herself is of course a solid antagonist, she is distinctly creepy, doesn't make many unnecessary appearances and has a great backstory to her that while meaningless gives some weight to her existence.
The music for this film is also creepy as all hell but freakin amazing, as it fits the tone of this film brilliantly.
When it comes to issues, this film isn't flawless. My biggest flaw is perhaps the final act of the film which seems completely pointless when you figure out the outcome of it. The story feels a bit uncertain on how to wrap up this film and inadvertently sets up a sequel in the end, which was released a couple of years later.
It does follow many horror movie cliches and isn't exactly the most orginal film in the world either.
But as a horror film, it delivers what it should deliver and is overall a solid experience.

","I'd been told this was a generic horror movie and I believed them. I read the book first and thought it was trash so I was curious about how they'd go about doing this.<br/><br/>Now, despite indeed being somewhat generic, I thought it wasn't half bad in its first act. Yeah, it's old school horror; fog, old mansions, Edwardian clothing but I really dug that. It is a beautifully shot movie in a formidable, bleak yet oddly stirring landscape that doesn't get dull. I might have nitpicked some cinematographic choices but they weren't a big deal. The old, remote town with a secret that may or may not just be their old superstitions may be a cliche but it did build a sense of dread.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, it gets REALLY generic mid way through. Bland, cheap scares and a Halloween costume of an antagonist (despite the build up and lore surrounding her, she herself has very little stage presence when she actually appears). This coupled with a really uninspired score that dampens a lot of potentially good moments by telegraphing to you when things are going down makes this movie ultimately a failure.<br/><br/>It's still better than the book though. There's more of an actual plot rather than just chapter after chapter of one guy drawling over how scared he is. Arthur is so much more likeable and I can't imagine anyone other than Daniel Radcliff playing him with a stolid vulnerability that really helps shake away the spirit a certain boy who must not be named.<br/><br/>I wouldn't bother unless you're curious how they handled the adaptation. I hear the play is a lot better. Ending was kind of a cop out too."
"Pjtaylor-96-138044","5","0","0","12 February 2019"," What was all the fuss about?
","'The Woman In Black (2012)' is relatively faithful to its source story. The changes it makes are usually only to shorten its timespan or to make things more overt, especially when it comes to its scares. Something was certainly lost in translation, however. The constant first-person perspective of the book isn't portrayed anywhere near as strongly on film, and the simultaneously in-the-moment but ultimately reflexive narration isn't carried across at all, which is somewhat natural but still unfortunate. These elements may be missing due to the change in medium, and are actually common casualties of adaptation, but they could have been smoothed over with some slight tweaks to the story and its presentation. I'm not suggesting that narration would have been a good idea, but the flick needs to communicate the inner thoughts of its protagonist more clearly (via whatever means feel natural) in order for it to be truly engaging. The book is written in the style of nineteenth-century 'gothic horror' and, as such, has subtle psychological horror as opposed to overt scares. It relies on the fact that we're always in the head of the 'hero', as most of the scary stuff is only scary because of the way it affects him. It's the kind of story where an ill feeling, a bump in the night and a barking dog provide all the horror necessary, leaving us with a PTSD-ridden protagonist barely able to recount his tale. In this movie, none of that really comes across. While it isn't necessarily silly, most of the spooky stuff is far too 'on-the-nose' and, frankly, clichéd to really work. It leans on 'jump scares' and the same 'face-in-the-background' gag to get its audience going, but it's never really frightening, to be frank. There are some creepy plot elements, though; a specific choice, which changes the way its antagonist interacts with her 'prey' (so to speak), is quite disturbing or, at least, challenging, if slightly superfluous and 'edgy' for the sake of it. When it gets going, it's not bad. It's just that most of the piece is actually quite boring. Radcliffe creeps around looking decently freaked-out, settles down and does a bit of paper-work, comes across a bit of exposition, gets haunted by a ghost and then gets shunned by the townsfolk. This repeats a few times until a third-act that feels off-brand and unearned. The ending is also strange, mainly because of a market-tested addition that aims to make it 'happy'. Overall, the picture lacks the interesting themes of the story that it's based on, even though the plot is more or less intact. Of course, an adaptation can change things (such as the ending), for better or worse, but the end result should still hold up. Here, the deliberate changes actually do less damage than the accidental ones. Regardless of the reason, this ends up as a dull and uninspired horror that isn't scary and isn't actually all that interesting, either. It just feels like a poor man's 'The Conjuring (2013)'. 5/10"

","I don't often watch horror movies, but this was an exception. I don't dislike the genre, I just prefer others. However I had heard good things about this movie and was able to watch it for free so I sat down with some friends and gave it a try. For the first act, I enjoyed it quite a lot. The lead character, played by Daniel Radcliffe, is by far the strongest part of the movie and as the entire first act was focusing on his characterisation I enjoyed it a lot. Daniel Radcliffe was perfectly cast in a refreshingly different role for him; he was realistic enough to believe and a well written character for the purpose of the story. My only gripe is that there were a couple of false notes in Daniel Radcliffe's acting which stood out once or twice, but nothing big. The rest of the cast is agreeable as well; the only other main cast member, Ciarán Hinds' Sam Daily was believable and did his job well, even if his character lacked an interesting enough arc. <br/><br/>A major issue with this movie is that it is traditional and clichéd to a fault. The characters are very traditional to such a horror movie (there is of course the frightened locals and the sceptical rich guy who won't believe a word of ghost stories), and there are also the traits and clichés that you might find in any 90's horror movie. The third act is especially weak. It becomes unbearably traditional, in that it lacks originality. However the worst part of the movie by far is the extremely poor ending that not only undermines the rest of the movie but makes everything up to that point look weak. It's over the top, very predictable and perhaps even silly. Still, at least the movie doesn't bore.<br/><br/>There are a few other ups and downs about this movie. There are some genuinely effective jump scares, and some good set pieces that work well to create the mood. The writing and directing is good enough, but nothing special. The soundtrack is good and sticks out in multiple scenes, and thus lifting the movie somewhat. Finally there is some poor editing (in particular in the sound department) that needs to be fixed, but nothing too big. In the end you will probably enjoy the majority of this movie, which is helpfully lifted by Daniel Radcliffe, but even he can't save some of the movie's flaws, in particular the very weak ending."

","This passed a very cold, wet winter's afternoon. I read the book that this film is based on many, many years ago and it scared the bejesus out of me. Susan Hill is an exceptional writer and imho movies are the better for having a decent author/writer behind them. So, what a shame that they took the very heart out of this terrifying tale in order, I can only assume, to pander to a modern trigger- warning-requiring audience. The end of the book is the best part, the most terrifying denouement of the tale: just when you think it's all over, it most definitely isn't. That's entirely lost in the movie as we're left with a bit of a daft, feel-good banality. But that aside, this is a very well done film. The settings are amazing. There are jump-scares enough even for hardened movie veterans. In fact, I think this film (like the book) works very well on the subconscious level of fear, because when you think back about the movie there's actually very little scary in it. It's mostly in the imagination. So, well worth a look. Gorgeous English landscape and interiors and a somewhat decent attempt to do the book justice. Pity about the ending, but a lot of people might enjoy it better than the haunting, depressing, genuinely frightening ending of the book."

And that's it...I can't come out with any other pros. Solely being scary is not a qualification for being a good scary movie, there needs to be some suspense, and this movie has no suspense at all. Probably I saw too many good scary movies? The story is pretty bad, and the main character is full of flaws. It might seems ridiculous to someone, but I find it to be a major problem that in most movies, actors (and actress) play a much younger role than themselves, and for some older-looking ones like Nicolas Cage, playing a older character is more often. But Daniel is not that type of older-looking guy, and I think he is even a little bit younger-looking. He was about 22 years old back then, and he looks like 22, or even a little bit younger than 22, and he plays a lawyer with a wife and a son who can walk and speak to his father. It seems like at least 30 years old...I actually like Daniel Radcliffe's performance in some other movies, but for this one, he is not only too young for the role, but also has a very average performance."

","Ghost Stories have always been my absolute favourite sub-genre of Horror. On that account, I've watched dozens of them, any film I could get my hands on. Judging from my personal experience and subjective preferences - The Woman in Black had never had a chance of being anything more than ordinary, perhaps reaching to good.<br/><br/>When it comes to portraying ghosts and apparitions, the Asians, who are the true masters of the field, have set the bar real high with their famous ghost stories such as The Grudge. In this field, I must say The Woman in Black has done an excellent job! The ghost is as horrifying as could be, the apparitions of the children are eerie and terrifying, and the jump-scares (while a cheap cinematic trick) are done just right.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, this concludes all possible praises I could give the film, with the exception of Ciaran Hinds playing the role of Sam Daily in a more than satisfactory manner. Harry Potter (aka Daniel Radcliffe) can only be compared to Johnny Depp's character in Sleepy Hollow, and unsurprisingly this comparison doesn't flatter him. He lacks the charisma and screen presence of other actors of the genre, and his acting simply ""doesn't cut it"". The plot and script are mediocre at best, nothing innovative or original, no noticeable creativity, nothing out of the ordinary we haven't seen before in many other films. I don't know if this criticism is to be given to screenwriter Jane Goldman and director James Watkins (this is by far not the best work of either) or to novelist Susan Hill, but the story isn't profound in any way.<br/><br/>All in all, I can't say I didn't enjoy this film.

He is to go over the affairs of an eccentric, recently deceased lady who lived in an isolated locale known as Eel Marsh.

Marco Beltrami supplies a good music score, and Watkins & crew do well at creating some real tension.<br/><br/>However, there are aspects to this that may simply not work for all members of the audience. The whole scenario seems awfully familiar by this point, at least for those who have seen lots of horror from all time periods. Also, much like the 1981 slasher ""The Prowler"" and the 2009 throwback feature ""The House of the Devil"", the running time is filled with perhaps a few too many sequences of a character exploring an old dark house. The use of visual effects isn't overwhelming, but Watkins goes the easy route a little too often with the use of jump scares. At least we never get too good a look at our restless, antagonistic spirit.<br/><br/>Radcliffe is adequate in the lead, but is overshadowed by the wonderful Hinds and the equally strong Janet McTeer as Daily's wife. It's really Hinds that makes this worth a look.<br/><br/>At the very least, the ending is one that some viewers may not see coming. This is competently made, and sufficiently creepy if never all-out frightening.<br/><br/>Six out of 10."

"Jellybeansucker","4","0","0","20 July 2014"," Well made but dull
","A poor choice by Hammer's execs to choose a sleepy Victorian ghost story with which to return to the big screen. Radcliffe and co. fine, special effects and costume dept. all very good as usual. It's competent but not that compelling. Not a bad finale but I'd lost interest way before it came. To put most of the excitement factor in the final third after a dreary two thirds is a big mistake, in my book. The story itself seems only suited to book form too.<br/><br/>The script is frankly dull, the story even duller. Ghost stories have their place in horror but not in Hammer Horror, imo. There was much growing psychological menace but this was never Hammer's thing. It's closer to Hitchcock than Hammer but I couldn't imagine AH making such a dull film. A waste of a big movie budget, I can't imagine what such a flat copy of a film already made would bring to anyone. I do not know how this choice of movie project got anywhere near a commission."

","Overall I had a hard time fully enjoying The Woman in Black. Its atmosphere is fantastic, its set design and cinematography are lovely, the acting is solid, but the experience is brought down by few major flaws. Among them being a fairly well-tread story and some disappointing shots.<br/><br/>To start, what The Woman in Black does extremely well is immersing you completely in its deliciously drab universe. The old mansion where Daniel Radcliffe's Arthur Kipps spends the majority of the film is dressed expertly with creepy antiques and a large helping of cobwebs and dust. The way the house is filmed as well serves to bring it to life in a big way.<br/><br/>However, the life is taken right out of it when every single suspenseful shot and every spooky sequence is ended with an entirely predictable jump scare. When you know exactly what (and when) something is coming for you, there's not much left to really scare you. Moments of very clunky and expository dialogue can take you out of the experience as well.<br/><br/>So I guess if you're in the mood for a beautifully filmed ghost movie, give The Woman in Black a try. Just don't go in expecting anything ground breaking or particularly scary."

","I was lucky enough to get my hands on a ticket to the preview of this film. It was shown at an exclusive event, in a magniloquent fashion. The hype aside, the film was merely another duplicate of a stereotypical horror movie. Apart from the amenity of the milieu and the superfluous display attesting the competence of its cast, The woman in black is a replica of an average ghost themed movie at best. <br/><br/>Jump scares, strange noises, tall shadows and an air of imminent terror - predictable and boasting at the same time. Daniel Radcliffe as the protagonist is perhaps the greatest blunder about this film. He only works as an alibi, an attempt to assure the audience that this movie is interesting material and has something worth watching in it, aka has Good ol' Harry Potter in it. <br/><br/>In all fairness, it's pretty OK anyway. It's not living up to the standards I have for the horror movies that I enjoy but it works as entertainment and visual stimuli. If you like to be crippled by fear and disgust when watching horror (I do!), this won't do it for you. But if you like Poe, Burton and Gothic misery/visual poetry I think you might like this one. <br/><br/>I rated it 4 solely because of the awesome and beautiful landscapes, decorations, costumes, environments and details.

"krachtm","5","0","0","8 March 2013"," Generic, clichéd, and gimmicky.
","The plot: A young man is drawn into the mystery of a haunted house and a hateful, vengeful ghost.<br/><br/>The Woman in Black is a rather generic, clichéd, and gimmicky movie. Although the tension and atmosphere slowly ramp up to admirable levels, it's all for naught, as it ALWAYS results in some cheap and gimmicky jump scare. I can totally understand how this would work to startle you early in the movie, but, after an hour of constant jump scares, it just gets tedious. When the movie didn't depend on these jump scares, the scenes were generally effective at establishing a creepy mood, even though it resorted such overused, clichéd elements as old toys, rocking chairs rocking themselves, and silent, ghostly children.<br/><br/>The plot was incredibly simplistic, and it was explained several times throughout the movie, in case you weren't paying attention the previous times. Everything is spoon-fed to the audience, with absolutely no attempt at subtlety. I wasn't really expecting anything else, though, as movies based on Gothic Romanticism are traditionally weighed down by tradition demanding that they include every single cliché imaginable.<br/><br/>The acting was a bit of a mixed bag. Daniel Radcliffe was incredibly wooden, and he seemed to have only one facial expression (dull surprise) for the entire movie. Seeing as how he was playing a very depressed, repressed, and distressed individual, this may or may not be excusable, depending on whether you're a fan or not. The other actors were more animated and alive, though they didn't really have a whole lot to work with. Most frustrating, perhaps, was the token rationalist. Although he serves as friend, mentor, and sidekick, depending on the needs of the scene, his main purpose is to be proved wrong and admit that he was always in denial about his belief. This is incredibly lazy writing.<br/><br/>I had high hopes for James Watkins, after seeing Eden Lake, but this is a movie for young Harry Potter fans, who will squeal with fright and then laugh nervously, after every cheap jump scare. If you're older than Daniel Radcliffe, I would suggest that you avoid this movie. I always thought that Jane Goldman was a hack and Daniel Radcliffe was wooden, and this movie does nothing but confirm my previous beliefs."

","This ghost story was pretty good. Lawyer, Arthur Kipps is sent to an English village to dig up dirt on a house that is up for sale. It is apparent that the locals don't want him there and don't want him going to the Eel Marsh house. He goes to the house anyways and spots a woman in black plus hears odd noises. He goes back to the village and witnesses a child die by drinking some lye. He's given a place to stay by Daily, the rich man in town, whom has also lost a child. He tells Arthur about the legend of the woman and that a child dies soon after she is seen, but Daily is not a believer. So the last part is about Arthur trying to solve the mystery. He finds out why the ghost has come back for revenge and tries to appease her. Frankly, I didn't see how he could stay in that house with all the noises and visions going on. That would be too creepy. And why don't the villagers with kids just move.<br/><br/>Any ways, we get a surprise, satisfying ending.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: Pretty good, worth a viewing."
"jpajs14","4","0","0","7 December 2012"," Read this Review! (I give it a 4.75 / 10 rating)
","First off, I want to start my review of this movie from a positive perspective. This movie contains many classic elements that you would normally see (only) in older, horror/scary flicks. This movie has many startling scenes in it that will make the faint of heart jump or scream, but each of the startling scenes in themselves are really not that disturbing or realistic. Now I'm going to review the entire movie. The acting in the movie is not bad, but the type of characters and events in the movie leave no opportunity for outstanding acting, either. The story is this: A young, widowed lawyer has a job to sort out and deal with the papers and will of a dead woman. He takes a train (the story takes place somewhere in the 1920's / 1930's) to the village where she both lived and died. Many events happen there, and one where Arthur Kipps (Daniel Radcliffe) is blamed for. The townspeople want him gone, but he stays to finish his work so that he may keep his job and support his young son. He soon discovers the house of the woman who died is haunted, but continues to brave through-it and discover the mystery of exactly what happened and why the house is haunted by the ""Woman in Black"".<br/><br/>The story of this movie is not very long. It seems as though just to make the movie longer, it drags on for a long time in dull, unnecessary parts of the movie. This can be slightly annoying. Early in the movie, Arthur explores the house of the dead woman. This appears to be a simple showcase of the kind of horror the movie contains early on, and all of the 'scares', are set up very obviously. This is a typical element in the movie that instantly strikes the movie as a semi-predictable one. The plot itself is kind of cheesy and un-original. When Arthur starts to get more involved with the spirits of the dead children and the ""Woman in Black"", he realizes he must find the body of the dead child and lay it to rest properly, so he can satisfy the ""Woman in Black"" and lay her soul to rest. The Woman in Black is very hateful and vengeful of her dead child, so she possesses other children and leads them to death. Arthur successfully lays her soul/spirit to rest, but not completely. The ending of the movie was very predictable as well, and it made the movie worse than it had to be. In summary, this movie can be fun to watch if you're scared easily, (And you enjoy being scared, of course) but the story and movie itself is just too un-original and dull to stand out from many other movies of the same genre.

","I don't think there is any medium now that this remarkable work by Susan Hill has not covered. The first version I saw was the very good 1989 TV film starring Adrian Rawlins. Since then, I have seen the excellent, genuinely scary stage play in London and read the book.<br/><br/>Now we have a film version, with Daniel Radcliffe venturing outside the world of Harry Potter to play Arthur Kipps, a young, widowed lawyer sent to the wilds of rural England by his employer to break up the estate of Mrs Drablow, a recently deceased client.<br/><br/>She, of course, lived in a spooky old house out on an isolated island. And it is here that two quite long, eerily effective passages take place as our hero sees the titular character and experiences various other weird phenomena while alone in the house.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, all is not well on the mainland either, with children dying right and left and Kipps given a distinctly chilly reception.<br/><br/>The problem with material like this is that, in our materialistic, rational, cynical age, to many it will seem rather silly. When I first saw it, I really wasn't sure what to make of it, in part because the very last scene succumbs to the film industry's eternal weakness – maudlin sentimentality. <br/><br/>The acting, however, is mostly good. Daniel Radcliffe isn't bad at all, though his performance is so restrained that at times I wanted to shout at him to wake up. <br/><br/>Atmosphere is well created and handled, supported by agreeably creepy music that is never overdone. The locations work too and the camera work is great.<br/><br/>But, despite all this, the overall effect is oddly pallid.

","""The Woman in Black"" is a movie that built its horror based on dark and Gothic atmosphere.it can be found on its haunted mansion near the classic English village. the beginning of the movie is filled with dark nuance surrounding the house that the main character Arthur Gibbs played brilliantly by Daniel Radclife tried to sell the house as his latest job as an advocate. while he is still haunted by the unexpected death of his wife because of the miscarriage.in this case Arthur was desperate to move on with his life by getting the job done. Little did he know that his latest job of selling old house will be influenced by an eerie local superstitious and conservative villager that were still believed in evil spirit. Despite the warning from the local villager, Arthur eagerly wanted to inspect the house that he tried to sell and also because his firm demand. Most of the people in the village were hostile toward him because of his visitation to the house except for the wealthy couple who accepted him in their house. It was later found that they also have just lost their son in an awful accident. Later in the movie the husband help Arthur doing his job in inspecting the house. the premise of the story is scary and horrific, in which the superstitious surrounding the house. most of the filming was shot in location instead of the studio, the director intend to bring the horror more realistic aspect which is works for the most part. What director James Watkins managed to do in here is building up the tone and mood through the movie from setting up the haunted house and provide a hostile villager that still believed in ghost and phantoms. The plot of the story is slowly build up toward the climax which bring up more sense of terror as the tenacious Arthur Gibbs explore the alleged curse house. Most of the credit goes to Daniel Radclife in his portrayal of Arthur Gibbs, his acting in this movie is convincing that he has lost someone important to him. Judging by the constant melancholic expression on his face through the movie, he understand what his character demand in the movie. Since playing Harry Potter, Radclife has moved forward from a teen star to become an actual dramatic actor. The evidence can be found in this movie, in which he has became more mature as dramatic actor. For the most part, ""The Woman in Black"" is not a terrible horror movie because it has a solid ghost stories that felt like a dark English folklore and a haunting location which provide the thick dark atmosphere through the movie. Unfortunately, it is far from great either because the film move with a slow pace that resulted in becoming dull and overlong.it takes half the time to reach the main plot of the movie which turn out slightly disappointing. Because of its weakness,this movie has a little opportunity to become classic and can be easily forgettable because the mediocre standard that this movie has, until a great horror movie come into an existence, ""The Woman in black is worth a chance."

","I was very curious when I have read all the positive reviews here. Then the trailer promised an interesting ghost story too. The most important expectation for me was to see Daniel Radcliffe in his first adult role in a horror movie. He made a good job. The other reason was how the new Hammer house produced this creepy thriller. It was no doubt very convincing showing very original sceneries with chilling atmosphere. The haunted house was very mysterious. All filled out with outstanding cold colors. The script is okay and the running time just perfect. What I and my wife didn't like therefore was that children are shown in a very poor aspect. You will understand when you'll have seen it. Be prepared to a very unexpected end that I want not to spoil out here. The music from star composer Marco Beltrami was excellent.

The film looked great, and the location was well-chosen. The film built tension very well at the start, conjuring the sense of creeping dread found in M.R. James' scarier works; the script was deft, and I thoroughly settled in, looking forward to a good scare. Except...well...it all went a bit wrong. The overuse of jump-scares that really should be left to Youtube reaction videos was my first gripe, but the sourest note was struck by a deeply unsatisfying ending that seemed to arrive too early, and just left me hanging, wondering ""Was that it?""; my wife felt much the same. Overall, I was left with the feeling that a potentially great film had been missed."

","The story is very straight forward, but doesn't have a real climax. Every haunted-house cliché was pulled out during this movie. From children to black shadows. Almost 50 percent of the scenes, that are supposed to be scary, are announced with such obviousness through camera-angle or music that they lose momentum before they are even there. Don't get me wrong, the movie has some moments that scare you, but those are just too little in my opinion.<br/><br/>What irritates me is that Radcliffe never gets scared during the movie, only at the very end. Every human being would be scared to death and run away, but Radcliffe just keeps walking through the house with one paranormal occurrence after the other.<br/><br/>If you just want to get scared, don't care about the originality of the plot (which has one nice twist at the end) then this can be an entertaining movie, but don't expect much more..."

I borrowed this from a relative. I also thought that Daniel Radcliff played a rather unimportant part. he could have been made a slightly more major character. compared to the harry potter films this voted 0. also this film is the first since the Harry potter films and it was a bit of a let down.

It appears that even ghosts hate lawyers, so it all gets messy really soon. The actors were decent enough and the film spooky, but the thing that bothered me most was the cheap scares: sudden loud sounds, screeching ghosts appearing in reflective surfaces, the really old and annoying ""something moving in my peripheral field of view"" and the ending. Not the ending ending, but let's say the few minutes before the ending. It felt so fake.<br/><br/>Bottom line: a classic (and by that I mean filled with clichés) ghost horror, with Daniel Radcliff finally shedding that Harry Potter adolescent off his casting persona in the lead role. It's not what was in the film that made it average, but mostly what wasn't. So much potential and what they end up doing is an Asian horror with a British accent."

","The Woman in Black is an homage to the traditional ghost story. This is not merely because of the film's Edwardian setting, but due to how it is made. It is not gory, nor even violent. Atmosphere and character come first, and scares are generated more by suggestion than in-your-face shocks. Shadows conceal dark figures hiding from the light, figures that vanish before you're even sure you saw them, leaving doubt and fear in their wake so that even harmless, everyday objects are contaminated by the aura of inexplicable fear.<br/><br/>Directed by James Watkins and based on writer Susan Hill's celebrated novel of supernatural dread, The Woman in Black is not going to please everyone. Some horror fans will be disappointed by the lack of blood. But others will be glad to find a scary movie which doesn't feel the need to hit them in the face with the same.<br/><br/>Daniel Radcliffe stars as Arthur Kipps, a young solicitor and single father who has never recovered from his wife's death as she gave birth to their son. Kipps is despatched by his employer to a small village and the foreboding Eel Marsh House, former home of the deceased Alice Drablow, to sort through any remaining legal papers. Kipps arrives to find the Eel Marsh estate in a grim state of disrepair, and discovers new documents to go through under every cubbyhole.<br/><br/>But Kipps soon learns that his real challenge is nothing so mundane as legal drudgery. He hears a carriage that isn't there wreck in the bog which surrounds the house, and is a mute witness to a terrible tragedy's phantom re-enactment. And then he sees a strange woman dressed all in black walking around the house's estate, a woman who clearly isn't normal. What is the secret of Eel Marsh House? And what does the woman in black want? The Woman in Black is a dark, Gothic mystery that succeeds in producing scares without sacrificing its dignity to do so. The script isn't altogether logical, but it is at least serious, and the cast never wavers. Radcliffe is fine as our protagonist, and does a good job of conveying the appropriate sense of gloom and despair that the picture requires. Eel Marsh House itself is a Gothic marvel, a derelict structure alone on an isolated road which floods every evening, cutting it—and anyone unfortunate enough to be within—off from the rest of the town til morning. There could hardly be a better place for unquiet spirits to haunt.<br/><br/>And the Woman in Black herself is a very unquiet spirit, one driven by a single all-consuming passion that justifies every fear the local villagers have. The lack of blood doesn't mean The Woman in Black isn't frightening—at times, it is terribly unnerving in that subtle way that only ghost stories can achieve. If you're in the mood for a traditional ghost story that eschews modern horror clichés, look no further than The Woman in Black."

","...something went dreadfully wrong here. Daniel Radcliffe is the film's Achilles heel. He just doesn't have the heft to pull off the kind of nuanced role this movie demanded. It's partially that he's too young to pull off the love-shattered widower and partly that he's simply not a compelling screen presence. Imagine this film with, say, Fassebender or Mark Ruffalo or someone of that ilk and you'll get a sense of where this movie fails. The execution is also very messy. For a Gothic tale like this to work the structure has to be very sound; but this movie becomes a morass of cheap scares at the half-way mark and never recovers. On the positive side, the atmosphere is well established, the mystery of what it is, exactly, that's haunting the town is well done, and the conclusion was surprising and effective. But I still mourn for what this movie might have been."

I couldn't feel any connection with the characters at all - specially with the protagonist, Arthur. Daniel Radcliffe's expression was neutral the entire time, which is probably the reason why the movie was so unexciting. The plot could've been more explored and the end was too predictable, at least for me. However, it was quite entertaining. It had its scary moments and I jumped in my chair once or twice.

Let's not mention my kids who remain glued to the screen when a Hitchcock movie is on screen. Hitchcock was an innovator.

","When you watch the trailer you get a feel, an impression, of what this movie is going to be like. Sure there are some creepy parts and a few gotchas that make you jump. However the connection to the story just isn't there.<br/><br/>I know this was based on a novel, and like many great novels this probably was not translated into film well. Though I have not read it myself, I can strongly suspect that is what has happened here.<br/><br/>There is a trend in horror movies as of late that is more disturbing than the movies themselves...they aren't scary. Just because you have a ghost doesn't mean that they have to resemble every knock off Japanese ghost from the Ring to the Grudge...and everything in between. We've seen those type of ghosts before. We need something different, something original. Perhaps Hollywood is all out of ideas. Perhaps they are all out of disturbing.<br/><br/>I gave this movie a 6 out of 10 because it was exactly what I expected it to be. It wasn't worse than I thought, but I wasn't pleasantly surprised. I like Daniel Radcliffe, Harry Potter. He is familiar and in time will be a better actor, but this wasn't the movie for him to show his acting chops.<br/><br/>I guess to sum it up, my 7 year old fell asleep in the first twenty minutes. When I was 7 and watched a scary movie I was scared witless...I couldn't sleep and probably woke my Mom and Dad up throughout the night.<br/><br/>It's what happens when they try to cram same ol' same ol' canned horror movie stuff into a PG-13 rating. If they had a rated R to work with it could have really helped by giving them something to work with.

","Different people see this movie as different things. I see it first and foremost as Daniel Radcliffe's life after Harry Potter. Emma Watson has shown her post-Potter debut in ""My week with Marilyn"", in a small but eye-catching role. So- far-so-good for her. But how about Radcliffe? Well, to the movie first.<br/><br/>The setting is not unlike ""Sleepy Hollow"" when someone in an investigating capacity has been thrown into the uncomfortable position of visiting an isolated community to be met with local hostility. Here, Radcliffe plays Arthur Kipps, a lawyer in the post-Victorian period getting this assignment as his last opportunity to prove himself before getting fired. He desperately needs his job to support his 4-year-old son, after losing his wife in childbirth.<br/><br/>The job involves looking up whatever documents, and there are reportedly tons of them stacked away in a creepy mansion, pertaining to the suicide of a mentally disturbed woman, in the said mansion. The co-star, if I nay call it so, the haunted house, is accessible only through a narrow strip of roadway just above the coastal waters, which reminds me of Key West. But then, during high tide, the roadway is underwater, turning the place into a completely isolated island, such as what you find in Agatha Christie's classic story about ten guilty parties just beyond the reach of law being lured to an island to receive their deserved punishment (I was going to quote the very original title of the novel but it's so politically incorrect that if I do so, this piece will surely be deleted as a result of abuse reports).<br/><br/>One thing the audience will be dying to find out, right from the beginning of any movie of this horror-suspense genre, is whether it is really something supernatural or, rather, a logical explanation exists. While this spoiler I am certainly not going to disclose, I will go so far as to say that the plot is quite simple, about someone who has lost a child seeking revenge, in kind, indiscriminately.<br/><br/>This movie is well made, and you see the word ""atmospheric"" in just about every review. The horror is by far more mental than visual. People who are well versed in making this sort of movie well know that the most scary moments are not when the horror appears, but just before, with something lurking around the corner, behind the door, and such. The haunted house is well designed and skilfully filmed.<br/><br/>Rounding up on Radcliffe, I would give him a lot of credit for playing a well-focused protagonist, giving some dimensions to a character that could have otherwise been rather flat (here's your 3D). He looks a bit young though for the part, maybe partly due to our long identification with him as Harry Potter. His is not easy work, shaking that firmly ingrained image, but he has made some headway. There is still a lot of hard work ahead but let's hope that there are good scripts coming his way to help him get there. In the supporting role are Ciaran Hinds and Janet McTeer, playing a couple that is the only people befriending Kipps in this hostile territory. They have some acting to do, quite easy work though for actors of their calibre. There rest of the cast is merely props."

Oh, and its another one of those movies where most of the dialog is practically whispered so you turn your volume up but then anytime a scare happens it is ridiculously loud just to scare you more. This is cheap and it seems more and more movies are competing to have the loudest jump scares. Just a regular old music sting has worked just fine for years, but these days it has to have a giant BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOMMMMMMMZZZZZZ to be really effective. I have no idea why Daniel Potter chose to do this movie other than a paycheck and getting to hang out on the many cool sets. I must say though that it was beautifully shot. 6!"

","A post-Dickensian movie set in the moors of England, beautiful in its sea-mist and greyness of feeling. The star of the movie is its setting. The mansion, which would have made Mrs. Haversham quite comfortable to live in. I haven't seen cinematography this rich since Melancholia. I've never seen a Harry Potter movie but was impressed with Radcliffe's Arthur Kips. Ciaran Hinds is the anchor that holds this movie together. His character is the logic we need in this nefarious supernatural setting. I liked the premise the movie gave us in the beginning. The limitations it set by keeping Mr. Kips there to do the job he was employed for because his job was on probation so to speak. Also the access denied to leaving the Mansion on the moors due to the ebb and flow of the tides.<br/><br/>Still, the PG-13 setting worried me that this movie would be limited and not push the envelope of horror. I maintain I was correct in that assumption. Lets look at Ti West's THE HOUSE OF THE DEVIL, same genre with similar setting, ""person in house alone"". THE HOUSE OF THE DEVIL had me on the edge of my seat with tension, while THE WOMAN IN BLACK resorts to redundant one-note tricks, rocking chairs, creaking in the attic, manequins that move and voices. I was not scared even minimally.One last comment is that it seems in the horror genre in the past few years, most endings have evil prevail, and this movie followed suit."

","I have been waiting for this film for some time. Which I think goes to show that there is an appreciative audience and a great deal of planning and work involved in such a production. I also had a little apprehension at another 'version' of a very well known film.I suppose there must be some kind of insecurity abound when they decide to go along with a re-make, rather than write a new story. I would think that the first film could easily have inspired a different idea but perhaps that is a symptomatic of a general decline in innovation these days. Having said that, I did enjoy the film; the acting is good, plenty of suspense, atmosphere, visually good and a few shocks. A good evenings viewing. That is where I see a problem. I can't help feeling of condescension. The action element, reference to tried effect from other films and above all added 'plot', all place the film as good entertainment rather than memorable film.The added plot, presumably to attract a larger audience, becomes more apparent as the film progresses, and as a film often leads towards a lingering sense of thought, in this case it culminates in an easy, Dysney type conclusion. I can't help thinking of the way children would explain the story to each other, pointing out the signs along the way. I would recommend 'The Woman in black' as a good ghost film but not what it could have easily been. Which goes to show that although there is a tremendous talent in Britain for filmmaking, Innovation is suppressed in favour of the box office."

","'THE WOMAN IN BLACK': Three Stars (Out of Five) <br/><br/>Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) stars in this supernatural thriller about a lawyer who goes up against an evil spirit at a remote village in early 1900's England. The film is based on the book of the same name by Susan Hill. It was written by Jane Goldman and directed by James Watkins. The film is slow paced and light on thrills but effectively moody and Radcliffe is decent doing something other than Potter.<br/><br/>Radcliffe plays Arthur Kipps, a young lawyer dealing with the death of his wife. He travels to a remote village for work in order to settle the estate of an English manor owned by a recently deceased woman. The locals want him to leave but he refuses and he soon finds out the reason why. The manor is haunted by the ghost of a woman in black, who preys on children.<br/><br/>The movie is extremely slow paced and I found it very hard to stay interested in what was going on. The mood and look of the film is sufficiently spooky though and when something does happen it's somewhat creepy and frightening. It is good to see Radcliffe trying other things post 'Harry Potter' and he's adequate here. Hopefully his star won't die with the end of his popular franchise because he does have talent and hopefully he'll show it off in better projects than this.<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fii0IC2l7o"

","Even before J K Rowling started work on her last Harry Potter novel, questions were raised as to what lay ahead for Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson. For child actors who grew into immense fame and fortune overnight, industry pundits have assumed that the trio would need more than a magic wand to woo audiences that are not Harry Potter fans. To his advantage, Radcliffe appears to be burning bridges between Hogwarts and the real world that exists beyond. For his first major role outside the highly protective dome of a $7 billion (global box-office) film franchise, Radcliffe may be on the right path to disproving the theory that child actors seldom make the transition from juvenile charm to crowd pulling adult stars.<br/><br/>Set during the early 20th century in Edwardian England, Radcliffe plays Arthur Kipps, a young lawyer haunted by the tragic loss of his wife during childbirth. Struggling with this troubled past and stress from his law firm boss, Kipps is sent to handle the estate of the Late Alice Drablow. Before Kipps has a chance to recover Drablow's last will and testament, he is intimidated by townsfolk who consider his arrival as a bad omen. Sure enough, bad things start to happen, including apparitions of a woman dressed in black and the mysterious death of random children. Along with his only friend Sam Daily (Ciarán Hinds), Kipps digs deeper into the unknown before arriving at a perilous yet shocking revelation.<br/><br/>In keeping with the genre, director James Watkins' final product is nothing new with a central plot that appears to stem from a cross between ""Friday the 13th"" and ""The Ring"" – both horror films with a central theme of malevolent vengeance. That being said, pivotal to the fright factor is Watkins' use of perfectly timed suspense. Even so, predictability is on a tight leash, allowing the viewer little chance of preparing for a frightening moment. My only problem is that these moments, though scary, are few and scattered. Although this may have been intentional, it's fair to say that pacing and a darkening tone more than makes up with never a dull moment. The story is also engaging right from the very first scene and it soon becomes clear who the woman is black is. Central to the plot, and the mystery, is why she does what she does and the motive behind her evil vengeance.<br/><br/>Shouldering the bulk of the story, Radcliffe is not exactly phenomenal, but neither does he stick out like a sore thumb either. If this movie is any indication, it's safe to say that Radcliffe has broken free of the Harry Potter mold with distinctive promise as an up-and- coming actor. On the other hand, as a horror film with a supernatural premise, there is more to be desired. For a remake adapted from Susan Hill's novel of the same name, this film offers some truly jumpy moments by trading chilling atmosphere in favor of intentionally pulling the rug under the viewer. Not to say that this film is completely void of a creepy atmosphere, its just that Watkins seems to have placed all his chips on fright tactics rather than focusing on making the entire film a disturbing experience for the viewer. This becomes evident right from the start and each time you jump off your seat, it's like hearing a prankster say ""gotchya!"" Towards the end, I was starting to get an unnerving feeling that Watkins intended to terrorize the audience more than central characters in the movie. Fair enough for a horror movie, but you'll get my point with the very last scene, echoing the words ""you're next!"""

","I usually do not like horror films that much but sometimes for a change I do watch. This one I watched to see Daniel Radcliff only. Whether he would be suited to non-Magic films or not. Well to be precise he needs a lot of work to be done in this regard. He was not impressive as a father of a child.<br/><br/>PROS - The story was whether long or whatever but was to the point and does not includes anything irrelevant. There are haunted places shown properly , which seems to be one integral part of horror films. Also I liked the roles of the supporting cast who plays an integral part in supporting an immature acting by the leads. May be the film keeps you seated all the time because there are so many situations in 1:30 hour which is kind of good. Also I feared that harry potter image should not be around and it seems like a good start to do a film in horror to remove that image now.<br/><br/>CONS - The acting is the first thing that seems to be unimpressive. However he tries to look a lot better but fails to do so, but he will survive in the coming films. I hate when they try to scare us with elevated soundtracks. Eaach time the woman comes on the screen a high decibel sound is produced which does not causes fear but irritation. And it looked completely absurd to show a child of so young boy (Daniel).<br/><br/>""Not recommended at all for anyone unless you are a die-hard fan of potter and want to see him in a different role.(I AM...)"""

","A classical, old-fashioned haunted house ghost story that maintains an atmosphere of constant dread and provides the occasional jumps and shrills without resorting to cheap tricks or getting unnecessarily gory. The story-line is satisfying though predictable but that's acceptable given the fact that the novel has been around for a while and central plot/theme may have been used by horror flicks over the years. The performances are good, mostly subtle and low-key but that is consistent with the mood of the movie and certainly a strong plus in the age where mediocre performances are the norm for horror movies. Overall, a sure- watch for horror fans."

","not a horror movie. There aren't horrible rotting corpses or people being tortured or dismembered or any of the things I abhor in horror movies. It's a good, old fashioned ghost movie. Although there are a couple of shocks, it relies more on story, atmosphere, and excellent sets. I only watched it because my stepdaughter has a crush on 'Harry Potter'. I didn't expect much but was pleasantly surprised. <br/><br/>Although Daniel Radcliffe still looks pretty young he does a competent, convincing job, but I had to laugh when my stepdaughter said he wasn't cute anymore.<br/><br/>A fun, spooky experience and worth watching."

","Daniel Radcliffe is practically still a child, but he has to play a father in this movie. Another Hammer film, that finally seems to have a good one under its belt (if you take Let me in out of the equation that is, so let's say a unique good one). Hammer films came back, but it didn't seem to really take off. With this one it could change (if people will accept it, when it comes out on DVD and Blu Ray).<br/><br/>To solve the mystery: Daniel R. is good in his role, the fact that his godson played his kid helped a lot I reckon. Also it's a nice change of pace for Ciaran Hinds. He's a good actor, but can play it mellow for once, instead of going all out (he was rather mellow in Rome, I meant his movie roles). Some nice shockers and a really nice story make this a worthwhile watch"

","Having not read the book, I had no idea that I was walking into a supernatural horror movie that evoked shades of Tim Burton but went further in its implications. There was an evil vibe about this story, something cruel and cursed that you get almost immediately after Arthur Kipps (Daniel Radcliffe) arrives into the village. Being eerie and dark, the hazy and bleak cinematography is what causes this vibe, making for a chilling movie, one that keeps you peering around the corner for the next major fright. <br/><br/>The sets were perfect in giving their impression of 'Ye Olde England', but they are kept barren for a purpose which has your attention diverted toward the characters (and ghosts). There are junctures you get the feeling that the film is veering towards a gore driven slasher flick but it restrains itself suitably to deliver supernatural themed horror which is definitely frightening. <br/><br/>Moving from fantasy to something far more adult themed, Radcliffe made the transition seamlessly and appeared to be more absorbed in his character than he ever did in 'Harry Potter'. Severe twists and turns are not to be seen in a film quite faithful to its source material but don't think you will be yawning in boredom. The intensity of the events give you no space to do so."

","The Woman in Black is set in Engand at the turn of the 20th Century & starts in London as junior lawyer Arthur Kipps (Daniel Radcliffe) is told to travel to a small coastal village called Crythin Grifford to settle the estate of the recently deceased Alice Brablow & sell Eel Marsh House where Alice lived until her death. Arriving there Kipps finds the local villagers very unwelcoming, managing to pay someone to take him to Eel Marsh House so he can do the paperwork Kipps spends a few hours there & notices strange figures that he realises are ghost's & in particular the haunting vision of the evil woman in black. Kipps investigates the history of Eel Marsh House & discovers a terrible past & that the sinister woman in black is a vengeful ghost who wants to take revenge for her own son's death by killing all the villagers children...<br/><br/>This English, Canadian & Sweedish co-production was directed by James Watkins & is the fourth film from Hammer Studios since it's revival, having said that the new Hammer is just a brand as it uses a well known name merely to sell genre product picked up for release & produced by other's whereas the original Hammer of the 60's & 70's had a regular in-house team of producers & actor's & made their own films. The Woman in Black is based on a novel by Susan Hill originally published in 1983 which was turned into a stage play & made into the television film The Woman in Black (1989) which I have not seen so cannot compare the two. The script here was written by Jane Goldman (the wife of Jonathan Ross) & feels a little bit empty at times, the long stretches where Kipps stays in Eel Marsh House & the way it sort of fizzles out at the end with a surreal climax & no great reason behind anything like why bother find the boy's body & putting it in the coffin? It doesn't do anything. The local villagers are forgotten about halfway through, the line at the end 'your not my mother' also confuses things further. Lasting about 90 minutes it moves along at a fair pace although it does try to develop the story & build the atmosphere even if it doesn't quite work at times.<br/><br/>One thing that The Woman in Black as going for it is some wonderful production design, The Woman in Black looks fabulous with the Victorian period setting & the creepy old house sat on an isolated island. A lot of time & effort obviously went into the visual style of this, the CGI computer effects are also used sparingly & are pretty good. There's no real gore here, a young girl coughs up some blood & a couple of decomposing skeletons are seen but otherwise The Woman in Black tries to create a sense of dread rather than assault the senses with CGI & special effects. One aspect that may annoy some people are the constant fake scares, scenes where you know something is going to happen only for some mundane occurrence to make a loud noise like a tap suddenly spurting dirty water or something suddenly appearing like a screeching bird. I loved the opening scene which is quite eerie as three young girls suddenly get up jump out of their window's together.<br/><br/>With a supposed budget of about $17,000,000 this did very well at the box-office over becoming one of the most successful horror films released in British cinemas, this was more successful than any of Hammer's original films that screened during the 60's the 70's in fact. Cotterstock Hall in Northamptonshire stood in for Eels Marsh House & it does a fine job. The acting is solid from a good cast, Radcliffe looks a bit young to be a father here but that's nit picking I suppose.<br/><br/>The Woman in Black is a solid supernatural horror thriller that tries to build up tension & suspense through it's story rather than gore & CGI which is admirable enough I suppose, while it drags a bit & maybe the story isn't quite as deep or as satisfying as it could have been The Woman in Black is an old fashioned haunted house horror film with modern production values. I liked it."

","This film concentrated on the shock and terror of a haunted house. The use of sound effects was very good and the visuals terrifying. Many people complained that the casting of Harry Potter was a mistake but as I have never watched a Harry Potter film I wasn't distracted and he performed very well. However, as I watched the film I recognised scene after scene that had been lifted from classic horror films, the empty rocking chair that keep rocking by itself, the clockwork toys that go off by themselves, the door handles that turn by themselves etc. Obviously the director has watched many older Hammer films and this film is almost homage to them rather than an original work. The ending was exactly the same as ""Dr Terrors"" with the exception that it was really weak and the final scene was obviously created to enable a 12a certificate and happy ending rather than the 18 it should have had. It is not as good a film as the 1989 version especially the ending. However, if you simply want to be terrified then it works on that level quite well."
"barnabyrudge","7","0","0","8 March 2012"," Effectively jumpy ghost story with a few minor flaws.
","It is a common misconception that The Woman In Black is an example of Victorian literature, when in actual fact it is a novel by Susan Hill written in 1983 and set during Edwardian times. The book has been highly regarded since its publication, inspiring a long-running stage show by Stephen Mallatratt, a chilling TV movie in 1989, and several radio adaptations. It finally gets the big screen treatment thanks to screen-writer Jane Goldman and director James Watkins. The key question any audience will want to ask is:- have they done justice to this most celebrated of contemporary ghost stories? The answer is yes; on the whole this is an eerily effective bloodcurdler which cranks up an aura of dread and suspense, without resorting to gore and splatter.<br/><br/>Young lawyer Arthur Kipps (Daniel Radcliffe) is struggling with bills and facing the loss of his job. His wife died in childbirth, leaving him with the responsibility of bringing up their child. As the pressure mounts, Arthur is close to the edge and thoughts of suicide are never far from his mind. Then he gets a chance at redemption. In the remote north-eastern town of Crythin Gifford, an elderly lady has died and a lawyer is required to sort out her affairs, including the sale of her dilapidated mansion at Eel Marsh. Arthur accepts the assignment in order to re-establish himself as a reliable member of the firm. The mansion is on a small island at the end of a causeway, completely cut off from the mainland when the tide is in. Arthur is immediately struck by the aggression and hostility that greets him in the village. Things worsen when he goes to the mansion itself, where he is plagued by a series of malevolent sounds and happenings which cannot be explained in a rational manner. Slowly, Arthur learns that the villagers live in fear of The Woman In Black, a vengeful spectre with a score to settle against the whole community. He pieces together the shameful and tragic secrets of Crythin Gifford, and realises that somehow he must satisfy the furious ghost's hunger for revenge in order to set her soul to rest once and for all.<br/><br/>Let's get the bad points out of the way first. Radcliffe is rather miscast as Kipps, clearly too young to be believable as a suicidal lawyer with inner demons and a tragic past. His performance is quite good in all fairness, but he just doesn't suit the role. What we have here is an example of cynical studio execs exploiting an actor's fan base to raise the profile of their film, rather than casting the right actor for the part. Also disappointing is the absurd ending to the movie, altered somewhat from the book's ruthlessly bleak finalé and probably a good deal less unsettling as a result. Apart from that, The Woman In Black is a good, solid ghost story, crafted with an impressive eye for the macabre. Its aim is to build dread, to keep the viewer's stomach in knots, and its sets about achieving this goal with a relentlessness that is well sustained throughout. There are plenty of genuinely jumpy moments, and even a few sequences that could be described as truly scary (there is, I believe, a subtle difference between jumpy and scary). The film is put together slickly and professionally; an effective fireside scare-story which provides a welcome antidote to the increasing number of OTT gorefests presently swamping the genre."
"MovieGeekBlog","4","6","20","4 February 2012"," full of clichés, slow and greatly miscast
","I am really sorry to have to reduce most of my review about this film to the fact that it all starts with a bad casting choice, but it's really very hard to see past Daniel Radcliffe portraying a father of a four years old boy. I mean, how can I possibly buy into it when the DVD of the latest Harry Potter film is plastering every single window of every store in town right now? It doesn't matter how much facial hair Daniel is growing to disguise his baby face, or how far away he's trying to take his new character from the 'boy who lived', or even how little dialogue he speaks in this film (because let's admit it, it usually all falls apart as soon as  he opens his month), I am just NOT buying into it! A grown man (A lawyer in fact!) who's been married, widowed and has a child of 4? That is a big leap of faith...<br/><br/>However I was willing to take the leap and I did really try my best, despite the film itself doing virtually nothing to help me and convince me otherwise: there was not a single mention of his young look from any of the characters and we are just supposed to take it all from granted. At some point in the beginning there was even shot of what looked like the Hogward Express, running through the British landscape, with steam and all the rest (I was expecting to hear John Williams' tune at any point!).<br/><br/>Radcliffe himself does try his best to restrain his usual trade-mark heavy breathing. The film-makers made sure he spoke as little as possible and wisely they even avoided having him standing right next to any other cast members (so that it wouldn't show how short he is which would have made it even more laughable). But unfortunately all this is just not enough and his presence, instead of making the film better, holds it back..<br/><br/>It's probably not very fair to criticise a movie just for his main lead, even less fair to compare it to previous movies the same lead starred in, I agree. But even when you take Radcliffe out of this film, you're actually left very little else.<br/><br/>""The woman in Black"" wants to be a film about ""mood""  and ""atmosphere"" more than ""action"" and ""twists"". It's more about the expectations of the ghost in a looked room at the end of the corridor than the actual reveal of the ghost itself. In a way, it's an old fashion ghost story: it's all about those creaks in a old house, the thick fog hiding a secret and those eerie shadows that should make your skin cold.<br/><br/>On paper all this sounds great and I am all in favour of an old-style good ghost story... If only it was all building up to something... Alas the pace is evenly slow and Daniel is alone for most of the film investigating strange noises around the house for what feels like an eternity; so much so that after a while it all gets rather repetitive and tedious.<br/><br/>James Watkins was probably aware of this and in order to ""jazz it all up"" decided to pepper it all with several ""fairly predictable"" loud stabs of cheap scares. I say ""fairly predictable"" because as an average horror fan I could see most of those ""jumps moment"" coming from miles away. Of course some of them are quite effective, but I don't think that should be a mark of a good horror film. It's certainly not difficult to scare people with a loud crashes and bangs in the middle of a very quiet scene.<br/><br/>I couldn't help feeling there was nothing in this film that I had not seen before... A haunted house, rocking chairs moving by themselves, spider webs, locked doors, ghosts appearing in windows, a graveyard at night, thick fog and quicksands, old fading photographs ... No cliché was left untouched. Oh look, Daniel is reflected in a window! How long will it take until a ghost appears in the reflection. Not long, believe me.<br/><br/>As for the plot itself, it really feels rather dated, like a story that belongs to a different era, which in theory should be fine, but 10 minutes into the film I really get the feeling that I have already seen it all.<br/><br/>I haven't read the original story, nor seen the stage play, but by watching this film alone I do get the feeling that this is a short story stretched to its limits. Probably OK for a twilight Zone episode, or maybe even or a theatre stage, but as a film, aside from some interesting visual imagery, there was just not enough to keep me intrigued for the length of the film and by the time the ending came I just did not really care who lived or died.<br/><br/>Very very very disappointing. In fact quite laughable. Full unedited review on MovieGeekBlog.com"

","This movie was brilliant, to start things out to the point. It was what many could see as a horror film that was actually made right, with nothing overdone and the special effects limited to make it all that more convincing. Sure other reviews say that there is no plot, or that it is just full of cheap scares, or that the whole interest of the movie is behind Daniel Radcliffe. This is all mostly not true. OK, while i'm sure Daniel Radcliffe did bring more people to view the film, he actually did a brilliant job, and you never once looked at him and thought he used to be Harry Potter. If you don't fully understand the movie you may not understand Daniel motives the whole way through, but it actually makes sense, and there actually is a good plot behind everything, including the woman in black herself. With the scares, well, some people may have said they were cheap and repetitive, but they were actually done very well. They were not something that you would get sick of and they didn't take away anything from the movie, if not actually make it better. The scares were well thought out, and nothing was to overdone to seem ridiculous. That might actually be the best part about this movie. Just like any good classic suspense or horror film, things were never done to a point where they went from scary to unbelievable, and the movie did not use any of the obvious plain moments that we would usually expect."

","You have to be in the mood for a good, authentically creepy ghost story to fully enjoy the quiet chills of THE WOMAN IN BLACK. It's only after the story ended that I realized I'd been taken by something I should have seen from the beginning. At any rate, the ending did come as a twist for me--but in view of all the preceding events, it was indeed foreshadowed by information given about the title character.<br/><br/>Daniel Radcliffe has to carry the weight of most of the film on his own shoulders and he does a very satisfying job as a young lawyer whose firm sends him on a mission to a remote village accessible only when the tide is low enough to permit horse and carriage to enter. The story depends on the musty atmosphere of a decaying mansion full of shopworn dolls in a nursery where three girls met their fate years ago. <br/><br/>Radcliffe's only friendly neighbor is Ciaran Hinds, who helps him get to the root of the troubled village and the death of numerous young children. The extremes to which Radcliffe is willing to go (as in the marsh scene where he recovers a dead boy's body) are improbable, to say the least, but so graphically enacted that you have to believe it. It's one of the most suspenseful moments in the story. Radcliffe is willing to recover the corpse to give it a proper burial next to the mother, whose spirit is evidently haunting the old mansion.<br/><br/>The surprise ending fits the story but came as quite a shock to me, although with hindsight I can see that there was some preparation for it if you paid close attention to the script.<br/><br/>For lovers of Gothic tales full of mist, suspicion, brooding townspeople and dangerous marshlands, THE WOMAN IN BLACK is your ticket. Good production values are in abundant evidence. Hammer is certainly making a good comeback in the horror genre with this delicious ghost story. Fine cinematography is another big asset.<br/><br/>Radcliffe makes expressive use of his penetrating blue eyes framed by bushy brows that confirm his qualification for more adult roles in his future."

Story wise, I'm surprised it actually made the cut; story was a bit bland, I was surprise I was able to guess more than 95% of the outcome of the few interesting bits there were. I at least thought the fear and horror in the movie was the redeeming point when I checked out the poster in front of the theater, but I made a huge mistake. I didn't expect the plot and the horror bits to be so predictable. If you've seen many horror movies back in the 1980's-90's that's exactly the type you'll be getting.

","First of all, I don't normally watch horror movies in the theater. I prefer to watch them at home, at night, with the lights off and with as little people around as possible. With this film, it hardly would've mattered. Insidious, The Shining, The Blair Witch Project and Paranormal Activity 1 and 2 are the 5 sole movies that have frightened me as much as this has, so fright fans: put this film in your plans. Daniel Radcliffe is excellent in this film playing a young lawyer near the turn of the 20th century living with his 4 year old son and grieving over the death of his wife during child birth. He is sent to a small village to manage the estate of a recently deceased woman. Obviously there's much more to be seen. The setting and premise of this film is done perfectly. The film has a very dark theme that it wants to get across and it does so superbly, not to mention how well it mixes with it's frightening tone. I've heard many complaints over how films have run out of ideas, but every now and then there's a good one. This is one of them. Yes, there are jump scares, but they're done in a way you haven't seen before. The movie will build up tension for almost 5 minutes until you literally are begging for the scare to come, and then it doesn't, and the music goes away. Now, you think, it'll come right now, it's in the mirror, behind the door, etc. No, the scare doesn't come. It gets you to the point where you actually realize there isn't going to be a scare, and then it finally comes. This film is the first horror movie that I've ever seen that I believe deserved Oscar nominations: costume design, cinematography, and Daniel Radcliffe for best actor. Unfortunately, with today's standards for the Academy Awards, there is almost no way that this type of movie would be nominated for any type of Oscar, though it certainly deserves it."

It always keeps you guessing and builds up your anticipation.<br/><br/>Summary : There may be complaints that there are not enough ""scary"" scenes in the movie. But i guess if the director wanted he could have included many more scenes. The idea was to invoke the ""chilliness"" with minimal appearances of the "" woman in black"".<br/><br/>Definitely worth a watch. BTW, i am a big fan of horror movies, so i really liked it."
"djgrnfrs","9","3","8","4 February 2012"," Splendid sets
","Without belaboring the points already made, I must claim that I thoroughly enjoyed this film. Whatever else might be said about the artistry of the movie, one cannot deny that the sets were exquisite. From the dead leaves on the porch to the layers of dust and grime on everything at Eel Marsh house, I fully felt the sense of dilapidation and abandoned isolation which I believe Susan Hill sought to evoke. Far too many haunted houses in films appear to have been ""ServiceMastered"" the week before. The locations were also superb, the hamlet of Crythin-Gifford did not clash with the mental images I had formed when reading the book"

","""The Woman in Black"" starts off by setting a mood, a Gothic mood, a creepy mood, a strange mood, but as you begin to understand just what is going on, you begin to let go of Harry Potter, and just allow the picture to entertain you.<br/><br/>It is about a lawyer played by Daniel Radcliffe who has had a terrible loss in his own life. His tragedy has effected his performance at his work and is on his last warning. He embarks on an interesting journey to research the death of an entire family in a recluse house that hosts its own graveyard, and woods. The house is separated from town by an area that floods during the high tide and is also a murky, mucky, black, dirty, swamp of sorts. He is there to investigate the estate but soon realizes that the townsfolk isn't too fond of his presence. After this, the scares start to jump out from everywhere. If you love those sorts of movies and enjoy Pg-13 trillers, then this is a great movie. If you are looking for Daniel's escape from ""Harry"" then you may want to wait for a later film since this film doesn't really allow him to improvise because of the straight forward, linear, style of directing. The shadows are realistic, the lighting is dark and the picture is desaturated. The desaturation is a good choice, but in my opinion, I would have been more interested in this film if it had been done in black and white.<br/><br/>There are some good memorable parts so I give it some credit for doing some things I have never seen before. Decent entertainment, but not for the adult crowd. I would take my 13 year old to it, but 17 and up might be disappointed because of the lack of horror.<br/><br/>The acting by Daniel hits the mark, but the character he plays is just not that interesting, but he is on the other hand very good at being what connects the younger viewers to the scares. But where I think the film detaches itself from the audience is where it uses visuals instead of on screen emotion to scare the audience, let alone allowing the audience to put their own emotion into the film. The Gothic, semi-monochrome style of the film doesn't do much in the way of telling the story but does add to the dreariness of the setting. And that is where the film sets itself apart from others.<br/><br/>Overall, don't expect much in the way of thinking here and it is really is not for the horror fan. Although I would recommend it to the teenage crowd looking for a scary ride."
"randyberridgee","8","3","9","5 February 2012"," A very enjoyable scary movie
","First off I am not the biggest fan of scary movies in general, but I wanted to see Daniel Radcliffe in his first role outside of Harry Potter. I was really surprised and impressed by the movie. Even outside of Dan Radcliffe the rest of the cast put on a really strong performance, especially Ciaran Hinds. It manages to scare you and build up great suspense without the use of blood and gore. It has a really strong plot unlike most scary movies these days and it feels complete by the end of the movie. Even if you do not typically enjoy scary movies I think this film could be enjoyed by anybody. So all in all I think this movie is well worth your money that gives you scares but doesn't overwhelm you with gore."

","I'm an avid moviegoer but don't often watch horror flicks due to the gore and violence. ""The Woman in Black"" was surprisingly good and I was even able to look past Daniel Radcliffe as his former Harry Potter because of the fantastic acting. <br/><br/>The story does a good job at bringing chill to the viewer as the plot stays a mystery from throughout the beginning to the middle. Along with the chill, there are plenty of thrills that have you startled here and there throughout the flick. The director does a good job at timing the thrills for the fact that you feel like something is about to happen, but still ends up startling you because it's not exactly at the moment you were expecting.<br/><br/>I have to disagree with some of the reviews on here that state that the movies goes downhill after mid way through. I felt as the tempo and chill continues all the way through till the end, and actually thought ""The Woman in Black"" has a decent ending unlike many horror/thrill movies. Again, my opinion but overall thoroughly enjoyed the movie and give it an 8 out of 10.<br/><br/>The only advice I would give is possibly wait a week or two to go watch ""The Woman in Black"" due to all the giggling, texting, talking teenagers obsessed with Daniel Radcliffe, who fill the theater for this movie due to thinking this is somehow a sequel to the Harry Potter films.... I can say in appreciation that it's far from the Harry Potter story-line :)"
"CleveMan66","7","2","5","16 March 2015"," ""The Woman in Black"" shines with old-school thrills and chills
","The 2012 British horror film ""The Woman in Black"" (PG-13, 1:35) has a diverse heritage. The basic story first appeared in a 1983 horror novella by Susan Hill. In 1987, the story became a stage play which is still in production and has become the second longest-running non-musical play in London's West End (behind ""The Mousetrap""). A made-for-TV version debuted on British television on Christmas Eve 1989, but made minor changes to the story with which the novella's author took exception. The story was even more significantly changed for the 2012 big-screen version. But the feature film's rich pedigree goes beyond the story's adaptations and changes to the original version. ""The Woman in Black"" is an old-fashioned ghost story which uses low-tech thrills and chills to maximum effect.<br/><br/>The big-screen adaptation eliminates and condenses many of the novella's details to produce a tighter story. In his first post-Harry Potter film role, Daniel Radcliff stars as Arthur Kipps, an early-20th century English lawyer whose wife (Sophia Stuckey) died in childbirth, leaving him to raise his now 4-year-old son, Joseph (Misha Handley), as a single parent, but with the help of a nanny (Jessica Raine). Arthur's employer tells the still-grieving and ever-morose young man that his job is in serious jeopardy if he fails at his new assignment – settling the estate of a recently-deceased recluse named Alice Drablow. On the train to the small northeastern English town of Crythin Gifford, he meets a resident of the town named Sam Daily (Ciarán Hinds, also a veteran of the Harry Potter franchise) who offers him a ride into town. Arthur's interactions with the locals suggest that this is either the least welcoming town in all of England, or that the townsfolk have a personal problem with Arthur or maybe a bit of both.<br/><br/>Mrs. Drablow lived in the large, spooky-looking Eel Marsh House, a mansion that is only accessible by a long, narrow road which disappears every day at high tide. Mrs. Drablow was a widow whose adopted son drowned in the surrounding marsh years earlier, eventually leading her to hang herself in grief. Her house is filled with piles of papers that Arthur must sort through before the estate can be settled and the house can be put on the market. These papers reveal that Alice Drablow's sister (the boy's birth mother who lost custody to her sister and blamed the sister for the boy's death) was a tortured and possibly mentally-ill woman who the locals say haunts the house. They say when someone sees her ghost, a child dies. Arthur doesn't believe in all that (nor does Mr. Daily, who befriends and helps the young attorney), but there's definitely SOMETHING going on. The creeks and thumps that Arthur hears in the old house turn into crashes and screams – and the increasingly frequent appearance of a female figure dressed in funeral garb. Bad things do start to happen in the local area. Arthur has his hands full trying to do his job, figuring out what is happening in Crythin Gifford and stopping it – and doing all this before his son's nanny brings Joseph to the town to meet up with his dad at the end of the week, as Arthur had arranged before he left home.<br/><br/>""The Woman in Black"" is a throw-back, both in setting and in tone – but in a good way. The Edwardian England backdrop separates the audience from their modern horror film expectations and the unsettling old-school sights and sounds can still produce effective scares in the 21st century. The movie is scary, but it's also dark and tense, much like ""The Others"" in 2001. Radcliff is convincingly troubled and carries the film very effectively. Hinds is equally troubled, but sympathetic and helpful. The actors playing the residents of Crythin Gifford make for a solid ensemble, their emotions ranging from callous indifference to frightened anger to extreme grief. The titular specter is so frightening and omnipresent that you may end up looking for her in the dark corners of your house. All this adds up to a believable story and a mystery that you'll want to see solved – plus an ending that you'll likely find both horrifying and touching."
"hellornola","7","2","5","10 October 2012"," Classic but unique
","As film makers continue to churn out more blood and guts to hungry fans, a classic haunted house movie is a breath of fresh air.<br/><br/>Daniel Radcliffe has grown up and out of his Harry Potter days, doing a fantastic job on his own, in this incredibly creepy movie. Everything from the house itself, to the people who inhabit the town, to the dull gray ocean keeps you on edge. There are definitely scares and jumps aplenty.<br/><br/>My only complaint is that I felt the plot was a little shallow. There were many frightening scenes, but not enough background information, which I felt took away from the overall eeriness of the movie. I had hoped that all would've been resolved at the end, but was sorely mistaken and was left feeling empty and disappointed.<br/><br/>Overall, it's a great movie to see when you're alone on a stormy night and feel like being terrified until dawn. It'll definitely have you flipping every light on in no time at all."
"Aly200","5","2","5","26 July 2012"," Best Horror Film to Date
","Most critics in the US did dismiss this film as a clichéd horror film with a typical plot:someone loses a loved one and becomes depressed, the spooky village with the creepy house that no one goes to and a vengeful spirit is wreaking havoc. I for one think that 'The Woman in Black' is one of the finest horror films released in the 21st century. The film was packed with surprising scary moments where you would feel secure, but then something spooky pops out or something scary happens and you fly out of your seat. Also a huge perk of the film is the fact that this is Daniel Radcliffe's first take on a real adult role (he recently turned 23). He stated in an interview for the film that he wants to move as far from Harry as he can and be known for also taking on roles that represent him at his current age."

I have seen a lot of horror movies, before and most of them were demented and down right grotesque! But this one is more in the veins of the traditional Gothic classics! Only more intense, I found that refreshing because it is my kind of horror movie ! No zombies or monsters lurking in the shadows. Just pure paranormal terror , that can bring a chill to ones spine! Not one that makes you hide your face or want to vomit! But makes you scared ,yet curious on how it will end! Daniel has come a long way from Harry Potter, he has definitely proved his worth in this film. I would give it an A!"

","This is an excellent adaptation of Susan Hill's novel about a young man who goes to settle the affairs of a recently deceased woman in an old spooky house where he sees a woman in black. People in the village are scared and it involves the children. It's so refreshing to watch a ghostly horror story instead of a gory slasher movie like Nightmare or Friday etc. A real ghost story is more frightening and much more entertaining in the end. A single ghostly apparition is more scary than all the CGI and shock tactics that many modern movies use. Daniel Radcliffe's face is older and he suits the role. His short stature isn't obvious. He acts well and his facial expressions are good. He is versatile. Looks like he has a good grown up career ahead of him after Harry Potter. Supporting cast like Janet McTeer and Cirian Hinds are good too. The production is very well done. The eerie house (where did they find it?) and village are very authentically recreated. Well captured atmosphere and good photography. I saw the stage play in London and this movie is much better and grander. For those who know the Hammer productions this is much more big budget and beautifully filmed. The story is consistent and makes logical sense in its own supernatural way. in The ending is in the Hammer tradition. A must see."

","Two things to admit up front: I adore Dan Radcliffe and I hate horror films. I've never enjoyed paying to have someone stress me out. Because it was Radcliffe, I paid to go and I'm very happy I did. I thought the cast was excellent and, while much of the haunted house was what you would expect to find, I thought the special effects were cool, such as the rocking chair. Some of the special touches, like the toys, were very Victorian and creepy. I took my 12 year old granddaughter, who loves to be scared and she loved it. She has gone back to see it two more times with friends.<br/><br/>I've not read the book, nor seen the old version of the movie, so the ending was a surprise to me. I thoroughly enjoyed it even though I jumped out of my chair at least five times.<br/><br/>I will buy it when it comes to DVD."

","Having watched this film 3 times in the cinema, i would like to think i am in a good position to review it. I am a big fan of horror movies and recently i haven't seen a good horror film that is generally creepy since last years insidious. The reason this is a great film is not just that it's creepy and jumpy but it's got good diolouge and a interesting storyline. One complaint i would have is that i could have done with more scares, all the scares were bunched together in small bursts which were over within a matter of a few minuets. A big question that people want answered would be,''is Daniel Radcliffe good in a different role?' well, yes, he is. Not once in the film did I think of him as harry potter, maybe because of his beard and lack of glasses. He was very convincing and I hope to see him again. As for people critisising the film? Well what did you expect? It's a horror movie made to scare and entertain, and on that front it definitely delivers. I would recommend this to anyone 13 or over."

It was my first horror film I watched in cinema, but never ever again going to watch a horror film in cinema. Who let the kids in films like that?!!!!

There are some genuinely great horror moments, obviously as it is a horror film, great shocks, some nice suspense. But nothing left me rattling with terror or kept me up that night thinking about it. It was a great story, we all enjoyed the story, it was well shot, looked great, great cast to be honest, everybody was good in it, you won't be bored, its a good length...come on guys just watch it.

"viper_76262","4","2","5","12 February 2012"," Great movie except the ending
","Great suspense and atmosphere. My wife and I loved the movie and were on the edge of our seats until the ending where it all fell apart. The hero goes to all of the trouble to appease the ghost (The Woman) (including risking his own life in an attempt to save his own son) after the ghost has marked the boy for death and thinks she is at peace, but then she just decides to come back anyway to kill his son. Not only does the son die, but so does the hero. And to make things worse, this villain victory is justified because the hero and his son are united with his wife who died in childbirth?! What a disappointment! This is yet another downer movie from Hollywood showing just how out of touch they are with America. Enough bad guys win in the end in reality and I think endings like this are not what America is looking for. Without the horrible ending I would have given the movie a 7 out of 10. If I had to rate the ending alone I would have to give it a 1 out of 10. Another review said that if you liked The Others you will like this movie. We saw The Others, loved The Others, and bought The Others. The Woman in Black took what would have been a good movie, threw in some cheesy parts that reminded me of The Ring and Blair Witch, and made me want my money back in the end. Hollywood desperation is really showing - re-releasing The Godfather, Star Wars in 3D, and now this garbage? What's next? Kindly refund my $19!"
"acf9","7","2","5","6 February 2012"," great movie
","I'm not typically a ""horror"" movie fan. I don't like the blood and gore and generally, ""horror"" movies are laughable at best. That being said, this one is greatly enjoyable and a good scare. As in any good scary movie, the fear comes from what can't be seen. What is seen is tastefully minimal and lets your imagination do the work. the cinematography sets the mood for the entire movie while the film work allows the scenery and sets to be hauntingly beautiful and ominous. Overall, a very well done piece of work that is cohesive from start to finish with enough frights in between to make it worth your dollar. Danielle Radcliffe has established himself as an actor that is capable of being more than a wizard and will be a promising talent for the future. I'd be lying if i didn't want him to reach for his wand though!"
"fdbjr","Null","2","5","4 February 2012"," Radcliffe's Performance (Spoilers)
","The Woman in Black turned out to be quite a successful Friday night movie, plotty and quite scary, without being over the top - nothing that the audience will take home with it. <br/><br/>Most of the reviews have hit the nail on the head. I am writing only to take issue with that minority of critics who complained about Daniel Radcliffe's performance. In my opinion, he was excellent - conveying the rising states of suspicion and fear in his character's emotional state, without ever lapsing into camp or chewing the carpet. He is on screen for 90 percent of the scenes, maybe more, including an extended set piece in the middle in which he is the sole actor in front of the camera. (That by the way was the spoiler - not much, in my opinion, but I take no chances.)<br/><br/>I am a huge admirer of the Harry Potter novels, but not of the movies - beginning with 'Order of the Phoenix', the director and writer didn't even try to match the nuance of the narrative, and they are more a series of staged tableaux than a fair presentation of the novel content. Maybe for that reason, I thought Radcliffe was far better in this part than any of those."
"DJRMewzique","7","2","5","5 February 2012"," Entertaining but Nothing New.
","""The Woman in Black"" is by no means a stroke of brilliance, nor will it really scare you in the theatre or haunt you after the credit roles, but as far as good 'ole ghost stories go, it's a pretty good film.<br/><br/>Based on the 1983 book by Susan Hill and a remake of Herbert Wise's 1989 film, the story is about a grieving widower, a lawyer named Arthur Kipps, facing severe financial problems, who must take leave from his son and attend to the estate of a deceased woman, only to find her property to be the source of much fear in the small town in which she resided. As Kipps begins to discover as the secrets hidden in the history of the family which lived in the home, he learns that the threat of a ghost and its ties to the death of numerous children may very well be more real than he had feared.<br/><br/>The film features some interesting yet clichéd bumps in the night, but under the direction of relative newcomer James Watkins, ""The Woman in Black"" does unfold in a nice, well-paced, terribly creepy manner, although does not really bring anything new to the genre. The inclusion of uncensored death of children is somewhat of a refreshing twist (usually such stories try not to make death of non-adults nearly as graphic) but overall, the film is not going to go down in history as a brilliant twist on the genre. I give it credit for not having a stereotypical ending and the film does include some seriously beautiful cinematography.<br/><br/>As for Daniel Radcliffe? In his first post-Potter role, many are commenting on the fact that he didn't really stray as far away from his well-known past as much as he should have, but not being a terribly big fan of the Potter films, having thus seen only the first three, I think Radcliffe does an excellent job here. I did not feel that I was watching Harry Potter for the length of the film and, hey, for the first time ever, there were moments that I thought Radcliffe was actually, dare I say it, looking kind of sexy. With his very expressive face, no doubt honed through many a take on previous sets in which he needed to exude fear, he portrayed the downtrodden and almost helplessly sad Kipps with almost mathematical execution.<br/><br/>""The Woman in Black"" may not be the dawning of a new age of ghost stories, but it does prove to be a great spring board for Radcliffe as he dives into the next phase of what could be a very impressive acting career."

The only thing i can think that could of made this film better is if at the end where the woman in black is standing there in front of the black background is if she done the scream like in the film, that would of been sure to scare everyone, my favourite horror film of all time i love it."
"Leemsn-co-uk","8","2","6","17 February 2012"," A lot better than I expected.
","This is my first review so be patient with me, I just have to say I thoroughly enjoyed this film, it turned out a lot better than I expected it to. Daniel Radcliffe's acting gets better and better with every film he appears in.<br/><br/>The location is absolutely fantastic, how the tide cuts off the house from the rest of the world and all that is left is the house and the surrounding garden. You truly believe it is a real place and the viewer is given a genuine believable excuse for the house being cut off, the tide is out which completely submerges the road away from the house, rather than being a completely unrealistic excuse like there is a massive wall that cuts off everything.<br/><br/>Daniel Radcliffe's acting could be better, but it is far from terrible, you really believe he is Arthur Kipps and not Harry Potter anymore. It is a brilliant thing that he is trying new things, I for one did not expect him to feature in a horror film as his first ""post-Potter"" film debut.<br/><br/>I really like how they never hid the Woman in Black, you see her directly in many occasions, instead of films such as the Blair With Project where you see NOTHING for an hour and a half.<br/><br/>The story behind the Woman in Black was a bit confusing for me, so many names were introduced so fast so it was hard to keep up, I got the general gist of the story and was pleased with the film's ending. You sense towards the end that the Woman in Black has not left and you will see her again before those credits roll. It was kind of 50/50 if Arthur's son would actually end up hurt but I don't believe it was done just for the sake of adding shock value.<br/><br/>I also liked the way for a small amount of time you believed that Arthur survived, but only a few seconds later it dawns on you that something feels wrong. From the others' reaction you weren't sure if he had survived or not until you saw the ever so slight visual change in the atmosphere, once Arthur was in ""Limbo"" it suddenly went darker and that was a nice, gentle realisation of the situation."
"mad_mandonna","7","2","6","13 February 2012"," The suspense was fantastic, literally on edge of seat behind hands.
","Horror is my favourite genre of film, but these days the horror films that are churned out lack the most important thing and thats scares. While Woman in Black won't leave much of a lasting impression on you beyond the end credits, it must be noted that the film does pack a punch to your nerves where other films may just try to gross-you-out.<br/><br/>Set in the late 1800's, the film looks stunning set in the dark north of England. The brick work and fog really set the mood, and the under-stated lighting allows the imagination to run wild. The film is directed with a certain flare, the camera is framed perfectly to fill with horrific images and the film is edited so very crisply. The music and sound is also a big plus here, atmospheric and above all creepy. The string orchestration sneaks into the back ground and at the times of pure silence and gentle thudding, it just makes it all the more effective.<br/><br/>Though generally good the film does lack a fair amount of story. The first half hour seems rather pointless, and neither builds character nor furthers the story. And the worst of all is the ending, which not giving anything away, was just a little too ""neat"" for my liking. The other problem I had is with lead actor Daniel (Harry Potter) Radcliffe, whom seems to only have two facial expressions. Though he played gormless fear rather well, his chemistry with other actors was non-existent. The worst sign of this is with his young son, there is a major unbelievability for his love for his son and this is fatal in the final moments of the film. Though by and large this is only a minor grievance, as supporting actors are great and the bulk of the films best bits are without dialogue.<br/><br/>All in all Woman in Black is a superb horror film, and well worth a watch. It's a nice break to have a horror film, whose interest isn't to splatter blood and guts everywhere. It's the perfect antidote to the Hostel's and Saw's out there."

","I recently watched this movie, with a couple of friends. We all decided to watch it after hearing that it was really scary. They weren't wrong. This film had the whole audience screaming in fear. This film had many scares and jumps thy scare you. What I also like, I that you don't see most of the scares coming. <br/><br/>The plot is about a young man, Arthur Kipps (Radcliffe) travelling to a village where he meets a terrorising killer ghost ( the Woman in Black). This ghost is probably one of the scariest ghosts in all of film mainly because it kills children. It doesn't just ""kill"" children, it forces them to kill themselves in brutal ways. Another thing, I felt, was that the ghost was in most of the scenes, even though it shouldn't really be there, I found this mysterious and creepy. I enjoyed watching the character Daily (Ciarán Hinds), who doesn't believe in the ghost. I felt that he was a warm kind character who was pleasant to watch. Another thing I loved were the creepy antique dolls that felt alive and watching everything happen. By the end of the film I didn't know whether to feel happy for Arthur or sad. <br/><br/>This is a great British horror film that will make you jump and has plenty of scares and shocks. I hope this film gets great reviews and you should watch it."

","THE WOMAN IN BLACK (2012) *** Daniel Radcliffe, Ciaran Hinds, Janet McTeer, Misha Handley, Jessica Raine, Sophie Stuckey, Shaun Dooley, Mary Stockley, Alexia Osbourne, Alfie Field, Victor McGuire, Cathy Sara, Tim McMullan. Old-fashioned ghost story told with panache in a return to form for Hammer Films with Radcliffe giving an excellently haunted turn as a bereaved widowed attorney in early turn-of-the 20th Century England who is sent to resolve a real estate brokerage where the mansion in question is, natch, haunted by a vengeance seeking ghost leaving its hamlet quavering in her bloody wake. Excellent production design by Kave Quinn is the real stand-out in this otherwise familiar but well told genre flick thanks to Jane Goldman's screenplay adaptation of Susan Hill's novel and James Watkins'direction skillfully gets the viewer on edge particularly the nerve-shredding sequence in which Radcliffe explores the manor in the pitch black with sights and sounds lurking every corner!"
"williamzim2000","10","2","6","5 February 2012"," Way above average, excellent, scary film.
","I'll be brief. I love horror films, but 95% of the time I'm disappointed because either the dialog is terrible, the casting is bad, or the acting is rancid. This film is excellent on all levels. Without giving you a summary of the plot, but just a heads up on weather or not this is worth going to see, the writing, art direction, casting and acting, all make for a really quality horror / ghost film. It may not be a landmark ""The Haunting"" (Robert Wise version, of course), but it comes close. And compared to the crap that Rogue Media puts out, or Michael Bay, or any of the other mainstream Hollywood horror Date Movies, this is miles above them. And, yes, it has some extremely scary scenes. This is the first horror film I've seen in years where I did not feel they played to the lowest common denominator. Your intelligence is respected, and that's refreshing."
"minerva114","9","2","6","5 February 2012"," Enjoyed it
","I am not a fan of scary or suspenseful movies but after watching Dan Radcliffe as HP for the last ten years, I wanted to see how well he did outside that realm. I wasn't disappointed in his acting. I liked the story and thought it progressed well. The house was very creepy and that was part of the excitement for me. I knew something was going to happen, it was just a matter of what and when. There were several moments where I jumped as I was surprised. The movie itself is not so creepy that young teens might be bothered by it. So I think it was a good choice in that regard for Daniel to do, knowing that most of his fans would want to see his first movie after Harry Potter. It was definitely enjoyable for those of us who do not frequent the horror movies."

","The Woman In Black is a great little unpretentious spook fest well worth your attention. It has a fine cast, evocatively interesting locations and sets and first rate cinematography. Most importantly director James Watkins has sensibly concentrated on slowly building an atmosphere of generally unseen dread and terror, rather than turning the film into some sort of special effects extravaganza. In this respect the film might be described as being a traditional ghost story, reinforced by the Edwardian English time setting of the piece. But this certainly is not to detract from the quality of this creepy tale of a young, recently widowed lawyer who travels to a remote village where he discovers the vengeful ghost of a scorned woman is terrorizing the locals.<br/><br/>Daniel Radcliffe well and truly casts aside his Harry Potter persona to play lawyer Arthur Kipps, still semi-depressed and mourning his young wife Stella, who died 4 years earlier giving birth to their son. The film is centred around his character and requires a great deal of adroit use of facial and body expressiveness, as he is the sole (human) character on screen for long periods. This is a movie, not over-burdened with reams of dialogue. Ciaran Hinds is on hand though, to give fine support playing local landowner Sam Daily, one of the few local people willing to assist Arthur attempt to complete his tasks for his London law firm, despite his family also being tragically affected by The Woman in Black.<br/><br/>The film was both a critical and commercial success and I have to admit I'm surprised James Watkins doesn't have a higher cinema profile, having only directed one feature since. He seems to have a strong understanding of what constitutes a good film, with an easily appreciated example, being the inclusion of the sad/happy ending, rather than just going for some sort of shock finale. Watching The Woman in Black may well see you adding a bit of colour to your regular movie diet."

It has so much tension, so much implied horror and some great, albeit too few scares. Radcliffe is excellent in the role, he's sincere and somehow innocent enough to fit the role incredibly well. Plaudits also to Janet McTeer, also excellent.<br/><br/>The production values are excellent, it's a beautiful looking film, it's eerie enough without being overdone, we don't have creaky doors or loose floorboards, just the right amount.<br/><br/>I thought the start was incredibly chilling, and helped to set the tone.<br/><br/>A truly excellent movie, a shame they had to follow it up with the slightly heavy handed second. 9/10"

","A perfect blend of mystery mixed with enough horror to feel the threat to the villagers and main characters alike. That being said, be forewarned of graphic violence (gore) involving young children. It's not gore for gore sake, like ""hatchet"" movies, but is necessary to the storyline. And let's face it, without some bloodletting it wouldn't be a horror movie. The look and feel, especially of the old mansion that can only be reached during low tide, sets the stage perfectly for spookiness. And, casting couldn't have been better suited for some excellent performances by Daniel Radcliffe, Ciaran Hinds, and many more. Is there some cheesness? Yes. Just a few intentional winks & nods to classic movies that I found to be amusing. (I.E. Not one hair moves while riding in a convertible, etc..).

There isn't much dialog or action, just good old-fashioned spooky atmosphere. Don't let it fool you - there are some genuinely good scares and creepy moment throughout!

"buddypatrick","3","1","2","3 March 2017"," A rather pointless film that didn't need to be made.
","If you have never seen a single horror film in your entire life, then perhaps the Woman in Black is for you; however even the average film goer can identify this is tired, worn out, done-to-death story we've seen hundreds - - if not thousands - - of times before. <br/><br/>The story is simple. In the superstitious turn of the 19th Century to the 20th Century, a solicitor/lawyer/whatever has business with a scary old house that local village people fear and believe to be haunted. It turns out the house is very much haunted by a ghost, a woman in black, who inflicts murder and grief upon the village folk because of her sons death at the house as Daniel Radcliffe's character discovers by snooping through desks and drawers whilst staying at the house. The plot escalates quickly, which leads one to believe a large portion of the script had been removed in the cutting room floor. Radcliffe's character catches on and becomes cluey all too soon into the story.<br/><br/>The only problem with this film that writes it off as a success is that it is so, so, so very unoriginal. I can't imagine how many times I've seen this type of story before; maybe I'm just neck deep into horror films but as previously suggested, even someone with the slightest idea of horror and thriller knows this textbook ghost story. There is nothing original about the film, which I could overlook if there were redeeming characteristics like a uniqueness in film making, musical composition or script writing but the Woman in Black falls flat in all aspects of this. Furthermore, the jump scares and attempt to create a sinister, spooky vibe are some what embarrassing.<br/><br/>With the overall film being taken into account, it isn't actually bad. The style is superb, with brilliant cinematography and quality acting (not so much on Radcliffe's behalf) and what I really liked about this movie is its location setting – the swampy causeway leading to Osea Island and the general countryside of Essex set a lovely and gloomy mood for the remaining hour and thirty minutes. <br/><br/>I would never recommend or even bring this title up in conversation, as I can think of plenty of other classic ghost story titles at the top of my head that are far more interesting than this brilliantly developed, but unforgivably run of the mill story."
"MaximumMadness","6","1","2","16 February 2017"," ""The Woman in Black""- Excellent atmosphere and an intriguing story are let-down due to a lackluster over-reliance on clichés and jump-scares. Adequate, but nothing special.
","It's sad that a film can do so much right... from sharp and crisp visual direction to wonderfully atmospheric and Gothic music to top- notch performances from a wildly talented cast... yet still come up short and even stale at times. But such is the case for 2012's ""The Woman in Black"", the second adaptation of a 1983 horror novella by author Susan Hill. While the film is certainly one of many strengths and is sure to raise some goosebumps from general audiences, the fact of the matter is that anyone with even a passing knowledge and appreciation of horror will likely recognize and bemoan the fact that the film falls into the same trappings and faults of many other modern releases- that being an over-reliance on the same old clichés that pollute the genre as a whole, and for its woeful over-reliance on jump-scares. <br/><br/>Still, the film is most definitely an enjoyable experience. It just falters a bit too often to be anything more than ""average"" and ""adequate."" Which is a shame, given the rampant talent that is obvious both on-screen and behind the camera.<br/><br/>In Edwardian era England, lawyer Arthur Kipps (Daniel Radcliffe) is dispatched to the town of Crythin Gifford, where he is set to work on the sale of a massive estate. However, not all is well in Crythin Gifford- and it soon becomes clear that a dark and vengeful specter of the past is haunting the town, claiming the lives of local children and driving them to commit suicide. And it is up to Arthur and his associates to solve the mystery and try and save the town from this vile entity... But at what cost?<br/><br/>Helmed by ""Eden Lake"" director James Watkins from a script by the ever-reliant Jane Goldman, I do think the movie has a lot going for it. Watkins has a very keen and wickedly stylish eye, and seems to relish in delivering the most wonderfully oppressive and dreary visuals possible. It's a very slick and moody film from an aesthetic standpoint, and I absolutely love the tone that Watkins establishes early on and builds off of with each passing scene. Goldman's script is generally tight, concise and moves at a fairly good pace, and her structure works well at building the mystery and suspense for much of the runtime. Add to that a genuinely disturbing and freakish musical score from the wonderful Marco Beltrami and a first-rate performance from star Daniel Radcliffe, and you should have a sure-fire winner.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, as I noted above... there's just too much of the same-old, same-old here to really get excited. What promises to be a tense and exciting supernatural horror in the first act quickly degenerates into a by-the-numbers thriller by the film's midway point. While I refuse to spoil any of the twists and turns of the tale, I will say that most fans of horror and suspense, or even people with the most basic interest in film structure will see everything coming from a mile away. It does take away some of the potential suspense, and outside of a generally surprising climax... most people will be able to call the shots way ahead of time. And then there's the jump-scares. My god... the jump-scares. It's really kind of irritating how so many modern- day films think that random jolts are a proper substitute for horror. Jump-scares are not, well, scary. They're startling. And their effect is only minimal and fleeting. They need to be earned and artfully used in moderation and in key-moments to be effective. And for the most part, they aren't earned and they most certainly aren't used in moderation here. You can't just keep throwing something in the audience's face over and over with a loud stinger and expect it to be ""good horror."" It really betrayed the genuinely and truly disturbing sequences of fear and anguish throughout the film. There are so many good and freakish sequences, that the random jumps that keep popping up end up dragging the whole film down. They cheapen the experience.<br/><br/>Still, it's not a total loss. The film is filled to burst with wonderful Gothic style, some fantastic sequences of dread and tragedy and admittedly a great turn from Radcliffe in one of his most notable roles outside of the ""Harry Potter"" universe. It might be pulled down a few pegs due to its admittedly large faults, but I think general audiences will get enough of a kick out of it to make it worth at least a rental. Just know that if you're a horror junkie or a genre enthusiast, this isn't really ""great horror."" This is ""popcorn horror"" for the masses.<br/><br/>I give ""The Woman in Black"" a ever-so-slightly above average 6 out of 10."
"alfiemachin","8","1","2","26 November 2016"," A classic story remade effectively
","In the modern time i struggle to find a genuinely terrifying and enjoyable film. This film is brilliant at creating with intense build ups and bone chilling scenes. As it follows the novel by the author Susan Hill, it gives its own twists to allow its own originality.So do not decline watching this film because you think you know what happens. CGI is used in many cases however it is not over used yet can look slightly silly in same cases. The figure of the woman was well portrayed as unknown and the pale scarred face was particularly sinister especially when it adapted into the environment of multiple scenes. The Gothic, Victorian theme gave it a constant feel of uneasiness and the atmosphere uplifted a very miserable emotion by using foggy,rainy weather and other atmospheric details. Daniel Radcliffe playing as the main character Arthur Kipps was a well developed character and showed great faces of fear and other emotions to analyse to you watching how he is feeling and also adds towards the extreme intensity of the film. At some point i do feel as if the music was slightly over the top especially to uproar jump scares.To conclude this, i believe this to be a very thrilling and scary movie which is unique in many ways. I would definitely recommend this to a horror or Gothic enthusiast."

"andrewshieh0712","7","1","2","25 July 2015"," The atmosphere is there, but all I get is jump scares, but not REAL scares.
","Woman in Black is an old-fashioned horror movie directed by James Watkins and starring Daniel Radcliffe. I've seen many reviews praising that it is very creepy and stylish but I don't think the Woman in Black is made for me. <br/><br/>The setting of the movie is around the late 19th century of a young lawyer is heading to a deceased house to sort out some stuff, and then unfortunate things start happening. Something that I like about this movie is its cinematography. Every shot in this movie really make you feel that you're in that period of time. I also like how the director moves the camera from the first person view which it tries to imitate the sight of Radcliffe. You know you are ready to expect an unexpected scare since the camera moves very slow. The house itself is also very terrifying. All of the things inside the house, including the strange dolls and the long, dark hallway all elevate the tension of the movie. <br/><br/>I do not mind all of the jump scares in the movie as long as they're used in the right time and place, but some jump scares are just cheap, especially in the first act of the movie. You got crows flying everywhere, or just random noises that just came out of nowhere. Something that I really do mind about the Woman in Black is that I'm confused with what direction it is going. You are been delivered some very creepy atmosphere every time is should be scary, but I think they could've given more especially when this is a slow- going movie, like very stuffy. We got to see Daniel Radcliffe walking through the hallway and exploring every room of this house, but as a whole you don't really get everything from the 25-minute walk-through. For example, you can see the shadows of the woman standing far from Radcliffe but that's all you're given in that scene. It could've given more to the audience. It's not scary to me, but just very creepy. All of the dolls and decorations help to build up the creepy atmosphere but not really a thing just scare you (except the jump scares).<br/><br/>I think that Woman in Black could've given as much terrifying scenes as its creepy atmosphere then this movie would just be incredible. Otherwise, the Woman in Black is just a very smooth, stuffy movie that has great performances, moody atmosphere, and stylish cinematography but lacks the most important element to become a horror movie - real excitements. I didn't really mind the ending but after the movie ends, the first thing popped in my mind is sigh... this is such a slow- going and stuffy movie! Maybe this kind of movie isn't made for me I guess."
"dfa120374","4","1","2","2 June 2015"," Another Below Average Supernatural Horror
","Woman in Black is another supernatural horror movie that looks far better in the trailers than what it actually is. Don't get me wrong, it's not an awful movie, but it's definitely nowhere near as good as what it is made out to be, and it was definitely a disappointment. It is a much slower-paced film as well, which I don't mind as long as there is enough to keep my interest, but there wasn't and it ended up feeling a bit like a chore just to get to the end.<br/><br/>Like I said, it's not an awful film and it is watchable, but apart from the odd few jump scares, sudden screaming ghostly faces (which is really becoming a huge cliché now), and a pretty decent creepy atmosphere, there wasn't really anything noteworthy about this film. Yes, the story was there and some decent acting was there, but the film lacked any real tension, originality, and moved extremely slow. These days, a horror movie can only rely on the plus points I mentioned for so long before it gets kind of boring and tedious as it lacks imagination, and Woman in Black falls into that category. The clichéd scares mentioned can be good in a film, but not when that's all that's relied on to carry it.<br/><br/>I did mention decent acting was here as well, but unfortunately not much of it came from Daniel Radcliffe as his performance overall was a bit wooden I thought. I don't mind Radcliffe at all (and I'm not afraid to admit that I enjoyed the Harry Potter films), but here his performance was just void of any real depth and was just a bit wooden, like I say.<br/><br/>The story was OK (which is one you have to pay attention to as well as you can become lost if you don't), but it wasn't really one that gripped you, or left you sitting on the edge of your seat in anticipation. Like all the other plus points, it was just OK.<br/><br/>Woman in Black is watchable and I'd recommend it if you haven't got anything else better to see and want to while away an hour and a half. Just don't expect anything that great is all."

It was great that the woman in black was never hidden, you always saw her and in some parts even her face, she was petrifying. I loved the ending, I think it tied the movie together really well, from all of the dead children on the train to Kipps and his son seeing his wife but no-one else, confirming that they were dead. All in all it was a fantastic movie that was great to watch, even though it scared the living daylights out of me."
"njs-55801","7","1","2","6 May 2015"," clever choice by Hammer, good career move by Daniel Radcliffe
","Hammer consolidates its return to horror film production and Daniel Radcliffe begins his post-Harry Potter career with this finely-crafted adaptation of Susan Hill's 1983 Gothic horror novel The Woman in Black. A cast of strong character actors, careful direction, beautiful cinematography and genuine scares come together to produce a subtle and satisfying film. Daniel Radcliffe stars as Arthur Kipps, haunted by a woman in white as well as a woman in black, a man empty inside since his wife's death until a routine solicitors job in the village of Crythin Gifford brings Kipps into contact with a vicious spirit whose undead rage ultimately gives him back everything he has lost.<br/><br/>The first ten minutes establishes much of the story to come and creates the anticipation that is part of the pleasure of watching a good ghost story. The opening scene is an eerie, wordless study of three little girls breaking off their dolls tea party to throw themselves out of a window; a light, ghostly quality is created by the colour scheme, mainly white, no primary colours, and the close-ups of the delicate dolls and teacups and the girls' paleness. It seems that someone else was in the room, by the way the girls all look up at the same spot and then look at the window. Something supernatural is present. When Arthur Kipps travels to Crythin Gifford we can anticipate the questions of what will happen to him there and will he survive.<br/><br/>Daniel Radcliffe gives a strong and convincing performance as Arthur Kipps, deep in mourning over the death of his wife in childbirth several years ago. Kipps is emotionally shut down, almost suicidal and haunted by visions of his wife, who is always dressed in white. This is a major change in story from the novel and the previous BBC movie and separates this version enough to give it a distinctive identity and make it more than a mere remake. It aligns the gloom within Kipps to the gloom he will soon encounter in Crythin Gifford; the presence of one ghostly woman, a woman he desperately wants, will soon be matched and opposed by another ghostly woman he does not want, providing a nice symmetry throughout the film and a resolution at the end when the one reunites him with the other.<br/><br/>Radcliffe plays a man under pressure from the start. As well as being severely depressed Kipps has unpaid bills and the threat of the sack hanging over him. His trip to Crythin Gifford is his last chance to save his job and the determination he shows in coping with events there gives a solidity and believability to Radcliffe's performance.<br/><br/>On the train to Crythin Gifford Kipps meets Sam Daily, played by Ciaran Hinds, in a solid support role. His part here as the older, wealthy local man set apart from the villagers not just by his status but also by his refusal to accept their superstitions makes him Kipps' ally, as the story needs at least one local on Arthur's side if he is to get anywhere; Hinds acts with certainty and seriousness, supporting Arthur throughout the story and trying to keep him sane. Sam Daily also has a ghost: a Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost which will play its part in unravelling the mystery.<br/><br/>It soon becomes clear that something is very wrong in the village and that it concerns the children. The local people are frightened and hostile and want to get rid of Kipps as soon as possible. Children are locked away after one little girl dies and Kipps seems to be blamed for this and possibly more. The film begins to take on the feel and tone of classic Hammer movies: the village with its dark secret, the old dark house/castle, the outsider who, joined by the local priest/older authority figure, has to fight the evil.<br/><br/>The significant ghostly action takes place when Kipps visits the house of his late client, Mrs Drablow, and begins to piece together her story. Mrs Drablow's unmarried sister had a son which the Drablows adopted and who died in marshland. The boy's natural mother, Jennet, went mad and hanged herself, blaming her sister for the boy's death. It is her spirit which haunts Eel Marsh House, taking the village children in revenge for her loss. Alarmingly, Kipps is bringing his own small son to the village in a few days and so the plot turns into a race against time as Kipps has to resolve the mystery and placate the spirit before his son falls victim.<br/><br/>The scenes with Kipps at the house are classic haunted house fare but very well done. Weird noises in the empty house, doors locked then unlocked, spectral faces and things glimpsed, the creepiness of old children's toys and visions of past victims all push Kipps to the edge but also towards a resolution. Daniel Radcliffe is great in these long scenes with no dialogue and he holds the attention through expressing Kipps' uncertainty in exploring the old dark house, his isolation and mounting terror as the spirits reveal themselves.<br/><br/>The ending brings the story of Arthur Kipps to a meaningful conclusion. Death at the hands of Jennet is not the triumph of her curse but the beginning of a new life with his woman in white. He is reunited with his wife and finally finds the fulfilment lacking in his mortal life. The scene avoids sentimentality by keeping it brief and understated: there's a smile and they walk off into the mist, proving that, handled properly, there's nothing wrong with a happy ending. The woman in black remains locked up in Eel Marsh House. Her rage is unabated, her desire for revenge continues – because she is dead it can never end."

"eddie052010","4","1","2","10 August 2014"," Not as scary as you've been lead to believe.
","The state of horror films these days is quite poor, as nowadays horror films are less about build-up, good characters and true scares and rather hateful teenagers, jump scares and poor plotting. Would this film, with it's healthy budget, acclaimed source material and the newly reformed Hammer backing it, break this mold? Unfortunately no, as despite positive critic reviews and great box office, this film is quite poor with poor production and nothing vaguely scary. <br/><br/>The plot is that a young lawyer called Arthur Kipps has a new assignment: to try to sell a house that has been abandoned for some time. The problem is that the village around the house starts acting strangely when he arrives and the house is haunted by a ghost who curses those who enter with a terrible fate. While the plot does sound creepy initially and there are occasional moments in the film that take advantage of this (mainly the brilliant opening scene), these moments are few and far between, and there isn't much interesting material in between these moments that make the film worth watching. <br/><br/>One of the reasons for this is the lack of any originality in the film's setting. I understand that both the film and the book that it was based on is meant to be told in a manner similar to a traditional Gothic tale, and I can respect that. The problem is that it sticks too close to these roots and because of this offers nothing new to this genre. This is highlighted with how the aforementioned haunted house is literally an amalgamation of every haunted house cliché in existence. You have the chairs rocking on their own, family pictures with the eyes scratched out, very dark rooms, a graveyard containing the villain's coffin, the list goes on and on. It honestly feels very derivative, and it ruins any atmosphere that the film wanted to make.<br/><br/>Other reasons for this are in the screenplay itself. Outside of the haunted house clichés, there are many other problems. One of these are the major plot holes which undermine the story's serious tone, with the main ones being why no-one is leaving this town if it is cursed by a ghost who kills their children and how Arthur doesn't depart also, despite how everyone is acting weirdly towards him and acting like they've got something to hide, similarly to how the people of Summerisle act towards Police Sergeant Neil Howie in the original Wicker Man. However there it made sense why Howie didn't leave: he was a police officer on a murder investigation, however Kipps is a lawyer trying to sell a house. Not very comparable is it? <br/><br/>It also isn't very scary, as the title villain isn't in the movie much , and even when she is, her moments of glory are very brief to the point that if you blink, you'll miss it. For most of the time, exposition tells you about her and what she can do, which isn't very scary at all. I understand that what you don't see is scarier , but in order to make her somewhat threatening, show us what see can do, don't keep telling us, as after a while, it gets pretty boring as you're essentially being lectured about the monster rather than being terrified by it. It is honestly one step away from reading the bleeding book.<br/><br/>It isn't enough to say that this is build up either, as good horror films may not show much of the monster through a lot of the running time, but they gave you enough to reward your patience but still keep you curious, and at least showed you the monsters by the end in their full glory, whereas this film doesn't even give you that luxury. At least in Alien and Cloverfield, the monsters at least had an original and interesting design, which made you feel rewarded for your pateince. This film's villain on the other hand is a woman in a black wedding veil. Fail. All of this reduces any menace that the villain has. Considering that it's victims are mainly children, that is quite an astonishing feat. <br/><br/>All of these script problems are surprising, considering how great a writer Jane Goldman is as shown by films like X-Men First Class and Kick-Ass. It does show a lack of experience for her, which is excusable considering that this is her first horror film. This inexperience is shared by director James Watkins, which is far less excusable considering that he has worked in the horror genre (director of Eden Lake, writer of The Descent Part 2) before. Sure, he gets good performances from his actors but the film is poorly directed, from the lack of menace from the villain, the fact that the kills get less and less scary as the film goes on, poor atmosphere and the fact that many scenes are very poorly lit (I know the film has black in the title, but this is just ridiculous). Sure, it's not as bad as Monsters, where vital scenes are shot in pitch blackness, but it does recall Spinal Tap, as you ask yourself: ""How much more black could this be?"" And the answer is none. It is honestly a horror film so shoddily made that it makes the low budget horror film Creep look like a professional job by comparison. <br/><br/>Overall, this is just a badly made & badly written horror film. Sure it isn't as poisonously bad as The Village and Paranormal Activity, but it is still pretty poor and gives the British film industry a bad name. If this is one of the newly reformed Hammer Studio's tent-poles, then they have clearly lost their way from their much better 50's-70's days of horror."

","Mercilessly slow and derivative thriller has a young widower lawyer in London traveling on business to a remote village on the muddy marsh to settle estate papers on a deceased client; turns out the whole terrified town is helplessly under the thumb of a suicide's ghost bent on revenge. Handsomely photographed in a gloom-and-doom manner--much like ""The Others"", which, I'm guessing, was purely intentional--this haunted mansion vehicle for a grown-up Daniel Radcliffe begins well but quickly flags. The pointless story, adapted from a novel by Susan Hill, treads too-familiar territory, while director James Watkins paces the proceedings like a funeral (with 'scare' music cues to add intensity). Radcliffe is a sturdy lad, but his face holds no mystery, and his voice doesn't command attention; he spends most of the picture reacting to ghostly comings-and-goings with his eyes wide and his mouth partially ajar. The finale, which would appear to wrap the plot up satisfactorily, is given a last-minute twist which is neither scary nor moving--just confounding. What will it take the appease this woman in black? And does anybody care? *1/2 from ****"

After 5 minutes, I really didn't see him as the Harry anymore.<br/><br/>I don't think this movie should be categorized as a horror, but more as an old-fashioned ghost story like they were made ​​in earlier years. It's more something like ""The Changeling"" and consorts. All the classic elements are reflected in this film: the lugubrious face watching from an attic window, the rocking chair, the wet footprints, the toys that start playing on their own, the footsteps in the attic, the candles blowing out suddenly, the long dark corridor and the shadows. All this placed in an ""Addams Family""-stylish old building with miles of thick layers of dust and cobwebs. The ideal setting for a classic haunted house like at the fancy-fair.<br/><br/>The complete story is put together nicely .. and yes I would have moved away from that village already a long time. The funny thing in such movies is that even though the protagonist realizes that he's dealing with spirits, he always closes a door as a defense.<br/><br/>It was a pretty exciting movie with some scare moments in it. Not the I-jump-almost-to-the-ceiling moments, but surely there were some damn-I-almost-choked-in-my-chips moments.<br/><br/>OK, the ending was predictable. It was obvious that Arthur would join his wife in the afterlife together with his son.

","Daniel Radcliffe has not improved as an actor, in fact his character was highly unbelievable, as with all his acting he showed little or no emotion in facial expressions or body language. As for the film itself,I found it lacked the charm at the beginning and the terror and the chills the stage play at the West End has. Parts of the film I found myself thinking how many other ways they could have conducted the film, to make it a lot scarier. I felt it ruined the film being able to see the Woman in Black up close as it lessened the horror and impact of it. I also felt the suspense was poor and rather predictable, such as the scene with the mirror... If you want to see a good chilling production of this I would recommend seeing the one a the fortune theatre in London. It was lot scarier and far more impacting imo."
"maurice-minor","3","1","2","11 August 2012"," A massive missed opportunity
","The ingredients were there to make a film equal to The Innocents or The Haunting, or even equal to the original television adaptation. However, they seem to have gone overboard on CGI and given in to a 21st century need to explain everything, even to the point of changing the original book, in order to satisfy some target audience they have identified. But their target audience would appear to be one they don't trust to make their own mind up about what is scary.<br/><br/>There was so much monochrome CGI work it may as well have been shot in black and white - the original version managed to portray 'forboding' and 'bleak' without painting everything grey; its a pity the makers this time took the easy way out. They seem to have lost any trust in their audience - no matter whether any suspense had been built up or not, the ghost arrived with a shattering BANG in the musical score and a loud scream - thats not sinister, ghostly, eerie or particularly scary; thats just making people jump for the sake of it, as if they had no confidence in an audience losing themselves to suspense. Once is fine, but 5 or 6 times? A deserted house is scary, an ominous shadowy figure in black is scary - yet they abandoned any attempt create unease by using the ingredients they already had and just went for a loud shock.<br/><br/>But the biggest let down was the final twenty minutes or so. This being made in the 21st century we are presented with a Victorian man deciding that of course the ghost actually needs 'closure'. The following scenes are ludicrous, rather pointless and have been added purely for this film. The final scene fails completely; there are so many problems with it that its amazing it wasn't re-shot.<br/><br/>Overall it comes across as a film written and made by people who have no idea about suspense or horror; its modern film making by numbers. This could have been an instant classic, but as it is, its no better than the likes of Final destination 3."

","""Never forgive.<br/><br/>A young lawyer (Daniel Radcliffe), widowed from the day of his child's birth, leaves his young son for a few days in London in order to handle the sale of a house in a small village. The villagers are less than welcoming, and the more time he spends there, the more he learns a the tragedy that has and continues to befall the children of the village... and the more he may be putting his own son's life in danger. <br/><br/>The Woman in Black is a frustrating movie. For every interesting story turn, there's an irritating flaw that keeps it from being as good as it could have been. My biggest peeve rests on the film's over-reliance on jump scares. They're used so often and predictably that they mostly ruin the effect that the creepy environments manage to muster. It just destroys the immersion factor in a movie for me when there's a loud bang and something suddenly appears in the frame over and over and over. <br/><br/>On the positive side, the period setting is a nice change of pace, the story does unravel in an interesting way, and Racliffe does a decent job (though a lot of the time he's just gazing somberly off in the distance or resolutely investigating a suspicious noise, on the way to his next jump scare). <br/><br/>The Woman in Black isn't bad, it just doesn't do enough to make itself stand out amongst a dozen supernatural thrillers, and it relies far too much on scare tactics that annoy me far more than they spook me. I don't mean to dissuade anyone from seeing it who's interested, just temper your expectations."

"Coventry","5","1","2","19 March 2012"," Graduated ""Cum Laude"" from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft; now onwards to mature Gothic horror?
","Unfortunately I didn't manage to see the obscure 1989 version of the same story prior to watching this multi-budgeted and heavily marketed version at the cinema. That film, although a modest TV-production, is allegedly an atmospheric and creepy, yet sadly neglected gem of British horror that brings full and proper homage to Susan Hill's novel. I'm actually willing to believe that ""The Woman in Black"" has more impact in a modest TV-format because it's (and I certainly don't mean any disrespect) a rather simplistic and lightweight ghost story. The concept is chilling and unsettling, but not particularly innovative, so director James Watkins (who put himself on the horror map with the grisly shocker ""Eden Lake"") tries to impress the demanding nowadays audience with advanced digital effects, a detailed recreation of the Victorian era and the casting of the immensely popular Daniel Radcliffe in his first lead role after the ""Harry Potter"" cycle. Radcliff depicts Arthur Kipps; a notary clerk still mourning over his lost wife who died four years ago whilst giving birth to their son. Kipps is sent to a remote and extremely superstitious little village to collect all the required documents to establish the final testament of a deceased Aristocrat lady. Her mansion is located in the middle of a swamp, only accessible via a road during low tide, and avoided by the locals because of a curse. They believe the swamp house is still haunted by the woman in black. According to the legend this restless spirit was once forced to give up her child due to poverty, yet the wealthy foster parents didn't take proper responsibility and they boy drowned in the swamp. Now, whenever someone witnesses the mourning lady in black standing in the cemetery, a random and innocent child will die. When a young girl does, in fact, die shortly after Kipp's arrival, the entire town aggressively turns against him. The premise of a ghostly apparition endlessly avenging his/her own unprocessed trauma is efficient but, as said already, not exactly original. Regardless of what point we are in the movie, you can always predict what will happen next. Of course the life of Kipp's own son will be at stake, and of course he will (fruitless) attempt to set right the mistake of others in the past. Furthermore, and this is a rookie mistake I didn't expect from James Watkins, ""The Woman in Black"" really goes overkill with the false scares and misleading jump-moments. For nearly three quarters of the running time, the script simply goes ""boo!"" through suddenly appearing faces and birds unexpectedly flying out of chimneys. Luckily enough I can confidently state that the budget got well spent. The decors, costumes and set pieces look astounding and the whole film is actually a respectful tribute to British horror of the 1960's and 1970's, particularly Hammer films who are making a comeback and co-produced this one! And, definitely worth mentioning as well, Daniel Radcliff's performance is stellar. With a few more mature and versatile roles like this on his repertoire, he might be able to wash off his cherubic Harry Potter image after all."
"ElMaruecan82","6","1","2","18 March 2012"," As scary as a 'Ghost Train' ride ...
","At first sight, James Watkins' film looks formatted to please an audience thirsty for thrills and heart-pounding experiences, it stars Daniel Radcliffe, Harry Potter in a first adult-to-be- taken-seriously role (and as a matter of fact, I did took him seriously) and the title is perfect to convey both a sensation of fear or mystery, I wish it could have been more original than ""The Woman in Black"" but as an audience-pulling title, it's perfectly marketed.<br/><br/>Now, reviewing ""The Woman in Black"" is quite a challenge as far as objectivity is concerned. As a horror film, it did one hell of a job because it truly scared the hell out of me, but as one IMDb user pointed out, there is a huge difference between making someone jump out of his seat and actually scaring him. By the way, I couldn't believe a veteran critic like Roger Ebert missed those tricks, so blatantly overused, well a bit too much in a film that tries to use some sophistication in an Edwardian English setting (I would have said Victorian until I noticed there were cars). ""The Woman in Black"" should have inspired a delightful to read cynical review, but he sounds satisfied then allow me to more bitter. It's not against the film, overall, it was short enough not to become quickly unbearable.<br/><br/>The problem in ""The Woman in Black"" is that the film succeeds in creating a harrowing and haunting atmosphere, and Daniel Racliffe's performance carries the fears and the interrogation of the typical protagonist who doesn't know where he's putting his foot in but must do it because it's part of his mission. So, for a film that had all the technical predispositions to be a great mystery thriller, cinematography, directing, acting and editing, I couldn't believe it would go for so many cheap attempts to scare audience regardless of the context and the content of the story. On that level, ""The Woman in Black"" was as scary as a ghost train, where most of the frights and shocks rely on the surprise effect, as efficient as they are predictable, which cancels out the merit of the film.<br/><br/>Indeed, watching ""The Woman in Black"" made me realize how it was easy to scare people, I can't count how many persons in the theater screamed and I almost had to cover my eyes at some parts of the film, not because I was genuinely scared but because I knew something was going to happen, yes it was scary but when you expect to be scared, the whole experience consists on not being surprised by a disturbing image that just pops up in the screen. It's just as if James Watkins, the director (so you can remember his name), took to its fullest the overused concept of some Youtube videos: a quiet and comforting moment and then suddenly, a screaming face appears to instantly increase your heart pulses, an idea already based on the 'ghost train' principle.<br/><br/>And what's even worse for the film's attempts to scare its audience is in the setting of the haunted mansion, so full of weird and hard to watch objects, so ugly that it only takes a close-up or a sudden shot on one of them to perturb the audience. All the mechanical toys, dolls and automatons seem to belong to the house for the only purpose of 'appearing', nothing else justifies their presence, at one point, one appears inoffensive and then it starts playing drums so suddenly that again, we wonder why Watkins didn't trust his story's own material. Well, the monkey playing drums had its effect okay, but was Watkins so desperately eager to scare us that he needed to let one whole sequence relying on that.<br/><br/>""The Woman in Black"" doesn't trust its own potential, and never gives enough credit to their characters, nor does it trust our intelligence. The film evolves in such an enigmatic atmosphere that we have no clue about what's going on. But it's part of the genre and we expect a mind-blowing experience coming near the end, until the protagonist, his name was Kipps (I had to check as I totally forgot about it after the film) enters the haunted house, and we start to make some vague correlations between the presence of a ghostly figure, a woman in black screaming like a vulgar subliminal Internet-prank image, and a series of disturbing children's deaths, and their deaths would be indeed efficient if the build-ups were not so overdone.<br/><br/>Anyway, before this review starts to sound too cynical, I want to point out that anything beyond what I said worked decently. I was amazed by Daniel Radcliffe's photogenic look, convincing as a tormented soul with a wound in his heart, the atmosphere of the film have some reminiscent shots of ""The Shining"", like the long and tortuous road that lead to the land where Kipps had to work on the estate. And the hostility of the population nicely contrasted with his interesting friendship with a rich landowner named  whatever. Anyway, near the center of the film, the story started to be easier to follow and not uninteresting. A feeling that doesn't last unfortunately when it starts to scare for the sake of scares.<br/><br/>Is it me or I feel like I'm repeating myself? Well, I guess it's time for me to conclude by saying that the film had quite a powerful ending that seemed to belong to another film. If ""The Woman is Black"" had the same gripping intensity than the last scene, it would have made so many cheap tricks like the overuse of shadows, the ominous music and the whole subliminal startling moments totally needless. ""The Woman in Black"" is not a bad film, but unfortunately falls too much in the category of exercises in style and  to use in my turn an overused line, with no substance."
"uly_xx","4","1","2","6 March 2012"," Really nothing new. It's a standard ghost mystery with obligatory startles.
","The movie's story line wasn't really anything new or memorable after i left the theater. The only thing believable was the setting and time it took place (I have to give proper compliments to the art direction responsible for the settings, environments and special effects crew). The screen play and build up to the climax wasn't anything to get thrilled or scared about for me. If you have seen The Grudge or The Ring, its easy to find the Woman in Black as just a matinée movie or a movie you can borrow from some one else who owns it. <br/><br/>As the story developed to the point when I fully understood why the unfortunate events were unfolding, I still couldn't even feel bad for majority of the characters who had encountered the Woman in Black. I simply could not bond with them. The only character that actually appeared to be a real person was Ciarán Hind's role, whom i actually was curious how his character played in the story. For the supporting character, he drove the movie for me to actually wonder why and how events were unfolding for the brief moments it captured my attention. As for Daniel Radcliffe role, it was not a very likable one for me. Majority of the time he was honestly just walking a slow pace TOWARDS the danger with a candle that never melts in practically 1/3 of the movie. The only thing positive about his role was that i didn't see him as Harry Potter, but this not a break out role for him either. The scenes of him walking in the house were painfully long for me while expecting the traditional violin notes played to build the tension and then BAM!...<br/><br/>...a cliché something jumping towards the camera. Like i didn't see that coming. Sigh.<br/><br/>The only that was surprising was the ending as it was different FOR the movie, but not anything you will take home and feel different about."
"aditsecret","7","1","2","29 February 2012"," Dan the Man in ""The Woman in Black""
","So finally the wait is over. The question that has been eating every Harry Potter movie franchise fan,hollow, is finally laid to rest. The question in question is ""What happens to our boy wizard post Hogwarts School of witchcraft and wizardry"". It's a natural question because, over the years people have literally grown up with the trio of Harry, Ron and Hermione. So, more than the excitement about the celluloid adaptation of the horror novel ""The Woman in Black"" ,it was this childish curiosity which drew me to catch Dan Radcliffe's next outing on the big screen. <br/><br/>Set in the Edwardian era (my 2nd favorite era after the Victorian one) the movie opens into foggy and murky environs of the city of London. Radcliffe portrays the role of Arthur Kipps, a widower and the father of an angelic 4 yr. old boy. It's as if the foggy weather outside is the depiction of the turmoil and murkiness in his life;Kipps an emerging lawyer is sent to a seemingly harmless assignment to handle the estate of one Alice Drablow, owner of an English manor known as the Eel Marsh House. The manor is located on a desolate island in the marshes as opposed to verdant locales of the English countryside, which just enhances the clouds of eeriness that shroud the movie throughout. As fate would have it, this harmless assignment turns out be a perilous one and one which tests Kipps to the hilt. As if a village run over by superstitions and small kids committing hara-kiri weren't enough, he has to lock horns with the curse of a mysterious lady in black and in the process muster all the courage deep down in labyrinth of his mind as a part of a plot which finally becomes a fight to save his child. What provides him solace throughout the movie are the visions of his wife every now and then in her wedding gown, his lady in white,if you will. <br/><br/>The director James Watkins maintains a solid hold on the movie and the final product, if not edge of the seat stuff, is gripping enough to grab the attention of the viewer. The whole movie has the look of a good old fashion horror flick. Be it the macabre environs of the haunted and dilapidated mansion, or the scares conjured in good measure by the mysterious lady in black who sneaks up on you every now and then for some seat popping moments .Add to the above, creepy toys, toddlers walking away in deep trance, the rocking chair and above all the indispensable black crow and you have one hell of a chills inducing department. <br/><br/>Now coming to the performances of the cast. First up is our protagonist. As stated earlier, Radcliffe carries a sombre and pensive demeanour throughout the flick. He shows just the right amount of understatement and restrain demanded by the role and boy does,Dan emerge with flying colors in the end. He fits into the shoes of a difficult role with ease just like an experienced campaigner (well with 8 HP films behind him,I shouldn't call him that). It's very easy to over do your part in such a role and appear wooden when it comes to showing a glimpse of those hidden emotions, but with his grimness and pensiveness in culmination with scattered outbursts of emotions one can't help but take away an image of Arthur Kipps and not harry potter when you finally exit the movie hall. As for the rest of cast, nobody else has enough screen time to make an impact except for the woman in black(Liz White) who sans any dialog manages to make an impression, a shuddering one at that. You wish the Dailys(Ciarán Hinds as Sam Daily and Janet McTeer as Elizabeth Daily) had more screen time; otherwise they carry out their parts with panache and in sync with the demands of the film. <br/><br/>So, in the end what you have is a satisfying enough horror mystery which I must say is good adaption of the novel. Adapting a novel to screen is a precarious task and difficult to pull off and the final product as conjured up by Watkins looks good. Credit to the able screenplay and direction, Watkins and his team concoct a ""just about there"" flick and upliftingly enough for potter fans Radcliffe packs quite a punch with his commendable performance, but still looks too young to play a father. <br/><br/>In my case I couldn't help but wipe a tear a or two off my eyes as I left the theatre brimming with emotions and sighing ""our lil wizard has finally grown up"""

Wasn't sure about Radcliffe but I was willing to give it a chance, and I am now prepared to say I was wrong to doubt him. He carries this film extremely well and I totally forgot he was Harry Potter in former life. Fair enough there were a few 'wooden' moments but in all, his expressions and acting was faultless. The movie itself was at just the right pace. An eerie slow burner, making the audience tense and always looking for when the next scare will be. There were a fair few jump moments that many people criticised but for me, they were needed in a film like this. There were plenty of eerie spine chilling moments too that didn't need the use of a jump scare, so they evened each other out.<br/><br/>It was pretty loyal to the book, apart from a few minor details, and of course the ending is totally different. But the premise of the movie stayed the same. The ending for me was a good idea, but it lacked the shock factor that I believe it needed for my 8/10 to rise to 9/10. It left me feeling a little disappointed.<br/><br/>The sets, scenery, acting and the house especially were fantastic. The woman also doesn't disappoint. When seen, she got the whole Cinema screaming, something I have never seen in a Cinema ... Even Paranormal Activity 1 & 2.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie was very good. Didn't scare me, but it certainly made me jump and gave me the creeps. Disappointed with the ending, but there were plenty of well done scenes (Rocking Chair moment especially) to make up for it."

","How is that supposed to be a horror? First of all the main character is stupid because people say if you go here bad things will happen so what does he do? He goes there... smart, well done mate. Therefore has a very weak plot line.<br/><br/>There is also terrible direction in this title, as every single moment in the film that is meant to be a jump scare, or just a scary moment in general, is easily predictable and obvious at every turn.<br/><br/>This film is also very boring.

","I remember this movie as the first thing Daniel Radcliffe did after Harry Potter, and we were all keen to see it. He was good! I've just seen The Woman In Black for the second time. I'd forgotten how really creepy it is. Set in the late 19th century was creative and wise. Full marks to the costume and props department. The house hovers between just lived in and abandoned, it's fantastic, and very haunting. Full marks for location too. All the actors are excellent. Daniel's character is deep and, importantly, brave. The filmmaker did a great job with lighting, film angles, atmosphere, framing, sound, etc, and there is a good hour of some really spine-tingling stuff. I had to dock it a couple of points for the ending, and having said that I'll have to press the spoiler button. Without spelling it out, well, it just didn't make sense after all he'd seen and been through. That's becoming a bit of a gripe with me. Too often in movies there is an important story detail that is just illogical as far as ordinary, responsible behaviour is concerned, and no one could accuse Daniel's character of irresponsibility. It didn't make sense and thus you are disappointed. Coming in at the climax, well, to be honest, lucky for the writer/Director team I'm only docking the two points. In my mind I made an adjustment and invented my own ending. It was too good a story to spoil it with an illogical ending."

The entire film, shot on 16mm film and shot on location is scary from start to end. The story is already pretty well known- A young solicitor is invited to a far flung location to see a strange happening: A female ghost terrorizing the land. It is based on a novel and a famous Daniel Radcliffe version was also made recently in 2012, but this is the film to watch in my opinion."

The actors are good and help with inciting fear into the viewers. From the beginning of the movie you can feel the mood of the ton and the setting of the movie which is great. It would have got 1 more star if the scares had more diversity. I really like this movie and think it is good , because it is good and i enjoyed how all the characters were so different. I like when i get scared because it is funny. I also enjoyed the scares because they scared my mum. My dad did not like this movie as much because he is big strong and tough.

","Daniel Radcliff has become synonymous with Harry Potter since its transfer to the big screen. Understandably, now he's too old for the part and the franchise is over, he's looking to move on to other things and shed his 'boy wizard' image. In The Woman in Black, he plays a young lawyer in the nineteen century who comes a cropper with some nasty ghosts.<br/><br/>First of all, well done to the film-makers for getting Daniel Radcliff in the film to begin with. I hear he doesn't come cheap. However, this is the film's main selling point, i.e. yes it's Harry Potter not playing Harry Potter for the first time. Unfortunately, competent actor that Daniel Radcliff is, he just comes across as too damn young to play the part.<br/><br/>Although, if that was the film's only let-down, I could probably suspend my disbelief and just go with it. But no. The film's main problem is that it's simply not scary. There are a few bits that will make you jump, but that's about it - 'spooky' comes in the form of (normally) inanimate objects suddenly moving, i.e. a rocking horse, a music box, a children's stuffed toy and so on.<br/><br/>It manages to borrow bits from other horror movies, like The Ring, but the fact is, it's very slow and not particular interesting. It's not really Radcliff's fault - a fair portion of the story involves him spending his time just wandering round empty buildings looking scared. During these scenes, he has no one to play off and you just find yourself waiting for whatever is going to creepily move to do so and offer the 'scare scene.'<br/><br/>Good luck to Radcliff in shedding his wizard image. This film will go some way to showing he can do more than just ride a broomstick. Trouble is, he's in a scary film that's just not scary."
"alexanna95","9","1","3","24 October 2014"," A surprisingly good and scary cliché
","I didn't expect much of this film. I had never before seen Daniel Radcliffe play any other character than Harry Potter, and a story about an old, haunted mansion sounded very clichéd and used. I was to be pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>The film itself was indeed full on clichés including an angry ghost seeking for revenge, ghostly children and a haunted house. The plot was well-constructed, though, which expertly built up tension throughout the whole film. I'm not usually easily scared when I watch horror films, but I watched this alone in the night and I have to admit I was chewing my nails in an excited burst of terror when Radcliffe's character was alone in the mansion with all the dead children outside. Maybe it's not that scary during the day, but it certainly gave me the chills in a pitch-dark room! I also have to applaud the acting. Daniel Radcliffe nailed the role of Arthur Kipps in my opinion, and the rest of the cast did a very nice job as well.<br/><br/>The film does have its flaws and many clichés, but it is a nice break from all the blood and guts we see in horror films nowadays. It's not a masterpiece but definitely worth watching."
"guillermobosque","8","1","3","8 October 2014"," The Woman in Black is an old-fashioned horror film with a well handled suspense.
","Summary: The Woman in Black is an old-fashioned horror film with a well handled suspense. 82/100 (B+)<br/><br/>The Woman in Black is directed by James Watkins and it's a remake of the eponymous 1989 movie based on the book by Susan Hill. Moving on, the opening scene is strange and creepy, I liked it. Anyway, I have to admit that the first act was kinda slow and a little bit boring. Surprisingly, the second half is more violent, intense and suspenseful. Also, I liked the performances, Daniel Radcliffe performs a single dad called Arthur Kipps and another standout performances were from Ciarán Hinds and Janet McTeer. I also loved the old-fashioned style of the film, it has a splendid selection of period furniture and costume design.<br/><br/>The Woman in Black boasts an impressive level of terror, the atmosphere of the film is frightening and most of the scares were unpredictable. Also, the sound effects were terrific and so well done. It has no gore, but instead of that, it delivers so many effective scares, I almost died! There was enough originality on its surprises. Even though I have to admit that this horror movie is more of the same crap, I mean: the loud noises, things moving by itself and creepy shadows; still scary as hell! Yeah, it doesn't offer something new to the horror genre, but still terrifying. Also, the stunning camera work increases the dread at times.<br/><br/>I'm glad that Watkins decided to use practical effects instead of cheap CGI. The Woman in Black is a movie that does not look crappy or cheaply done. In spite of its modest budget, the production was splendid. Moving on, as I said above the film counts with a very creepy sound design, the loud noises are constant but they came at the right times and efficiently. I saw this film in the morning and it scared the crap out of me, my point here is that it doesn't matter if you see it during the day or at night, it will scare the hell out of you. Watkins proves that he is a talented director and I just hope to know more about him soon. What a horror flick!<br/><br/>On the upside: the ending was strangely awesome, the house is creepy as hell (the rooms and empty hallways add some spookiness to the film), it has excellent performances and the production design was great. On the downside: a few jump-scares were unnecessary and the first 30 minutes are boring as hell. So, in conclusion, I recommend it for horror fans and non-horror fans. Woman in Black is an audience pleaser and the perfect film to watch with some friends at night. Although it doesn't offer something fresh or new to the genre, it keeps the tension for most of the time and there's a very scary sequence at the first 50 minutes. (B+)"
"Lejink","7","1","3","12 September 2014"," Hammer House of Horror
","Years ago I saw the long-running play of this film but so long ago as to forget almost everything but the scary face of the Woman herself, so it was great to sit in late of a night and let Hammer films scare me once again with a traditional haunted house tale.<br/><br/>Shot in a washed-out, almost monotone kind of colour - scheme, this was a well-paced and beautifully filmed movie, in particular the house interiors and the spectacular views of the desolate, tide-covered road leading up to it. Daniel Radcliffe returns to the supernatural to play a recently widowed young solicitor tasked with investigating the papers attendant on a recent death at said house, only this time he has no magic powers to assist him. In truth he's way too young for the part, especially with a five-year-old looking son in tow, but he otherwise cuts an effectively gaunt figure facing up to the enmity of the village for disturbing the old ghost, who every time she's seen prefigures the death of a young child. <br/><br/>As is the norm in films of this type, despite experiencing some very strange goings on at his first visit to the house, he nonetheless decides to not only return but to stay over alone (bar an accompanying dog) when he could just as easily have had all the relevant papers transported to the inn where he's staying.<br/><br/>Suspense is built up nicely for the fright-scenes with subjective camera shots, flash cuts and an atmospheric music score. There's worthy support for Radcliffe especially from Ciaran Hinds and Janet McTeer as the wealthy couple also struck down by the curse. It all comes to the boil with an unexpectedly callous but in the end appropriate climax, as you realise that Radcliffe and his son could never be happy as they were anyway.<br/><br/>In short, a rattling good ghost story, just like Hammer used to make."
"keenan328","7","1","3","7 August 2014"," Slow start, but very solid, old fashioned ghost story
","First of all, forget the rating system on IMDb. I rate by genre. How can I compare this movie to a classic like To Kill a Mockingbird? Impossible. The Haunting (from 1963) would be a TEN in the Ghost Story category. In my opinion, movies like Poltergeist would be a 4, whereas Insidious maybe a 5. I am hoping that there are movies I haven't seen (due to research on IMDb) that would fall even lower on a rating scale of this nature. I must point out that I have NEVER seen a Harry Potter film, so no prejudice here. Except for the aforementioned Haunting, not too many movies would hit the Hall-of-Fame numbers of 9 and 10, but The Woman in Black dares to hand out enough chills and thrills to creep very close to such a lofty ranking. Except for a VERY slow start to the film, this movie ranks right up there with the best that I have seen when it comes to ghosts and spirits. A couple of cheap BOO moments, but that has to be expected. By having the movie take place in the early 20th century and in good old foggy England, you don't have to deal with cell phones and home video to ruin the story. Wait until late at night, dim the lights and get ready to be spooked. Be patient, since the beginning drags a bit and really, the ending could be a bit better, but the middle 70 minutes has plenty of chills. Children over ten can enjoy it, as long as they have been exposed to spooky stories in the past. No sex, no swearing and very mild gore/violence. I'm a bit old fashioned, but I really liked it."

","The Woman In Black is a very good film. There isn't a lot more to say about it. Watch it and there's a distinct possibility that you'll enjoy it ... very much.<br/><br/>I have to admit, I was keen to see it at the time but didn't expect too much (British drama, and all that). After watching it the first time, I thought ""Nice .... good film. A classic ghost story reminiscent of old Hammer films"" (which is essentially what it is), but it left me feeling a bit indifferent. I had to watch it another couple of times to really appreciate it.<br/><br/>The makers obviously realised that focusing merely on visual aspects isn't enough; that they would have to come up with a pretty sophisticated storyline (although not very original) and create a gripping atmosphere or it would be a pointless exercise. Well, they've succeeded. You can tell that a great deal of thought went into making the film, which is also mirrored by the impressive attention to detail. Although being the film's only real strong points, they're enough to make it an enjoyable experience, because they're so crucial.<br/><br/>Daniel Radcliffe, I'm sorry to say, often seems out of his depth in the film, seemingly not knowing how to really play his character (clearly too many years of playing Harry Potter), with the only notable performance here being Ciaran Hinds' (closely followed by Janet McTeer), a seasoned and very talented actor. The film is often painfully slow paced and there is a substantial lack of action. Script and score do what they need to do, although Radcliffe's script is so sparse at times, it borders on a silent performance.<br/><br/>Yet, all this somehow doesn't really matter, because the film still works ... and works very well. A very enjoyable and atmospheric Gothic horror flick that's well worth a couple of hours of your time."

","The Woman in Black tells the story of a young lawyer whose wife passes away and leaves him to raise their son alone with the help of a nanny. The lawyer travels out of town to a remote village where he discovers that a ghost of an angry woman is terrorizing the town. More specifically, the town's children. The lawyer attempts to save the town and give this demonic presence what she's been searching for.<br/><br/>Visually the film looks great. It's filled with interesting locations, beautiful lighting scenarios and very believable costume design. The look of the film was very intriguing using a sort of haze or light fog over much of the images. You certainly want to know more about the mysterious town and our traveling lawyer. The film was marketed as a horror/thriller which I do believe suits it well. Audience reaction in the showing was through the roof with the film being filled with jumps and jolts from its viewers. The sudden movement and sound kept viewers on their toes and kept them plugged in into what would otherwise be a very slow film. I will even go as far as to say that Daniel Radcliffe did a good job with the script that was given to him. I bought into the idea that he was a father, a lawyer and a very confused and curious man.<br/><br/>However I don't believe all of these positive things saved the film from the most important thing; the story itself. The storyline contained so many holes and characters that led absolutely no where. It was one of those films that was building and building and once we got to the peak we realized that the foundation was way too weak for all of that time and anticipation. I would have to spoil the entire film to really get into it, and I just don't want to do that because I don't think its a movie that you should not see. You may love it. It's a toss up. I just wish the plot had a bit more substance and mythology into its main back story and main points.<br/><br/>I do believe this will keep Daniel working though. His performance, however not the strongest, proves that he has enough in him to be more than the boy with the scar on his head."

","This film was definitely different than what I was expecting an went back to the old school way of scaring the audience. I was very impressed by their use of music and the way atmosphere was created. Yes, this did move slower than some of the modern films but for me it was able to build terror so much more by using your own imagination.<br/><br/>Daniel Radcliffe was actually OK. I was worried, since the last time I saw him was in Harry Potter, but he did manage to pull the role off.<br/><br/>The climax was very terrifying, as I was hoping and did actually make you think everything would be OK. The final scene was very slow but it concluded the film nicely, but did leave you not really knowing how to feel.<br/><br/>The only bad thing I can say is, at one point in the film, every opportunity there was for a scare, the film makers took full advantage of. This was way to much and really didn't work because eventually you become desensitised to it and it becomes boring. The idea was there, but it was major overkill.<br/><br/>All in all, it was a scary film, especially if you like the older way of building tension, i.e no CGI every 5 seconds and slow moving to an exciting climax where you feel like hiding behind your settee!"

","I'll start by saying that I am probably one of the few people in the universe who hasn't seen any of the Harry Potter films. To be honest, I have no intention of watching any of them (not really my thing) so unlike the majority of people this was the first film I've seen with Daniel Radcliffe and I must say that it was a very impressive film.<br/><br/>Arthur Kipps (Radcliffe) is a young lawyer who is sent to a remote village to examine documents for a widow who died at a property called Eel Marsh Farm. The widow's name is Alison Drablow and she died at the property around 12 months ago. Kipps is told that he needs to go through all the documents with a fine tooth comb in order for his law firm to complete her last will & testament. Kipps becomes more intrigued when he discovers that Drablow had a little boy that died whilst she was living at the property.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed this film and found the story to be suitably engaging and mysterious. The creepiness of the residents and the general paranoia surrounding Eel Marsh Farm certainly held my interest. I quite liked the idea behind the film as well (ghost of mother of dead boy makes children commit suicide). Her motivations for this are open to interpretation, but I felt that she just wanted other parents to feel the same pain that she felt in losing her child - the difference being that she lost her child in an emotional sense (lack of contact) rather than the other parents losing their child in a physical sense (more obviously kids killing themselves). I liked the 'thought provoking' nature of the plot.<br/><br/>The direction and score were both excellent and there were many dark shots which really did give this film a very creepy feel. The cinematography was also really impressive; particularly some of the misty shots from outside the house. These are really big pluses for this film and I must say from a technical perspective it was nothing short of excellent. Acting wise I thought that Radcliffe & Hinds were both solid in their respective roles. Whilst there is much to praise this film for, I did have a couple of issues with the film; Regrettably, there were quite a number of cheap horror cliché jump scares. Had there been 1 or 2 throughout the film, I would have probably let it go, but there must have been at least a dozen. This was a bit of a shame as everything else about the film was superb. The ending was also fairly predictable, but at least it was slightly 'uplifting'<br/><br/>Despite the minor problems, this is still a very good film with an interesting story and characters. There is also excellent cinematography & direction. Unfortunately, it is let down slightly by numerous cheap jump scares. Nevertheless, I was still very impressed with this film."

As the film started I was quite disappointed and wasn't sure if Daniel Radcliffe was right for the role: I was quite cynical and critical through much of the film - but then realised the hairs were standing up on the back of my neck, despite myself.<br/><br/>I think, overall, it is uneven - some bits work but it lacks the sustained and inexplicable tension and true 'leap out of your seats' horror of the play ."

","The Woman In Black is way better on the second watching. You get past all the dumb ""boo"" noises and really get into the tragedy. Sadly, it's just not very scary. But it is beautifully shot, scripted, and acted. There is no gore to be had, so if that's your thing this isn't the one for you. <br/><br/>The Woman In Black is a refreshing break from the thin, uninspired swill that the big movie corps like to dump on us every Halloween. The difference is the pervasive sense of grief and melancholy that is such a departure from the ""jarring"" route that is so well-mapped out. It's easy to make someone jump. It's harder to make someone feel connected to overwhelming sadness. That's what makes this one stand out. Fear is temporary: despair sticks with you."
"themellowstoner","3","1","3","8 October 2012"," The Verdit Is In.......And It Ain't Good For Harry
","For all the Harry Potter fans out there that are saying this was the scariest movie they've ever seen... Well, I'm not surprised. I mean really, since the Harry Potter series was written for kids, it doesn't surprise me that a bunch of 12 year old girls that have a thing for Harry thought this was terrifying. What does surprise me is that they all have IMDb accounts and have no shame in throwing 10 star ratings around like pink glitter and Tootsie Pops... But as much as I love insulting ""the youth"", lets stay on track and go over exactly why this movie blows.<br/><br/>The one thing you would think that a period piece like this would have going for it would be atmosphere, right? London at night in the early 1900s with the fog and gas lamp lit streets. Perfect setting for a scare, right? Well, think again dummy. The director manages to get NOTHING from this absolute gift. And even though the production is good and the surroundings look creepy and authentic... It is truly mind boggling how devoid of atmosphere this film actually is. And making matters worse, there's practically no music throughout the movie to set the mood properly either. Instead we are treated to an array of sound effects you would most likely hear at a cheesy haunted house at Halloween.<br/><br/>On to acting and dialog. Harry himself isn't that bad, but the writing and the direction is, and he and the rest of the cast suffer because of it. There is little-to-no chemistry between the actors and everything is rushed. Scenes start mid-conversation without characters ever having been introduced and interactions between them that should be creepy and unsettling are over within seconds in stupid 'shock value' scenes leaving you to just chuckle and shake your head in dismay at all the missed opportunities.<br/><br/>So, unfortunately for Potter fans no matter how many times you polish a turd, it's still a turd. And that's exactly what this film is: a big stinker. If you're hard-up for this time period I would recommend ""The Others"" which is much better than this mess."

","I ended up fast forwarding segments of The Woaman in Black as it was so boring. I didn't like the somewhat similar The Others either however if you did, with The Hanunting/Legend of Hell House thrown in you may get something out of this. Just because a revamp of old school horror represents the antithesis of torture porn and scream teen horror it does not necessarily make it watchable.<br/><br/>The causeway linked spooky island house is a decent setting but the script is clichéd and derivative. Like the bleak landscape and weather the film has a morose atmosphere which ground me into fast forward button submission. The ""scares"" were cheap and predictable. I award one point for the downbeat ending which is generous because it is signposted. A far better attempt at a vengeful ghost/haunted house movie is The Abandoned which is set in Russia. What is infinitely more interesting is where Daniel Radcliffe goes from here as this was a safe option in his attempted transition from boy wizard."

","I had been really looking forward to seeing this film. I had read the reviews in the newspapers which generally said that Daniel Radcliffe's acting was wooden but that this didn't really detract from the good 'haunted house' story. Now, having seen the film on DVD, I am really disappointed. This may have worked reasonably well as a 3D film in a simulator cinema at a theme park, or as part of a ghost train ride, but it is otherwise very weak. The scary bits all come from things popping out and the soundtrack gets louder so that the noise of something suddenly moving makes you jump. The pace is incredibly slow and there is no character development so you don't care what happens to anyone. Daniel Radcliffe is undoubtedly a very handsome young man who looks splendid in his period costume, but he was much too young to play the father of a four year old child and his acting was not wooden, it was non-existent. I felt that the supporting cast were having to hold back so that they did not upstage him. He seems like a charming, intelligent, gorgeous person, but I cannot understand how he has managed to make so much money from acting.<br/><br/>The cast and director of this film should have watched the wonderful Nicole Kidman and her superb supporting cast in The Others to see what a really frightening film should be like. Stanley Kubrick used brilliant actors whom he directed with a rod of iron to achieve a film so scary that the mere appearance of two smartly dressed young girls in front of a little boy in The Shining remains an iconic image of terror - one of many from that film. Whilst I didn't expect anything of the Stanley Kubrick calibre, The Woman in Black is well worthy of its 12 certificate rating, because anyone over that age would find it extremely dull."

But the story was more than boring, the characters shallow and pretty meaningless. On the bright side, Daniel Radcliff was not terribly bad, but again, he didn't have much to work with.

I have been reading ghost stories since I was a child in the 70's and this book ranked way up there for me. I don't know why Hollywood insists on rewriting stories for the screen as though they think they know better than the author did.

","I first heard of this by reading in Empire. I was was interested of how Dan Radcliffe could do in horror. I then saw many trailers and found out that it was done by Hammer studios. It was then, my excitement grew. Came out the cinema buzzing with excitement and happiness.<br/><br/>The story was fantastic. I'm a huge fan of old, Gothic ghost stories. It kept me eyes on the screen all the time.<br/><br/>The acting was great. Dan Radcliffe pulled the part off very well, but I think more dialogue is needed by him during scare scenes. <br/><br/>The special effects were necessary. It didn't go over the top with CGI, which is a great thing. <br/><br/>The scare scenes were amazing. Yes it was jumpy, but the creepy feeling stayed with me through out the film. It even made me nervous, which hasn't happened with horror in a while.<br/><br/>I'm a large fan of horror and us horror fans need more films like this. There are times where we see a great modern horror, for example, 28 Days and Weeks Later, Drag Me To Hell, Insidious etc. But this doesn't happen all the time. All we get are horrors with over the top gore, no story, hateful characters and over the top CGI. Gore doesn't bother me but it has to have a reason and CGI, I don't mind, but it has to be necessary. I really wish that horror would go back to the good old days with great stories, lovable characters with enough tension that stays with you after the movie.<br/><br/>I have become a large Hammer fan with the Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee Dracula films, Horror Express etc. Has Hammer returned with another great film, I think so!<br/><br/>Seriously, horror fans, your in for an awesome movie.Please go and see it. I reckon you won't be disappointed. But I recommend you don't bring your children. How it got away with a 12 certificate is beyond me. Again, it even made me nervous and I'm 22. But other than that, your in for a good scare."

The 12a Certificate guaranteed that the auditorium was full of giggly, squealy kids, all taking precious time out from checking their texts to sigh 'Oh my God!' and other suchlike things over 'all-growed-up-Harry-Potter' Daniel Radcliffe.<br/><br/>Not that it spoilt the film much. As has been pointed out, the acting was wooden, the 'jump' bits were all so clichéd that you could see them coming a mile off, the structure was a shambles... and it was boring to boot.<br/><br/>Even the always-interesting Ciaran Hinds was out of place.<br/><br/>The upsides? The cinematography was good, the direction was competent, and the Gothic atmosphere was convincingly created.<br/><br/>It was just a shame that the story and characters weren't a match for them.<br/><br/>2 out of 10"

","Another release from the new Hammer studios. This is maybe the most look-a-like Hammer so far. Still some will have nostalgia towards the old Gothic Hammers with Cushing and Lee but that's over. The acting done then and the way it was filmed is over. <br/><br/>Back to reality. They really made a risk by giving the lead role to Harry Potter, I correct, Daniel Radcliffe. And naturally you will compare it to Potter but I must say that he did so well here and Potter is forgotten. So far so good and I would even go further. This time it was scary. Let me explain. It isn't a slasher or whatsoever, this is a pure ghost story but it do has some jump scenes in it. And I can understand that newspapers were writing about people screaming in their seats at the cinemas. That's because youth thought they were going to see some, sorry, Harry Potter stuff.<br/><br/>James Watkins was the director here and I must admit that he knew his stuff by directing Eden Lake (2008), a flick I liked a lot. It isn't fast moving but it got my full attention. It's not a flick full of red stuff it even didn't got any nudity like the old Hammers. I liked it and I guess Hammer did good with giving Daniel the lead. It will attract old Hammers geeks and it will attract Harry geeks. <br/><br/>On part of the effects naturally they used CGI but it didn't bother me because we are looking at ghosts. The best Hammer so far, I mean from the new Hammer. But I'm sure it will gave his pro's and contras.<br/><br/>Gore 0/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 3/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0/5"

I wasn't quite sure what to make of it, though the Official Trailer immediately intrigued me.<br/><br/>The setting of the time period was be far the first to catch my attention. and catch it, it did. I was very impressed at how the movie was not filled with Gor and blood spattering all over the place. But instead a mind bending thriller.<br/><br/>I was literally kept on the edge of my seat from the beginning to the end, and all the way threw. I had seen Radcliff in his previous tails of the Potty series. But to see him come to life in this film was nothing short of incredible. He has grown into what i would call an amazing actor.<br/><br/>The film depicts that of the 1900's era, which is my favorite in many films. But, this was different by far beyond what I expected.<br/><br/>I would suggest this movie to anyone. The suspense, the story, and the thrill all come together so well.. I will hope after seeing to one day actually see the stage show.."

","My friend told me that this film was going to be a crappy film but when I went into the cinema and watched this it scared the living **** out of me and my Girlfriend and also so many people ran away from the film. It creates a great atmosphere and the ending where Daniel Radcliffe and his son get run over is great and it really builds up to a fantastic ending. The only fault I could find is that lots of it is never explained like how she got the children to commit suicide and how she could mess with anyones heads this doesn't take away from the story or the atmosphere. Daniel plays the role to perfection, really allowing the audience to really get attached to his character and when he dies people genuinely feel sad. The supporting cast are also great especially Janet McTeer who portrays the grieving but insane widow perfectly. All in all a must see in the cinema if your a fan of horror"
"doorsscorpywag","5","1","3","23 February 2012"," Brave try but ultimately a fail
","I was fortunate enough to be able to compare the 1989 TV version and the new outing and even though the new film benefited from tons of cash and Dan Radcliffe it is a poor relation to the TV drama. Adrian Rawlins as Arthur Kidd is far far superior to Dan and his Kipps character. <br/><br/>Dan and Kipps seemed to wander around slightly bemused whilst Kidd's descent into madness and horror was portrayed very well by Adrian. There were creepy turns from both Ladies In Black but Pauline Moran in the TV drama did better close up. The brilliant TV actor Bernard Hepton far outclassed the very good film actor Ciarán Hinds as Sam. The effects in the new version were decent but the atmospheric feel was won hands down by TV. Mainly it was in the writing and the TV had Nigel 'Quatermass' Kneale who really knew how to get into the viewers head.<br/><br/>It is nice to see Dan making a name for himself outside of the Potter films and he did a decent job it must be said but something about what he had to work with was missing. The Woman in Black is NOT a horror film it is a psychological and creepy drama and it was sad to see the film people resorting to a screaming face in the window pane to get the films only real jolting moment. A scene that made no real sense and had no real connection with what was going on. It summed the film up really as the hype had built this up to be a real scarer and it was more akin to films like The Haunting than some Hollywood scream fest. The Woman in Black is a creepy story that gives you a sense of unease and TV did it far far better than the movie people who were trying to compete with the Hollywood horror genre rather than trying to make a real old style drama which this story is. The ending of the TV version far more disturbing than the silly ending of the film version. <br/><br/>Overall it was a half decent movie which was reasonably well acted given the constraints of the script they were handed but Nigel Kneales TV script really wiped the floor with this and was an example of how TV actors sometimes eclipse their big screen cousins on a budget probably less than this films catering."
"williamsonkwr","7","1","3","22 February 2012"," Good but Radcliffe does not yet have enough maturity for this role.
","Daniel Radcliffe has definitely grown up from his days as Harry Potter but I question whether he had grown up enough for this role.<br/><br/>The film is very good on the whole and is very much the sort of horror film I enjoy, lots of things to make one jump but without the boring and unnecessary gore.<br/><br/>I think that the scares were well placed and sustained, with good timing but they would all have worked just as well with any other actor.<br/><br/>It cannot be denied that Dan is a good actor but I did not think he was ready for this role; he does not yet appear to have the emotional depth or maturity and probably not enough experience of life to play the part of a young widower with small boy very convincingly at least not yet, and this film could have been so much better with a more mature actor.<br/><br/>A good effort but he is trying to run before he can walk."

","I was really looking forward to seeing Daniel Radcliffe as something other than Harry Potter. I was seriously disappointed in this movie. The first 45 min or so was so slow and boring I almost got up and walked out. The tone of the movie was extremely dark, as expected. There was some effort to lead up to the impact points, but the intensity wasn't maintained. There was about 20 min of actual ""scary"" and suspenseful. The scary parts were really scary, though. I jumped out of my seat several times. It was true suspense, not just blood and gore. However, there were actually times when the audience laughed out loud at overly contrived efforts to make things seem creepy. At the end, it was like... really? That's it? Overall, the good parts weren't worth sitting through the rest. It would have been better to watch this sitting at home in the dark with a group of friends."
"james-hong","5","1","3","18 February 2012"," Nothing Novel - Jump Scares and a Creepy Atmosphere
","The plot itself is decent but not detailed enough to make the vengeance of the spirit make enough sense. The film itself succeeds in giving the thrills the audience seeks, but does so in a typical manner (not unlike the recent Insidious, though I felt that the first act of Insidious was comparatively superior to that of this film). The atmosphere however, was well established and dreadful from the very start. With regards to the acting of the actors, Radcliffe's response to the situations within the film (like most other horror movie mains) are rather unrealistic (but obviously, necessary for the progression of the film), other characters were not well illustrated to be worthy of any discussion.<br/><br/>Overall, a movie ticket? Nah, just get the DVD put your speakers on high and you'll feel just the same.<br/><br/>5/10"
"dalelawson-1","8","1","3","17 February 2012"," Best horror film in ages!
","The thing that is in everyone's mind when Daniel Radcliffe first appears on screen is Harry Potter! I personally think that Radcliffe has one of the hardest challenges an actor can ever face, which is trying to get out of being typecast, or perhaps never being cast at all because of his huge involvement in the Potter franchise. But I am pleased to say that he excelled in The Woman in Black (Dir. James Watkins, 2012), providing a believable performance as Arthur Kipps. Only at the beginning did his act falter; as Radcliffe seemed nervous around the boy who was supposed to be his son.<br/><br/>I'll briefly mention that this film flows particularly well, and gives off a high degree of verisimilitude, thanks to the talented supporting cast. Ciarán Hinds and Shaun Dooley are two actors that are worth mentioning as they play Mr Daily, a character who becomes the only friend for Kipps, and Mr Fisher, the innkeeper who attempts to drive Kipps out of town so as to protect the children. Both their performances are strong and they create a fantastic side-kick and a great minor antagonist.<br/><br/>Apart from what I had gathered from the trailers, I was unaware of the story of The Woman in Black when going into the cinema, having not seen the theatrical production or original TV film. The Woman in Black has a strong and interesting narrative, something that isn't common for many horror films within the last ten years, and provides plenty of scares, jumps and horrific moments. The most intense and captivating scenes within the film occur at the manor in the marsh. Fear excels to a new level when Kipps decides to stay in that house over night.<br/><br/>Creepy toys and terrifying dolls are continuously visible throughout The Woman in Black establishing a strong concept of fear within the secrete village. As well as perhaps symbolising that the woman is always watching Kipps, no matter where he is. There is a shot where Kipps walks past a toy with a candle, the candle is reflected in the toy's eyes making it seem like they are moving and following Kipps.<br/><br/>The only really disappointing aspect of the film was the conclusion. All I can really say without spoiling the plot is that there should have been a cliff hanger instead of the plot being resolved.<br/><br/>This was by far the best horror film I have seen in a long while, mainly due to the decision not to make it a hand-held documentary. The director uses diegetic and non-diegetic sounds to create suspense, which again takes the film away from the silent ""jump"" scenes over-used in modern horrors. I hope that more producers watch this film and realise horror films don't all have to be exactly like Paranormal Activity (Dir. Oren Peli, 2007) to terrify audiences.<br/><br/>If you enjoyed this review, check out my others on my blog: http://dalelawsonreviews.tumblr.com/"
"kluseba","8","1","3","15 February 2012"," Mediocre story but grippingly scary
","The Woman In Black is a visually stylish and authentic ghost story with a haunting atmosphere and a solid acting that is set in the early twentieth century in an isolated British village.<br/><br/>Even though the story as well as the ending of the movie are rather predictable, they are so well designed and acted that this doesn't disturb the entertaining enjoyment of the movie. The movie still has still some very gripping and memorable scenes even if the story itself is not the best one that could have been chosen as a remake.<br/><br/>This movie will definitely put you on the edges of your seats and is nothing for weak-heartened people as it is really scary at some points. It's probably the most intense horror movie since ""Insidious"". The movie works a lot with light and especially sound effects so you have to watch this in your local cinema to fully enjoy this picture.<br/><br/>In the end, after a rather disappointing second half of the cinematic year 2011, this new year starts in a very satisfying manner with movie highlights such as ""The Grey"" or ""The Woman In Black"" that make me look forward to discover a bunch of other movies within the next few weeks."
"astafford-uk","8","1","3","15 February 2012"," Atmospheric and scary
","This is scary, most certainly, and it had members of my audience screaming out loud at times. It's very atmospheric and almost totally visual which is unusual in this age of loud noise on the screen. Is this a new trend, with 'The Artist' also being (almost) silent? This quiet challenged me more than the usual noisy films do as really had to watch carefully. Blink and you miss it.<br/><br/>There were some oddities though: I couldn't quite work out the time of year it was supposed to be as sometimes it looked like late autumn and other times quite summery. Another thing was the certificates: the adoption certificate stated Ms Alice Whatever - this title would not have been used in the late 19th century in England. Also there was way too much information on the death certificate - poetic licence, I suppose, but these details detract a bit from the whole.<br/><br/>Daniel Radcliffe made quite a convincing young father and is well on his way to saying goodbye to Harry Potter. But I did groan a bit at the beginning with the long shot of the steam train ... I thought we were on our way to Hogwarts."

The plot was thoroughly thought out, it was very clever and very unexpected. It had every viewer on their toes. The music contributed well to the scenes and there was a time when Arthur Kipps (Daniel Radcliffe) walked in and the room screamed thinking it was the woman in black. The film was fantastic and I can't think of a better actor to play Arthur than Daniel Radcliffe. He played the part extremely well and filled his character with heart felt emotion. The plot had a deeper, darker side to it which made the story even more scarier. It was tragic in the end and I'm still shaking with sadness and fear. I recommend it to everyone who loves horrors but it's not for the faint hearted. I can't fault it. I hope to see it again and I hope to see other films like it. :)"

","Going into this film, I had read many conflicting reviews. Some loved it, some thought it was generic. I can see each side of those arguments. For many hardcore horror fans, they will come out thinking ""I've seen this 100 times before, but the saddest part is that it could have been great."" The directing was the hardest part to watch with this film. I'm a fan of James Watkins' Eden Lake, so I was expecting the directing to be better in this. It seems like with every subtle genuinely terrifying thing in The Woman in Black, an unnecessary jump scare followed. I don't know if Watkins was pressured by producers or the studio to put in those dumbed-down jump scares, but they ruined the film. As Alfred Hitchcock said ""it's not the scares that terrify the audience, it's the anticipation."" As I was watching this film, I was just anticipating jump scares, which doesn't genuinely scare anyone.<br/><br/>Daniel Radcliffe was embarrassing with his acting. Absolutely atrocious. He didn't look scared, thrilled, saddened, or even happy. Just indifferent the entire film. He didn't act at all, just gave generic surprised looks. Having said that, there's something about him that I liked still. He has the ""it"" factor, just as an actor has ""it"". Regardless, he was bad in this film.<br/><br/>This isn't a bad film, but it sure has been done before. As I said before, this could have been amazing. I did get chills throughout my body at certain parts, but they were quickly replaced by disappointment due to jump scares. If you're a horror fan, this will be run of the mill to you. If you're new to horror, you may like this. Overall, this could have been great."

","This year and last year, I've been going to the movies with my friends to try and seek out at least one good movie that we like. Opening night we were dying to see this movie and we were praying that it would be good. As the movie started, I labeled it as the kind of movie that would just end up killing people with no reason like the Final Destination movies. But then the movie quickly progressed into a movie with an actual plot. However, in order to actually get the movie, it is critical to pay attention to the beginning, even if you have obnoxious people talking like in our theatre. My friend and I aren't easily scared by movies and the first few scares, we heard people screaming throughout the theatre while we were thinking ""Oh this isn't going to scare us"". However, we were mistaking. When Arthur was in the house alone, he and I were covering our faces and hiding in each others shoulders along with screaming along with the rest of the audience. I could write so much more about this movie and how amazing it is, but that would take up far to much time. Long story short, this was the best movie I've seen in a long time. My friends and I are actually planning to go see it again. It was actually scary, the actors were fantastic, and the movie remained dark and mysterious until the very end. I highly recommend seeing this movie. It was the best $9.00 I've spent in a long time."

I really like the character of Sam. He was very loyal to a man he had just met. I thought Daniel Radcliff did a good job as the grieving husband. Truthfully, I would have never even gone into the house, much less chased down weird sounds with nothing more than an candle and a hatchet.

","8/10. This film surpasses the original 1989 version even though IMDb ratings indicate otherwise. As in the original, an effective creepy atmosphere and setting is portrayed. The camera angles and composition were outstanding, including excellent use of background, objects, and shadows to reveal the supernatural. The music was pretty good, but did not seem to have a significant role. The use of sound to produce jump scares was perhaps over used or exaggerated, yet effective. The movie's pacing may be slow for some and dialogue is sometimes minimal as Kipps is mostly alone. This isolation combined with the plot and setting create an intense feeling of dread. The film could have used more action based suspense, but would have required more deviation from the book and original movie. The cast worked for me on all levels, even though Radcliffe seemed stoic at times, I don't think it hurt the film. This period piece treated me with five strong chilling moments, and sixteen in all. This is a great movie for fans of atmospheric horror and the supernatural."

Being a massive fan of Daniel Radcliffe in Harry Potter,i was always skeptical of him being able to portray another character completely different to Harry, but i have to fully admit, he was brilliant! He took on a brand new character and he nailed it brilliantly. For such a young actor to portray an older person in role he was certainly better than most actors i have watched in large movies where they have to take on a role that is very different physically to themselves. The movie itself was fantastic, the director made a smashing fear movie with great scenes that will take your breath away. One scene which i will not say to much about due to readers that are looking to watch the film, but i will say that one scene that contains a car, a small child and Daniel Radcliffe diving under mud defiantly gave me a chill that will not go away for a few weeks or least a few days.

The last horror film i reviewed was Insdious and i don't even know how it can be considered a horror film it wasn't scary at all. Back to this movie, I thought the acting was good not the best acting but it gets the job done. Now I don't get scared very easily but I did jump a couple of times. The last 10-20 mins is the intense and scariest minutes in the entire film and that is how the last 10-20 mins in any horror film should be. There will be a lot of people who wont like the movie because there is no blood or gore in it, but that is OK. You don't need blood and gore to make a horror film scary, blood and gore can take away form the story because that is all the filmmakers care about these days. Is this movie worth seeing? Yes I saw in the theaters and normally I don't see horror movies at the theaters because I am just wasting my money, but this movie looked like it would be worth the money and it was. I am surprised that the rating for this movie is at 6.7 I think it should be at least 7.7 but thats just me.

"DICK STEEL","7","1","4","3 April 2012"," A Nutshell Review: The Woman in Black
","Is there screen life after Harry Potter for Daniel Radcliffe? The answer is a resounding yes, going by how the actor has now matured and is able to carry an entire movie on his own, and better yet, having extended scenes with nothing else but his character on screen the entire time, groping in the dark, figuring out what's lurking behind sinister shadows, looking afraid, yet resolute in sticking to what he's been tasked to do for family.<br/><br/>The Woman in Black, based on the novel by Susan Hill and is still an actively staged play, has more working for it than just Daniel Radcliffe's singular presence on screen. It's adapted for the big screen by Jane Goodman, responsible for adapting some of the best, in my opinion, stories in recent years such as Stardust, Kick-Ass, The Debt and X-Men: First Class. And director James Watkins may only be one film old, that effort was the remarkable Eden Lake, and he follows up that horror effort which was more slasher, with one that's more ghoulish here. I suppose having a strong story, which kept to its spirit (pardon the pun) rather than to follow verbatim, worked wonders, and Watkins pulls out all the stops despite having to dig in deep from the bag of old scare tactics and tricks.<br/><br/>Radclife plays the lawyer Arthur Kipps, who's given one final chance by his company to prove himself by heading out to a remote village to wrap up the paperwork for a, well, spooky mansion. A widower, he reluctantly bids his son farewell, and hops onto the next train hoping everything could be completed in time for the weekend, where he can be back in London to spend quality time with his kid. But Murphy's Law means that desire never really got fulfilled, as Arthur takes it upon himself to find out what exactly was going on in town when kids happen to die during his visit, with the villages adamant that he packs his bags and head home.<br/><br/>And with kids dying and dropping like flies, it got really creepy from the get go, where three girls inexplicably take off from their attic window, complete with eerie sounding music, and scary looking toys that seem to be popular items used by the art director to pepper the set with. And as a friend puts it, one can't really go wrong with haunted mansions, as we get one main mansion and a few other for red herring fun, but nonetheless having them milked for light and shadow play to perfection, complete with long dark corridors, creaking staircases, and a beautiful marsh in its immediate perimeter that isolates the house from civilization when the tide comes in. And when Watkins amplifies the horror quotient from the midway point with Arthur single handedly exploring what's behind some fast moving shadows and whispering noises, be prepared to let out a little girlie scream now and then, because such scary moments catches you offguard even though you're primed with anticipation of the usual tricks that come out of the bag. They all worked quite effectively to make you squirm a little in your seat.<br/><br/>The Woman in Black isn't all just silly scares with little substance though. At its core it wrapped things up pretty nicely in a sort of bittersweet fashion, and given its success at the box office, a sequel has recently been announced. The strength comes in the characters and their potential in adding a lot to the plot, such as Ciaran Hind's rich landowner Mr Daily, and his wife (Janet McTeer) who goes into a trance, seemingly possessed by their deceased kid who communicate through his mom. Mr Daily on the other hand isn't quite the believer despite the strange incidents happening around town, and proves to be quite the reliable ally for Arthur to maintain his sanity. As already mentioned, Radcliffe's Arthur will draw you to his cause as the man who's backed to a corner professionally, and having supernatural disturbances is the last thing he needs to derail his putting food on the table.<br/><br/>What also worked in the film's favour is its period setting, which somehow provides an additional dimension to the level of creepiness throughout, with plenty of shades of black and grey. The art direction is superbly handled, as is the cinematography and its score by Marco Beltrami, where without these strong technical attributes, The Woman in Black will probably pale in comparison to its film peers. It isn't everyday that a horror film has elements that clicked and don't come off as silly, so if you're in the mood for a little creepiness, then this film will undoubtedly and should be your choice. Recommended!"

","This movie was definitely the scariest but one of the best movies i have ever watched. It was jumpy in nearly every part of the movie. It was extremely scary from beginning to end, the way it was put together i thought was excellent. The bit that was the scariest was when the boy was lying on the bed and the woman in black gets closer and closer also the bit when she rises up through the ground where the cross is. I hope that they bring a second one out because i would definitely watch it. When she screams really made me jump because just the way she looks when she's screaming freaks me out. In conclusion i would recommend you to watch this because it is an amazing movie to watch."
"ozziefilmbuff","10","1","4","23 March 2012"," Hammer is back!
","The first British horror film to bear the ""Hammer"" banner in 35 years doesn't disappoint.<br/><br/>It's a masterpiece, but not by exploiting sentimental, schlocky nostalgia or by trading on a once great name in the hope of appealing to rusted-on fans of the original Hammer Films. This is a trend-setter in it's own right.<br/><br/>Radcliffe pleasantly surprises. I assumed he'd be typecast as the perennial schoolboy from the Potter films before witnessing his unexpected ease and charisma in this production. So believable as an anxious father - effectively relating the primal fears of any parent - I had to google his age to assure myself he wasn't older than I'd thought!<br/><br/>He makes it, but a classy supporting cast adds lustre. The child actors deserve acclaim for their unsettling stillness; accented by their pallid makeup and costumes.<br/><br/>And as for the setting itself, a formula as old as time comes across as fresh as paint! But there's nothing fresh about this eyesaw - a once grand house at the end of a snaking causeway and periodically cut off by tides and sea mists, the stately but decrepit pile offers a widescreen, HD wonderland of dark nooks and crannies, dusty drapes and brocade dressing screens. Production designer Kave Quinn has gone to town with the creepy Victoriana, and whoever was in charge of props deserves kudos for the marvellous selection of eerie toys alone --cymbal-clanging monkeys, leprous dolls, a sinister zoetrope -- that populate the abandoned nursery.<br/><br/>As Radcliffe's character Kipps settles in for several nights of terror, despite warnings from the believably terrified local villagers, the shocks are duly delivered with a perfect sense of horror timing, accompanied by huge jolts of discordant noise.<br/><br/>All the Hitchcock tricks are dusted off and polished to perfection.<br/><br/>The special effects are more than adequate, but they aren't nearly as impressive as the perfect sense of horror timing and the truly unsettling blend of shadows and light. I approached the whole film with an air of cynicism, solely because those hoary old chestnuts - haunted houses and all the stock characters that we find within and around them - have been done a thousand times over, and often badly. Had they been one fraction out, what was a highly effective unsettling viewing experience could have descended into laughable schlock. They weren't, and it didn't.<br/><br/>Only shot-by-shot analysis can reveal whether there really are figures and faces lurking, barely seen, at the edge of the frame, which contribute very subtly to the atmosphere of unease... or are just figments of the imagination? The more obviously visible spectres, meanwhile, including the titular Woman in Black owe a particular debt to recent Asian horror movies, (especially Hideo Nakata's ""Ringu,"") in the unsettling, fast-gliding way they move and appear.<br/><br/>It's a film to be viewed on the big screen, and more than once to be fully appreciated. Full stars!"
"ckinnair205","10","1","4","14 March 2012"," Brilliant & Well Acted.
","The Woman in Black is utterly brilliant, well acted, well preformed and a good horror film! I disregard the BBFC Rating as I personally think this film should at least be a 15, even if it was cut by 6 seconds; however it was still brilliant! I can not criticise one second of it. Daniel Radcliffe preformed mearly well; and it was a big jump for him after the acclaimed 'Harry Potter.' This is easily one of the best films I've scene and will ever see. It is a good Horror and very jumpy with disturbing parts. It is not suitable for young children; regardless of the rating. It was a ride to supernatural hell! - It was worth the money."
"barbara-364","7","1","4","12 March 2012"," Dark Gothic film which may give you the creeps
","The Woman in Black. A dark Gothic tale which uses every creepy trick in the genre and finishes in a plethora of loose ends! The filming, where you can see it, is good. A lot of the atmosphere is generated by the music and loud bangs will make you jump. There are few characters who appear to be sane and the story line takes spite and hatred into infinity. If you know England, the Yorkshire village is filmed near the Essex marshes, which perhaps only have the east coast in common. The village and its people are like in the comedy series ""The league of Gentlemen"". Not much in the film is understated or left the the imagination. it perhaps would have been creepier if it had been. The ending is a bit predictable, fatalistic and expected. The most disturbing aspect of the film, from my point of view, is that superstition, ignorance, spite and hatred are the dominating themes. It wouldn't appeal to a tidy mind. The bereaved hero, Kipps (Daniel Radcliffe) has gone to a Gothic house ( which looks like Satis House in Rochester, Kent) to sort out the estate. The mess of papers is never sorted out. The house never gets on the market. Disturbed minds are never sorted out. Wherever there might appear to be normality is an undercurrent of extreme insanity. I really liked the vintage car and the vintage railway scenes, although I am reliably informed that the locomotive used dates from the 1930s not the 1910s. I once stayed in a Yorkshire Inn, which had that kind of atmosphere. I decided to go into the small communal lounge upstairs where there were a lot of stuffed animals around the room, the rain beat against the window panes and the wind howled around the eaves. I put the television on and the film Damon Omen started. I heard an uneven rhythmic tramp on the wooden staircase which led to corridor outside the room I was in. The door opened with a creak. My heart was racing by this time. There stood the black- bearded landlord and it was his wooden leg I had heard on the stairs. We both jumped in surprise to see each other. I decided the warmth of the open fire in the flag-stoned bar and a draught Theakston's Old Peculiar with my friends was preferable to watching Damon Omen on my own that night. I was reminded of that incident when I watched The Woman in Black."

","One thing comes out of your mouth, when you see Daniel Radcliffe as Arthur Kipps and that's- WOW. I thought it would be very weird to see Daniel as somebody else other than Harry Potter, but he played Arthur Kipps quite brilliantly. Although, he is still very young and didn't look like a father of a 4 year old, but, what matters is acting and that he did quite well.<br/><br/>This movie is a remake of a 1989 movie of the same title. I didn't see the old flick. But when I saw the reviews of the old flick I wanted to see it. But, I thought it would be wise to wait for a few months, as I knew the remake was going to be made. <br/><br/>The movie was good, it was not stupid and gory as nowadays horror films are made. It was a good scary movie with a fine story and nice (it seemed reasonable to me) ending. It relied on good acting of Daniel as well old fashioned scary moments.<br/><br/>I was looking forward to see this movie, as I wanted to see how Daniel would come out of the Harry Potter persona. He did it quite well actually. Normally, if an image of a particular actor is built, it becomes quite difficult for him to break out of that image( All the characters of FRIENDS look stupid in anything other than FRIENDS). But I think Daniel is a fine actor and he will go a long way.<br/><br/>It is a nice old fashioned horror movie, which will be liked by the people who are not amused by stupid gory flicks."

","The Woman in Black The film was very good, the film has a story the woman in black was the last witch to die on the Isle of man but she owned a house in Yorkshire but no one knows why she moved there. One scene in the film was very jumpy because the camera viewed outside the window into the marsh were a young boy died and then the camera looked at the window and you can see a hand print then Richard touch it and the woman in black appeared. The woman in black is a cursed when someone sees a young child dies. The ending is great because Richard's son walked on the train track and Richard went to go and get him but it was too late because the train hit them both but they went to heaven."
"markmullen777","7","1","4","4 March 2012"," A decent return for Hammer but take 2 stars off for the UK version
","To start off I'd like to say how annoyed I was to find out that the producers of this movie where so eager to put their greed before art in insisting om making cuts (essentially making the film less scary/threatening) in order to make this a 12A film in the UK. What they failed to see in their blind rush was that certificate probably put off a lot of adults such as me from watching the UK version. I could go on to say that I think certification these days is almost pointless but this is not the place. Take two stars off for the heavily cut UK version.<br/><br/>Fortunately I was lucky enough to see the US version of the is film. I was happy to see a return of Hammer Horror at last and this was a decent, if not great edition to the collection.<br/><br/>Good stuff:<br/><br/>It is quite scary and their are a few really good jump out of your seat moments. It's not overly long and the story moves along briskly towards it's end. <br/><br/>The setting in history is a good one (I mean if that had a been a torch our hero was carrying and and not a lantern it would not have had the same effect) and the set design, wadrobe and even the countryside all fit well to a feeling of foreboding horror.<br/><br/>Bad stuff:<br/><br/>As many other's have pointed out Radcliffe is too young for the part really and his acting skills and his accent are a little clunky at times. Especially when he's the same scene as the excellent Cieran Hinds. Radcliffe obviously brings along a fan base but I hope in future Hammer take a bit more of a risk and perhaps use lesser known actors without baggage. <br/><br/>It's scary but not terrifying, opting for 'jump' moments which can become a bit of a gimmick.<br/><br/>All in all it's a solid 7 movie. I hope future Hammer productions take more risks and stray from this path of safe and certainly profitable productions. Of course they need to make money, but horror films can make money by trying new ideas."

","I couldn't believe this was actually a 12a.I must have jumped off the seat at least 10 times. It's the type of film where you know its gonna make you jump yet you still can't help jumping. Even the sounds and the way the camera turns, how it is looking down and you are shouting in your head for it to look up to see if there is something there. I laughed, screamed (twice) and cried during this film. Seriously if you have any doubts about going to watch this film then go, book yourself the tickets and get yourself down to the cinema. This is a slight spoiler I suppose, for some reason I didn't like the ending as it portrays something that i think isn't true at all but they need to end happy after all that sadness.

There were a few younger than 12 in the audience with me today and I can almost guarantee most of them will be having nightmares tonight. On a personal level, I enjoyed it very much.

You see her throughout the movie which keeps her always in the front of your mind. Every time they had a shot of Daniel, I found myself concentrating on the background. It was really un-nerving. Some others have said she is seen too much, I disagree. The suspense was awesome (luckily, I downloaded this movie and could pause for 10 minutes every so often to get my nerves back--OK it took me 5 hours to watch this 90 minute flick!) Although the end was different from the other versions (book and earlier film), I still think it maintained the character of the book.

","I had been waiting for the release of this film for a long time, The Woman in Black book, and stage play are fantastic and I was hoping that the film would do both of these justice. And in the main I think it does. The adaption from the original book is rather far off, however the main plot points are roughly similar. Daniel Radcliff as Authur Kipps, I wasn't keen on this casting, a fantastic actor but it seems he is not yet ready to play a married man with a child of 4, 10 for effort however. The supporting cast are very good and it is always nice to see a lot of British talent. It is a step back into the the real meaning of the horror genre, no blood, or gore, but real edge of the seat scream out loud frights, and terrifying imagery which will remain with you long after the film ends. There is nothing revolutionary about this film, and the story does become a little over dramatic at times and I still support the fact that it would have been just as good by sticking to the original plot. None the less entertaining, and well worth a watch, but not for those with a nervous disposition."

","Woman in Black , directed by James Watkins , based on a novel by Susan Hill is a scary , you-name-it horror-scenes thriller which is sure to keep you engrossed in each frame coupled with a very well written story. Aurther(Daniel Radcliffe) is a struggling lawyer who has been given a last chance to find out about the unknown will of a deceased woman Mrs. Drablow in a remote village. The moment he reaches the village, he finds weird thing about village and its inhabitants. The villagers don't want him to stay around when they realize about his investigation to the strange house, far away from the village, in the creepy island. Sooner, he is assisted by Simon Daily (Ciaran Hinds) who is the only person in the village to solve the mystery of killings of children due to strange appearance of a woman in black in that house The Woman in black , a remake of a 1989 TV movie of same name, was an outstanding thriller that is sure to give a chill down your spine. The new time director, James Watkins, handles the story very efficiently. The 90 minutes flick helps to keep your attention in each frame. I would like to mention couple of scenes including the one where Aurther moves to top floor to find about the movement of easy chair and the one where he takes a nap in a chair and gets up being shocked by the barking of his dog. The Cinematography is brilliantly executed displaying the European country side effectively. The background is haunting that gels well with the movie. The dialogues are impressive. Art direction is splendid. We have known Daniel Radcliffe for his Harry Potter series but believe me the actor has shown lot of promises apart from his magical tricks. He completely carries the film solely on his shoulder. Ciaran Hinds does good job in the supporting role. On the whole , The Woman in Black provides ample scary moments which will keep you on the edge of the seat and is sure to keep you engaged throughout the film."

Daniel did a good job though, it's the first time I felt that he really grew up and can really act as an adult, unlike still perceiving him as a kid in his potter movies.

Definitely one to watch in the cinema for the sound effects which I personally like and make me, well, choke on my popcorn more! <br/><br/>I would say it's probably too scary for the classification they gave it (12a). I understand in this classification the threat should not be frequent which in this film it was. Dangerous imitable behaviour is possibly borderline.

This review will be my most thorough to date, reviewing every square inch of this movie.<br/><br/>Firstly, CASTING. Before going to view The Woman In Black i took some time to read other peoples reviews in local newspapers, and the thing that really stood out for me as a criticism was the fact that nearly every reviews mentioned Daniel Radcliffe not being right as the main part, saying he was too young to be cast as a long term father. I went to see if these critics were just out there to criticise Radcliffe and i discovered that i felt he done a great job as a major lead role, obviously having enough experience from blockbuster film series Harry Potter. I did see the critics point, but i did think they were a tad harsh. 9/10 Secondly, PLOT: Personally, i thought the plot was clever, yet quite easy to follow. Apparently, according to friends, they had changed the ending. I observed that, yes, the ending was different, but it didn't bring my overall rating of the film down at all. It was still spine-chillingly good. 10/10 Thirdly, SETS/LOCATIONS: Loved them. Thought that the ideas gone into where each scene is set were exquisite. No criticisms. 10/10 Lastly, EXPECTATIONS: I truly expected the best from this film, and the best is what i got. It was a tense, scary and overall brilliant affair. Throughout the movie you could expect at parts something was going to jump out and make us gasp, but i couldn't predict exactly when, and even though i knew it was going to happen, i still jumped in shock. The film exceeded my expectation and was well worth the money i paid. 10/10 5 STARS *****"

","When I was 12 years old I had watched ""The Woman in Black"" in the theater and was scared to death, but it was also etched in my memory. Today, ten years later, I went with my dad to watch the new version, excited to see how Daniel Radcliffe had done, as I have followed his career since his first Harry Potter role.<br/><br/>At first I thought that he is too young to be playing a father and a widower in this movie, but 10 minutes into the movie I was only seeing the character, which speaks for Radcliffe's ethos and ability as an actor. I felt proud of him as a fan of his to see him playing his role so well. He uses his face and his body in a very effective way, carrying the plot gracefully and convincingly. This is definitely a success story for Mr Radcliffe.<br/><br/>Apart from the acting, which was all great, the cinematography is simply amazing. The site chosen for the house in the movie is simply perfect, so old and majestic it can hardly be separated from the landscape, which has a road leading to it which is very appropriate for Susan Hill's novel.<br/><br/>Also, the soundtrack is interesting, often contributing effectively to creating the horrific illusion.<br/><br/>All in all, this new version of ""The Woman in Black,"" is a beautifully made film, as well as very loyal to Susan Hill's excellent story. It is a breath of fresh air from other, overtly violent horror films, as it is one of the few truly mysterious and atmospheric stories of our time. It is a beautiful story, yet quite sad, but leaving the theater today I was feeling more in touch with myself, which I believe is what a well-told story does to one."

I went with my two best friends and we sat at the front row and the audience was laughing and talking throughout the trailers until the movie's title came up and everyone was silent, it was like the cinema was haunted itself. The plot focuses on Arthur Kipps played by Daniel Radcliffe who is a lawyer with a 4 year old son and a deceased wife who died of childbirth, he goes to a small country side village in England to sell and finish paperwork on the Eel marsh house who was owned by Alice Drablow with her husband, son and sister. He befriends Sam Daily while the other villagers tell him to leave but he refuses. Arthur sees glimpses of the woman in black who haunts the village and the Eel Marsh house and a child is killed by drinking lye, Sam's wife is tormented about her sons mysterious death and tries to tell Arthur strange things about the woman in black but Sam keeps restraining her. Arthur stays in the Eel Marsh house experiencing strange events from the woman in black which in my opinion is my favourite scene because it's the most suspenseful scene in the movie. After another child death Sam's wife warns Arthur that the women in black is after his son next, we also find out that the woman in black manipulates children to commit suicide. so Arthur must try to stop the woman in black's terror and save his son and the ending i won't reveal. This movie had a fantastic story, great cast, acting, setting, atmosphere, music and Daniel Radcliffe were all brilliant. Also REALLY SCARY!. I recommend it to classic horror fans or people who like being scared out of their minds but for kids NO WAY!!!. For a rated 12 it was pretty dark and spooky, i was shocked at how the children were killed and the film itself. The ending was good but sad as well thats all i can say since i don't want to spoil it. I rate the movie 10/10."
"mikeylvsmvies","10","1","4","10 February 2012"," Good Old School Scares
","This movie gives the audience good old school scares. Daniel Radcliffe gives an effective performance as Arthur Kipps a young lawyer in Edwardian England who gets caught up in supernatural events involving a haunted house in a remote village. I found this movie to be utterly terrifying because of what was not explicitly shown. The supporting cast helped sell the premise of the movie. I screamed frequently in terror during this movie especially when the title apparition makes her appearances. If you are seeking a silly slasher flick where a bunch of silly teenagers get carved up by some psycho with a big knife then this movie is not for you. However, if you like old school scares in the Hammer Films tradition run to a theater near you and see The Woman In Black."
"alangsco","7","1","4","10 February 2012"," Decent atmospheric chiller
","Having first read the novel and watched a TV adaptation in my English class as a 14 year-old, I had pretty high expectations of this big- screen version. And overall I wasn't disappointed.<br/><br/>I felt the film capitalised well on the seclusion and isolation of the town and, more importantly, Eel Marsh House. You really do feel that there's no way out once Arthur Kipps (Daniel Radcliffe) is at the house. The house itself is suitably eerie and has you on edge for as long as Kipps is there.<br/><br/>There are plenty of little frights throughout the movie, but I didn't feel this ever became cheap and pointless like so many other films in the horror genre. Indeed, i'd classify this as an honest old-fashioned ghost story more than anything else. Daniel Radcliffe is clearly going to struggle to break away from his earlier role, but I thought this was a step in the right direction. I did actually care about what happened to the character, which is more than can be said for so many lead characters.<br/><br/>Where I felt the movie fell down was showing the dreaded Woman a little too much. It's that old thing where sometimes the more that's left to the audiences imagination the better. The setting was definitely creepy enough that they could have left her out of a few more scenes. I also didn't like the very end scene simply because it's not how I would have ended it. You'll have to decide for yourself though.<br/><br/>All in all I recommend this as a very worthwhile way of spending a couple of hours."

","I am a fan of the horror genre. However lately, American horror films have really deteriorated in quality, either they are rip-offs of Asian horror films or more of violent and gory ""Saw"" or ""Final Destination""- type films. As the poster and stills of this film promises a return to the old fashioned Gothic horror film, I made sure I watched this.<br/><br/>Set in Victorian England, ""The Woman in Black"" is about a young lawyer Arthur Kipps (Daniel Radcliffe) who had been assigned to a remote village to fix the papers regarding a certain estate. However, Kipps notes that many children are dying mysterious deaths, and the people seem to blame him for it. Are the deaths of the children related to the mysterious abandoned estate he is working on or the ""woman in black"" he sees lurking in its shadows?<br/><br/>From the ominous first scenes, we know this film would be special. I am pretty sure that a word that many reviewers will use to this describe this film is ""ATMOSPHERIC."" The creepy atmosphere that director James Watkins successfully achieves for this film is excellent. It will completely absorb you and bring you into that haunted village and house right along with Arthur Kipps. Yes, there were the usual jump scare techniques, but they were used to great effect. You will gasp in spite of yourself. The use of porcelain-faced dolls and wind-up toys may be old, but still very effectively used to further enhance the scariness of the scenes. Daniel Radcliffe does very well here. I did have a hard time accepting him as a young father at first, as his Harry Potter persona is still very fresh in our memories. <br/><br/>Overall, I liked this film very much. I thought I was already jaded after all those horror films I had seen before. This film still succeeded to give me genuine chills and jumps. The gloomy weather, desolate marshy location and antique set design were on point for creating the perfect atmosphere for dread. Okay, this is not at the level of ""Sixth Sense"" or ""The Others"", but it is definitely a step in the right direction as far as the horror genre is concerned. Despite a few illogical scenes (what ghost story film isn't without them?), I will whole-heartedly recommend this film for horror movie fans."
"vincentlynch-moonoi","7","1","4","8 February 2012"," Thumbs up for the movie, thumbs down for Radcliffe
","I went to see this film for two reasons. First, because I like old-fashioned ghost stories. Second, I was curious how I would like Daniel Radcliffe outside of his Harry Potter role.<br/><br/>In terms of being an old-fashioned ghost story, mission accomplished! And, this has some real chills in it. Not to mention a surprise ending that almost stunned me.<br/><br/>Now, in regard to Daniel Radcliffe, I have to admit to begin with that about half way through the Harry Potter films, I came to the conclusion that Rupert Grint and Emma Watson were far better actors than Radcliffe, and that in the long run, they were probably most likely to have long-lasting careers. Of course, we won't know that for a while yet. But in terms of his acting in this film, I was not particularly impressed with Radcliffe. Part of that may not be his fault. There are very, very long segments of this film with absolutely no dialog...perhaps as much silent time as in any film I have ever seen. Of course, my negativity only increased since I went to this film just a day or two after Radcliffe admitted being drunk in some scenes in the Harry Potter series, and that's not a trait of acting I respect...particularly in a children's film. The next Radcliffe film to come along -- well, I may go IF the film itself appeals to me, but not to see Radcliffe. Oh, and BTW, trim those eyebrows!!!!! In terms of the supporting cast, Ciarán Hinds deserves the most credit. Really a very nice performance.<br/><br/>A good film with a so-so starring actor. Okay to watch, once, but it won't find its way to my DVD shelf."

","I really enjoyed this movie. After several years of badly done horror movies (with the exception of Insidious), I can honestly say I go into the theater with very few expectations. I usually leave disappointed after an hour of plot-less, cheap hacking and slashing. The Woman in Black however, was a pleasant surprise. This creepy haunted house story set in a desolate marsh during the turn of the century, built suspense throughout the movie, giving you just enough glimpses of ""the woman"" to keep the audience on the edge of their seat until the truth is revealed. The costumes and set are very well done, and the acting is excellent. I suggest this film to any true horror fan."
"ftfelix","Null","1","4","8 February 2012"," The Power of Silence
","I recently developed a list of qualities a good haunted house should have.<br/><br/>Leaving visitors with an unnerving sense of ""something is not quite right here"" was one of them.<br/><br/>The film adaptation of ""The Woman In Black"" has this unnerving quality.<br/><br/>Horror isn't, as most reviews on this movie will agree, the use of gore and violent death, but the anticipation built from not being able to define what it is that doesn't feel right at the moment.<br/><br/>A majority of this movie isolates you, which is a key component to building that feeling of uneasy anticipation.<br/><br/>Coupled with isolation, the film also harnesses the power of silence -- a power so deafening that at the appropriate moments, even the faintest of sounds jolts you into a state of paranoia.<br/><br/>In addition, this film makes great use of background action and imagery. While you generally pay attention to the foreground, there are moments where images and action in the background (if you are paying attention) can freak you out (a la the famous ghost boy in the background of a scene in ""Three Men and a Baby"") If you prefer your horror movies to affect you on a mental and visceral level than a visual level, then this is the movie for you.<br/><br/>If you prefer slasher films, don't even bother."
"MovieCritic33-6","8","1","4","7 February 2012"," ""What did they see?"" A review on The Woman In Black:
","ACTORS: Daniel Radcliffe, Ciarán Hinds, Janet McTeer, Sophie Stuckey, and Liz White.<br/><br/>PLOT: A widowed lawyer (Daniel Radcliffe) is assigned to handle the affairs of an old estate, unaware of the dangers it has to offer, and the vengeful curse it has on whomever lays eyes on the woman in black.<br/><br/>ACTING: Startling and intense. Difficult to see Radcliffe play a character outside of the Harry Potter world, but manages to subdue our urge for him to lash out an ""expecto patronum"" spell.<br/><br/>SCRIPT/PREMISE: Loosely based on the novel by Susan Hill (from my knowledge). Original concept, but somewhat of another familiar ghost story in vain of ""The Ring"" and ""The Haunting"" (only set in the early part of the 20th century).<br/><br/>TONE: Dark, a mood piece getting its uneasiness from its gloomy atmosphere, haunting imagery, unnerving silences and frightening moments of ghostly encounters and ""cheap"" scares. Achieves a great deal of eeriness without the use of instrumentals a rarety nowadays.<br/><br/>PROS: Scary and eerie. Intriguing and mysterious. Terrifying visuals. A good length. One of the better ghost movies to have been made.<br/><br/>CONS: Some may not enjoy the amount of silence in this film. A mood piece not all will appreciate. Too many close ups of ""the woman in black"" risks making the film lose its edge. Some ""cheap"" scares.<br/><br/>VERDICT: I personally enjoyed the film, it was mostly refreshing for its genre, and haunting. If you like ghost stories or are into mood pieces, see this film. Otherwise you may not appreciate it."

Some complained at the end of the movie but they were actually the ones who were cursing at the screen, yelling, and jumping out of their seats when something popped out. This movie was so much different than others i have seen. THe suspense is wonderful, i mean at first your like wtf when is something going to happen and when you begin to think nothing will something does! lol. i also loved how there was no nudity or profanity in it, it was a REAL movie! just a thriller/horror in it's absolute perfection. You don't find many movies these days at least in America that doesn't have nudity, profanity, and the like. Its nice to see that this world hasn't gone completely insane. i also liked how you really had to think about what was going on and not just sit there, it was mind stimulating. now I'm a 15 year old saying this! haha. it could've been a tad more scary but it was great either way. Well if you get the chance you should really go out of your way and watch it, you wont regret it! Daniel Radcliffe did a great job in acting, nice to see him as someone other than Harry Potter."
"zzoaozz","9","1","4","7 February 2012"," Magnificent Ghost Story
","I enjoyed the original movie this one is based on a great deal and went into the theater hoping that the producers had remained true to the feeling of the original movie. For once, I was not disappointed. This is an excellent adaptation that changes just enough of the elements to make the movie reach a more modern audience. The updated special effects are done subtly so that they don't overpower the plot and mood of the movie. <br/><br/>The mood is what makes this move so unique and the way it builds up. Daniel Radcliffe is the beginning of that mood doing an excellent job of portraying a man who is already melancholy for personal reasons. He comes to a village that seems to be shrouded in a miasma of fear and superstition. The dark mood builds steadily unfolding at just the right pace to create and maintain tension to the movie's conclusion.<br/><br/>There are jump scenes in the movie, but they add to instead of destroying the tension. The acting is excellent. The story is solid and compelling, the characters are ones we can sympathize with. The setting is magnificent, the house and grounds and village all have their own unique personality. Even the use of color is carefully manipulated to create a sense of place and contrast of mood. The movie as a whole is a beautiful piece of art. <br/><br/>This is the best ghost story I have seen in a very long time and as a fan of horror, that is saying a great deal."
"Fields201","7","1","4","6 February 2012"," Harry Potter and the Woman In Black
","Let's face it: The main reason for this movie's success is people want to see Daniel Radcliffe stretch his acting muscles beyond Harry Potter. I happen to be one of those people. I also like a good haunted house story so there were two good things going for this movie. A lot of people told me to go see Chronicle instead but nope, I was determined to see this.<br/><br/>The film stars Daniel Please-Don't-Typecast-Me-As-Harry-Potter Radcliffe who must leave his son to go battle a haunted house with a witch and zombie children. It is here where his son draws pictures of his dad never smiling and his dad is like, ""Hey, you're right. I don't smile!"" And keeps not smiling.<br/><br/>The townspeople hate him because he doesn't want to be in anymore Harry Potter movies and they even block his path to continue his plot in the haunted house. Once there, a lot of creepy things happen like strange loud noises up the stairs that he must go and investigate.... with a candle and an ax. I mean, this is some loud noises he has to go investigate and what he sees would make me run out of the house like a screaming girl. Somehow, he finds time to sleep which after being terrorized by the zombie children and have scary faces appear at you in an otherwise creepy looking house would probably make me want to catch a few Zs too. Of course it doesn't go very well but luckily he had a dog to bark to wake him up.<br/><br/>Woman In Black has plenty of jump scares and tension filled moments. I had to mark the review down because of the ending. It really isn't a bad ending or anything but some of the things that happen seemed either pointless or stupid. Like why lock Harry's friend in a room when nothing was going to happen to either one of them? And to not to give the ending away, but the scene between mother and son: I doubt the mother would be that happy.<br/><br/>But one thing I'm thankful for is that Woman In Black was a pretty good movie. I was scared going on, not because I thought the film was going to be scary, but I thought it was going to disappoint me like that godawful Don't Be Afraid of the Dark movie. It wasn't anything like that. If you excuse me, I'm late for Hogwarts."

And boy, am I glad I did! I am a horror movie buff, and I don't consider it a good horror flick unless I have to close my eyes. This movie made me more than do that, I was screaming and jumping. The story line was clever and thrilling, and I like how the main characters life intertwined with the lives of the characters within this small creepy town. Whenever the sun went down, I knew I was going to be on the edge of my seat. Daniel Radcliffe also proved that he wasn't just Harry Potter! I highly recommend this movie, I loved every second!"

"Michael_Elliott","Null","1","5","26 February 2012"," Some Good Atmosphere but Not Enough Scares
","The Woman in Black (2012) <br/><br/>** 1/2 (out of 4) <br/><br/>Hammer Films' latest about young lawyer Arthur Kipps (Daniel Radcliffe) who travels to a small village to close up on an estate but not realizing that the town is haunted by a vengeful ghost who had her son stolen from her years earlier. Now, every time someone sees the woman their child dies from mysterious circumstances. THE WOMAN IN BLACK is almost a good horror film but there were just a few too many flaws for me to completely the enjoy the film. I think there are quite a few good moments sprinkled throughout the movie but in the end there just wasn't enough scares for me to give the film a better mark. I think director James Watkins does a pretty good job with the visual style of the movie and he also manages to build up some interesting atmosphere. The film is clearly trying to be a throwback to those old ghost and Gothic movies from the 1950s and there were countless times where you could feel the fog and atmosphere breathing down your neck. The one issue I had is that the movie was never really scary. Perhaps we've just witnessed too many ghost stories over the past few years but the old-fashioned scare tactics here never really work. The director certainly can build up the jump sequence but I never felt the pay-off was there and several times instead of scares we get those loud ""jump"" scenes where something loud happens and to me this isn't a scare. The performances in the film were all pretty good with Radcliffe doing a nice job with his character as he's able to give it some depth. Both Ciaran Hinds and Janet McTeer offer up fine support as well. THE WOMAN IN BLACK has a fairly effective, if predictable ending, that almost saves the movie. There's no doubt that those who appreciate those Gothic films of the 50s should be entertained for nostalgia alone but in the end the film still needed a tad bit more."
"Prichards12345","7","1","5","18 February 2012"," Great first hour, then runs out of steam
","For an hour or so The Woman In Black is a wonderfully spooky film, with a central 20-odd minute sequence almost devoid of dialogue that's a real stand-out: Ratcliffe exploring the house though darkened corridors and shadowy rooms, encountering incredibly effective supernatural manifestations - the sequence with the rocking chair is one of the most frightening things I've ever seen in a horror movie; and yet it's very subtle, too. Of course the story is basically a bunch of M.R. James clichés - the evil looking dolls, the shrouded figure, the soft pounding noise, the sudden appearance of the monstrous apparition behind our hero, etc. But the movie handles those clichés with splendid effect.<br/><br/>Unfortunately the last 30 minutes is a bit of a let down after what's gone before. The ending, which should have focused on the result of the train encounter, instead gives us what can only be called sentimental rubbish. I'm trying not to spoil things by being too explicit here.<br/><br/>Daniel Radcliffe, who some people have called wooden on here, is perfectly fine in my view - if a little young for the role. He portrays an anguished solicitor trying to hang on to his job while still grieving over the death of his wife in child-birth. He resists the temptation to enter the national gurning championships when many other actors would have done so, and the film's well directed, long on atmosphere and jumpy moments, short on blood and looks splendidly spooky - the house in particular is wonderfully decrepit, fully realised by crisp yet atmospheric cinematography. <br/><br/>It's just a shame the ending is so weak. This would have been a classic had it sustained its creepy momentum. I think this is Hammer's first genuine ghost story - surprising as they made over 50 horror movies in their original incarnation. Inspite of the weak ending the movie is very good on the whole and well worth a view."
"eightyproofsunshinefilms","9","1","5","11 February 2012"," Definitely an eye peeker film....
","OK so I am a HUGE fan of all things horror, and thriller. This genre of film doesn't usually scare me, I just appreciate it.<br/><br/>When the trailers and reports on this film first began coming out I paid very little attention as I wanted to be surprised. With it's Gothic house and creepy looking locations I was hooked right away. Plus it has Daniel Radcliff in it so I was excited to see him as something other then Harry. I have a 1 yr old so going to movies to see anything besides children's films can be difficult. And so i made my first mistake. I went to see this BY MYSELF. NOT SMART. I went during a weekday and was the only one in the theater, again NOT GOOD. But because i didn't know much about this film I expected it would be a creepy little ghost story and have some moments of AUUGH to it. It opens with 3 little girls playing in an attic. Tea party with a cracked porcelain doll. Took me a moment to realize it was also a Period film. NO CLUE it was set in the 1800's. So after they slowly go out a window it flashes back to Arthur's memory of his wife. You realize she has died and he is left alone with a child. In order to pay his bills and keep his job he is leaving to go take care of the final paperwork for his law firms client who has died. Fast forward to a creepy village where all the weirdos seem to live. They see him coming and as if he carried the plague run inside and lock their doors and hide their kids. I was confused at first until he got to THE HOUSE> (It was about this point that a couple walked into the theater quietly and since i have fantastic peripheral vision i noticed movement and almost jumped out of my skin! They went to the very back of the theater. ) So there we were watching as Arthur first sees the EEL MARSH house. HOLY MOLY! What a mansion by the sea. Although it was very fabulous one time it is now basically in shambles. My thoughts, who the heck walks into a place like that anyway? NOT ME! So he goes inside and low and behold the place is filled with the creepiest decorations ever. The set designers really went all out on this with chandeliers made of antlers and creepy pictures on the wall. AND DO NOT GET ME STARTED ON THE SCARY TOYS IN THE NURSERY! THE CLOWN DOLL MADE ME WANT TO RUN Things begins to happen quickly and like most ghost stores he goes in search of the bumps in the night. Again, WHY GO RUNNING AFTER IT? The Camera-work was fantastic. It really sucks you into the moments, as he does things like if Arthur is rounding a corner it switches to basically his point of view so the viewer is thrust into the rooms and around dark corners first when only seconds ago the creepy sound was or the ghostly hand. (At this point that other couple has decided to leave. I heard the girl back there begging to leave, that she couldn't take the intensity any more. I too at this point was ready to just say get me the heck outta dodge and run. SO instead I zipped my coat basically up to my eyeballs and hunkered down in my seat as they slowly creeped out of the theater, only to leave me alone and shaking in the darkness. BAM! The Woman in Black just hung herself and I almost peed my pants. SCREW THAT ROCKING CHAIR IM OUT!) Yeah lets not even talk about the child who drank lye, and the one who lights the place on fire, or the creepy lady who has her ""twins"" sitting at the dinner table while she carves pictures into her table. Again, this film does not have tons of dialogue, it does not have blood flying all over or a man carving people up with a machete. What it has are REAL ELEMENTS OF ACTIVITY that scare you to death. If you are scared of the dark, do not be an idiot like me and sit through this all alone. If you hate clowns, creepy dolls, and even creepier children, again do not go see it alone because it has all of that. OH AND DID I MENTION THE WOMAN IN BLACK?> OH Lord those eyes. By the end i was so freaked out that the credits came up and I had missed a lot of things hiding in my coat. I could barely get up to leave. I finally made a dash for it and ran out of the theater and down to the concession stand where people looked at me like I was insane. However, that being said, the film was done brilliantly! Again the set design, props used, camera work, locations, editing, AND the acting really made this film feel like an amusement park ride. You not only had to guess what was around the corner you had to go and LOOK. Or be like me and hide. I would recommend this film even if you do not scare easily or get creeped out because it is just done well with no extra tricks or CGI, it was refreshing to have a film tell an entire story using only things most people grow up afraid of. The dark, and things that go bump in the night. Next time I see this will be in my own home so i can snuggle my own dog and hide under my blankets instead.<br/><br/>PS- THE DOG LIVES! all I'm gonna say for you animal lovers out there."

","Three children are playing happy families in the attic without warning the children seem to get up in a sort of daze or trance and drop what they are doing and walk over to the window which of course has three open-able pans of glass which then lead them to walk out of the window to their death on the ground below, but who lead them? The mother screams in terror this is what sets the story in motion.<br/><br/>Arthur Kipps is seen packing his luggage ready to head of to work but just before he does Joseph Kipps Arthur's son played by Misha Handley which is in fact the real life godson of Daniel Radcliffe entered the room and shows his dad drawings which he has made to some up the weeks and each of the pictures which Arthur is in the drawing of him seems to have a sad face and the days which Arthur isn't there Joseph has left the pages blank but with a week ending drawing has a picture of his mother who has passed away so her drew her in a cloud in the sky symbolizing a angel in heaven. Arthur packed away the drawings given to him by Joseph and put them underneath the bills and paper work in his briefcase. Arthur arrived at the office to be told that there was a rather large and very costly case which needed addressing which also entailed a awful lot of paper which had to be finished at the home then sent back off to London which meant Arthur would been needing to stay at the town for a week to get the work finished and then to try and sell the property, Arthur was told there is a local solicitor going by the name of Jerom played by Tim McMullan has a large amount of paper work with him and to go visit him in the town. Boarded the Train Arthur then found himself falling asleep having flashbacks of the day his son was born which then lead to the maternal death of his wife Stella Kipps played by Sophie Stuckey which haunts Arthur and tries not to believe in paranormal and ghosts but he can still feel her there with him and guiding him. Arthur is then awoken to find a man and his dog sitting opposite him on the train who introduced himself as Daily Played by Ciarán Hinds who then knew his name and propose for visiting the small remote village as the paper work was left beside Arthur as he slept the man then said 'You wont sell the property to a local person' and offered to give Arthur a lift to the guest house where he was staying as it was to be told that it was quite a distance from the train station and it was also pouring with rain. Arriving at the guest house there seemed to be a problem or more of a case of not wanting to have Arthur staying the night even though Arthur confirmed the booking after much discussion with the hotel owners it was agreed that Arthur would stay but he would have to stay in the attic.<br/><br/>Arthur was then ushered out of the door to see his horse and cart transport , Arthur then told the driver there had been a change of location to their journey which cost him six shillings to change the mind of the driver to take Arthur as far as he could to the house, The house was located away from the village and the path which lead to the house often got washed away in the tide so only at certain times of the day and night could you be able to get to and from the house which meant the driver of the house and cart suggested a time for Arthur to be picked up to travel back to the village. Arthur then got to work at sorted the paper work from different locations in the house and this is where most of the jumpy moments start through the film where in a packed cinema and being a 12A meant that all the squeamish young girls and there friends where they on any moment which could make you jump but that's not saying none of the guys weren't scared they tended to hide it by talking loudly or laughing to cover the fact they was scared, Arthur had to look under the bed for some more documents only to look up and see a hand of what looked like a child on a glass door opposite the bedroom where he was searching for documents which then lead Arthur to the room to then look out the window to see a Woman In Black standing out there looking at him. The great use of sound moving around the old house and dark camera work really give it a haunted house feeling to it with Daniel Radcliffe not looking anything like Harry Potter what so ever and really got into character and fitted the role, the use of lighting as well in the darken areas of the film meant that things could go bump in the night and more often then not did, there is indeed some parts of the film which may make you laugh but for most of it your hanging off your seat and looking out for things moving in the shadows as focused camera work plays a key part of the film as well where something popping in and out of focus does tend to play on your mind. Some scenes of the film are a little far fetched but doesn't overwhelm it too much and still does what it puts out to do and tell a scary story of a Woman In Black who is punishing the locals for what they did to her and what they didn't do to help her."

","This movie felt like a test. I had to use up so much of my energy to not make Harry Potter jokes throughout. I failed. I couldn't help but hear EXPECTO PATRONUM echo in my head every time the dementor-like woman in black appeared. The very last scene of the movie is so similar to a scene in the last Harry Potter movie that I couldn't help but laugh.<br/><br/>Despite the typecasting, Daniel Radcliffe did brilliant in his first big non-Harry Potter role. He also shows something that many of the Harry Potter actors have started to prove—they know which scripts to take. This movie would have been great with any actor. With Radcliffe in the lead, however, it gave a unique perspective on the story that made it much better than I expected.<br/><br/>For a horror-flick, the director has to be good. With James Watkins, this movie was destined to be great. I lost count of how many times I jumped with fright. At first, they were cheap shots. As the movie progressed, however, so did the creepiness. The anticipation builds so well during several parts in the movie that you can't help but jump. I hate to admit that, just seconds before a terrifying moment, I couldn't help but close my eyes.<br/><br/>The down-side of The Woman in Black is in the structure of the storyline. The setup and eventual conclusion of why the woman in black does what she doesdoesn't make sense. It works well for the effect of creepiness. But when you honestly look at it, it doesn't work. As the movie concludes, it only gets worse. The final scene leaves so much more to be desired.<br/><br/>If you want a scary movie, this is the one for you. This is the best horror I have seen I some time. You will jump. You will regulate your breath with excited anticipation. You will be pleasantly surprised at Radcliffe's abilities as an actor. You may not be satisfied at the end, but the journey is more than worth it."
"thedork-2","9","1","5","6 February 2012"," Excellent Cinematography with one problem.
","Loved the film. Loved the plot and loved the jump cuts. The cinematography was excellent until the last 20 minutes of the film. The film had an old-fashioned ghost story element not unlike that of George C. Scott's ""The Changeling."" It kept me on my toes and interested and I didn't mind the scary jump cuts. <br/><br/>What I resented was about 20 minutes before the end of the film, the modern equivalent of horror movie filler. ""We've run out of scare tactics so we're going to throw a dark haired white ghostly figure at you. Its mouth will extend to an inhuman position and it will give an ear-piercing-only-dogs-can-hear-you-now scream."" Once just wasn't enough. The first scream was followed up ten minutes later by a second scream. The film would have been PERFECT if not for the switch to modern day horror tactics. It already had the hair on the back of the audience's collective neck standing, and did not need the cheap CGI Japanese horror changeover. Great plot, great editing, great cast, great feel, horrible scream."

","As far as horror films go, this one is decent. our easily scared, this film will not disappoint, but for the heavy duty horror buffs (like me) this film won't disappoint, but won't have you covering your eyes.<br/><br/>Although fairly predictable, and having no presence of gore, the film is still very enjoyable and worth watching. Most horror buffs think horror flicks need to have blood, guts, and a crazy serial killer to be considered to be scary; this film has a little bit of blood, has a serial killer (not typical one), but no guts. What it lacks in gore it makes up for suspense and a great storyline.<br/><br/>The acting is average, the setting and period costumes were great, and are dear Harry Potter has grown up to be a great versatile actor. The Woman in Black, was actually very creepy and the best character of the whole film was the Marsh where all of this took place, just the though of driving up that very narrow road surrounded by muck sends chills down my spine.<br/><br/>So a 7 out of 10 is given for this film just because I personally wasn't afraid,but give it a chance and enjoy it for what it is."

It is so simply an old fashioned horror movie that from the very beginning I was looking for the moment I knew that it would be terrible, but that moment never came. This is what I liked about it: 1) The scary part didn't come from some super natural devil/alien/psycho killer possession/revenge etc.<br/><br/>2) The scary part came from the old fashioned idea that a terrible wrong had been done to a poor innocent and when she died she couldn't rest and worked diligently at getting her revenge.<br/><br/>3) The ghost is an actual character, scary, mean, vengeful and present.<br/><br/>4) Daniel Radcliffe is very awesome.<br/><br/>5) Daniel Radcliffe's character is awesome.<br/><br/>6) It exceeded my expectations.<br/><br/>7) Not everything happened the way that I anticipated which made the movie not predictable, but enough things did so that it was actually logical.<br/><br/>8) The end was spectacular - again old-fashioned, not predictable, but logical so that you didn't leave feeling like it was dumb and would never happen in the course of events in the movie.

","Eerie is the perfect word to describe this movie. Went to see it a week before it came out with friends, and I can honestly say I reached for my jacket almost six times throughout the movie to cover my eyes! The intense sounds that were played during the movie, will make your heart beat constantly. Especially, when it music stops, and there is just dead silence. Daniel Radcliffe, plays Arthur Kipp, in the movie. And not to put (Harry Potter) in this,but Daniel defiantly broke out of his comfort zone compared to his other films. Daniel too me, doesn't really fit the ""adult or father"" figure in the movie,meaning appearance-wise, but his acting will blinded you from this in a good way. As soon as he steps in to this small, remote village, the suspense, horror, and thriller begins. <br/><br/>-The most taunting parts of the movie, starts when Daniel is in a room and looks out the window, and finds the women in black standing in the graveyard staring at him. Then a crow appears in the room distracting him, and once he looks back she is gone.<br/><br/>-When Daniel wanted to know what was behind the locked door, since the other doors in the house where unlocked, he rushed downstairs to retrieve an axe, and once he runs back up the stairs to the room, the door is completely open. <br/><br/>-(Shown on Trailers), when Daniel looks out the window, and puts his hand over a old hand print plastered on the window. He stares at his reflection, then instantly the women in black's face appears screaming right back at him. ~~~~ The movie's plot is written well, the story doesn't fall short, and will make you think twice about having kids...! (It really won't)<br/><br/>You will feel sympathy for The Women in Black, you will hate her, and you'll fear her at the same time, which makes this movie very good, and one of a kind."

"truemythmedia","7","0","1","8 October 2019"," Better than Most PG-13 Horror Flicks
","Overall, ""The Woman in Black"" is not a great film, but it is a competently made genre film that succeeds in holding my attention from start to finish. Most of this film's thrills come from the atmosphere. The world of Eel Marsh House is dilapidated and poorly lit, the home itself is only accessible during low tide, as the road is covered by water during high tide, effectively turning the Home into an island (I kept thinking of the house featured prominently in Roman Polanski's ""Cul-De-Sac""). Curtains of gossamer hang from the ceiling, and candlelight does little to banish the encroaching shadows. Elements like these are staples of gothic horror (and Hammer films!) and this film is a treasure trove for gothic horror atmosphere if it's nothing else. I can almost guarantee in twenty years no one will really remember this movie, but it's entertaining enough that if you stumble upon it on Netflix or any other streaming service, it would be worth your time."
"jon-c-ison","5","0","1","28 September 2019"," Great atmosphere but lacking psychodrama
","A beautifully filmed and atmospheric Victorian era ghost story, in a great location and with wonderful spooky sets. The focus is on the lead character and a very, very haunted house, the history of which is gradually revealed. I liked the slow pacing to begin, the retro atmosphere, the house itself which is amazingly staged, and the few genuinely creepy and shocking moments. The problem is the movie does not quite manage to build tension and fear in an an incremental way, and relies too much on cliched devices. And although the characters and their history come out nicely in the storytelling, somehow the ""vengeful ghost"" idea isn't very convincing, and this sort of breaks things, including the unsatisfactory ending. Worth a watch though."

","I am always caught and interested by the various horror movies and the differing plots, actors, stories and directors.
Some are better, some are worse and some are simply not worth your time.<br/><br/>A lot of these reviews speak badly of the typical clichés of which an old-reigning horror movie would hold, yet I can understand the effect of which it holds on just any horror movie. The thrill of the chase when the zoom fronts on the face, the sudden clashes of sounds, and the screams of a demon sprinting towards the shot.<br/><br/>What I do not like, is such a build up to an amazing ending acted out by an amazing actor of which truly brings the whole movie to life (Daniel), whereas the whole story is rippled apart by the death of the main character, and the ""return of evil"" despite the good effort put throughout the whole play.
When finally the ending is supposed to take a soft turn of better ambiance, and when you've finally got through the nerve-gritting horror and the genre as a whole, you're flattened by a monumental waste of time.<br/><br/>Yes, I know vast, classical and -very- good horror movies have an eerie ending, but one of which wipes out the whole point, plot and catch of the movie is absolutely ridiculous.<br/><br/>The actors did an amazing job, and that is why I give it 3/10 rating. Daniel, Ciarán, and the scattered child actors of which portrays the dead. Fabulous. That was the worth of the movie. If you'd therefore like to watch Daniel Radcliffe perform his craft of art, do give it a watch."

"nogodnomasters","8","0","1","22 June 2019"," CHASING SHADOWS
","The movie hits on all the classic stereotypes of a ghost story. There is a haunted mansion in an isolated marsh thick with fog. There is a past of a haunted suicide and a recent will. The village has a secret. The house has ghostly images, squeaks, creaks, whispers, things that move on their own, and a raven that enters it.<br/><br/>Our main character has a wife who has died in child birth and for some undisclosed reason this is his ""last chance"" with his firm so he just can't walk away. In the beginning, Radcliffe wears his hair down over his forehead leading me to suspect he really does have a permanent mark in the shape of a lightning bolt.<br/><br/>There is a mystery that is supposed to draw you in, but having seen so many clichés you wonder if this film will offer you anything new.<br/><br/>As the poorly developed Arthur (Daniel Radcliffe) sorts through the papers in the house he uncovers letters which sheds some light unto the situation, and we get to see his bolt free forehead. Radcliffe was neither an asset nor a liability. His agent did him well, but I thought he mustered more fear and terror as that Potter guy in the late sequels than he did in this film. He seems to have trouble with convincing facial expressions.<br/><br/>The strength of the film is in how well it utilizes all those haunted mansion clichés, the lighting...or lack of it, and the detailing of the era. Arthur is played as a rather dull character. There are things that happen to him which would have made me leap out of skin and run out the house, yet he does very little. Also Arthur is quiet as he encounters the unknown, perhaps done to build up the scare factor, but I wonder how that would have worked with a character who talks to the ghost while searching about, maybe with a comical line or two taken from ""Hold That Ghost"" or someone like Joe Pesci swearing obscenities at it.<br/><br/>Parental Guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity. Safe for the kids to watch on a foggy night if you want to scare the bejesus out of them."

","The Woman in Black as a book is one of all time favourites, a chilling story written by Susan Hill. For this adaption to be a success it had to stay true to its source, and for the most part it did. Watkins did leave out and tweak a few things, for the better? Im not so sure, however as it story it was still rewarding. As for directing, he managed to replicate many of the chills through atmosphere and general spooks. They were a little cliche but as good as it possibly could get. I thought Daniel Radcliffe did well in his role although not overly convinced.

"mrosesteed","7","0","1","24 March 2019"," Scary but somewhat generic
","Produced by a resurrected Hammer Film Productions, The Woman in Black is a frightening ghost story in the gothic tradition of that studio's mid-century horror films. Although it trades the lurid colors of those earlier features for a bleak, subdued, desaturated palette, it mirrors their relatively high production values with solid art direction and lavish, detailed period sets and costumes. Effectively creepy, The Woman in Black relies heavily on sound to draw the protagonist into dangerous situations, and shock the audience with loud noise scares. In spite of this last generic and occasionally confusing tactic (it is sometimes unclear which of these latter sounds the characters can hear and which are part of the non-diegetic musical score) the entire soundscape does enhance the film's ominous atmosphere and allow for the substitution of images obscured by dark or fog for less mysterious or more costly visual effects."

","The Woman in Black, is the best known version of a story which began as a novel and was made into a 1989 TV movie and a play, and has been followed by a sequel film. Starring Daniel Radcliffe of Harry Potter fame, and featuring Ciarán Hinds (Mance Rayder in Game of Thrones) and Roger (DI Fred Thursday in Endeavour,) The Woman in Black is an old fashioned Gothic horror story, set in a creepy house in a remote weird village, where the disconsolate ghost of a woman who had lost her child takes vengeance by killing the children of the village. Radcliffe plays a young lawyer sent to sort out the affairs of the house's deceased owner. The film is a mixed bag: the early 20th century atmosphere is very vividly realized, and the film gets its effect from well done continual menace rather than gory special effects. It's been criticized for going through every horror film cliché in the books -- mysteriously hostile village yokels, a haunted mansion, furniture moving with no one in it, etc. -- though these standard characteristics are very well done. My main dissatisfaction personally is that the film sets us up for a basically happy ending which it then fails to deliver.<br/><br/>You'll want to watch this if you are a real fan of ghost stories. The CBS Films Blu-Ray disc is of excellent quality. Advisory: rated PG 13, the main caution is that some people (not everyone) say they find it genuinely scary."

","It could have been worse, but also a lot better. The atmosphere is great, Gothic, darkly and captivating, the first half an hour is interesting enough, but after a while it all goes astray. Plenty of cheap jump scares (way too many), all of the same kind (a sudden apparition), the storytelling gets slower and slower and nothing much happens until the very predictable climax. There's also an attempt at a twist end, but that doesn't work either.<br/><br/>What got me the least about this movie is the huge amount of horror clichés, I won't spoil anything, but let me just say that the story itself is a clichè in its entirety. And also the acting of the main character is disappointing, it is quite dull and lacking any expressiveness. The guy only has one single expression (something like an astonished fish) throughout the movie, whatever occurs to him or to other people around. <br/><br/>If you get scared by this and you're past your teen years, probably horror is not your genre of film and you should watch something else."

","What is amazing about this movie is that there is nothing particularly dynamic, fresh or unique--but I still liked it. I think I liked it because it was done well, the story was nice and tight, and maybe because of the core element of the story: the lady in black and the kids.<br/><br/>The movie starts off with three lovely little girls opening a second story window and jumping to their deaths. No, they didn't show splattered little girls on the ground but it was just so eerie how they robotically and in unison stood up, walked to the window, opened it and jumped. And that's what I think makes the movie captivating; the fact that the town wanted to protect their children.<br/><br/>The movie was ominous and dark though it isn't one of the scariest movies I've seen.

","The woman in black is a truly terrifying film to watch. This movie definitely is not one of those run of the mill stupid cheesy horror films, this movie scared me to death in almost every scene. Daniel Radcliffe is very affective as the lead, and did very well in my opinion, he was very believable. The movies setting is very affective and has an eerie feel to it. The costume design was spot on, and so was the script! The scares are genuine and very bone chilling! They don't resort to the stupid cliché over used and ineffective jump scares. The film is also beautifully shot, it looks very slick and well directed! The storyline is very interesting and intriguing. The characters are creepy and perfect for this type of movie. The woman in black is a very eerie, frightening, and creepily effective film with very good acting. 10/10 for the woman in black."

","I went into this movie knowing that the ratings were good, but hearing that it wasn't that great. Unfortunately, I found next to nothing enjoyable about this movie. <br/><br/>The plot is, although interesting-ish, rushed and never fully developed. Despite the beginning of the movie being incredibly dragged out, it was dragged out with absolutely nothing. There was next to no content in the first hour of the movie. You might as well skip the first hour, you'll probably like it more and understand just as much. <br/><br/>The characters are below average. Like I said, this movie is very rushed. So along with the plot being rushed, the characters follow. There's some forced in back story stuff at the beginning, but the characters are incredibly stale and flat. Nothing special. <br/><br/>The movie as a whole is just boring, especially the first hour. Sure, there are some things that could qualify as 'horror', but they were so unbelievably unscary that the whole movie ended up feeling more and more like a failure over anything else. 'Fear of the unknown' was used during this time, but none of the fear was known to the main character, so I was never tense or scared for him at all. He didn't know he had reason to be afraid, and in the end he didn't. They made that clear early on. <br/><br/>After the first hour the horror actually becomes good...for about ten minutes maybe. I actually enjoyed those ten minutes and had hope for the movie suddenly, wondering if this would be the rest of the movie. Nope, I was wrong. Afterwards it declined into boredom once again with several cups of stupidity thrown in this time.<br/><br/>Overall The Woman in Black is just really boring. Nothing happens. Ever. Sure, it was good for about ten minutes, but the other 85 minutes were just a waste, and I had to spend an hour getting to those few precious minutes. Sure, it wasn't impossible to watch, but it was pretty unpleasant to. Somehow the movie manages to move too fast yet be extremely boring. In the end there is no way I would ever recommend The Woman in Black."

","Traditional horror movies with ghosts in the classic sense are no longer as popular as they used to, so the move to make a film adaptation on this subject brought some freshness in this sub-genre. They chose an excellent material for the recording, the popular novel from Susan Hill, and gave it to the chosen writers and gathered a quality team of actors together, so that the final product could not fail. There are many clichés and individual attributes repeats from popular movies, but on the other hand it can be seen as a realistic replication eerie atmosphere at so many times tried and tested method that does not make mistakes. Quality horrors, in my opinion, give us pounding tension as the film progresses and the end of the film is reduced to an explosive scene that resolves it all. With this film it is not that case. From the start the viewers are given tense scenes that do not escalate at the end, so that the film is more thriller than horror."

In an effort to find a document in the home of a client who died, Kipps disturbs a mysterious and vengeful entity that kills children in the nearby village. From there, he will have to face the wrath of this supernatural force, the fear of the villagers and his own fear.<br/><br/>Directed by James Watkins, this psychological horror film messes with what we consider more valuable: the children and their safety. This fact is important for the film to be as daunting as it is: no one wants to see an innocent child suffer. The main role is played by Daniel Radcliffe (the eternal Harry Potter), who manages to comes into our hearts by the ingenuity and innate goodness that his character shows. We can see that he doesn't realize what is happening and he want no harm to anyone. And like him, the audience only understands all the facts in middle of the movie. Curious fact: we never see the face of the ""woman in black"" long enough for us to fully realizing its features.<br/><br/>This film has excellent visual and sound effects and a gloomy, hazy photography that just makes us even more nervous and apprehensive. The ambiance, decor, toys, everything should be welcoming in a family home is, in this film, used to enlarge our sense of discomfort. Do not see it alone."
"Scarecrow-88","7","0","1","9 July 2015"," The Woman in Black
","Old school Gothic period chiller, adequately atmospheric, with a genuinely melancholy, tragic, and sufficiently morbid and spooky story, enhanced by the traditionally melodramatic score has a grief-stricken widow (Daniel Radcliffe) sent to the ""Eel Marsh House"" to ""settle documents"" for her estate,running into locals who want him to leave immediately. Something about the place, and how children continue to die, leaving plenty of sad parents and curiously cold townsfolk who treat Radcliffe as an unwelcome outsider. Radcliffe was told by his boss at the law firm (a rather cold- hearted sort who realizes his employee lost a wife yet warns him of being successful or else in his duties at the Marsh house) to go through all documents/paperwork before coming back, making sure everything's in order. What Radcliffe can't anticipate is a child-killing ghoul dubbed ""the woman in black"". Few are at all kind to him except a grieving man named Arthur (Ciaran Hinds) who lost his son to drowning and has a wife who believes the boy speaks through her. The townsfolk, a ""superstitious bunch"" (as Arthur considers them), make Radcliffe's life a bit difficult, feeling he's responsible for any further harm that might befall their township. The Marsh house is a dynamo of art design, with the wallpaper, banisters, doors, furniture, portraits, candelabras, fireplace, windows, and architectural decadence providing the appropriate backdrop for eerie goings-on. The outer design of the house is given a decaying elegance while the inside has enough dispersed lanterns and candlelight to embellish the aging furnishings that give the house its bleak ambiance. There's plenty of the woman's presence in various shots like facial appearances in windows (even a real good one right next to Radcliffe as he looks out a window at the willowy courtyard below), off-distance throughout the house, and in faint glimpses, all done to convey that she's around, not quite dead. The score could be tiresome to those who aren't fond of aural cues meant to make you jump or jar you out of your complacency. Ending is both haunting and beautiful at the same time...the woman in black is driven and rarely fails in her mission to live up to her reputation. Toys, a rocking chair, haggard writing on a wall, the ghosts of dead children in the woods near the house, a cemetery deep in those woods, and even the sight of a hanging ever so briefly: lots of items and visual images to emulate how the woman in black has and continues to make her presence felt. A particularly shocking scene has a girl set herself on fire at the urging of the woman in black: it is one simple motivation for her, and that is to take the children from those that took her boy. The film's chief terrifying scenario has Radcliffe's son arriving to meet him with the nanny by film's end. The usual trappings--the ""marsh"", fog, candles only for proper visibility, and the old, dark house--are all accounted for. If you look for these, you're in luck. If you don't...avoid. As most of these movies go: the ghoul could be satisfied if the protagonist can uncover what she so desires. In this film's case: finding the woman in black's son, bringing him to her, and perhaps giving him a ""proper burial."" As to be expected, this film has impeccable lighting and photographic work to add to the gothica."
"dexter-vane","4","0","1","20 May 2015"," Cheap horror but OK to watch
","""The Woman In Black"" is an alright horror movie. I watched it, and I have to say that it got to me, but only through cheap jump scares. The jump scares worked, but let's be honest, the jump scare is the lowest form of horror. There was no real horror or any tension building. The movie tried to do that, but it relied a lot on horror movie clischeès. The story is also a little overused. It's basically the classic ghost story: a ghost seeking revenge for the loss of a person close to them. Daniel Radcliff's performance was nothing special, but he didn't do a bad job. All on all a watchable horror movie, although the classic, sometimes even uncreative jump scares (for example the keyhole-scene) don't manage to cover the mediocre movie."
"Wizard-8","Null","0","1","1 April 2015"," Some genuine atmosphere, but there are some problems
","I was curious to see what the new Hammer film production company would do making a horror movie for the 21st century, so that's why I sat down to watch ""The Woman In Black"". After seeing it, my feelings are kind of mixed. First, the good things in the movie. The LOOK of the movie is great; you can really feel the cold and dark environment the characters are in, and the sets and special effects are very good. In part due to this, director James Watkins also manages to build a genuinely eerie feeling throughout. He also gets good performances out of his cast - you can believe the movie's characters are living and breathing people.<br/><br/>However, the movie also has some shortcomings. For starters, the movie throughout presents a level of horror that's kind of light. It's generally with people thinking they are seeing or hearing things, and it doesn't progress more than that. That's a fine way to start a horror movie, but I eventually got a little impatient - I wanted some stronger shocks eventually. Another problem is that the movie is somewhat slow and drawn out. There's enough material for an hour long ""Twilight Zone"" episode, but there's not enough story here for a feature film. While I was never bored, I could clearly see that the movie was often spinning its wheels.<br/><br/>In the end, the movie is overall okay. It definitely has some good stuff, but it also has some issues that clearly should have been worked on before filming started. Wait until it comes on cable during a slow weekend."
"Lucabrasisleeps","7","0","1","22 January 2015"," Not as good as the original but still effective
","The original movie was very quiet, creepy and had very less special effects. The remake, while being effective, is obviously of the new style of American horror with the over the top jump scares sometimes. Thankfully it doesn't go as over the top as some other recent British horror movies (example being Descent part 2). <br/><br/>The biggest problem I find with the remake is Daniel radcliffe. The guy is too young for this role. No way he seems mature enough to do such a role and he seems overwhelmed by it all. I can't take him seriously as an adult (yes I know he is) and certainly not as a father of a kid. I think there are far more mature and good looking actors in Britain who could have done this role. <br/><br/>But disregarding that fact, it is quite an effective horror film. Honestly though, it reminded me most of recent American horror such as Insidious and Conjuring. Which means constant jump scares, with faces in the window, loud music, screaming ghosts (now why would they do that?). I don't mind the style though, I enjoyed it quite a bit. Just that people coming to watch the movie for the old atmospheric British style would be disappointed. I didn't mind the changes that were done. Why is the wife dead in the remake? It doesn't make any difference except it makes the ending happier I guess. Also the whole ""The Ring"" style searching for bodies and all - I think we have seen enough of these plots where you need to find the body to make the ghost happy or whatever. I think even this aspect is not there in the original. Also about the other guy's wife - I don't remember this at all. It has been a long time since I saw the original of course. <br/><br/>In terms of atmosphere, it does do a good enough job. I did think the music is a little overdone at points but that is to be expected in the Insidious school of film making. My favourite scenes were the scenes where they show the woman in black in the distance and also the scene in the fog. And of course there is a scene with, ugh, the dead body of a child...I hate stuff like that. <br/><br/>I liked the movie, an enjoyable modern horror movie.<br/><br/>7/10"
"alexcomputerkid","8","0","2","21 January 2015"," An important horror film.
","Out of everything that was trendy or popular in the film world, the Harry Potter movies were a favorite for me. Part of it was due to the original plot. Maybe because it was series that never let up and kept you interested from the first installment. Maybe because it was a series that knew how to use it's action, effects and atmosphere to it's advantage. Regardless, I always loved Harry Potter movies mostly because of the main actors. Director Chris Columbus used the approach of getting unknown child actors with Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Girn and Emma Watson to put in lead roles for the eight films.<br/><br/>After the success of the Harry Potter series which ran for over ten years, the main stars of this series were left in the awkward position of where to go with their careers. Really with all the money the actors made between them, none of them needed an acting role again. Girn has not being seen much and Watson has some big roles including Noah, The Perks of Being a Wallfollwer and Bling Ring. For now though it's Daniel Radcliffe who has the most interesting career away from the Harry Potter films. Going straight to theater, Radcliffe showed his passion and heart for acting. He also proved that he can take a risk by taking the lead role in the horror film Woman in Black for his first role after Harry Potter.<br/><br/>There are many reasons why the Woman in Black released in February of 2012 would be a risk. It's not like Radcliffe had ever done horror and horror seems unpredictable in terms of money and reception. A February release is never is the most busiest time of the year in terms of movie sales. Everything that could have gone wrong with Woman in Black actually went well though.<br/><br/>In the 1800's, lawyer Arthur Kipps (Radcliffe) heads out to collect the papers of a dead woman Crythin Gifford and help start the sale of her house. Once Kipps comes to this English town, he sees it is a town full a scared locals of all ages. Crythin Gifford's house is filled with odd noises and we start to learn the real history of Gifford. This is an old school ghost story that feels something out the 60's and 70's.<br/><br/>For a horror film, this has all familiar elements. It has creepy kids and a town threatening a visitor. Also there is a big and creepy house out in the middle of nowhere. It uses all the elements we've seen before but in a risky and interesting way.<br/><br/>The most important elements is the house itself. The house is something that sets up everything from jump scares, atmosphere and the plot. The scares aren't really anything special but they are creative and will be enough to scare the Harry Potter fans who are here for Radcliffe. The plot is thin and is sketchy on details. The plot also reminds me of Insidious from the same year. The atmosphere uses old British styles with a town that has similarities to the The Crucible from 1996.<br/><br/>The next biggest factor of the film is Daniel Radcliffe. Using a laid back style with good acting, Kipps comes off as very likable and also very caring about his child Joesph ( Misha Handley) who turns out to have bigger role then expected. Radcliffe carries this film through all it's acts and brings depth to the character which is really more than expected.<br/><br/>While providing a strong ending that takes a risk, Woman in Black is an impressive horror film for many reasons. It is a film that helped Hammer Film Productions get back on the map and most importantly put Radcliffe on his career path after the Harry Potter films. An important horror film."

At least in the beginning. When you sit and actually see how the story develops, you wish you would have never started it. If you don't like movies with ghosts and stuff you should never even look at it and forget about the existence of this movie.

"breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com","7","0","1","19 December 2014"," A good ghost creeper
","Ever since his introduction as Harry Potter from Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (2001), Daniel Radcliffe will forever be remembered as the child actor who grew up to play Potter all the way to adulthood. Since the finale to the franchise, Radcliffe has been working at his very best to lose that image. With that, he officially displayed this to the public with the release of this ghost story. Although it is not a far departure from the genre Radcliffe originally started with, it shows that he started gradually. The Harry Potter series was not horror related but it did have spiritual entities from time to time. This story is along those lines too but with a much darker intent.<br/><br/>Radcliffe plays Arthur Kipps, a widower of one son looking to keep his job at a tough law firm. When given one more chance to maintain his position at the firm, his task is to finalize the latest condemned house in a marsh. Turns out this particular house has a secret only the townsfolk seem to know about and do not like talking about it. For Mr. Kipps, it'll be an eye-opening experience he did not see coming his way. The only person kind enough to help Kipps is Sam Daily (Ciarán Hinds), one of the wealthy men of the area who provides what feels to be a foil to Kipps'. Kipps believes that spirits possibly exist, while Sam doesn't. Yet, even with their opposite views, they are both likable characters. This is where the writing succeeds in developing its protagonists thanks to Jane Goldman, who also wrote Kick-Ass (2010) and X-Men: First Class (2011).<br/><br/>Plus, James Watkins' direction lets the characters explore other avenues of solving certain issues differently than normal. Also there's the chilling background about the house in the marsh. Its story is tragic and unsettling. And how about that set design and camera work? Both go hand in hand. Tim Maurice-Jones' cinematography looks authentic with its backdrops and every picture has a very gray look, which not only matches the time period of this story but also sets the tone. Every color looks drained and almost to the point of ill. Kave Quinn's set design for the house is just too good. The entire house is that of what would look like if you returned to a house after two or more decades. Dusty, full of cobwebs, rickety floorboards and strange sounds. I get goosebumps just writing about it.<br/><br/>Marco Beltrami's score to the movie was also well thought through. Arthur Kipps had his own reoccurring theme and there was barely a track in the album that contained stings - which is nice for once. Frequently this is all the horror composers make in their scores and it gets not only repetitive but also tiresome. Beltrami comes up with some very creepy tunes. The only issues that arise in this movie are a few things. For one, pacing is a bit slow. This doesn't affect the overall flow but there are certain scenes that just feel like they drag sporadically. There's also continuity errors with which belongs to events that happened at a certain time. Specifically talking about how fast a body decays; the process of decay is slow but under certain conditions I'm sure the rate changes,...in this movie, it didn't seem to acknowledge that. Not too big of a deal, but it could make viewers curious,...briefly.<br/><br/>When it came to the horror elements to the film, there wasn't much at all specifically because of its PG-13 rating. But even for it's rating, it did have some very dark moments that were intense. The Woman in Black is not any better than Mary Shaw from James Wan's Dead Silence (2007). Nooo. However, along with that came the most cliché of horror movie tropes - jump scares. There are several moments where these particular jumps happen. Some work, while others don't. As mentioned before though, composer Marco Beltrami didn't include the stings in his album and that's appreciated. For horror movies, directors have to come up with some type of way to be either more creative with their jump scares or not use them at all. They are really becoming overused. As an overall experience though, it is a well made horror film that should be scene for any fan of the genre.<br/><br/>As one of the first movies Daniel Radcliffe doesn't play Harry Potter, he nails his part in this chilling ghost story. It has well-rounded writing, good music and even decent horror elements for a PG-13 movie."

I have had the privilege of seeing it twice and each time the superb staging and acting has blown me away. The stage play is based on the classic ""less is more"" theory and the moments of scary are limited to a few times but when they come they are nothing less than chilling and downright terrifying.<br/><br/>By contrast, The Woman in Black film is not scary in the slightest and the basic reason why is that we are bombarded scene after scene with ""scary"" faces and ghoulish spectres. It literally becomes a matter of going ""oh look another ghost and so what?"" The location are well thought through but the haunted house is one giant cliché. The acting is OK but the script gives them very little to work with. Daniel Radcliffe seems a really nice chap but he was miscast as a tragic widower as he cannot muster any emotion beyond ""mild alarm"". <br/><br/>Delivering such a poor film with such great source of material is one heck of a feat but the Hammer team manage to do this magnificently. <br/><br/>The last great act of the Hammer Company was in 1980 with the TV Series ""Hammer House of Horror"". Most episodes were really scary and one in particular ""The Two Faces of Evil"" was just about the scariest TV programme ever to grace our screens. I watched it as a 12 year old in 1980 and then as a 42 year old 30 years later. Both occasions were a thing of sleeping with the lights on afterwards.

This film has no tongue in cheek performances; it is superbly acted by Daniel Radcliffe and Ciaran Hinds. There are good actors in the background too, such as Janet McTeer, David Burke and Roger Allam. This was the real scary thing, aided by brilliant set dressing with some well used and sinister clockwork toys. An effective horror film? An involving thriller? Yes, definitely. The director casts a dingy light over the film, enhancing the feelings of the young lawyer, down on his luck and threatened with redundancy. The matter-of- fact assessment of his superior, Roger Allam, was chilling. Daniel Radcliffe is outstanding. I have never watched any of the Potter films, so this was the first time I'd seen him. He shines in the good company around him, which is a hard task. He is undoubtedly a convincing performer. I was pleased to see the word HAMMER on the start credits. The Hammer pedigree includes some dreadful crap but it also had remarkable success with Dracula, The Wickerman, and my favourite, The Witchfinder General. Hammer used good actors such as Ian Ogilvy, Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing. Melissa Stribling was gorgeous, and probably not a bad actress, but all I really recall of her is her sex appeal.

I felt this was strongly a kind of good film and here is why below.<br/><br/>The story is really quite well done with scenes being done well and the pacing never really picks which pace it wants to go at, but it works out well in any sense. I felt the plot is as said previously kind of one you feel will be easily predictable, now it isn't that hard but it isn't easy and makes for a good mystery story surrounding the going's on. I also did like the way the bleak setting makes the story even better, with a small village who's population know something is wrong, but have no idea behind the real truth of it all, just fun stuff.<br/><br/>Daniel Radcliffe attempts to throw the cape of Harry Potter of his shoulders and start a new film career away from the series, and he does an OK job with a solid performance, not always good but a good start after such a long series for him. Supporting cast do a good job and with some lesser known faces involved, I commend the film for branching out with it's talent scouts. Ciaran Hinds is at his best as ever and although I felt could have been used slightly more in scarier moments, still manages a good performance here.<br/><br/>Written really well with a script that sometimes can be the focus of times, the film isn't afraid to leave the more thrilling moments to pursue it's dramatic interests, and the script helps greatly with making them scenes bearable. I enjoyed the bleak locale with darkened houses and the sun never quite seems to shine, it sets up very well for the even darker house that Radcliffe finally encounters the Woman In Black, very scary looking indeed so commendation to the costume department indeed.<br/><br/>The film does hold back when scary and sometimes isn't that that scary, it is however not too bad and mostly is genuinely frightening but some bits seem to obvious. You could say it just follows the plot of the similar horror movies we see and it kind of does, although as said hard to predict, the set up and even the ending are more staples in Horror movie film. Finally here I will say the film needn't not introduce Radcliffe's back story so much, and even though it isn't bad, it can take up vital scene time as the movie is quite a short one.<br/><br/>Horror movie fans will enjoy this with it's scarier moments but may not enjoy the more dramatic scenes, but horror fans who like a deep and dark under story should enjoy this very much so. I have seen Harry Potter fans parents complain it is too scary, just a note, this is not Harry Potter and not near it, Radcliffe is simply hanging his boots up and moving on with his career, and he does a pretty good job here if truth be told.<br/><br/>Overall I will give it a 7/10, a Strongly Pretty Good movie with not that much room to grow, but nevertheless the job it does it fine enough to make an entertaining piece. I did at parts feel underwhelmed and maybe wanted the movie to just finish, but once you firmly get your head into the plot, you can sit back and enjoy the story and horror. One last thing is that this movie is genuinely scary and will thrill you, so watch with your eyes glued to the screen for maximum scare factor."

","""The Woman in Black"" is a thriller movie with some horror scenes which has to do with a young man lawyer who travels to a village where he discovers a ghost of a scorned woman which is terrorizing the villagers. The villagers were really nervous about the arrival of the lawyer and they advised him to leave as soon as possible from the village because they did not want to get in more troubles with this ghost, but he did not listened to them and he continued his work and his investigation about it.<br/><br/>I have to say that ""The Woman in Black"" is a different movie from other horror movies because it combines really nice thriller and drama with some horror scenes and the whole movie which was filmed in England with all of these nice buildings confer some new and nice things in this movie. I also think that the interpretation of Daniel Radcliffe who plays as Arthur Kipps a young lawyer was simply outstanding. Another nice thing in this movie was the storyline and how this affect the other people lives and how those people felt and did about it. Although I have to say that most of the movie was too dark for me and that was something that I did not like. I would like it more if it was not so dark because it was not only a horror movie it was more than this, if it was a horror movie and only that then I could understand why it was so dark.<br/><br/>Finally I have to say that I really recommend this movie and I am sure that you will like it and if you are a fan of English style of movies then I think that you will not only like it but you will love it."

He is to find and examine all of her papers especially her will. He soon learns there is a mysterious woman in black who threatens the local children.<br/><br/>It's very old fashion. It's dark. It's foggy. It's slow. It's not good enough to be described as moody. Director James Watkins has made a quiet style horror. But as a horror, it completely fails or it is completely outdated. There is nothing scary here. Daniel Radcliffe is a fine actor. This is what horror used to be ... about 50 years ago. Even the most squeamish among us will be bored with this."

","""Meh"" was the feeling I was left with at the end of 'The Woman in Black.' ""Meh"" to the story, ""meh"" to the acting and even more ""meh"" to the attempted frights throughout the film. There's not a lot of good stuff here. The last 10-15 minutes raise the bar a little (at least on the scare front) and then a questionable ending finally seals the fate on this one and we are able to finally turn it off.<br/><br/>Daniel Radcliffe gives a very average performance. It feels like we are watching a boy playing a man's role. Taking on a horror movie first thing after the 'Harry Potter' series seemed a strange decision to me. One reason could have been very few lines for him to learn, which may have sounded appealing after some quite long editions to the 'Harry Potter' series had him working long hours to learn them all I'm sure. It takes you to the about the halfway point to realise there really isn't a lot of dialogue and that that there is is quite clunky and poorly written especially for a period piece.<br/><br/>The biggest annoyance this film provides however is the countless amount of attempted scares (mostly on Radcliffe's character) which come to absolutely nothing. Soon nothing becomes frightening in the least because all this ghost seems to have in its armoury is trying to scare people. Of course it's revealed it can do a little more that, but more of a focus on this and less screen time with Radcliffe would have benefited this movie immensely. <br/><br/>As I said the last 10-15 minutes pick things up a bit and do some redeeming. The ending is to each there own. Personally I was reasonably neutral over it, but if I had to lean one way I'd say I didn't like it as much. There are much better, more atmospheric and effective horrors out there at the moment (especially 'The Conjuring' if you haven't gotten around to seeing it yet), but if you feel like you've seen them all and choose to give this one a go just don't expect anything too special."

","THE WOMAN IN BLACK<br/><br/>This is a very good movie. I fully expected to see it and think it was not very good, but it was a pleasant surprise.<br/><br/>The movie is about a guy who has to go and sort out the paperwork at a house where the owner has died. The problem is, the house is haunted. Because he has entered the house, the ghost is taking revenge on everyone in the town.<br/><br/>The trailer always interested me with this movie, and seeing as the legendary Hammer Horror company did this film, I had to see it. 2 things were on my mind when I went to the cinema to originally see it. First of all, the movie is a horror film but is only rated 12... how could it be a horror? It is very psychological. There is not much scary to see in the film, the whole thing is in the atmosphere in the movie. Secondly I thought, can Daniel Radcliffe get past Harry Potter with a career? Can he really act? Well, the answer to both questions is a big yes. Daniel acted very well. I thought he did a brilliant job and hope to see him in more roles in the future.<br/><br/>The horror element obviously wasn't that scary due to it being a 12 rating, but I did like the woman in black character. She was very subtle in places and when she crept up on Daniel, it was creepy.<br/><br/>The acting was great by everyone. The movie stars Daniel Radcliffe, Ciaran Hinds & Janet McTeer.<br/><br/>This film is best watched with all the lights out in the dark and the volume up high.<br/><br/>The effects are very good. The ghosts looked great and were all very spooky looking. <br/><br/>I will give this film 7 out of 10.<br/><br/>""I believe the most rational mind can play tricks in the dark.""<br/><br/>For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:<br/><br/>https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl"

","I wish more movies could be made like this - extremely well acted, fabulous costumes, gorgeous cinematography, interesting side characters - but also very frightening. The scenes of Arthur (Daniel RAdcliffe) in the house trying to complete his onerous assignment are flawless. The film has so much to say about societal norms during the late 19th century. Daniel Radcliffe is proving himself a true talent and will probably be known as the Lawrence Olivier of his generation - a gifted actor who can play all types and all venues. This movie is an instant classic and will be appreciated by lovers of horror or lovers of Victorian-period films or even just a beautiful love story. I was so intrigued by this film that I went out and read the book which is quite different from the film but enjoyable also from a totally different perspective."
"nynemout42","9","0","1","25 November 2013"," Awesome, creepy thriller!
","I have had very few movies make the hair on the back of my neck stand up. This movie is not a gory, blood bath movie like most people are becoming accustomed to when you say horror film. This movie takes advantage of creepy music, dim lighting, and misdirection. Life like story and you really can get into it. Not a lot of high dollar, digital effects, just simple, small scary things that make you jump. I saw the live play in downtown London last year and it was absolutely brilliant so I decided to watch the film. This is now one of my favourite films! The movie is quite like to play and doesn't differ much. Even though I knew what essentially happens, this film was still putting me on the edge of my seat! Well directed and the acting is very believable. The setting is just where it needs to be to add to the mystery and creepiness! I highly suggest this movie if you're looking for something scary, yet not in the blood bath genre!"

","This is a fantastic thriller that leaves the viewer guessing. There are some points where the plot seems to be getting predictable, only to throw you off into a completely different direction. I just loved all the little jump scares this movie had to offer, as well as the bigger ones that you had to think about. The setting could not have been more perfect for this movie, and the house design was absolutely wonderful. It truly made you feel as though you are in this haunted house, being chased by an ill-meaning spirit.<br/><br/>All in all, a great movie, and it was refreshing to see Daniel Radcliffe take on a new, darker role, which I think he did perfectly."

","The film ""The Women in Black"", in my opinion it was really good. The film is about a young lawyer who goes to the village to sort out the papers of a woman because she died, but in the village weird things happen. The director refines every detail to make the film in Victorian era. The actor Daniel Radcliffe (Mr.Kips) does a really good job. He doesn't have to say anything and I know how he feels. The film in some moments is engrossing. The body language was really good. The colours were dark and music makes it more scary. The other actors play very well.

"AttyTude0","2","0","1","3 October 2013"," One or two ""Boo! Haha, scared you!"" are more than enough, thank you.
","This film has terrific ambiance, very creepy and gloomy. I'll give it a point for that. I'll give it another point for the fact that it does not fall into the ridiculous modern error of confusing Halloween-like effects of gore and blood with the genuine and time-proved cause for real: the unexplainable and the unknown.<br/><br/>Those are the only two points I readily concede. What ruined the whole thing for me and made me lose patience was the old, tired and tiresome hah-made-you-jump effect that occurs seemingly every five minutes in the film. Used once or twice the trick can be effective. Used more often than that it becomes annoying and, as others here very accurately pointed out, just a cheap carnival, haunted-house-ride type of scare tactic. What are we, five? <br/><br/>A bloody shame the director and writer decided to go the cheap, childish way. This could have been a great ghost film. If you get your thrills by having someone shout Boo! at you from behind, every five minutes, this film will delight you. Me, I prefer something more subtle and sophisticated. Just my personal opinion. To each his own, and all that."

"mush_disaster","8","0","1","26 September 2013"," Eerie, beautiful and scary
","When the movie first came out I read mixed reviews about it; someone called it a cliché, dull and disappointing. The ratings on here were also not the greatest, so when I finally got around to see it, it wasn't with very high expectations.<br/><br/>I was very pleasantly surprised however. Yes, the plot and setting might be considered a bit cliché with the old haunted house and the dead mother seeking her lost child but this time I really didn't mind.<br/><br/>The setting is beautiful and the whole movie is eerie. There are plenty of creepy moments and the sightings of ghosts is constant throughout the story. The construction of the plot is very well done; no parts of the story seem too much, out of place or purposeless. Some scenes were extremely well thought in their simplicity. I found the scenes with the rocking chair exceptionally scary: the violent rocking left me with a feeling of horror. The grotesqueness of its movements leaves the impression that there could never be a human sitting in that chair, as most people would never dare rock it that hard in fear of tipping backwards. Another fantastic scene was when Radcliffe decides to look for the boy in the mud. Very original, very scary.<br/><br/>Daniel Radcliffe gives a masterful performance and shows a whole new side of his talent; especially when it comes to facial expressions of shock, horror and sadness (which is mostly all of the expressions this story requires).<br/><br/>All in all, I loved the movie and would definitely recommend it to anyone."
"cheerman1991","8","0","1","27 August 2013"," Post-Potter-Performance = Decent
","In his first outing after finishing his role as Harry Potter, Daniel Radcliffe had a few challenges facing him. To move past his days of wizardry Radcliffe really had to prove himself as a formidable actor. The Woman In Black is the first attempt to move on from the extended series.<br/><br/>Young lawyer, Arthur Kipps (Radcliffe), is trying to earn a living for himself and his son after the death of his wife. Sent to a remote village in order to sort paperwork belonging to the recently deceased Mrs. Drablow, Kipps is greeted by the unfriendly and superstitious villagers. He soon meets Daily (Ciaran Hinds), a wealthier man who is also mourning the loss of a loved one. Kipps needs to get to the deserted house within the marshland. The only problem is that none of the villagers want him to go there, because the lawyer runs the risk of seeing the shadowy figure of the woman in black.<br/><br/>Filled with suspense and mystery, this movie introduces Radcliffe to a new genre. The scenery in the film sets the mood well. Emotion flows through the environment around the actors which sets the movie up for story-oriented horror as opposed to the typical startle and shock driven horror that has been seen in recent years. There are clean cuts and transitions as opposed to the ""found footage"" style which has become all too common. Adding to the mood of the movie, the music is well done although not overly memorable.<br/><br/>The acting was done fairly well. Kipps is not the average horror movie protagonist. He does not rush into the danger head first. The film focuses more on the building of suspense. Radcliffe spends much of his time on camera searching the house and chasing strange noises. There are some scenes in which Radcliffe seems to lack natural emotion, but overall it is a good post-Potter performance. Some of the supporting characters seem unable to walk and talk at the same time. Choosing between either motion or line delivery makes the scenes drag on occasionally, and it also tends to distract from the dialogue.<br/><br/>The Woman In Black offers a suspenseful mystery, and an ending which leads to mixed emotions. Definitely worth watching for those interested in old story-driven suspense. Those looking for the cheap shock thrills will be disappointed with most of the movie, but for those who appreciate the subtlety of the emotion it is worth it."

","Just don't think of Daniel Radcliffe as 'Harry Potter' and I'm pretty sure everyone's gonna like this movie.<br/><br/>The plot of the movie is however not unique or new but the way it is filmed, the unfolding of all the events is what has made the movie worth watching. <br/><br/>To summarize the story without spoiling the suspense and thrill of the movie, here's a little info about the movie : The main character 'Arthur Kipps' (Daniel Radcliffe) a widower and father of a young boy, visits an isolated town in England filled with people having superstitious beliefs (although not very wrong, at least in the plot). Everybody in the town fears 'The woman in black' who they think is behind deaths of their children.<br/><br/>Soon Kipps also starts to see this mysterious lady in black clothes. He visits an isolated and deserted house in the marsh for doing research on his work. Kids have known to disappear in this marsh land. In subsequent visits to this house and deaths of young kids in the town, leads to the unfolding of a dark secret - about The woman in black.<br/><br/>The story mainly shows Arthur Kipps' (Daniel Radcliffe) struggle in finding and solving the mystery of kids' deaths and their relation with the mysterious woman. Also Kipps have to save himself and his own kid from this potentially dangerous 'woman'.<br/><br/>I specially liked the ending of the movie which has a good twist and is little unexpected (at least for me).<br/><br/>There is no gore or violence in the movie but still the movie is assured to give you a few chills, some goosebumps and a sense of uneasiness throughout.<br/><br/>Highly recommended for the horror movies fans who like to see a movie which can give a little sense of fear/scare.<br/><br/>For me its 9/10, could have been 8/10, but i liked the ending and decided a '9'."

","This is a perfect example of a film that can be called a horror movie without spilling a ton of blood, although there is only some, blood and guts. Horror these days is defined as crazy guy comes out with a knife and kills you with blood spurting everywhere. Not this film. It has story, scares, and heart. Which is pretty hard to find. Daniel Radcliffe, I have to say, did an absolutely fantastic job as real estate agent Mr. Arthur Kipps. James Watkins did a wonderful job directing this film, and it had my hair up on my neck nearly half the movie. And great job special effects guys! OK. Back to the directing. Brilliant! Watkins made the movie not only entertaining, but very scary. He knew exactly when to show the Woman in Black, and when not to show her. He also knew when not to show the Woman in Black. The suspense was killing me! I did not know what to expect the whole film, and that is exactly what I like in Horror movies. I can relate this show to the movie Insidious and others like that for one reason. There is almost no gore. People do die, yes, but without it being graphic and gutsy. The acting. Fantastic by Daniel Radcliffe and everyone else. He did a great job being his character, as he did in the Harry Potter series. He was the only big star in this movie. Ciaran Hinds did a wonderful job as well as wealthy man Samuel Daily. I'll say nothing else but for the wonderful acting of Alisa Khazanova as Mrs. Drablow. She didn't really say anything in the movie, but did body movements of the ghost very well. I can't emphasize enough how good this movie was without blood and guts spewing all over the place. If that were present, it would have ruined the whole movie. <br/><br/>I give the woman in black a 9/10 because it is scary, not gory, and was gripping until the end."

","I've never seen a Harry Potter Film, nor will I, so this was the first performance I've seen by Britain's wealthiest young entertainer, Daniel Radcliffe. I will admit, for being as young and inexperienced in diverse film roles as Radcliffe is, he did a good job. Though if any person built a personal net worth of 80 million dollars for playing (1) fictional story-based character, I'd hope they had the balls to broaden their horizons too. Unfortunately, he chose to branch out to the horror/thriller genre that literally been beaten to the ground the last several years and kicked down the hill. Sure, you can expect a few jumps during certain scenes, but what gives? Knowing the circumstances already, why would he venture to this extremely haunted and desolate mansion unarmed and flying solo... hello?

","First thing, Harry Potter needs acting lessons, not wizardry classes. Every line he delivers is wooden and empty. His expression is either bland; or furrowed brow. He could get away with it in the Harry Potter movies, because they had so much crap going on, and to be honest- for the first 2 or 3 movies, all the kids were awful actors. But, not anymore. I think he's the Keanu Reeves of his generation.<br/><br/>Ciarán Hinds was perfect, as always, and he made up for Radcliffe's woodenness.<br/><br/>Another thing: this movie is NOT scary. I can't believe anyone could be frightened by any scene.<br/><br/>The ending is... interesting, and I quite liked it. I don't know why she ""would never forgive"" Radcliffe, since he has ZERO connection to the village, or her son's death; and if anything, he tried to help her reunite with her son.

","So what this mostly will be remembered for is as Daniel Radcliffe's first post Harry Potter project. Which is a bit disrespectful to what is a, quite chilling decent horror movie.<br/><br/>Based on a Susan Hill novel of the same name, the film follows a young widowed lawyer played by Daniel Radcliffe called Arthur Kipps, who is essentially on his last warning at work and travels to Eel Marsh House to look through the papers of the late Alice Drablow. he experiences resistance from the local and glimpses of a woman dressed only in black. Daniel Radcliffe is adequate in his role continually improving in all his films. As he was no acting child prodigy that's for sure. The film does feel very accurate to the time period. With the house used in the film being very creepy and suitable perhaps being the star of the show. Also because of it's inexperienced star the film very much does rely upon supporting characters especially good were Ciarán Hinds who plays a man in denial about the myths until evidence becomes to much to deny, and his wife played by Janet McTeer who is still grieving over a lost child, really competes with the titular character for creepiness.<br/><br/>A couple of things that do work against it, is the film does not seem very original. with it's scares and story line seeming to be well trodden paths before. Also is very well telegraphed before it happens of how the movie will end lessening it's impact quite a lot.<br/><br/>A decent horror with a adequate amount of scares.

But: that's what I expect of every good movie! Only thing that really surprised me was, that it's good to see Radcliffe can do more than Harry Potter.<br/><br/>Maybe I would watch it a second time in a few years, but for most people I think it's enough, to rent the DVD/BluRay on a rainy day and watch it with your girl/boyfriend.<br/><br/>And don't forget a box of nachos and your favorite soft-drink to make the evening complete ;-)"
"ParanoidAndroid97","8","0","1","14 April 2013"," He's not Harry Potter anymore...
","Daniel Radcliffe will probably be remembered throughout film history as the boy who lived- or rather the casual Londoner who played him. Here, he makes his first big-screen comeback after the finale to the Harry Potter series starring as Arthur Kipps, a grieving lawyer sent to Eel Marsh House, an old manor surrounded by misty marshland, to sort the papers of Alice Drablow, the recently deceased owner of the house. But while there he discovers other documents -passionate letters written by Drablow's deranged sister, mostly centred around her son. The film is one of the best of the past few years in terms of making you jump out of your seat- while Kipps rummages around the house he sees sudden flashes of The Woman In Black- the sister Jennet Humphrys' ghost- which frighten him out of his wits and do the same to the viewer. While physical horror is reduced to one scene- a girl that has drunk lye vomiting blood- it certainly delivers in every other department that a good horror film should. It's psychologically disturbing, it haunts you even after it's over, it has a horrifying twist at the end- fans of The Sixth Sense will certainly find it enjoyable. On to Radcliffe. He more-or-less is forced to carry the film in terms of acting; he is the only one in the house most of the time and so is the only character to react to everything that happens there, and for the most part his fear, and the desperation that comes from it, is convincing. He is also good enough to make you forget about Harry Potter and focus on his character, which he could easily not have done had his portrayal of Arthur Kipps been unmemorable. However, he seems unrealistically young to play this part- the book character is meant to be a middle-aged man, and this Arthur Kipps looks like he's only just left high- school, making the viewer feel as if Radcliffe was only cast to remind people that he's still around. Aside from a bit of bad casting, a slightly cliché script and the fact that it rather loses its impact once you see it a second time, The Woman in Black is a disturbing and shocking film that is certainly worth watching late at night with a bowl of popcorn (and if you scare easily, some pictures of cute puppies to take your mind off it), and so I give it 8/10."

But woman in black was exact opposite. It has an amazing story line that other scary movies don't. It had me thinking and had me jumping almost every second. I have to give it to Daniel Radcliffe because he fought Voldemort and now this ghostly woman that kills children. I never knew what was going to happen next in this movie. And the ending! It was just crazy but it was good, I didn't see that coming either.. Even as I watch the movie now it still has me scared. The only problem I had was trying not to call out ""HARRY GET OUT YOUR WAND"" but that is my fault not the movies. If you love a good story and getting a chill down your spine then see this movie."
"cainaaronclarke","8","0","1","27 March 2013"," Not as bad as the critiques claim
","Though the film is scary it may not be enough to scare modern horror movie fans due to the lack of quantity of the scary scenes, however despite this I don't feel like this is a bad movie. Personally I can't find much fault with the movie, the story is very good and it clearly shows the concept from the original play and even though critics have given the film bad reviews because of the lack of scenes to make the audience jump I think the movie is good because of that, because it's the story which is scary and not the individual scenes. The one part of the film I was disappointed in was the ending, because I've seen the older film and read the play I already knew how it ended so it didn't effect me so much however for people who had not seen the older film or read the play the ending would have been predictable anyway because Jennet has a close-up where she tells the audience what she is going to do. This I feel ruined the ending.<br/><br/>The film is structured in a way so it builds tension to the finale of the film throughout the film the viewer will constantly be wondering how Arthur will solve this situation and escape without his family getting involved, the film does this by having Arthur not only haunted by the Woman in Black but also letting him learn about her past and making him come up with hypotheses on how to eliminate the problem. The purpose of the film is to make the audience scared when watching but more so to make them scared after they have watched it, I know this because of Jennet's speech saying she will continue her curse and that it will never be solved.<br/><br/>The way the individual scenes are structured in the film have certain effects because the audience know it's a horror film, for example the audience know that the large manor is going to be haunted and scary before they are shown inside however if this film was a different genre, say comedy for example the audience might not suspect the manor to be haunted and scary because we only expect that in a horror film. there are various other locations and sound effects which also trigger the stimulus of fear which normally wouldn't in a film that isn't a horror for example the crows or the Victorian dolls. Also in a film we are normally surprised or shocked when a character is killed off however we expect that in modern horror films its even not surprising if the main character dies anymore.<br/><br/>The narrative of the woman in black is very linear there are a few flashbacks to reveal a brief back-story of the main character and letters to give a back-story to Jennet however other than this the story is very straightforward, however the film doesn't follow a normal narrative structure. Normally the film will start with an equilibrium then in the middle this will be disrupted and in the end everything will be back to normal or a new equilibrium will be established however in the Woman in Black the film starts with a quick introduction of the characters and their situation then the main character travels to a haunted village. In the middle of the film the main character learns about Jennet and what she is doing to the children of the village and he tries to find a solution to the problem. At the end of the film the main character is killed and Jennet continues to haunt the village, so to sum up the story: Start- The Woman in Black is terrorizing the village.<br/><br/>Middle- The Woman in Black is terrorizing the village.<br/><br/>End- The Woman in Black is terrorizing the village.<br/><br/>This shows that the film does not alter much throughout however it seems like it does and the film seems to be progressing to something because we see it through the point of view of the main character.<br/><br/>The film doesn't have many characters however the characters that are in it do have a few key roles which serve a purpose in the story. A couple of characters fulfill the roles of Propps Character Theory for example the hero of the story is Arthur Kipps as he is the protagonist of the film, Jennet therefore is the villain as she goes against the hero. Then there are the smaller roles like Mr Bentley who is the donor as he helps Arthur with his quest to stop Jennets curse, then there is the dispatcher who is Arthur Kipps boss, Stella Kipps is arguably the princess because she is dead but Arthur does get her in the end, so to speak.<br/><br/>So to conclude, The Woman in Black is a good film and I would recommend people to watch it even if you're not a big horror fan don't threat because the film won't make you jump... much."

","This movie is definitely for lovers of ghost stories who appreciate an ambient setting and dark atmosphere as much as visual scares. I saw it in the cinema to great effect, as these qualities were amplified. And there certainly are chilling moments that come out of the sustained tension in the movie. But my favorite aspect was watching Daniel Radcliffe. He has a strong screen presence that, along with his character's backstory, adds a lot of feeling to the story. And he's got such a gorgeous, sensitive face and voice, I personally was kept enthralled until the closing credits. Hope to see him in more feature films."
"mithil293","7","0","1","19 February 2013"," Yeah its no different but it has its MOMENTS
","Yeah, it's no different, been there seen that kind of story. It involves the same mystery situations, the same shocking revelations but no conventional ending. From the suggestive title one can make out half of the story, thus the movie falls into the bucket of predictability. But if only were movies were weighed by the stories they showed, we would be in a swamp of identically similar movies. What matters after the story is it's treatment, helping us unfolding the colours of the plot. This movie scores in jumping their audiences out of their seats but also showing some stunning visuals.<br/><br/>What I a m referring to is art direction. When the protagonist visits the mansion house, it carries a kind of eerie presence to it. The kind of detailing that goes in designing that house from interior is just plain astounding. The intermittent shots that shows puppets animated faces also brings out that strange feeling. The director has wisely used those shots to create the effects. <br/><br/>The movie is lacking in areas with a weak screenplay, but overall it grips you. I loved the fact that all the main characters in this movie had some past baggage, a history that directly connects with the plot. When I first saw the ending I was skeptic of it, but then I read about it and was thoroughly satiated with the climax. It is to know that the woman in black doesn't win over Arthur, he denies he that right. <br/><br/>Performance wise Daniel Radcliffe is good but could be better. His portrayal of much older man than he is fails too convince me in some scenes. But his prowess as an actor is tremendous, I will be waiting for more. Ciarán Hinds as Daniels compatriot in the move is exceptional in some scenes. he sometimes takes hold of scenes from Radcliff and gives his own touch. Rest of the cast does well in their appropriate roles.<br/><br/>Give it a watch, you might be surprised with the kind of work being done. It's horror to the core and gives back a lot what it promises."

The grand Gothic house on the moors that's routinely covered in dense fog, dark, endless corridors shrouded in darkness and a strange secret from the locals are a few of the typical clichés found in this but strangely they work in creating a fantastic atmosphere here that is wholly enjoyable and impressive, especially once it gets to the second half and is allowed to really take hold as the legend becomes clearer and the action intensifies with some rather fun moments from time-to-time. The main problem here is the absolutely tedious pace this employs as it manages to plod along in the beginning of him alone in the house without anything really happening and the low-key nature of it really takes a hold.

Daniel Radcliff does an excellent job of acting. The marshland of 1900 England make an excellent backdrop for this eerie tail.

Such is the background of awkward and supernatural things happening to and around a poor lawyer and the widowed father Arthur Kipps - normally, but not splendidly played by the former Potter guy Daniel Radcliffe. The real gems of the film are Ciarán Hinds as Sam Daily, a local landowner and Janet McTeer as Elisabeth Daily, Daily's wife, who are really catchy to watch. Well, the whole film is more or less thrilling to watch, but I would have preferred some real evil involved, rather than spiritual phenomenon.

","Nothing freaks me out more than a ghost story. There's something about the idea of something that you cannot see, that you cannot fight, that's more terrifying to me than any other type of horror story, and The Woman in Black is one of the best horror films I've seen in years. The film is brilliantly directed by James Watkins, with so much of the film's characters being revealed through cleverly designed shots, rather than verbal exposition. It tells the tale of a recently widowed London lawyer named Arthur Kipps, who travels to a small country village to settle the documentation of an old abandoned house in a foggy marsh that is unreachable during high tide, and is also haunted by a vengeful ghost who is causing the strange deaths of all children in the village. Harry Potter himself, Daniel Radcliffe, portrays Arthur Kipps in his first major, post-Potter role, and he is marvelous. At first he seems too young to be portraying a father, but it's how Radcliffe shows a breadth of emotions that one generally associates with someone beyond his years, that makes him believable in the role. In many ways, it's a one man show, and Radcliffe carries this film, with much of the film following him being terrorized in a house, and he is such a mesmerizing presence on screen, you're willing to go along on the journey. Where the film really stands out though, is that it just avoids all clichés of films like this. Not only is it well acted and well directed, it just genuinely keeps you on the edge of your seat because it does not traipse into genre formula, and literally shocks and surprises you in the very end.<br/><br/>I give The Woman in Black a 9 out of 10!"
"knowyourmovie","8","0","1","14 November 2012"," An enjoyable traditional horror movie recommended for all fans of the genre...
","""The Woman in Black"" is a tastefully executed, stylish, atmospheric Victorian English Gothic horror movie. Under the confident hand of the visionary director James Watkins (""Eden Lake"") all the numerous little pieces of the complex movie puzzle were fittingly put together by the excellent production team with admirable delicate thoughtfulness and commendable precision.<br/><br/>The cleverly adapted by Jane Goldman (""Stardust"", ""X-Men: First Class"") screenplay relies more on subtle cues than on sparingly and appropriately used cheap scares.<br/><br/>While being very enjoyable from a pure aesthetic perspective, ""The Woman in Black"" could nevertheless disappoint those looking for a deeper, more intellectually stimulating story. Unlike such masterpieces of the genre as ""Se7en"" or ""Saw"", the movie does not feature thought-provoking moral and ethical dilemmas. In other words, it is quite entertaining, but not deeply satisfying on the intellectual level.<br/><br/>With that notable exception, the movie is nearly perfect in almost every aspect and is a pleasure to watch thanks to the fine work of the movie crew, well-orchestrated by James Watkins.<br/><br/>There is a lot to appreciate in ""The Woman in Black"", including the cinematography by TimMaurice-Jones who worked with Guy Ritchie on ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" and ""Snatch"", and the production design by Kave Quinn, previously known for his memorable work on ""Harry Brown"" and ""LayerCake"".<br/><br/>The original music was written by a prolific movie composer Marco Beltrami, known for his work on tens of popular movies, including ""3:10 to Yuma"" (2007) and ""The Hurt Locker"" (2008) for which he received Academy Awards nominations.<br/><br/>The most memorable music piece in the movie is an elegantly slow, subtly hinting on deeply hidden but utterly inescapable tragedy and horror ""The Woman in Black"" theme, quite creepy in all of its deceptive fragility.<br/><br/>The creators of ""The Woman in Black"" put a lot of thought in utilizing both the music and the sound effects in a delicate fashion that preserves, emphasizes, and magnifies the horror element, rather than ruins it by preparing the viewers in advance to what is going to happen next on the screen. As a result, ""The Woman in Black"" grants us a unique luxury many other horror movies sadly deprive us of – being genuinely terrified when we least expect it.<br/><br/>Both the interesting work with light and the well thought-out color palette used in ""The Woman in Black"" deserve a separate mention in the review as well.<br/><br/>The whole movie crew, led by the director and the production designer, put a lot of heart, soul, and hard work into inventing all the small details featured in the film and carefully and skillfully combining them together to create a truly unique movie atmosphere.<br/><br/>There is not a single inauthentic moment in the ""The Woman in Black"" not a moment when a character or a detail seems to be out of place or out of style.<br/><br/>It is quite enjoyable to register all the small details sprinkled here and there throughout the movie, to guess their hidden meaning, to experience the associated emotions, to appreciate their thoughtfulness, to savor the perfection of their visual implementation.<br/><br/>It is fun to analyze all the various efficient techniques that the movie crew employs to gradually intensify horror, all the clever little diversions that they launch to muddle the plot and to introduce a measured amount of confusion into the movie watching experience.<br/><br/>The sensitive matters of life and death, love and loss are not taken lightly in ""The Woman in Black"" They are handled with care and with reverence and are depicted in a sympathetic, deeply touching manner.<br/><br/>In addition, ""The Woman in Black"" happens to be a genuinely emotional movie, with the emphasis on the word ""genuinely"". Authentically depicting human emotions on the screen appears to be one of the most difficult tasks in the movie industry.<br/><br/>Even subtle emotions can become significant and captivating when shown on the screen if everyone involved in their depiction - from the director, to the screenwriter, to, of course, the actors – knows what they are doing.<br/><br/>At the same time, even the strongest emotions can be perceived with indifferent yawns by the disconnected audience if the movie crew lacks professionalism and skill to properly show these emotions on the screen. <br/><br/>Of course, my review of ""The Woman in Black"" would be incomplete without a small, but important discussion about the acting in the movie. I do not think that anyone would argue with my high praise to the terrific acting duo of Ciarán Hinds and Janet McTeer (Mr. and Mrs. Daily) or with my accolades to all the other vivid and talented supporting characters, including the kid actors.<br/><br/>The performance of the ""Harry Potter"" star Daniel Radcliffe (Arthur Kipps, the main character) happens to be a far more controversial subject.<br/><br/>Even before watching ""The Woman in Black"" I heard many complaints from critics and general audience alike regarding Daniel Radcliffe playing Arthur.<br/><br/>After having seen the movie, I can say that apart from Daniel Radcliffe looking too young for the role of a widower with a four year old son and him occasionally bearing a painful resemblance to Harry Potter, I do not have any major complaints about the performance. It was not a great role, but generally a solid one, leaving us more or less hopeful regarding the Daniel Radcliffe s future acting career.<br/><br/>Despite some minor weaknesses and a lack of depth, ""The Woman in Black"" still remains a worthy and well-executed effort and simply an enjoyable traditional horror movie, recommended for all fans of the genre.<br/><br/>knowyourmovie.blogspot.com"
"aesgaard41","10","0","2","13 November 2012"," Harry Potter's Scariest Adventure Yet
","In Hollywood, there are three types of ghosts. There are the invisible people who can't be touched and are usually played for laughs, there are the murderous serial-killing fiends who cause mass homicides and then there are the demonic forces whose sole purpose is the misfortune and torture of the living without any long-term plans. It is so rare to have a decent haunted house movie that actually knows how to scare and terrify the viewer. ""The Woman In Black"" is one of those movies. It is what a decent haunted house movie should be: creepy setting, strong characters, engaging plot and an unsolved mystery with some suspense. It stars Daniel Radcliffe as a lawyer barely over the loss of his wife. He is already haunted by her death and the responsibility of his son when his firm sends him to secure the papers of a deceased client. The job requires he travel to the distant isolated village of Crithin Grifford in Northern England by train, encountering the creepy superstitious people and eccentrics along the way. The movie is thick in atmosphere and the plot moves briskly as he wonders if the isolated house he is located could be haunted – a premise we are sure is happening even if his character is not. The movie is far more scary and unnerving than the tedious voyeuristic style of the ""Paranormal Activity"" movies. This is a movie reliant on its setting as much as its ghosts to be scary because we know Radcliffe's character is trapped in the house by the rising tide and can't leave as easy as other characters in other movies may have. His eyes and expressions relate the fear he is having in the location. Unlike ""Paranormal Activity,"" ""Woman In Black"" is carried by a plot involving town mystery where none of the children in town live long to adulthood; so now we have not just a ghost story by one wrapped inside a mystery. It's the type of horror movie we rarely ever see. Bottom line: the movie is scary as hell without being as condescending, tedious or confusing as ""Paranormal Activity."""

I'm pretty sure I'm not going to be able to sleep for a week or so. I usually like jump scares and prefer movies that go for suspense rather than gore and I'm not very easy to scare (concerning movies at least), but this one was really a little more than I could handle. If that's what you're looking for, this is exactly the right thing for you. I have to add that I absolutely hate dolls and clowns. They mixed those two components in as well. Oh, and if you're worried that the dog might get hurt and you don't want to watch it because of that: don't worry, he's just fine. I'm not quite so sure about me though. I gave this movie 8 out of 10, because it starts out a little boring and there's not really a storyline in my opinion (there you have a scary lady and a guy hanging around in her house, have fun).

However, Daniel Radcliffe seems way too unsuitable for the character he plays. He looks too young and doesn't seem that good actor to bear this or maybe anything on his shoulders.

","Great movie! Loved it. Just a tip: don't watch it alone! A great thrill with some fantastic jump out moments. One of the better horror movies i've seen lately. Daniel Radcliffe does a good job of playing a somewhat depressed widower, he manages to portray emotion whilst balancing his character and his connection with the storyline. I can imagine playing a completely different role to his previous role in the Harry Potter series and breaking out of the way that everyone sees him as Harry Potter must have been tough but he has managed to break out of his shell in this film. The sound effects, costumes and the setting of the time in this film is impressive, the director and set designers have managed to re-create the time period effectively and this only makes the film increasingly spooky. The idea of the film is very effective. I would recommend it for teenagers and adults, but not children, unless if you want your child to have a few sleepless nights!"
"eatfirst","7","0","1","14 September 2012"," Understated chills
","A laudably understated adaptation of Susan Hill's celebrated Gothic chiller, The Woman in Black tells a simple but effectively spine- tingling tale of disturbing events at an isolated village in early 20th C rural England.<br/><br/>There has been criticism in some quarters of Daniel Radcliffe's presence in the central role as casting too young. I'm not buying this. In fairness he does have relatively little to do for much of the short running time beyond looking somewhat perturbed. But his portrayal of a young, but tragically bereaved husband, somewhere perhaps in his mid- 20s, is convincingly depicted with a gaunt, withdrawn look and meekly shuffling persona. The problem, I believe, is simply the difficulty that audiences are having in seeing past the familiarity of Harry Potter as an adult in any movie. This perfectly solid performance will hopefully be a significant step in gradually recalibrating audience expectations for his future career.<br/><br/>Complimented by some pleasingly underplayed supporting roles, and top- notch production design, especially the deserted and overgrown manor house at the centre of the story; this self-consciously old-fashioned ghost story comes across rather like a particularly fine and visually lush BBC period literary adaptation. It won't break any new ground in the annals of horror movie making, but it is a solid reminder of just how satisfying understated chills and unsettling atmosphere can be."
"CountVladDracula","10","0","2","4 September 2012"," Traditional Gothic horror at it's finest
","This is one of those old fashioned, traditional Gothic horror films that is sorely under-appreciated by modern audiences. People are too used to gore and slashers that they no longer appreciate atmosphere and being spooked by the old fashioned and imaginative. This is the sort of horror that sticks with you, that chills you to the bone and I think that's why a lot of people don't understand it or don't appreciate it. It's one thing to be made to jump by a serious killer, it's another thing when a horror film reaches you on a deep and personal level.<br/><br/>This is true to form, traditional Hammer horror. There hasn't been a good, mysterious and haunting film like this since 1999's Sleepy Hollow starring Johnny Depp. I miss horror films like these and it's a shame that so many people today just don't ""Get"" this type of horror.<br/><br/>Something that disturbs me about some fans of this film are the ones that think The Woman in Black character was doing Arthur a favor at the end. She really, really, wasn't. He was depressed but death is never the answer and no one says ""Never forgive"" over and over again while helping someone."

From the start the movie set's the mood just right. The weather is dreary and perfect for a haunted house out in the marsh, the locals are very unwelcoming to the character and add to the ""there is something wrong here"" feel of the village, the house is untouched and has an abandoned feel to it.<br/><br/>The movie isn't as slow paced as a lot of other haunted house movies and ""the woman in black"" starts to appear pretty early with ""sightings"" becoming more frequent and pronounced through the movie. There are a lot of reflections in windows and mirrors which really creep me out more than any monsters and psycho killers in other movies.<br/><br/>Daniel Raddclife's performance is pretty good but i can't help thinking of him as Harry Potter but i guess that is just due to me seeing him in another role for the first time. And it's just another demonstration of how scary this movie that it shut me and my ""'arry potter"" comments (in a dreadfully bad cockney impersonation) up pretty quickly.<br/><br/>........................

","When the movie starts the first thing that I notice is the logo for the new Hammer film productions. Hammer studios, if you do know, were a British film company that in the 40's and 50's specialized in film noir, science fiction and other modest genre pictures, but there great success and ultimate legacy would be built upon there Gothic horror tales that they made in the late 50's through the mid-70's. Helping to cement the careers of stars such as Christopher Lee, Peter Cushing, Oliver Reed, Herbert Lom, Michael Gough, Hazel Court, Ingrid Pitt, Barbara Shelley, and directors Terence Fisher and Freddie Francis. Like the revived Eailing studios (droll British comedy) and Amicus films (anthology horror movies), the names alone have returned in an attempt to reclaim some of the past glories by using a signature still half heartily remembered by fans of movies of yesteryear, happily Hammer is still leading the way in quality fright films.<br/><br/>The Woman in Black is the most overt return to their Gothic roots, telling a ghost story that lives in the morbid tell tale hearts and fractured minds of misguided youths from days of ole. In other words, this is my terrain, these are the scary stories we are told around camp fires or experience on a Saturday matinée television show, before we would find the more graphic shockers of late night. It's a return to innocence, while letting the goose flesh crawl up on our arms.<br/><br/>Set in the Edwardian era and starring former Harry Potter Daniel Radcliffe, here making a fine transition to more mature roles, and Irish character actor Ciaran Hinds, in parts that could easily have been played by Reed and Cushing a few decades back. Based on Susan Hill's novel, previously filmed for British TV in 1989, with a sequel already in the works. I missed this one in theaters last February, but am grateful that I caught up with it now that it is out on DVD, other than an unnecessary sappy ending, this is good old fashion scary material. Just after seeing the pathetic Apartment 143, here's a scream fest to worm the cockles of my still beating heart.<br/><br/>Thanks to no undue gore or torture here, but there are a few good jolts and a nicely scary atmosphere, plus one of the creepiest, but simple final shots in quiet a long time. This is a nightmare suitable for the whole family, and it's well worth the sleepless night."
"westerlund-147-949472","8","0","1","25 July 2012"," Old school ghost story for a new audience.
","I have not read the original novel by Susan Hill on which this movie was based on, but I have seen the play numerous times and I have also seen the movie from 1989 starring Adrian Rawliffe (who eerily enough also plays Daniel Radcliffe's father in the Harry Potter-films). Based on how hauntingly wonderful and terrifying those experiences were to me, the 2012 adaptation definitely had a lot to live up to. While it does not really reach the same heights as the above-mentioned, it did turn out a lot better than I expected.<br/><br/>The story involves Arthur Kipps, a London-based lawyer who is suffering from the loss of his wife in child-birth several years earlier, and is now send to a remote village in which he is tasked with settling the estate of a deceased woman. At the arrival he instantly feels unwelcome and it is clear that something darks lurks in the mind of the villagers. When he arrives to the estate it doesn't take long before he starts to feel a dark, supernatural presence around the premises that in some way is connected to a dark past.<br/><br/>The first thing that struck me was how great the visuals were. You have mist, darkness, creepy buildings and an overall dark atmosphere that permeates the whole movie. Many horror movies have this, but The Woman in Black really succeeds in drawing you into its dark and haunting world. The great sense of the visuals also shows itself in how scenes are built up and shot and how the actors appears on the screen. A simple thing as the image of Radcliffe's character with rolled up sleeves, an axe in one hand and a lantern in the other standing in front of the camera with a terrified expression on his face is presented in a very striking and memorable way.<br/><br/>The story is simple and effective, basically just a simple ghost story. As is it often in the horror film genre, it is not so much about how original the premise is as how it is told. The build-up is nicely done. The movie does not rush, it gives you time to get to know the environment and characters, a long with the feeling that something is definitely not right about this place. When the scares do start to come, it is subtle at first just so it can release the big guns later on, just as a good horror film should be.<br/><br/>The acting is overall great. Radcliffe takes an important step in this movie to shake off the Potter-curse. There was never a moment of thinking ""oh, it's Harry Potter out there"" or ""use the expecto patronum!"". You really believed it was Arthur Kipps on the screen. The supporting cast does their job as well, especially Ciarán Hinds who plays one of Mr Kipps few friends in the village and who are wrestling with his own demons as well.<br/><br/>However, as much as I like this movie, it still falls short of the 1989 version. While this movie was scary, it didn't reach the levels as to give me nightmares, and I feel that it relied a bit too much on jump scares. The 1989 version was a very amateurish and low-budget production, but the scares were so well done that it had my heart racing all the time. The 2012 was a very ""pimped"" version of the story, but it didn't scare me as much as I had hoped.<br/><br/>Still, I did not leave the theaters disappointed. If you want a solid and spooky ghost story in the year 2012, this is were to look."

","It is spot on; The Woman in Black deserves the many accolades presented in this cinematic forum. It is a scary movie. I realized this as I lay in bed contemplating the movies short comings and realized that I would or could not peer down my darkened apartment hallway. Ahh, the veiled Victorian she devil had crept into my sub conscious. However (you knew that was coming), as an aged movie lover, it helps me to analyze the movie in hope of making it to sound and restful sleep. In my opinion, scary as the movie was, it lacked some-thing. Not something, but some 'thing'. <br/><br/>Let's backup a little here. If you have enjoyed the movies, The Others, The Ring, and read H.P. Lovecraft's A Shadow Over Innsmouth, you will feel some of those horror tales presented at times during the film. The beginning of the film starts out similar to H.P. Lovecraft's horror story in which a man travels to a spooky seaside town to investigate. The name Marsh is thrown in for good measure. The middle of the movie plays out very much like The Others as our strong and fearless lead character blindly falls prey to horror traps as they attempt to find enough clues to solve the mystery inside the house. And thirdly, The Ring plays heavy towards the end of the movie as our hero attempts to placate our Victorian evil by burying things in the correct holes. The Others, The Ring, and read H.P. Lovecraft's A Shadow Over Innsmouth were superior horror tales because the truth or wisdom presented by the end of those stories was very close to heart and would not go away. The evil or 'thing' was real and could get us (any of us). The Woman in Black was perilous only for those unfortunate to have offspring residing in town limits. Was she scary yes, but dangerous? That depends on your circumstances. As for me, I have no offspring and resolve to sleep soundly this night."

","My earliest exposure to Hammer Horror films was with my Dad when he would let me stay up late and watch the horror movies of Hammer Horror's heyday in the 60's and 70's. What I remember from those movies is the slightly left field plot lines, and a certain kind of over the top acting. Great actors like Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing made these movies so incredibly watchable.<br/><br/>The woman in black pays homage to these early roots of horror, which to my mind was the original and best. Though this movie has special effects, it didn't go over the top using them, instead relying on old school scare tactics. Daniel Radcliffe's character looked quite out of depth throughout the whole movie, which I believe is what he intended. Ciaran Hinds was excellent as usual. The supporting cast was also pretty decent, though if I had a criticism; it would have been nicer to have a bit more back story.<br/><br/>I thought the plot was quite good and it avoided going down the road of cliché. The ending was not really what I was expecting at all, and without giving anything away left me with a few chills, and that is exactly what horror should do! I recommend watching this moving wholeheartedly. Sure, it wont win awards, and the more snobbish cinema-goer will look down his nose at it, but it is a great movie by the standards of great entertainment.<br/><br/>I hope that the name of Hammer Horror has a well deserved renaissance, as the movie world would be a better place because of it. Bring on the next one!"
"the-timelord-victorious","7","0","1","26 June 2012"," Chilling and Imaginative.
","After seeing this in the cinema, and really enjoying it upon first watch, I felt inclined to pick this up on DVD. I think what's so marvellous about this film, is that James Watkins has successfully managed to capture such a chilling and uneasy atmosphere. The Victorian setting works extremely well, and is the perfect era for a good old fashioned ghost story.<br/><br/>I've always felt that one of the best elements of a horror film is suggestion (creaking floorboards, sounds etc), and to an extent, this film has done it remarkably. It's very refreshing to see a horror film that relies on psychological terror, rather than in your face blood and gore, something that has sadly became one of the main conventions of a horror movie. Yes, the jump moments were a little predictable, but they had an extremely nice build up, and at some points, did genuinely unnerve me. This film takes the expected, and predicable, and something that has been done so many times before, and totally makes it look refreshing.<br/><br/>BUT, I think that it lost it's footing towards the end. it didn't ruin it, but I think it became a lot less terrifying, simply because It almost abandoned the suggestive and started to become a lot less scarier. It's like Watkins lost some of his nerve and tried to give us more by showing us what the Woman In Black actually looked like, and because of this, I think the film lost something. This is very upsetting, because if Watkins had relied more on suggestion, and gave us glimpses of the Woman in Black, and made it more psychological, which, in his defence, he did do right up until the 'screaming window' sequence, I think it probably would've been one of my favourite films.<br/><br/>Daniel Radcliffe may not be the best actor in the world, far from it, but he is simply wonderful in this film. What I love most about his performance is that he really has tried to distance himself from the role of Harry Potter, and this has worked to a massive degree. I never once thought of anything to do with Harry Potter during the course of this film, I simply saw Radcliffe in another role, and I feel that this is such a massive accomplishment for such a young actor, and considering Hallows Part 2 was not even a year ago, he has done a really really good job. Another thing about his performance, is that he does it to the best of his ability, there's a lot of physical acting required in this film, by which I mean facial expressions and trying to convey a massive amount of vulnerability and terror without speaking, and this is I feel one of the hardest things for an actor to do. It's hard enough for actors to successfully pull the audience into the film, and act scared around other characters, but to do it completely on your own, that is a huge resonsibility for a young actor, and I think Radcliffe pulled it off perfectly.<br/><br/>Overall, it's a fantastic ghost story, only ruined by the antagonist stepping out the shadows and showing herself. Like I said, if we didn't see her face, and she stayed under the vale, then this film would've been a solid 4 star for me. It's very very high quality overall though, and one of the very few films that still remains to unnerve me."
"chrisbailey-404-861876","7","0","1","23 June 2012"," Made me jump out of my skin, and i think it should have a higher age rating to be honest,
","First the good points:<br/><br/>I came to see a horror to make myself jump, and boy did I do just that! It was the usual build up of how intense the scares where, easy reflections in mirrors to heart throbbing choking fits. Sadly for one woman in the cinema she screamed and dropped all her food at the first scare, which was not at all scary, i'm not sure how she coped through the rest. It had quite a good story line, not so original but it was nice to see Harry Potter on something other than ""Harry Potter"". I actually thought that harry potter was dumb facing three headed dogs, well this is gonna be one of those, noooo, i said he shouldn't go there and now look whats happened! God why is he soooo stupid!<br/><br/>Bad Points:<br/><br/>In horror movies I like there to be at least 5 minutes of sunlight or something like that to give the effect that the horror takes place at different times rather than a whole dull movie."

"Movie_Muse_Reviews","8","0","1","20 June 2012"," Period detail and subtlety makes 'Woman in Black' a cut above the rest
","Horror films always seem to take place in the present, which is understandable, considering one decade or century isn't necessarily scarier than the next (in the traditional sense of fear). It also costs more money to dress up a film in a particular era. So if it weren't actually scary or interesting, ""The Woman in Black"" would at least be commended on its early 20th Century setting and expert set decoration.<br/><br/>""Harry Potter"" star Daniel Radcliffe turns out to be pretty non-essential to this resurgent horror effort from Britain's Hammer Films, unless you count the spotlight he brings to it. His character, Arthur Kipps, serves only as a means to explore the mystery of the Woman in Black.<br/><br/>Rather than riding the trend of supernatural planes and paranormal occurrences, ""The Woman in Black"" is a tried and true ghost story. Arthur Kipps is single father who lost his wife during childbirth. The trauma has leaked to his professional life, and so to prove himself to his employer he must train out to the country and settle the affairs of Eel Marsh House. As it turns out, ""settle the affairs"" means something completely different.<br/><br/>Very little of the history/mystery of Eel Marsh House is given to us through expository dialogue, which is quite refreshing for a horror film. Perhaps it's because writer Jane Goldman (""X-Men: First Class,"" ""Kick-Ass"") is over-qualified for the gig of adapting Susan Hill's novel. Ciarán Hinds' character, essentially the only man to welcome Arthur with open arms, could have been a convenient excuse to explain that Eel Marsh House is haunted, but instead, our own knowledge that this is in fact a horror film is all we need to mount the tension and start to draw conclusions about what's going on in this small town.<br/><br/>As such, ""The Woman in Black"" builds slowly and quietly, creating a pesky suspense more terrifying than any of the jump scares. The countless times Arthur goes up and down the stairs and out the door and back inside Eel Marsh or slowly walks into new rooms where he previously saw a ghost is maddening and even frustrating, yet it's far from boring. Director James Watkins uses the hauntingly gorgeous set decoration to create even more suspense.<br/><br/>The nursery where a traumatic event occurred in the house featuring all kinds of wind-up toys is an incredible and creepy sight. Watkins will focus in on the beaded eyes of dolls which look like they are watching Arthur because the candle light reflects in them as he moves. In general, the period decor is thick and rich, and Watkins wields it to his advantage.<br/><br/>The movement throughout the house also moves the plot along. When Arthur sees something he goes to explore the room, as if the Woman in Black wants him to discover her story. Arthur is also alone at this point, so there's no needless dialogue to summarize what he's uncovered. In fact, large portions of the film are completely silent other than the swelling horror music.<br/><br/>While any actor could have played Arthur, Radcliffe does well in the role. It's implied given the script does not include any scenes of him trying to flee, but he doesn't have any exaggerated scenes of being afraid or freaking out; he's actually a rather refreshing horror protagonist. Most of the time the person goes into some room because it's a horror movie, but here you actually believe Arthur would go in the room because he's not dumb and has proved to be a bit more brazen than most.<br/><br/>There aren't any shocking twists or reveals in ""The Woman in Black,"" but the very slow and calm approach to the mystery allows the conclusion to be riveting anyway. Any viewer with decent observation skills will start to put the pieces together fairly quickly on who the Woman in Black is and why she's haunting people. Instead, it's what her feelings are toward Arthur and what will ultimately become of him that are slightly ambiguous.<br/><br/>The ending is one of those shockers that ends suddenly, like in a Sam Raimi horror film. It's not impossible to predict, but part of it is rather unexpected; it's superior than most neatly tied-up horror endings.<br/><br/>In fact, ""The Woman in Black"" is superior to most horror offerings, though certainly the period setting and the subtlety of the story rank as its best features.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Thanks for reading!

","It is not a good idea to watch the 10pm screening of The Woman in Black and then drive home alone through dark, mysterious lanes to an old house that creaks and groans in the night.<br/><br/>There has been a great deal written about Daniel Radcliffe's first film since Harry Potter graduated and much of it for entirely the wrong reasons. He's an actor and he plays different roles. Career (and life, perhaps) defining as it was, that episode has ended and he's embarked upon the next seventy years of his life. Some reviewers have been overly critical of his performance but, having watched it with a dozen other viewers who were equally unnerved, that, too, is unfair criticism. It's a bit like condemning Beckham for not scoring when he set up all five goals.<br/><br/>Certainly, it isn't an award-winning performance and he looks too young, despite light stubble, to play a lawyer, but it is a convincing turn, albeit one that occasionally needs more oomph. At times he seems afraid to really immerse himself in the character of Arthur Kipps, but it is a vast improvement on his early over-acting as the wizard boy.<br/><br/>It isn't the only criticism of a film that is certain to boost the resurgence of Hammer. There are one or two cheesy moments we could do with out, not least of all Jane Goldman's unnecessary rewriting of the end sequence, which novelist Susan Hill left with an air of hopelessness. And the scream that we hear at various times through the film feels like a generic sound effect last heard from the mouths of the ringwraiths in The Lord of The Rings trilogy. But when the film is seen as a whole, these really are very small quibbles and the overall production quality renders these almost insignificant.<br/><br/>The sets and locations are superb, from the dark, cobwebby Eel Marsh House and its overgrown cemetery to the thick, devouring swamp by the causeway. Though the film is largely shot in muted hues of blue and grey it feels rich and magnificent upon the screen and throughout the film I was torn between thoughts of how stunning it could be and stifled calls of ""What the hell are you doing there?"" Radcliffe brings a desperate sensitivity to the screen as a bereaved husband whose son tellingly draws him with a frown and there are times where he looks quite the hero. He won't look back at this as his best performance ever but it is solid and a definite step in the right direction. Ciarán Hinds predictably gives another supporting character depth and life and it is always a pleasure, although too infrequent, to see Janet McTeer on the big screen. She has very few scenes as Mrs Daily but is flawless in her performance as the unhinged woman that is, at times, almost as disturbing as the titular character, and in the hands of a less capable actress Mrs Daily could easily be little more than a freak.<br/><br/>The Woman in Black is loosely termed a horror film, although it is more of a chiller, but is it scary? If you like your frights gory and blood-splattered, then no. But if your fears are of the unknown and the barely seen you won't be disappointed. There are moments towards the end when we see too much of the ghostly woman but the fleeting glimpses and the hints of terror are enough to really put the willies up you. The small audience jumped in unison to frequently for comfort and more than a few were very vocal in their fright.<br/><br/>The fingers of fear scratched my spine with their fingernails and I left the cinema with a damp shirt and a desire for company and light conversation before bed. I managed neither and have just realized I promised to see it with another friend next week. Fool! Another film review from The Squiss.

The story, however, not Mr. Radcliffe's fault, was rather difficult to follow, to discern, and understand. Apparently one is required to have read the novel, which is a bit too much like some of his other movies. I wish I had been given more of the story before having to watch the special features afterward, to understand it better, which they could have done for me, had they so desired.

","Since the publication of Susan Hill's 1983 novel, ""The Woman in Black"" has endured great success in London as an underrated TV movie of the 80's and a rather popular theatrical adaptation. Seems to me that it was in dire need of attention in America. Director James Watkins, screenwriter Jane Goldman, and the newly resurrected horror studio Hammer have brought it back by giving it the remake treatment, and for the first time in a while, a horror remake is as solid as its inspiration.<br/><br/>Just coming off of the tragedy of losing his wife in childbirth, Arthur Kipps is sent to an ordinary and lifeless town to settle the will and other documents belonging to the dead Alice Drablow, who owned the supposedly haunted Eel Marsh house. While he makes a friend in a man named Daily, the residents of the town treat Arthur as a disease and strongly encourage him to stay away from Eel Marsh. But Arthur is not a superstitious man, and spends several nights in the house. Then things take a turn for the worse. Creaking floorboards, imaginary footsteps, and large shadows plague Arthur while he is on his mission. Worst of all, a female figure in a black dress makes her presence known, and it's quite clear that she is a restless and angry spirit.<br/><br/>As gruesome as director Watkins' first film ""Eden Lake"" was, the stark realism of his antagonists' gory actions set up a tremendous sense of reality for the audience. ""The Woman in Black"" takes a different route. Watkins understands that as fictional as a ghost story may be, such a film requires minimal blood and intense tension and paranoia. We see the title specter very rarely, or even from a distance to bring up Arthur's supposedly blurred imagination. Is she real? Could the house really be haunted. Well, such a phantasm is questionable to the main character's sanity.<br/><br/>But tension abounds in ""The Woman in Black"" right when Arthur steps foot into Eel Marsh House. You can tell right away that the place is destined to be haunted. The inside is raggedy and aged, and the creepy dolls in one of the rooms are still eerily playing. Once a noise occurs, Arthur and the audience go quietly ballistic. As an entry into mainstream horror fare, the film does have its share of ""BOO!"" scares, but here, it's all about suspense and waiting for the fear to creep up on you.<br/><br/>Most movie buffs will check this movie out for the casting of Daniel Radcliffe as Kipps. Fresh off the conclusion of the ""Harry Potter"" series, Radcliffe has a lot of weight on his shoulders. Most of the movie depends on him and his reactions to the supernatural events going on around him. He still looks a little young to be married with a child, but Radcliffe handles himself surprisingly well. Ciaran Hinds and Janet McTeer back up the main character greatly as Daily and his unstable wife.<br/><br/>Perhaps the movie could have been better if Jane Goldman included some humor in her dead serious script, but ""The Woman in Black"" sticks to the old-fashioned formulas of such films as ""The Haunting,"" ""The Innocents,"" and ""The Others."" Throw in a few creepy children and some great effects, and you have a recipe for a solid haunted house movie. Thanks to a heavy atmosphere and a good performance from the Harry Potter alumni, ""The Woman in Black"" achieves its goals and brings some great chills to the spine."

You now have The Woman in Black.<br/><br/>It was a refreshing break from all the crude horror movies that seem desperate for gore and violence throughout. No, The Woman in Black was actually scary in its own way, from its haunting setting, to disturbing villagers, to sudden sequences of scary images that left you twitching in your seat.<br/><br/>Needless to say, after watching this, you're going to think twice before going into a dark room...or anywhere...alone.<br/><br/>9/10.

"JimmyCollins","8","0","1","1 June 2012"," Superb chiller that is a breath of fresh air for the horror genre.
","As an avid fan of the novel of which this film is based, and a big fan of Hammer, I was very excited to hear that it was finally getting a big screen adaptation, and in my opinion it's an extremely fine adaptation of an extremely spooky story.<br/><br/>The story is about a young lawyer named Arthur Kipps, who is still fragile after the recent death of his wife, because of his grief his work has suffered, so as a final chance to prove himself he is sent to Eel Marsh house to settle the affairs of a recently deceased woman, it's here at Eel Marsh house that all the chills, thrills, jumps and bumps start beginning, a mysterious woman dressed entirely in black is seen throughout and around the house, taunting Arthur, this sends Arthur on a mission to find out who the woman in black is and why she haunts Eel Marsh house.<br/><br/>I really loved this film, it simply must be seen on the big screen, the moodiness/darkness/dreariness is suited so well to be seen in a dark cold cinema. The production is top notch all the way, the eerie score, the dilapidated house, the almost barren town are all presented terrifically, in particular the trail that leads to Eel Marsh house, it totally has an overwhelming feeling of dread around it, everything in this aspect is done to perfection. The acting is stellar, Daniel Radcliffe is extremely fine in his performance, his emotions and the way he expresses himself are all done very well, not cheesy or overdone, also worth a mention is Janet Mcteer, who is always great, she is almost another mystery worth solving, her character is certainly intriguing and she is great in every scene.<br/><br/>The Woman In Black works very well as a horror film as well as a mystery, even though I knew the outcome as I'd read the book, you still get very interested in how it's all going to end, the ending is a tad different from the book but I do actually think this ending films a bit better. An all round excellent movie which is well worth the time, I would recommend it to anyone who loves decent cinema. <br/><br/>Here's hoping this is the first in a long string of great new Hammer films. :)"

","First, this is a great break away film for Daniel Radcliffe! No more Harry Potter character for him. Yes, his stint on the stage, and Broadway were great, but still does not give him the audience reach that this film gives him. He needs to make more films that will give him the audience reach that he needs to break free from the 'bi-speckled' character of Harry Potter that he was been playing for all of these years. Still he is a joy to watch. See and notice as I did that he was the bluest of eyes that really stand out. Is it done on purpose, I don't know but kind of make you think. <br/><br/>With his body language he creates a tensions and mystery that this movie needed to work well. To give that creepy and haunted ""look over your shoulder"" type of performance.<br/><br/>It is ""A"" typical 'Hammer'(look up the production company) move that will will give give that creepy feeling of 'you should not be there' entertainment that is traditional to every haunted house movie. Dark, creaking floors, dim dusty nooks and carnies, squeaky heavy doors, and jiggling door nob and a twisted story line all done with taste. Is this a 'Oscar"" winning performance, nah, but maybe for sound. You have to see the movie to understand. <br/><br/>Don't over think it when watching this move and see it for what it is, a haunted house flick that you have to see with the lights off, a bowl of popcorn, a drink and your other half next to you. And get ready for the twist and turns. <br/><br/>Enjoy."

","Two things I freely admit in advance: I'm not a big fan of horror films made nowadays, and I do tend to make fun of the modern fashion of films of all kinds to over-rely on the use of cgi cartoonery. However, this one is an exception. It uses a necessary amount of cartoonery to help generate a spooky atmosphere, and although shocks galore has no gore.<br/><br/>Young employee sent by firm of solicitors to none too friendly North to help wrap up a dead person's estate, an estate apparently situated next to a village full of weird yokels with secrets and in the middle of swampy washland, gloomy woods and a doom laden time warp. For the first hour it's really good (pity it wasn't two hours), backwards and forwards in a dark candle-dependant Gothic house and grounds, unfortunately it then gradually becomes rather ordinary with the ending telegraphed to the viewer in advance. Instead of a walking into the sunset ending nowadays a walking into the spotlighted grimy fog does. Every trick in the book was trotted out to great effect, I noted all the obvious bits from three of my favourite films The Innocents, The Haunting and Diabolique. Serious young man Daniel Radcliffe said less than the dog he was with, and could've played Leonardo DiCaprio's son in Titanic and got away with it, but was to me surprisingly good in the main role.<br/><br/>But I was surprised by how good the entire film was overall, a judicious mix of shocks and cartoonery that actually worked and even has me hoping I will be spared long enough to revisit it!"
"gradyharp","8","0","1","26 May 2012"," A Smidgen of Edgar Allen Poe, Henry James, and British Gothic
","This is the second cinematic adaptation of Susan Hill's novel of the same name (the last was made in 1989), this one written for the screen by Jane Goldman and directed by James Watkins. As with many British ghost stories (termed Horror, Drama, Thriller by the press) the themes remain the same - just the locales and the names of the characters change. Not that that is a bad thing, but it is nothing novel and if such stories are your cup of tea - shadowy images in darkened house windows, incidental dead children, a suspicious group of townspeople, a lots of candles flickering out because of mysterious doors opening and closing at will - then this incarnation will please. There is very little dialogue and very little character development, but the locations are magnificent, the cinematography is glorious (Tim Maurice Jones) and the musical score (Marco Beltrami) is chilling. THE WOMAN IN BLACK is an elegantly creepy, atmospheric, British period style ghost story.<br/><br/>When a friendless old widow dies in the seaside town of Crythin, young solicitor Arthur Krips (Daniel Radcliffe), who lives with his four-year old son Joseph (Misha Handley) - Arthur's wife Stella (Sophie Stuckey) died in childbirth) - and Joseph's Nanny (Jessica Raine), is sent by his firm to settle the estate. Arthur finds the townspeople reluctant to talk about or go near the woman's dreary home and no one will explain or even acknowledge the fact that he inadvertently incurs the wrath of a malevolent spirit, the woman in black. She is no filmy, gauzy wraith, but a solid black silhouette of malice and evil. The viewer only sees her a few times, but you feel her malevolent presence in every frame. Ignoring the towns-people's cryptic warnings (they are trying to conceal a deadly secret), he goes to the house where he discovers its horrible history and becomes ensnared in its even more horrible legacy.<br/><br/>Along the way Arthur is befriended by Dailey (Ciarán Hinds) and his strange insane wife (Janet McTeer) and Dailey is the only man willing to transport Arthur across the tide covered marshes to the haunted estate. The story is basically dealing with life after death - in the person of ghosts who stay around to wreck vengeance for their deaths - and the many events that suggest that indeed there is a place after death is borne out by story's strange ending.<br/><br/>Daniel Radcliffe manages to carry his role well (the designers keep him with a fashionable 5 o'clock shadow to prove he has outgrown Harry Potter) and the subordinate cast is strong in the miniscule parts they are given. This is a mood piece, a ghost story of the old-fashioned sort, and it doesn't pretend to be otherwise. You either like these films or you don't. I do."
"momtopom03","8","0","1","26 May 2012"," Scared the heck out of me!
","I can't believe some people gave lousy reviews. It's a horror story; ghosts, scary faces, scary sounds, a big scary house on a scary marsh; what more were you expecting? I've been waiting a long time for a really good ghost movie; one that made me anxious and afraid to sleep in my house at night. This one did it. The window scenes alone were enough to get you looking over your shoulder.<br/><br/>I loved that it was set in England and as I mentioned, that it had all the visual effects needed. The beginning was just a tad slow and I must admit, I used that time to make myself a snack but then later wished I had watched it. Daniel Radcliff did a great job as did the supporting cast. I thought Simon's wife was just a little too crazy but during the time period the movie is set, she wouldn't have the medications we have today to deal with her anguish.<br/><br/>I gave it 8 instead of 10 only because I can't understand how Arthur would go back in that house, let alone stay over, after that first sighting. Course if he didn't, there would be no movie. He just didn't seem too scared to go back in the house; maybe a little nervous but certainly not scared.<br/><br/>In any event, I really enjoyed this movie. The Others was a scary movie until the ending; then it became sad. Darkness Falls could have been scary but I found myself laughing during some of the scenes. The Woman in Black; this scared me. In fact, as I type this review, it's morning and sunny and I still find myself glancing around the house."

","I see no way to do a review of The Woman in Black without making some sort of legitimate comparison to that of Hammer horror films. For those unaware, Hammer horror films were films made under the British label Hammer Films. They were predominately active from the 1950's to the 1970's producing a wide variety of low budget horror films featuring eerie atmospheres and recognizable characters like Dracula, for instance. Their films always had the cinematography down to a tune, not to mention usually incorporating some element of film noir and science fiction in for good measure, and the term ""Hammer horror"" has been made synonymous over the years with stylistic efforts focusing on the lesser-shown pieces in the genre. Recently, in 2007 I believe, Hammer Films was revived and The Woman in Black marks one of the latest films from the company.<br/><br/>It reminds me of Ti West's The Innkeepers, a horror film of the same breed just released this year. It was an exercise in the genre of slowburn horror, neglecting all of the glossy special effects and gory set pieces that we have grown accustomed to, and threw in some effective atmosphere and tonal suspense to create an unsung blend of eeriness. Unfortunately, the film still has yet to get the recognition it deserves, yet may retain the minor cult following it has eagerly adopted.<br/><br/>The selling point for The Woman in Black is without a doubt, Daniel Radcliffe's name and after a decade of doing mostly Harry Potter films, only getting side-tracked by very small projects, he handles the role firmly and believably. I had a discussion with a friend on whether or not Radcliffe would fade away into nothing or would he continue to work on other projects. I quickly said that Hollywood will probably never let him stop working. He has such an ability to act with enigma, and never gives away too much or too little. He has grown up in front of the camera, dodging both harsh criticisms and media glorification. Will he ever be known as anything other than Harry Potter? That's a whole different subject. It would come as no surprise to me if he eventually made a film that would garner universal acclaim and land him a Best Actor win. Then maybe he would be known as that character. Or he will forever be the Mark Hammil of film.<br/><br/>Paying delightful homage to the Hammer Films, The Woman in Black starts us off by introducing us to Arthur Kipps (Radcliffe), a studious lawyer, father of a four year old child manning down the fort after his wife's death during birth, and trying to live as collective a life as possible in Edwardian era England. Ultimately, to prove he is still a successful and capable worker, he accepts a job from his boss to manage the estate of the recently deceased Alice Drablow, who had lived with her husband, son, and her sister in the Eel Marsh House.<br/><br/>Ostensibly, one could dub Arthur delusional. He consistently has visions of his wife and it isn't long before he begins to experience things of the supernatural nature in the Eel Marsh House. There is one scene in the second act that is about twenty minutes long of Arthur wandering around the house touching things, picking up knick-knacks and occasionally scared to death by a piercing noise or a sudden shift in the wind.<br/><br/>This is not a study on Arthur's unknown condition as much as it is a study on the Eel Marsh House itself, its location, decor, atmosphere, and vibes it brings after the death of its owner. It is inevitable that your mind will drift during the film, due to the lack of movement and events, but sometimes, the terror will virtually gnaw at you until you give in and jump a few times.<br/><br/>The Woman in Black is smarter than your average horror-fare, but is sometimes, literally, quietly incompetent. Its long patches of silence seem to be listless and it does come off as hokey and uneven more than it should. Still the sets are lovely, the music perfectly compliments the setting, and Radcliffe (who has to carry a lion's weight of the film) gives a strong performance, out of his comfort zone which was firmly placed into a character for over a decade. This is a solid and moderately strong effort in the genre.<br/><br/>Starring: Daniel Radcliffe. Directed by: James Watkins."
"robyn-small","8","0","1","23 May 2012"," Absolutely frightening to the core!
","I cannot recall the last time I was truly scared from start to finish in a movie. The Woman in Black is a bouquet of evil, menacing, heart-stopping characters and moments that will keep the hair standing on your neck for the duration of the film. The timing and Macabre nature of this story and setting are perfect with just as much anticipation of fear as fear itself. Daniel Radcliffe comfortably fits in with this genre and played his character smoothly, managing not to wince at all the scary parts, a trait in characters of horror films that can ruin the element of surprise. The plot was solid and eluded to a sadness of sorts, a dark history that shrouded the small group of members in the fear-driven town. The movie-watcher is even moved to empathy for the evil main character at points while not losing grip of the blanket needed to hide behind. And the final terrific cinematic surprise, especially in a horror movie, was the great ending.<br/><br/>I love horror movies and i truly loved this one, I highly recommend it and my best suggestion...don't turn away for a moment."

It could've been I guess a little bit better. Somehow a basic topic about ghost vengeance is too many times used in this kind of genre and recycling over and over again. Someone may think it was the point of this movie but where is originality? There are about 10-15 minutes in continuity without any spoken word as well but filled with spooky thrills.

","""The Woman in Black"" (2012) is a Gothic suspense-horror thriller, directed by James Watkins (writer and director of Eden Lake), that passes in the early twentieth century, in England: it is the story of a lawyer, Arthur Kipps (Radcliffe), who lost his women in the birth of his boy, now age 7, and that are depressed ever since.<br/><br/>After the death of an elderly woman who owned a secluded mansion in the middle of a marsh, in a rural English town, he has the job to arrange the paperwork, in order to sell the house and moves there to deal with it.<br/><br/>From here begins the story that unfolds from the occurrence of sinister events, and the villagers strange reactions, who fear a superstition that curses the village.<br/><br/>The film is well done, visually, has a sad and gloomy, dark atmosphere typical of Gothic-themed movies. There's no abuse of special effects or blood, and the film relies more on the atmosphere of suspense, until the end of the movie.<br/><br/>I just noticed a inconsistency in the filming, when two characters are driving, in a open car, and the hair of the characters do not move - after that I noticed no other gross errors.<br/><br/>The music, which only appears discrete and pertinently, and the sound effects are good, and helps to compose the general atmosphere.<br/><br/>What stands out in this movie is the performance of Radcliffe, beginning to get off of his eternal role of Harry Potter: his acting in the movie are very good.<br/><br/>The main story unfolds gradually as the secrets of the house, the legend and its ghosts are explained until the end of a film that follows and the Gothic style ending.<br/><br/>Just as a note, the film is based on the book by Susan Hill, written in 1982, which has the same name, and has the same story, but with modifications in the sequence of events and the ending.<br/><br/>Overall is a good movie to pass the time, being a good classic tale of Gothic horror-thriller, related to ghosts and haunting, but nothing that really stands out among the many films that exist.<br/><br/>My score: 6.8 / 10.0."

","I walked into this movie having read many reviews on IMDb, thinking that I was going to get bored half-way through a badly written clichéd film starring Daniel Radcliffe, whom I expected to show promising things and hopefully move onto something much better.<br/><br/>But what I saw was a very traditional Gothic horror story with a very tight and flowing script, a very fine ensemble cast without exception, wonderful photography and period costumes. Daniel Radcliffe carries the film admirably. I didn't notice the score and that's a great compliment as it fits perfectly into the movie. And was it tense? There was hardly a moment that I wasn't gripping the seats.<br/><br/>I think the only weakness is that they succumbed to modern horror-genre stereotypes in terms of the ""make-a-person jump"" sound effects. I would be curious to see whether the movie would have worked without them, because the mood was set so well I thought that the scares were unnecessary.<br/><br/>And while the ending is terrific, the epilogue is a bit of a let-down.<br/><br/>But don't miss it at the cinema!"
"safra176","10","0","3","19 April 2012"," Nothing Wrong with this movie.
","(May be spoilers) I have never given a movie 10/10 but this one wins as one of my favorite movies. Daniel Radcliffe is amazing in this, even though the whole time I was screaming ""HARRY YOUR WAND!!!.......oh wait"" but I still loved it.<br/><br/>I really was on the edge of my seat. A few times I did jump but after a while I got used to it. It was intense, you knew something scary was going go happen but the exact moment you did not know. So you would be ready for something scary and BAM! Something pops out or whatever and you would still skip a heart beat. I also love how it was not a killer just running and killing there was a story that was rather interesting. I think scary movies are so much better when there is a back story to why someone is killing. Some people found it boring, maybe they did not get it or they are the people that want blood and gore. If you are one of those people this movie may not be for you. The movie is about a man named Arthur Kipps who is kinda depressed about his wife dying in child birth. He has a son that is a toddler now. Kipps is going to spend time with his son but he has one last job to do before he can. Kipps has to go to a house of a woman that has died to settle the estate, he does not bring his son with him. He arrives in the town that is very creepy and everyone seems to be depressed and colorless. Everyone warms him not to go to the house for random reasons(they don't tell him why, which I find stupid) he goes anyway and while looking through papers he hear noises and he find a room in the house that is locked but there is noise coming from inside.<br/><br/>Kipps befriends a rich man that lives in the town named Daily. No one will take Kipps to this house but Daily takes him there and back. Kipps stays over night and finds out more and more. He still hears noises coming from this room, he sees the woman in black, he sees children standing in the yard at night. In the marsh outside the house he sees a boy rise from the muddy water next to a cross and he walks to the house. The strange boy tries to open the door but when Kipps opens the door no one is there he walks out looks around when coming back into the house mud foot prints are on the ground.<br/><br/>Every night Kipps would see this woman. He soon finds out that when ever someone sees her a child dies. The woman in black kills the children or she makes them kill themselves.(Idk why they did not just move out the town or tell Kipps the story of what will happen.) Every time a child dies the woman in black is there. The people in the town do not want Kipps to go back, he does. Kipps finds out that the woman in black had a son that was taken from her by her sister. She was also crazy but her son died and no one looked for the body so the woman black haunted and killed children because her son was taken and died and not given a respected grave. Both Kipps and daily go to find the dead body of the boy and lay him to rest with his mother. We think all is good but at the end (Warningw spoiler) Kipps son arrived in the town, he is going to leave with his son that night. We see the woman in black. Kipps son walks off onto the train tracks, train was coming. Kipps jumps to save him but they both are hit by the train. We see Kipps and his son walk off into the light to Kipps dead wife. Then we see the woman in black by the train tracks.<br/><br/>I love this movie! It is a must see. The only problem, people did not tell Kipps about how kids die when someone sees the woman in black and the people did not move out of the town. It would have saved lives. Still its intense and heart pounding. SEE THIS MOVIE!!!!!"

","The only grievance I had with it was that there wasn't much lines for Daniel.In this film you can see the value of good lines-from an absence of them. Being a Harry Potter fan but also a fan of Daniel, I tried very hard not to see Harry when I watched the film and you can see the effort Daniel put into doing the same although casting him as a young father was a bit of a stretch. I can't see any fault with Daniel's contribution with the film and I hope he continues to make solid classy films. On the other hand,for some reason it seemed like a short film.There were no interconnected plot lines or surprise ending.Although,yes I was genuinely scared, something was missing from it. I'm sorry to put it bluntly but the effects were laughable..The one scary scene did not make me roll off my bed in fright.It was like ripping off a plaster.Short and a bit surprising but left no lasting impression It's frustrating because there was a lot of potential for some very scary scenes in this film."

"KineticSeoul","7","0","1","30 March 2012"," Finally a horror movie that isn't a found footage genre and it's scary
","Now I didn't read the novel this movie is based on but I sort of want to now after watching this movie. Now I seen scarier movies, mostly movies from Asian cinema. But this one did a pretty darn good job with the creepy eerie feel to it and the scares. The movie starts out pretty slow though and the build up is a bit boring with constant jump scares that doesn't build any tension. It almost seem more drama like than horror for quite some time but when the horror kicks in, it can get pretty scary. When the main character finds out what is going on, the tension starts to get pretty high and there is a lot of creepy parts to it as well. Which makes me wonder why they had those super creepy dolls for kids to play with but it does add a lot of creepiness from it. Although the camera seems to focus way too much on the dolls to the point the movie sort of feels like ""Dead Silence"" sometimes. So the plot is this during the very early 1900's Arthur Kipps(Daniel Radcliffe) wife dies from giving birth to a male child and after a few years later after that event, he leaves his four year old son to handle a estate at a very very creepy mansion. I don't know about the character Arthur but it would take me a lot of will power to stay in a mansion like that by myself. Daniel Radcliffe is pretty decent in this and fit right in this movie and his small and skinny stature adds to his vulnerability which makes it more tense when the scary moments kicks in. But he just didn't seem that scared despite the really scary stuff going around, he sees something really creepy and he goes to investigate anyways which doesn't make much sense to most people. But this is one of those elements that apply to most horror flicks so it's passable. But his character still should have at least shown a bit more fear to make it buy-able, even if his character might have lost the will to live. Lot of horror flicks use children and something about their innocence and naivety adds the creepy effect and it's done with it's close to full potential in this. Sometimes this movie reminded me of ""The Grudge: Old Lady in White"" and ""The girl in black"". Which is fine because those are pretty scary flicks as well. This is actually a decent movie after Radcliffe finished the Harry Potter franchise, this one will give chills and goosebumps. It did for me and I seen a lot of horror flicks, not the scariest movie I seen but this one does a pretty good job with the scares.<br/><br/>7.5/10"

","The film by James Watkins claims the horror genre, but I personally thought that a horror movie up to put it mildly, this picture is not reached. It is very formulaic movie turned out. And all the scary moments, and ""unexpected"" shadow, and ""boom! Boom!"" Yes, and the denouement was predictable from the first 15 minutes. The director has turned out just fine, nice, terrible story (which in many children's camps were told), not more. Well, not all of sneaks inside, not filled with horror. The point not that-a little or a lot of blood or a zombie, the point is 1) all the tricks of the operator, painter, stage tricks - are not new; 2) the plot does not catch neither an unexpected denouement, neither deep characters. Where is showing reflection of the protagonist, where his a struggle, doubt, where the disclosure of the characters? This is does not. The director focused on the picture to the ""horror"". It's very simple. Sparingly. Although certainly a qualitative picture came out, England, late 19th century, atmospheric and beautiful, Gothic, house, interiors, landscapes, costumes and props. But! where are the heroes? not in the foreground. To be honest, not something to fear, well from what you can not sleep here at night ..!? A truly horrible, chilling, scary (if you want) films, those that act on the feelings, under pressure, so to speak, on the psyche. Here, the so-slight horror. For presentation and disclosure of talent Radcliffe seems to me that there was not enough scope (spaciousness). Role of the outrageously simple, no special reflection, a feelings of monotypic. Not that role, which can reveal all of his talents and release from Potter. Although he certainly played perfectly. But to me why it seems that the title of the genre ""horror film,"" Watkins skillfully hid the genre ""drama"". I would like to talk about this ""second bottom"", a drama with elements of horror. Black and white, as you know, these are two sides of one coin. And Arthur was persecuted not so much a woman in Black as a .. yes yes .. his beloved, his Woman in White, which became the fatal «woman in the black» for him. This is her he can not let go of all 4 years, her sees in a vision, her does not drive away, with her can not break the emotional connection. It was she, a woman in white, has turned his life into hell. At the beginning of a young father, not paying much attention to his son, silently immersed in a world dreams, visions, dreaming fruitless to meet again with his deceased wife. During all picture, he's chasing ghosts, lives in the past, not wanting to let him go. And lo and behold, he finds himself in a village where people in fact live exactly the same. Is the director showed us the life in this town, happy children, laughter, innovation, development of .., no. Is the director showed us the life in this town, happy children, laughter, innovation, development of .., no. Before us, slough of despond, dejection, greyness monotonous days , oppressive atmosphere of despondency, distrust, and dullness, monotony. In this village live with pleasure haunted, live in the past. There is no air and sun. Only black & white landscapes. Parents who are locked(!!!) own daughter, ostensibly to protect her... No, not in black woman killed her. Killed her own parents, who live illusive dreams and prejudices, and maybe she just broke down and burned himself, lit a fire in the midst of this greyness, as well as burnt itself from within after drinking lye, the second girl. Children can not stand the peace with greyness and dejection, sadness of the world. Arthur goes to the manor, again through the black-and-white field. Black and white field, black and white women, and a mixture of these opposites and gives the dull gray color, the color of the swamp, which sucks all the inhabitants of the village and Arthur more and more Arthur got out of the swamp only conditionally, but he did not want to drive away the past, and him absorbed a swamp, slowly sucking in all 4 years. It is unfortunate that the young son he pulled behind him, of little interest to his son, 4 years, he lived dreams (in psychiatry, said a person get stuck). Arthur had wanted such a finale. Definitely. His woman in black become his a woman in white, here is the most awful and terrible, his wife. This film is about a large box with grief and sadness, which is better to leave on time, while the swamp you will not swallowed, it is impossible to live the world of dreams, the reality is needed. And this Watkins' drama with elements of horror movie, I would advise everyone to watch, though, to understand and comprehend is what- « No need to look way back in time, no need to chase ghosts. Enough to make phone calls that have not answers. Stop fighting the fact that you can not afford defeat. Let go of it. It's time we all stop and start walking in the opposite direction.»-Japanese writer-philosopher, Kobo Abe. And if that is what Watkins wanted to tell us, bravo!"
"JamesHitchcock","8","0","1","17 March 2012"," One of the most genuinely frightening films of the 21st century
","Susan Hill's novel ""The Woman in Black"" is one of the most famous ghost stories of recent years, reminiscent of the classic works of M R James. A theatrical adaptation has been running in London since 1989, making it the longest-running current West End production apart from ""The Mousetrap"", and it was made into a television film, also in 1989. (I won't compare the 2012 film with that version, as I have not seen it since its first television screening 23 years ago).<br/><br/>The story is set in the Edwardian era. A young solicitor named Arthur Kipps (a name Hill borrowed from H G Wells) is assigned by his firm to handle the estate of a woman named Alice Drablow, who has recently died, and travels to her manor house, Eel Marsh House, located on an island in the coastal marshes. (Exactly where in England the house is supposed to be situated is never made clear- probably somewhere in the North-East, although the scenes of the house itself were filmed at Layer Marney Tower in Essex).<br/><br/>Eel Marsh House has a tragic history and a sinister reputation in the locality. We learn that when Alice was a young woman her sister Jennet Humfrye gave birth to a child out of wedlock. To avoid a scandal, Alice and her husband brought the boy up as their own son, but he died in a tragic accident at the age of nine and Jennet, maddened by grief, committed suicide. It is said that ever since then the house has been haunted by Jennet's vengeful spirit and that every appearance of her ghost, known as the ""woman in black"", presages the death of a child in the neighbourhood. Kipps has also had a tragedy in his life; his wife died in childbirth and he has been left to bring up their young son alone.<br/><br/>Kipps faces hostility from local people, who fear that any intrusion into Eel Marsh House will provoke the ghost to take the lives of more of their children, but befriends Sam Daily, a local landowner. Although Daily is a sceptic who does not believe in the legends surrounding the old house, Jennet's ghost proves to be all too real. It could hardly be otherwise in a film of this nature; nobody is going to make a horror film based upon the premise that belief in ghosts is all superstitious nonsense.<br/><br/>""The Woman in Black"" was produced by the revived Hammer Film Productions, the most famous name in British horror, but it is very different to those rather camp Gothic tales, generally starring Peter Cushing or Christopher Lee, that they churned out in the sixties and seventies. It is in many ways an old fashioned ghost story, reminiscent of Alejandro Amenabar's ""The Others"" from around a decade ago. Whereas most modern horror films (especially those of the ""torture porn"" sub-genre) rely upon explicitly showing us acts of violence in all their gory detail, ""The Woman in Black"" returns to the tradition of films like ""Cat People"", ""The Spiral Staircase"" and ""The Haunting"" of relying upon the power of suggestion. The ghostly Jennet, for example, is only seen in brief glimpses. The difference is that director James Watkins, like Amenabar but unlike the directors of those other films, has at his disposal all the special-effect resources of the modern cinema.<br/><br/>The result is one of the most genuinely frightening films of the twenty-first century, particularly during those scenes where Kipps is alone in the old house. Certainly, some of the devices Watkins uses are clichés of the genre, such as the creepy music and that huge black crow which mysteriously appears inside the building, yet they are remarkably effective in creating an atmosphere of terror. Even I, who am normally sceptical about the existence of ghosts, was persuaded to suspend my scepticism.<br/><br/>The film's best-known name is Daniel Radcliffe as Kipps. As in ""My Boy Jack"" he does enough to suggest that he has a good chance of making a name for himself in the post-Potter world, even though, short of stature, slight of build and bespectacled, he does not have the normal looks of a matinée idol. (These characteristics, however, have not prevented him from acquiring a considerable female following).<br/><br/>The ending, which is not the one that Hill wrote in her novel, will perhaps strike some as too sentimental. ""The Woman in Black"" is, nevertheless, a most impressive film. It is only Watkins' second film; I have not seen his first, ""Eden Lake"", but on this evidence he appears to be a director to watch for the future. 8/10 A goof. While searching the house, Kipps finds a birthday card sent to Nathaniel on his first birthday. The card shows a picture of an Edwardian motor car. It is clear, however, from the dates on his tombstone that Nathaniel was born in the early 1880s, before cars were invented."
"snows_in_africa","10","0","1","16 March 2012"," Love this movie!
","Personally, I think this is a one good scary movie but like all good movies, there's always room for criticism.<br/><br/>Let's talk about the good stuff first. Okay, the setting is beautiful, and the plot is pretty good - well it's predictable but hey, it's a horror film, I don't expect any twist or incomprehensible plot because this is not a thriller.<br/><br/>As for special effects, the ghost kids are so badly disfigured that you could puke in the cinema. However, I don't find the woman in black scary at all.<br/><br/>Now it's time for the criticism. Mr Harry Potter is too young and sexy to be a father of a 4 year old kid. There's also another thing about his facial expression. Throughout the movie, he's got this confused look, it's like as if he's solving a puzzle in Da Vinci code. He should be scared, in cold sweat and tremble when he sees a ghost. He saw more than one scary looking ghosts, but he's as calm as Mr Arnold.<br/><br/>All in all, this is a good film. It's a must see in 2012."

","I am assuming that the majority of you reading this are below the age of forty; if I am right, then I want you to tell your parents and grandparents to go and see this film and be prepared to be scared in a proper way, not just startled, but really unnerved in the way that you were by ""Dead of Night"" in 1945 and by ""The Haunting"" in 1963. This is my type of horror movie: no blood and snot shocker, just a well-paced thriller based on the conventions of such films, i.e. DO go upstairs when you hear creepy noises, DO go into the dark room where you know something terrible is waiting and DO NOT lock doors to keep the bad thing out (or else, lock ALL doors through which you may need to escape yourself). I had never realised how creepy musical boxes are; I now realise that clowns are far scarier than I had realised and folks who live in remote villages definitely are not good for visitors. If you changed the location of the film to Transylvania, this would be the absolute epitome of the Hammer films I paid my two bob to see in my teen years (half-a-crown in the balcony),from the suspicious locals to the sets so well built that they look like real locations. As for young Harry Potter as Arthur Kipps, I found him quite stiff and lacking in variety of emotional expression, but I hope he soon finds a role which will give him a chance to show a wider range. I only hope he has a shave next time.By the way, I have never watched a Harry Potter film, so Daniel Radcliffe came to me as a pretty unknown quantity."
"napierslogs","6","0","1","12 March 2012"," Simple, quiet but creepy harshness to a classic horror
","I went into ""The Woman in Black"" thinking it was going to be a dramatic thriller along the lines of ""Martha Marcy May Marlene"" or ""Take Shelter"". But it turns out to be a classic horror. Better than a Hollywood horror movie, at least it's a British indie. Set in the late 1800s in a haunted house, the film thrives on the austere harshness of the small town, the house and its inhabitants.<br/><br/>We have one main hero, Arthur Kipps (Daniel Radcliffe), who has to leave his young son and travel on business to take care of the final papers of a deceased woman and her lonely old house. The house is literally haunted with shadows of disquieted ghosts and creepy deaths of young children. The overblown score will tell you when to get scared. Some of which were reasonable startles to have in a movie, but towards the end most thrills were visibly ridiculous.<br/><br/>The only interesting direction the film takes is never having Arthur doubt himself. He knows what he is seeing and he's going to get to the bottom of it. The reason that character works so well is Daniel Radcliffe. He's good for the film, and the film is great for him. He has a very quiet demeanour and a very earnest, steadfast approach. This keeps the film simple and gives a power to the actors. One which Radcliffe competently displays.<br/><br/>Everything and everyone in the film is haunted. The title tells us, and prepares us for, one of the illusions, which I thought was good. Most of the other-worldly hallucinations or actions were just to increase the creepiness factor but don't give any insightful interpretations. But then again, I don't particularly like horror movies; only when there is an element of reality to the thrill."
"lizzykittens","5","0","1","11 March 2012"," The Woman in Black is an artfully brilliant production that fascinates the mind, reviving all the dead conventions of Horror...
","In an incredibly traditional thriller/horror style, The Woman in Black epitomises everything we find horrifying about haunted houses and superstitions – to truly terrify someone, it is unnecessary to drown the screen in blood and gore, but it is more effective to establish an eerie atmosphere which sends chills down the viewer's spine with each vibrating footstep. It is clear that together with Daniel Radcliffe, director James Watkins has made his mark, challenging the contemporary ways of creating horror; he has set standards that 2012 and years to come may struggle to top, and has completely revived the dead, traditional genre of Horror.<br/><br/>It is sad that Daniel Radcliffe's acting improvement from the Harry Potter series is almost nonexistent, but his ability to shift his persona after engaging in such a steady roll is admirable. His role as a widowed lawyer with a son leads him into a muddy mess, as his investigation in a woman's death traps him in an unwanted horror that his curiosity cannot cease chasing, despite ample warning from the village. Thankfully, his lack of ability to portray his emotions is not entirely counterproductive; his character's ignorance is mandatory when setting the atmosphere. The worry in the villager's voices and faces are enough to create awareness of the supernatural, which leads to questioning the curious behaviour of the villagers and their children's untimely, unexplainable deaths - the premise of this horror.<br/><br/>The essence of horror is not to completely confuse the viewer, but instead to lead them astray and leave their mind feeling vulnerable and frightened. This is effortlessly accomplished in The Woman in Black; the simplicity of the story and swiftness of plot progression is perfectly proportionate. It feels traditional, eerie almost, like the feeling when watching The Others for the very first time – we feel frightened, but don't know why just yet. It is tailored perfectly to tantalize us, to tempt our curiosity; we continue to wait for the woman in black to appear even though we know a scream is just around the corner.<br/><br/>Classical Horror imagery is incorporated into almost every scene – the creepy musical toys, mahogany rocking chairs, the dim, candle-lit hallways in an old, Victorian mansion. Even the foggy marshes that is considered one of the most cliché conventions of horror feels as fresh as if Watkins was the very first to use it. The pace of the film begins relatively slowly, but does so in order to place us in the village as if we were stood right beside Radcliffe, and to see for ourselves the woman in black.<br/><br/>Whatever your preference of film genre may be, The Woman in Black is an artfully brilliant production that fascinates the mind, reviving all the dead conventions of Horror that we all once loved, but unwittingly abandoned in favour of gore and blood. Your knees will be knocking, your stomachs will be twisting, and unquestionably you will be trembling at the sound of a pin drop, observing fearfully for the silhouette of a woman."
"ipekmine","6","0","1","11 March 2012"," Successfully Creepy
","My expectations for 'The Woman In Black' were neither high nor low, and I was curious about Radcliffe's first non-Potter performance. He surely did a good job, might not be the best actor out there, but he did well in this movie. In addition to trying to keep us back from thinking about Harry, the role itself was another challenge for Daniel as it was mainly focused on his character and he handled it well, even during the several minutes when the film flows without one single word. His moves and expressions did the talking through those parts, if I may say so. Sadly, not many 'new' actors manage to use body language these days, therefore hats off to Harry -oops, Daniel, I meant. As for the movie, it's good. It doesn't necessarily make you sh!t in your pants, but keeps you concentrated and tense through the whole time. For a story adapted from a play, it has a perfect flow and makes sense overall, something that doesn't always happen with these kind of thrillers. It's creepy in a good way, contains almost all of the classical aspects without making it too cliché or boring. Most importantly, from first moment on it makes you feel like you're gonna flinch any given moment and this is done professionally, with the background music, the very successful movie-set and good directing. The ending is also good, and does not disappoint. All in all, The Woman In Black reminds us that ghost stories can be much more attractive than the recent blood-full, poor plotted so-called horror movies."

Harry's seemingly 'acting' innocence (as an man?) worked in his favour - you felt that he was out of his depth in the story (as it should be).<br/><br/>Often with these types of films, you sense that there is no answer to the story, although the unfolding is good in its telling in the film, the final scenes may lack a little coherence.<br/><br/>Overall, I'd recommend the film without question, well directed and an entertaining Hammer Horror."
"smoore-39","5","0","1","5 March 2012"," Expect nothing more than you would from an average Hammer Horror from the 60s
","I naively expected that a Hammer Horror film from the 21st century would be a step up from the low-budget affairs that bore this brand in the 1960s and 70s. While the film clearly has access to a larger budget than its predecessors it is essentially no better than an average vintage Hammer Horror. <br/><br/>Where Woman in Black differs in a positive way from earlier Hammer Horrors is in the relative authenticity of its period detail - it looks like a good quality BBC costume drama. I wrote ""relative"" because in one fundamental way is lacks authenticity to such an extent that I soon lost my ability to suspend disbelief - it is set in an isolated community in the north east of England, and yet judging by the accents of the villagers this is the one of the most multicultural isolated villages in the land. One of the main characters, a local landowner, speaks in an Irish accent for some inexplicable reason (yes, I know that the actor is Irish but he put on a good RP English accent when playing Julius Caesar in the Rome TV series). Perhaps I should also add that, accents notwithstanding, the quality of the supporting cast is quite high. <br/><br/>Where Woman in black very much follows on from the B-movie Hammer Horrors of the mid-twentieth century is in its formulaic approach to creating suspense and horror: very annoying use of loud noises as a cue for you when you should be scared, a mad and ugly villainess, villagers taken straight from Frankenstein etc. <br/><br/>And, finally, where the film fails to match up with Hammer classics is in the rather modest acting skills of its lead - Daniel Radcliffe still strikes me as having made his way to international stardom purely on the basis of looking like Harry Potter. Radcliffe's performance in Woman in Black is not bad. Indeed it is competent. But that is not good enough for a film with a very simple plot that unravels so slowly that whole minutes elapse with nothing more to entertain you than the visuals."

","I'm a huge horror movie fan and was looking forward to this title.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I got really disappointed with The Woman in Black for two main reasons: it's predictable, it uses tons of clichés.<br/><br/>First, the storyline is reminiscent of so many other movies out there. The first few moments were quite original and I expected a few twists here and there, but as I continued to watch the film, I realized that I'm in for a big disappointment.<br/><br/>Daniel does a good job in delivering his role, but the support characters are strange and out of place and the entire premise seems badly developed. The ending was quite predictable as well and to be honest, it could have been done SO much more interesting and scary.<br/><br/>Second, all of the ""scary"" scenes are not only very easy to anticipate, but they were almost literally copies from other ghost movies. The mirror ghost scenes, the screaming face scenes and a plethora of others were all blatantly copied. Unlike intense psychological horror movies or movies that use anticipation and the fear of the unknown (REC, Exorcist, Paranormal Activity), Woman in Black employs cheap thrills with the excessive use of atmospheric music, sound and special effects. <br/><br/>Overall, Woman in Black is not a horrible movie, but if you're a horror movie fan and have seen your share of films, you'll be thoroughly disappointed by this title. <br/><br/>It's quite predictable, uses simple scare tactics and dare I say...boring? <br/><br/>7/10"

","As a movie fanatic; I have owned, reviewed, and witnessed over 850 DVD's and VHS tapes some with superb stories, some not so good. <br/><br/>To start, it was even stated by J.R Tolkien herself; Danial Radcliffe is a very good actor, but most of his audience will depart from his newer films because of what made him.. harry potter. and unless Danial works really hard in gaining new audiences his name will soon be forgotten. <br/><br/>I agree completely. <br/><br/>nevertheless, this is a wonderful film; and it does deserve some praise. but to me, I cannot help but feel the story was pulled out of several different horror movies and jumbled into one, well played screening. <br/><br/>this is indeed one of those movies you have to glue yourself to a chair and attempt to get through the first half hour before anything even somewhat entertaining happens, but boy when it does you'll be wishing you'd made some popcorn first.<br/><br/>what starts slow, (until about 36.58)ends up being a thrill ride filled with ghosts, and hauntings, all through the eyes of a broken lawyer.<br/><br/>I would gladly watch this movie again, even if it makes me think of several other films at once (Human centipede, sleepy hollow, a haunting in Connecticut) and I would suggest you give it a watch."

","Hammer (Horror) Studios were revived in 2007, and came back with worthwhile remake Let Me In and silly The Resident, it was good to see they were making a classic ghost story, and I was looking forward also to seeing the child star grown up in a different role, from director James Watkins (Eden Lake) and writer Jane Goldman, Jonathan Ross's wife (Stardust, Kick-Ass). Basically, set in the Edwardian period, Arthur Kipps (Harry Potter's Daniel Radcliffe) is the young lawyer who has become depressed due to the death of his beautiful wife Stella (Sophie Stuckey) who died while giving birth to their son Joseph (Misha Handley). He is obviously caring for his now toddler son, who spends a lot of time making drawings of the family - with his father in them with a sad face. Arthur is assigned to complete paperwork for the sale of a large house on a marsh near an obscure village, and all the people there live in fear, so he is shunned on his arrival and stay. Alice Drabow was the owner of the Eel House estate, and she lived there with her husband, son Nathaniel (Ashley Foster), and her sister Jennet Humfrye (Liz White), and obviously Arthur has to look at the house itself too. As time goes by and Arthur is forced to stay in the house, due to the marsh water level rising, strange and mysterious things are happening, such as creaky noises and seeing things, and he realises that the house is haunted by the ghost of a woman scorned. He asks questions to the villagers, and he learns that the ghost of the Woman in Black is that of Jennett, and she is seeking revenge for the death of her son, who is actually Nathaniel, and was taken away from her. The only people who are friends to Arthur and willing to help him in the situation are local landowner Sam Daily (Ciarán Hinds) and his wife Elizabeth (Janet McTeer), as they understand what it is like to lose a son. They give him information concerning the estate, the background to the story of the Woman in Black to help an investigation, and Sam even helps Arthur pull out the body of Nathaniel from the marsh. Using a number of windup toys Arthur must lure the ghost into the son's room so that she can see her boy and be at peace, and after a short attack she disappears, and he lays the body of her son by her side in her grave. In the end Arthur is reunited with his son Joseph, but then the curse of the ghost, where children are forced to kill themselves, strikes one more time, as Arthur and his son are hit by a train, but in death they are finally reunited with Stella, and the Woman in Black looks on to freak you out. Also starring carriage driver Daniel Cerqueira as Keckwick and Tim McMullan as local solicitor Jerome. This is a good choice of film for Radcliffe, seeing how he spent the last ten years as the boy wizard, and it shows he does have a good range, hopefully this will continue into other genres. As for the film, it has all the right elements for a good classic scary movie, a haunted house where the victim is isolated, good tense music by Marco Beltrami, and a good amount of jumps, the biggest being near the end with a horrible high pitch scream from the ghost, it is not all that scary all the way through, but it is certainly a horror thriller to see. Worth watching!"
"valbrazon","9","0","1","24 February 2012"," Excellent scary movie with Radcliffe.
","I saw the trailer of this film before Devil Inside, at least something good for catch up a bad movie and i had only one idea : watch it. It's what i've done and i'm really surprised of it! I suspected a scary movie without real interest but it wasn't. It looks like a lot ""The Others"" for the style (haunted house and ghosts), ""Insidious"" for the son missing and it's scary scenes and ""Dead Silence"" for the old woman. I noticed a reference to ""Old Boy"", there is a scene where Daniel Radcliffe take a hatchet and walk slowly in the house.<br/><br/>I expected a twist ending for this movie, because most of the times there is a twist in this type of movie, but there is not.<br/><br/>For conclude, it's a must see movie if you like Daniel Radcliffe and scary movies."

","Having been a die hard fan of the Woman in Black story for many years and having read the book, seen the original made for TV film and been to see the play in London, I was sceptical about the remake and wondered how similar to the original film it would be. I have to say it is a very good film and did not disappoint in any way. Quite different to the original film, but that doesn't take anything away from it. The suspense it builds along with large gaps where there is no dialogue and the dreary back drops help to play on your imagination and Daniel Radcliffe is brilliant as Arthur Kipps, if a little young looking for the role perhaps.<br/><br/>Lots of scenes that make you jump too, which is great and I think they did a good job of incorporating their own take on THAT FAMOUS SCENE from the original film. As for the ending, it's definitely open to interpretation, personally I didn't interpret it as a happy ending, but that's my personal opinion. Enjoy!"

","This is definitely one of my favourite films. Before I went to watch it I had no fears and thought it'll be fun. I spent half the time in the cinema with my hood over my face because it was that scary to me and never have I heard so many screams in my life, but that's the good thing about the movie it's not one of those gory horrors where you seen blood flying around the place it makes you jump/scared and more aware. I'm one that likes have things jump out at me even if it does scare me, but that's the whole point. If you're the same as me then this is a film that you definitely have to see. Those I definitely don't agree with it being a 12A, if I we're to bring a child with me I don't think I'll ever hear the end of their screams."
"Scarlet_Syndicate","8","0","1","23 February 2012"," Is this really a 12A?
","I went into the cinema with quite low expectations of a horror that is only rated a 12A. I didn't however expect it to be so good. <br/><br/>The start is quite slow and it took a while for me to get into but once I started to watch it properly, I was hooked. The tense storyline keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout and keeps you guessing what will happen until the very end. The acting was to a very high standard, although that said, it is still very difficult to remember Daniel Radcliffe can't just cast a spell with his wand in this film and everything will be alright.<br/><br/>There are a lot of moments which make you jump and want to hide away from the screen and it works very well as a stand alone horror film, Although, one thing I was confused about with this film was how it got such a low certificate rating. If I didn't know what rating it was, I would definitely have said it was a 15. On the other hand though, this film does prove you can make a decent horror without having to keep it to a limited audience.<br/><br/>All in all, if you're looking for a night out with your friends and you're a fan of horror then this movie is well worth seeing, however I would advise that it is not a film to take young children to watch."

","Here's a movie that is watch worthy for the spooks. Don't go expecting too much of graphics in this one. Detailed review below<br/><br/>Plot: The story is set in late nineteenth/ early twentieth century. A young father who's in financial stress, tries to take up an assignment of dealing with papers pertaining to an old estate that is now long vacant. To him, this could mean saving his job. The only problem is that, the house he tries to assess, and the village nearby is haunted by the Woman in Black.<br/><br/>Effects: As can be expected in a ghost flick, there are quite a lot of frames that have been captured only to arrest the attention of the viewer; either with a subtle fingerprint appearing on a window or creepy noises, one is kept in the edge of their seat. Apart from this, there are also scenes, like that of a fire accident, that are very neatly done without too much gore. Whenever she appears on the screen, the ghost itself is made to appear extremely calm (except in the last scene) - something that is extremely unnerving for the viewer. The crescendo that accompanies the final time we see her in the mansion, makes it a really exciting watch. The set (mansion/ village) itself is quite brilliantly done.<br/><br/>Cast and Performance: Daniel Radcliffe is the protagonist of this tale and has done quite well in his first movie performance since the Harry Potter series. His natural act does give away in moments where you expect more fear or action out of him. But this is probably good in a way, as it wards off his Potter series histrionics (that is still stuck in our mind). Roger Allam as Bentley is probably the only other actor who shares a good spoil of the screen time and does okay. The tale is probably too thick with the haunted scenes that one would probably not recollect the other minor characters in this film.<br/><br/>Direction: The director (James Watkins) has stuck to traditional spooks to keep the audience entertained. This does extremely well, considering the fact that the whole tale is set in an era which may not mingle that well with too much of special effects. As explained above, he has made sure that Radcliffe doesn't keep himself in his wizardly shadows. Directing the sequence of events in a very straightforwardly manner probably meant that the intention was not to get the audience too preoccupied in piecing together a story, but rather enjoy the thrills that come with a horror flick.<br/><br/>Read my full review at: http://blog.nrajesh.com/ review-woman-in-black"
"davidgee","6","0","1","22 February 2012"," The ghost of Harry Potter
","Susan Hill's Henry Jamesian ghost story gets a bigger make-over than the stage version. The premise is more or less the same: young solicitor's clerk arrives in deserted house to sort out papers of deceased owner. Cue spooky goings on involving a dead child and its dead but restless mother.<br/><br/>An audience weaned on the SAW series and PARANORMAL ACTIVITY was never going to settle for mild disturbances in the manner of The Turn of the Screw, so after a few scenes of frightened villagers lifted from any Hammer horror you care to mention we soon start to see dead people. A serious flaw in the direction allows the audience to glimpse ghostly reflections and manifestations in a rocking chair before Arthur does and before the CGI is cranked into overdrive. Helped by local landowner (Ciaran Hinds - with a full-on mad-with-grief wife who almost belongs in a Carry-on), Arthur thinks he knows how to placate the Woman in Black. But does he? ... Cue (loud) threatening music.<br/><br/>The 'ghost' that really hangs over this movie is Harry Potter; the wiz-kid is going to take longer to get past than an incarnation of James Bond. Daniel Radcliffe tries hard to climb this mountain but he is not yet (will he ever be?) an actor of substance and here, as in the HP series, the special effects overwhelm the cast. There are a few make-you-jump moments in THE WOMAN IN BLACK and the marshy setting is a pleasing throwback to Roger Corman's Edgar Allan Poe adaptations, but this movie will not enjoy the shelf-life of Jack Clayton's THE INNOCENTS or Robert Wise's THE HAUNTING, two early Sixties spine-tinglers that are still tingly 50 years later."

","""The Woman in Black"", as the title suggests, is about a deceased woman dressed in black and the mysterious events that happen in a small English village in the 1890s. Daniel Radcliffe is Arthur Kipps, a young lawyer and father of a son and husband of a wife who has passed away having given birth to their son.<br/><br/>Daniel Radcliffe picks up a task from his company, which sends him to a village and a remote ""empty"" house. You all know what comes next. This house turns out to be not so ""empty"". Who is this woman in black. You will have to watch the movie yourself to find out, but I can ensure you it is not a new and distinctive ghost story. It is a plot used numerous times for ghost stories, with a few changes here and there indeed. The overall movie goes on from start to finish in a somewhat linear way. It is not a movie with noticeable twists and turns and sudden realizations. It, however, is a movie that is well-organized to present in a way that makes sense.<br/><br/>I would not say it is a happy ending or a sad ending, but it is obviously a clear one that does not require or allow much imagination, definitely not one that is full of ambiguity. A natural and organized story and an appropriate amount of shocking scenes join to offer the audience a good movie experience. I recommend this as a ghost story with a few great moments.<br/><br/>There are a plenty of disturbing scenes and moments that can make your heart jump out, but they are apparently not disturbing in the bloody way. So if you enjoy a ghost story with a solid plot that makes sense, this is for you."
"matthew-owen61","9","0","2","21 February 2012"," Taking the horror film to a next level
","I went to watch 'The Woman in Black' with my friends last weekend. As it is rated a 12a, I didn't have very high expectations concerning the horror side to the film, and thought it would be like any other 21st century horror film; rubbish. Oh, how wrong I was. This film is jam- packed of suspenseful scenes, terrifying houses and eerie faces seen in a window near the beginning of the film. I genuinely thought this film was brilliant. It wasn't filled with ridiculous scenes filled with blood and guts flying every where, like you would get in films such as 'Final Destination.' Arthur Kipps (Daniel Radcliffe)is a widowing lawyer who is given one last chance to prove his worthiness to the law firm he works for. He Just so happens to be given the case of a woman who died, and is sent to her house to do deal with the paper work. It's obvious that the residents of the village do not want him there, and it's later in the film you find out why. The scary stuff really begins when he is at a sink, and you see the blurred figured of a woman step out down the corridor from him......but I won't spoil it for you. From the beginning scenes, to the end credits, this film is gripping and without doubt one of the most frightening film I have ever seen. Daniel Radcliffe portrays his character very well indeed, and it is nice to see him a film other than 'Harry Potter.' I applaud him for his part in the film. Edge of the sit stuff, you won't be disappointed!"
"Lwills093","9","0","2","20 February 2012"," I wasn't disappointed
","I went into this movie thinking it was going to be good because i read many good reviews here. Usually, this is a recipe for disaster because a movie will get hyped up and then you usually feel let down for some reason. That didn't happen with this movie. This one was different from all the horror movies I've seen in the last twenty years. For one, it was filmed in England, and that got my attention right there. The house where the incident occurred, was Creepy! The story was creepy and very interesting and kept my interest from beginning to end. I can't say anything bad about this movie. I was scared and entertained, and I would see it again."
"CharlotteRoseOG","9","0","1","20 February 2012"," Amazing film exceeded expectations and most importantly...Gave me a scare!
","The Woman In Black... When I first heard about the film (maybe half a year ago) It intrigued me. I haven't seen the play or read the book but the story at once caught my eye. The trailer did a good job of setting me up and I expected a jumpy creepy film full of surprises. I was not disappointed. The film was a perfect balance between story and scares. The story was engaging and intriguing and the scares came both expectedly and effectively, or alternatively when you least expect them. It doesn't rely on an awful lot of CGI or gore and so if you are looking for the next Saw then look somewhere else. However, if you are looking for an impressive horror with amazing writing and great performances then this is the film for you!<br/><br/>Daniel Radcliffs performance was fantastic. Gone are the Harry Potter days where if something dramatic was about to happen then the wand and invisibility cloak would come out. Instead, we see the amazing raw talent that Daniel Radcliff possesses. Having never over impressed during the Harry Potter days, in this film his facial expressions and the look in his eyes did more than any spell ever did! A truly fantastic performance. He really seems to 'get' his character and portrays him perfectly. I was 100% hooked!<br/><br/>Admittedly, at some points the story can get a tiny bit confusing. But it is never boring. And yes, the jump scares do come in quick succession, but they don't happen when you think they will or how you expect them to,so they still have the desired effect on the audience! If you scare easily then also be warned, you will jump, scream, and have a really creeped out lurking feeling in the back of your mind for days afterwards. I know I did. But it is so worth it! So whether you are a horror fan or not, go and see this film. It is a nice British horror that will really impress.Plus, if you see it in the cinema it looks fantastic on the big screen and if you are lucky you'll sit in a cinema where the tension is so evidantin the room that you could hear a pin drop. When was the last time that happened?"

","In the late 1950's through the early 1970's, Hammer Productions produced a string of excellent Gothic horror films, including their own stunning versions of Dracula, Frankenstein & The Mummy to name a few. As famous for their gorgeous set designs and wonderful British actors as they were for their hauntingly terrifying psychological scenarios - these films have become legends of horror. From the 1980's onward, Hammer Studios lay dormant until suddenly and unexpectedly they again began to produce new films starting with 2010's ""Let Me In"". <br/><br/>I am happy to report that Hammer's one-of-a-kind Gothic ""scary tales"" have risen from the dead. This film is beautiful to look at, completely engrossing and one of the most frightening pictures I have ever seen, and I've seen thousands! Daniel Radcliffe, in a roll that could totally make or beak this movie, not only rises to the challenge but completely annihilates it! He is superb and heads an equally stellar supporting cast. The plot is a fairly simple ghost story, so I won't go into that too much because the real star of the show here is the execution of that story.<br/><br/>If you are sick of the mundane, slice 'em and 'dice em horror flicks that shed gallons of blood but fail to initiate even a flicker of horror - then you are in for a real treat here. This one WILL give you goose bumps and nightmares!! An utter triumph in the horror genre!"
"effyhow","9","0","2","19 February 2012"," A near flawless horror film
","I have now been to see The Woman in Black twice, apparently I am a masochist. <br/><br/>Haunting, chilling, jumpy, eerie, TERRIFYING - team these with snippets of dry humour and you get a really watchable film (or not if, like me, you spend the entire film with your hands over your eyes, cowering in your seat). <br/><br/>If you can look past the occasional stiff performance from Daniel Radcliffe and stop yourself from assuming that he is far too young to be playing the role of Arthur Kipps, The Woman in Black is a relatively flawless horror film. <br/><br/>This is not to say that there is none of the cheesy predictability that tends to go hand in hand with the horror genre, for example, ""Don't worry about collecting me from this creepy old haunted house before it gets dark and the tide comes in, I'll work through the night."" That was never going to be one of your finer ideas was it Arthur Kipps? Don't you know that the creepy stuff happens when its dark? And of course, the incessant build-up of anticipation followed by a loud crash and a musical crescendo. ""Is it a ghost? Oh no its just a crow!""<br/><br/>From the get go, the lighting and the camera angles set the mood of unease, the constant gloom that encompasses the scenery hints at what is in store and the uneasiness and the tension do not cease at any point. And there are some genuinely terrifying moments.<br/><br/>It is the simplicity of the film that makes it what it is. It is has not succumbed to Hollywood and does not try too hard, save a few inevitable clichés. It had me scared of the dark, what more could you want from a horror film? <br/><br/>http://stephdarestodream.wordpress.com"

"Anurag-Shetty","10","0","3","18 February 2012"," One of the scariest horror movies of all time!!
","The Woman In Black. Wow, where do I begin. Right from the first scene of the movie the moviegoer is on the edge of his/her seat. Arthur Kipps, a lawyer is under a lot of debt. He's given a last & final case. To sell a house in Eels Marsh village. Once he's there however he finds out there's something strange going on in the house. This is the summary of the movie in a nutshell.<br/><br/>This is the only horror movie I've watched in recent times that not only uses the clichés of horror like sudden noises & the likes but also has some genuinely scary moments without any sudden sound. Daniel Radcliffe has done an outstanding job in his portrayal of Arthur Kipps. He has improved substantially since his Harry Potter days. Radcliffe has a genuine look of fear on his face throughout the movie. Ciaran Hinds is effective as Kipps' sidekick Mr.Daily. Elizabeth, Daily's wife has done a spectacular job! The little boy who plays Kipps' son in the movie has done a good job as well. That boy is so cute! Anyway, I want to conclude my review by saying The Woman In Black is a must watch movie. Especially on the big screen. Don't drop your popcorn buckets out of fear, people! My rating, a perfect 10! Tip off- If you hate, blood, gore & violent deaths & still want your dose of horror, then The Woman in Black is made just for you."
"lopezetta","8","0","1","18 February 2012"," Gothic horror at its finest
","It's been a long while since I watched a film so rich and drenched in the psychological aspects of horror rather than the visceral ones.<br/><br/>SPOILERS--- begin The dilapidated, old mansion full of worn-down rooms and the traditional, grandfather clock nicely setup the mood and atmosphere for the ominous that comes from beyond. The creepy factor is accentuated with the mechanical toys that at some moment one could swear they would come to life at any moment to haunt the protagonist.<br/><br/>This is Daniel Radcliffe's first, post-Harry Potter role, and I would say his body and facial expressions capture our wildest imagination when he dares to venture alone inside the mansion at night or investigating all the strange noises and visions during the day. SPOILERS--- end<br/><br/>Furthermore, I am a huge fan of Gothic style ever since I was introduced to the genre by watching Tim Burtons' films like Edward Scissorhands and Beetlejuice, since childhood. And, I was wondering how the Goth and horror premise for this film would have been handled if either Tim Burton or Guillermo del Toro had been offered to take the mantle in this movie.<br/><br/>Anyways, The Woman in Black never deviates from its formulaic storytelling and succeeds at keeping the suspense factor and lingering feeling of dread and fear at all times, proving that what matters in horror is a gripping story with a protagonist that speaks for us our worst fears at a psychological level, making him or her to start doubting the rationality of the mind once the ominous Lady of the Black decides to make her presence known.<br/><br/>Furthermore, a very good advantage this film possess is that it relies in both psychological horror and an ominous story to keep its audience in expectation of what's in store lurking at every corner of the creepy mansion, keeping the use of CGI special effects limited by the dark visuals or to a minimum when they are needed to be used; this is the kind of horror that stimulates the viewer's imagination, because it delves into the fear of the uncertain and the unknown.<br/><br/>I definitely enjoyed the film, and I will list it as one of my most see for this year's Halloween season."
"byrann_gowan","7","0","1","18 February 2012"," Dan trades wands and flying broomsticks for a haunted house and the woman in black
","And the result is a near-perfect movie.<br/><br/>So, the story here is that a young lawyer, played by Radcliff, goes to an isolated village where he is trying to sell a house known as the Eel March house (or something like that). When he gets there, however, he realizes that, not only do the villagers seem very unwelcoming, but he realizes that they keep their children inside the house for most of the movie. That is because they are trying to protect them from the woman in black, who is a ghost that is hell-bent on taking the lives of children, basically as revenge for when her own child died.<br/><br/>The result is that of a great movie. I must say that this is the first time in which I went to a horror movie in the theatre. They scared me so much as a kid, that I did not want to watch any single one. Even the ""Goosebumps"" on television scared me. But, when I saw the preview, I felt that I should see this movie, even if it is just to see Dan in his first post-Potter role.<br/><br/>Speaking of which, the acting is great here. Ciaran Hinds is great as Daily, the only guy who tries to help Arthur (Dan's character), whether it is to sell the house, or if it deals with the woman in black. Janet McTeer plays his wife, who has some scary moments of her own.<br/><br/>But, I can't leave out Dan. Unfortunately, there was one aspect of him that made me deduct one point from the film, and that was the fact that he was a 22-year-old, playing a father of a four-year-old. He just seemed a little too young to be portraying that aspect, and so because of that, I was, like many others, reminded of Harry. Nevertheless, he is still able to hold his own in the film, and his character is actually someone that we care about.<br/><br/>Speaking of which, what really works in this movie is the character development. We are immediately introduced to Dan's character; the movie does give us glimpses of his past, which is good, because we get to know him more that way. Same with the other characters; Daily is a really likable character, and the villagers are not so much angry as they are scared. It is great character development, and that is very much needed in a film like this, because in a lot of horror films, we just get the young kids who just like to party. Not here, though.<br/><br/>And finally, the scares. This is a movie that doesn't rely on blood, guts, and gore; also unlike other horror films, it simply relies on chills and scares, which is a nice break from the horror films. And let me tell you; there are scares. I definitely jumped a few times, and if a film makes me do that... well, I give it props.<br/><br/>Overall, a great movie. Rotten Tomatoes said that there may not be enough chills for viewers that are more used to the horror films that we usually see. I disagree; there are chills, and there are times where you will jump. Plus, the actors all did a great job, even though there were times that I couldn't get Harry out of my head, and the script and the characterization was well-done. A 9/10 for me."

The name could have been Pied Piper since she was denied something and she took to stealing other's child, My children since the villagers would raise their kids only to be taken by this lady, the screaming lady coz she won't talk no matter what or in my case I would have done something like Woman with no clothes for once phasmophobics would have been excited to see the ghost. Also the Woman in Black is completely illogical coz even after being united with her child she won't give up killing kids. It makes one think that all she wanted to do was kill kids rather than be united with her child. Plus why will she wait for people to see her and then plan a killing when she could just pop up anywhere, doesn't make any sense. <br/><br/>Our beloved Harry Potter aka Arthur did not look like a dad. Toward the end of the movie he announces – She (ghost) has gone only to contradict himself in the next scene where he wants to leave the city at once. In normal circumstance one would enjoy the glory that follows but not Mr. Potter. <br/><br/>Overall a well directed movie in the first half, the buildup is nice but the second half lets it down."

","Hammer studios release their best movie in decades, with this stark, atmospheric ghost story.<br/><br/>Radcliffe is a lawyer who has a tragic past. His wife died during childbirth and now he is struggling to make ends meet and is on a final warning at his law firm.<br/><br/>He goes to a remote village, where it seems that everyone has seen The Wicker Man and treat Kipps as an outsider. He is there on business to sort out someones estate, but the locals are desperate to get rid of him, apart from one, the local rich man, Sam.<br/><br/>Kipps arrives at the estate to catch up on paperwork, and when he looks out of the window, he sees a mysterious figure, the titular character.<br/><br/>From then on, every time he sees 'TWIB', a child from the village dies in a violent way.<br/><br/>Slowly uncovering the truth via letters from dead relatives, Kipps goes through psychological toil trying to keep sane and keep harm away from his child...<br/><br/>What Potter did next is something very mature and hugely scary in parts. It's a traditional ghost story, and the director knows what to do with the source material and the beautiful house which, without trying to sound clichéd, becomes a character in itself.<br/><br/>What makes the film more eerie is that we never really see 'TWIB' close up until the last five or ten minutes. The rest of the film, we are treated to subliminal glimpses and effective use of 'old house sounds'.<br/><br/>Radcliffe is great, and soon gets rid of the Potter similarities, although he may be a little too young to plat the character.<br/><br/>the film gives you an unsettling feel of dread from the offset and depending on which way you look at it, the end is either very glum or very uplifting, Kudos to Jane Goldman for such a good script too.<br/><br/>Well worth seeing.<br/><br/>And the dog makes it at the end if you were wondering..."

","Although I have never read the novel, I have seen two different versions of the stage show which tells the story of junior solicitor Arthur Kipps' trip to remote village Crythin Gifford, to deal with the affairs of the recently deceased Alice Drablow at (even more remote) Eel Marsh House, a creepy house reached via a causeway which disappears under water at high tide. Shunned by the locals, Arthur finds that he may not be as alone as he thinks at Eel Marsh House as he begins to backtrack Alice Drablow's circumstances and the reason why the villagers are so hostile.<br/><br/>The Woman In Back is a decent late 19th / early 20th century ghost story, and the stage adaptation (turning it into a two hander) is very effective. The film is also moderately effective, even though it takes fairly extensive liberties with the original, not least of which is turning Kipps into a widower from the outset in order to shoehorn in an ending which is at odds with the author's original shocking conclusion.<br/><br/>The film is unquestionably atmospheric, but there is a distinct air of trotting out haunted house clichés, many of the early ones of which are somewhat dishonestly manufactured into ""Made you jump"" moments (carriage driver Keckwick appears behind Arthur accompanied by a massive orchestra hit - ""Made you jump!"" Yes, because you just played an enormous orchestra chord right in my ear!). Fortunately, there are some genuine scares later on and the film only just stays - perhaps for lack of gore - within its 12A certificate. So there are worse ghost story movies to see, and it is nice to see Hammer Films up and running again. And it is worth mentioning Ciaran Hinds' terrific performance as Sam, local rich man with as many secrets as the other locals.<br/><br/>Now to the criticisms. One is that it is never made clear why The Woman In Black (for - spoiler apologies! - you are left in no doubt that she exists, we the audience see her when Kipps doesn't) exacts such revenge on innocent people who were not involved in her own tragedy: it all seems a bit unreasonable, and doesn't work as well here as it does in the theatre production. The other - and the main one, I fear - is that Daniel Radcliffe simply isn't very good. In performance terms, Arthur Kipps is simply Harry Potter without glasses but with whiskers. He has one expression - earnestly anxious, and this passes for mourning at the start when his wife dies in childbirth, and continues 4 years later as he is sent on this assignment, and remains in place as The Woman In Black appears in the shadows and just on the edge of his vision, winds up clockwork toys, rocks invisibly in a rocking chair etc. etc. - Kipps remains anxious. Radcliffe's one-note performance convinces no more than his one-note Harry did. And his mildly estuary English is so contemporary that it simply doesn't ring true for the era in which the film is set, and ends up being distracting.<br/><br/>By the way, given that Crythin Gifford is a tiny village in the back of beyond, drowned with rainfall, obscured by fog, with a population of miserable souls who are hostile to strangers, how come the inn is so fully booked that Kipps can't get a room?"

","From the very beginning of the film, you knew that it was going to be good... The mood is set almost immediately, and jumps straight into it. I've had a lot of people telling me that it was ""slow"" at times, but I completely disagree, and think that it was simply building the tension!!! As soon as you lay eyes on the house in the marsh, and the creepy music plays, you're on the edge of your seat and waiting for the unexpected to happen... Throughout the movie, I was constantly looking behind the characters and in mirrors, expecting to catch a glimpse of a shadow, and as soon as you settle, there's a woman on the screen!!! The acting was brilliant, and I love the fact that the characters used body language more than anything!!! This movie had NO blood and gore, just simple, horrifying moments that drew you to the screen... I was so fixated by this movie, that I didn't eat a single piece of popcorn, and had about 5 sips of my drink, which is saying something, seeming as I've usually finished both within the first 10 minuets!!! This movie wasn't confusing in my eyes, and I think the story line was brilliant!!! The one thing that I was surprised on, and really think should be changed, is the rating... I mean, this film should EASILY be a 15!!!! And they didn't even put it as a solid 12, they put it as a 12a!!! Which means kids as young as 5, and even younger are able to watch it with an adult!!! If you're looking at this movie and thinking, oh, it's only a 12a, it's just going to be a few scares that are obviously going to happen when the music plays, then think again!!! I went to see this with my mum and older sister, and we are SO lucky that my younger brother didn't come along, because he would of been crying his eyes out, and we'd have to take him home... This film is AMAZING and I LOVED it!!!! Probably the movie I've ever jumped the most in!!!! WATCH THIS MOVIE PEOPLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 10/10, easy..."

Arthur Kipps (Daniel) a young lawyer who is sent by his boss on his final chance to prove he wants to stay with the law firm, is sent off to the Eel Marsh house.

","I went to see this film with my friends. To start the Hammer logo fills the screen with numerous posters from their classic horror films. This really delighted me. The film provided many, sometimes unintentional jump scares, the whole audience screaming at the sudden burst of a tap, spewing out mud. There are many creepy scenes in which the camera is focused on Radcliffe but there isn't much going on which adds to the mystery of, is the Woman In Black in the shot and we do get that feeling to look for her, especially in the long shots. One question I have to ask is why the film was rated 12A, I mean seriously an 8 year old may die watching this film, they will never sleep again! OK it is not that scary, but still. The weakest part for me was the ending though. WHY WHY WHY did they want to do that.

Everyone in the cinema wondered how it could possibly be a 12. It is haunting, with terrifying visuals - the woman in black herself is terrifying as well as jumpy parts and close up shots of scary content throughout, as well as scary audios such as ghostly noises and screams throughout. Both REALLY would frighten children and some adults. If you look past the scary parts it is a good and interesting tale, but for me it was far too scary to pay proper attention and consider the theatrics of it.

The film mainly takes place in a dark creepy house on an island, the house is haunted and every little thing in the house just makes you jump. The music and sounds used really get your heart beating fast as well. The film used many vintage toys, added some cobwebs, and ended up making some of the scariest and most horrifying toys you will ever see.

","Wow, only a couple of hours ago, I watched this film and it certainly lived up to all expectations! I thought that it would follow the pattern of most horror movies, blood, gore, and not much depth in the actual storyline, but no, this movie was interesting, it was intense, it was chilling and at times, I felt sucked into this teeth-chattering ghost story! The storyline at the beginning was simple but mysterious, and the horror weaved into the film was also simple yet it seemed to have the weirdest effect on the audience. There were so many what I call 'thrills' that I lost count but they weren't unnecessary ones, they fitted in nicely with the film and although because they were brilliantly realistic, and frightened the life out of me, I really enjoyed it. Being scared so much, and getting that really intense feeling all by sitting in a cinema in front of a big screen shows a great film. I haven't given rightly any credit to Daniel Radcliffe, because he tried very hard in this film and you could see how he had grown as an actor, in his actions and speech so overall, excellently directed, great chills down my spine and a great watch!"
"ghost_dog86","4","0","4","12 February 2012"," What a way to bring in Black History Month.
","Written by Markus Robinson, Edited by Nicole I. Ashland <br/><br/>Yet another old fashioned and all too predictable ghost story (by today's standards),sloppily adapted into a feature length film, ""The Woman in Black"" is aforgettable attempt by Daniel Radcliffe to shed his Harry Potter image. Directed by James Watkins (The Descent: Part 2), adapted for the bigscreen in unimpressive fashion by Jane Goldman (Kick-Ass, X-Men: First Class) and starring the aforementioned Daniel Radcliffe (the Harry Potter series), this film tells a ghost story set in the creepiest village in England. Oh, how original. The plot is centered around the tale of a ghost-woman or ""woman in black"" who haunts a gloomy old mansion located in this village, every so often coming out to terrorize the residents by making their children kill themselves. A young lawyer/single father comically named Arthur Kipps (Radcliffe) must travel to said village and enter the haunted house (mansion) because...well because every story needs conflict I'm guessing. In fact, it isn't even important why he goes into the mansion at all, because once there he must go through the hacky haunted house routines which every audience member has paid to see. He must stay overnight in the haunted mansion (for some reason), investigate weird noises coming from that room down the hall, walk up and down creaky flights of stairs, see scary faces in the window and then rub his eyes only to find that the faces have gone, etc. To say the least, the protagonist's actions are not only predictable, but also laughable at times. Very early on it will ring clear to the audience, that knowing who certain people are or why Daniel Radcliffe aka Mr. Kipps doesn't leave the house after he is attacked by the woman in black the first time, is irrelevant. But here is the kicker: storyline aside, acting aside, horrid editing (some of the worst I have seen in modern cinema) aside, there are legitimate scares here! And it pains me to say this, but scares which are so legitimate, that they may be worth paying to see for some viewers.<br/><br/>""The Woman in Black"" is a film which relies Exclusively on pop-out scares (things jumping out of corners, sudden loud noises after long stints of silence, etc.) and extreme close ups on creepy children's wind-up toys. And as horror film 101 as that may seem, director James Watkins makes these simplistic scares highly entertaining. Even through the far too tedious Scooby-Doo routines (where Radcliffe chases the ghost into one room, meanwhile the ghost runs into an adjacent room chasing Radcliffe, which occur over and over again for the entirety of the film) Watkins succeeds in keeping most audiences in a constant state of suspense, by creating a domino effect of cheap but very effective scares.<br/><br/>The real problem with ""The Woman in Black"" basically stems from the filler, or instances during the movie where the scares are not happening. Whenever one of the characters has to read something or talk to someone the movie screeches to a halt. And even though Watkins does a good job of producing scares, the film still contains major camera work problems, for instance: There are long sequences where tons of reading of letters and documents must be done by the audience, in order to obtain back-story on the infamous woman in black. But when these close-ups on all too important old, tattered letters, written in illegible cursive are presented, as an audience member I could barely make out what they said. Therefore, missing much of the back-story to the point where I simply stopped paying attention to the story all together. But the biggest issue with this film comes into play often, and it has to do with the villain (the woman in black). A horror film usually lives or dies on how powerful or threatening the ""bad guy"" is. In the case of this woman in black (and I don't want to give too much away) while she does have murderous rage, she doesn't seem to be able to physically hurt anybody. She gives off this high pitch screams and runs at you, and that is about it. And yes, while she does make children kill themselves, if one doesn't have children then this woman in black is only about as annoying as a common housefly. If fact, the blandness of this villain is a huge reason this film doesn't work.<br/><br/>As for Radcliffe, who goes from fighting Sirius Black to the woman in black, he doesn't give that bad of a performance here. It is just a shame that he is horrendously miscast. His character is presented as a father of a young child, when he himself looks like a sixteen year old boy! And to make matters worse, when he ventures off into the old English village, he is surrounded by parents that also have small children, but said parents are all visibly in their forties and fifties. So, due to a strange lack of make-up, the baby-face of Radcliffe only made him seem that much younger amidst his weathered supporting cast.<br/><br/>Final Thought: If after reading this review and you still wish to see this, maybe you don't know how to read. But my advice would be, in order to have a good time with this material,pay no attention to the nonsensical and barely applicable storyline or the downright confusing ending, because it doesn't take away from the fact that ""The Woman in Black"" holds around ten legitimate scares throughout. In saying that, I am still in no way recommending this film to people who are interesting in an entertaining storyline, or a well done scary movie, or simply a good film.<br/><br/>Please visit my page on Examiner.com http://www.examiner.com/x-52464-San-Jose-Indie-Movie-Examiner and leave any comments you have about this or any review.

","The Woman In Black (2012) is a remake of the 1989 TV movie of the same name and based on the 1983 book by Susan Hill. This remake is actually better than the original, a rare feat. From my experience, usually remakes of horror movies are nowhere near as good as the original. This is an exception.<br/><br/>The things that this movie have going for it are the dark, chilling, spooky atmosphere and the genuine creepiness of the haunted house from the Victorian era. You'll see classic components of a haunted house - cobwebs, paintings hanging on the walls, lit candles, a rocking chair rocking by itself, creepy looking dolls, music box melodies, and of course ghosts. Throw in the thunderstorm and the movie feels complete. This is definitely one of the creepiest and best ghost story movies I've ever seen. There are a lot of sudden scares that might you jump out of your seat. There is an occasional dose of comic relief sprinkled throughout the movie. The musical score by Marco Beltrami is decent.<br/><br/>This movie was my introduction to Daniel Radcliffe (I've never seen the Harry Potter movies). He does a commendable job acting. This movie is a triumphant return for Hammer Horror. Who can forget the classic Hammer horror movies from the 1950s, '60s, and '70s? Overall, this is a good Victorian ghost story that I highly recommend."
"moonandhare","9","0","2","12 February 2012"," Spooky
","Excellent classic ghost story, beautifully shot on location, with lots of creepy atmosphere. Daniel Radcliffe does good work as the young lawyer Arthur Kipps -- I wondered if I'd just see him as Harry Potter, but his character is quite different, and Radcliffe does a good job of conveying his character's emotions. There were also some of the usual great British character actors (Janet McTeer, Ciaran Hinds), who were reliably excellent as always. I also thought the ending (which I won't give away here) was interesting. I hadn't read the book, or seen the play, so I don't know whether the movie has the same ending, but it was well done. I don't usually go to scary movies, but was curious to see this one because it marks the return of Hammer Films, and I'm glad I did see it, as it was lots of fun. No gore, just a deliciously spooky good time."
"yora217","9","0","1","12 February 2012"," Not perfect, but still really good
","I myself am a huge fan of the Harry Potter series and was deeply saddened with the end of the series. It felt like my childhood had ended as the series came to a close last year. I am happy to write that Daniel Radcliffes latest film does not disappoint. This film takes a traditional formula in the horror movie franchise. In today's society, people expect blood, gore and violence to sell in a horror movie, but this one uses frightening unexpected scenes. This works great for the film because it really has little to no violence overall. The premise is a broken man who lost his wife in childbirth and he is assigned to go to the house in which the main story's horror elements take place. The story itself is rather straightforward, you wont really find a huge amount of twists, but then again that is not what the emphasize is on. The Gothic look was very much appreciated by me as i am a huge fan of traditional horror films that were in black and white, and i found this to be a welcome addition to the genre. While it will not be a film that you will watch again and again, or will call a modern masterpiece, it is indeed a fantastic film in my opinion and worth it to anyone who wants to see Daniel Radcliffe in a mature role and a good horror movie. I think if anything my only complaint was that it sometimes felt like it would drift from the main plot and kind of throw you somewhere else without really explaining why. Other then that i can honestly say to go see it and enjoy."

","First, I must say that I have not read the book so I don't know whether the film adaptation follows it or not. All in all this movie surpassed my expectations. Initially I was worried about Daniel Radcliffe carrying a movie and if he could strip himself of his Harry Potter shell. I was pleasantly surprised. <br/><br/>Daniel Radcliffe plays a young lawyer who is brought to an old manor house by his firm to organize the legal papers of a deceased client. Once there he encounters many things that seem out of the ordinary and strange things begin to happen. I will not disclose anything further for that might give away some of the plot.<br/><br/>This movie uses some elements that have been lost in more recent horror films. It makes use of the dark, almost colorless, lighting as well as superb music that sets the tone for the film. The woman in black also avoids tasteless gore and nudity, but instead relies on subtlety and the viewers own imagination. Also, it is fairly light in dialogue. This movie prefers to tell its story with the use of music and images which, in my opinion, is incredibly affective.<br/><br/>As far as critiques, I only have a few. I wish that the film would have expanded on the background story a little more or used more flashbacks. Also, I would have liked a more solid climax in the story. However, as I said, I have not read the book so I do not know whether they were just following that. <br/><br/>Bottom line, this is Gothic horror at its best. It is a true horror FILM rather than trashy shock nonsense. Definitely creepy and worth a watch."

My wife and I went to this not totally knowing what to expect. What we got was a tense thriller that made her bury her face in her hands several times. If you like horror movies like ""Saw"" or the like, this is probably not one for you. If you were creeped out by ""Silence of the Lambs"", you'll probably like this movie. The biggest thing is that repeat viewers are unlikely because the scares are not going be as good the second time around. But it is worth seeing."

","Every once and a while, a film comes out that leaves images, emotions, and dreams in my head for days on end after viewing it. ""The Woman in Black"" is one of those films. Not since ""Drag Me to Hell"" and ""1408"" has a horror film left such a print on me. Horror movies, in general, suffers greatly from terrible directors, cheap scares, and a slew of god awful young actors who end up taking off their shirt, making you forget how bad the movie actually is.<br/><br/>While this film has a few ""cheap scares"" (overly loud sound cues bursting out of silence - of course you're going to jump at these noises. They're unnaturally loud!), it holds on to a beautiful script with smart direction and an outstanding cast of actors all around.<br/><br/>Let's look at the flaws...<br/><br/>1.) ""Cheap scares"". I mentioned it above, and I cannot express how much I am tired of seeing these in every horror movie after horror movie. I don't mind the pop outs, someone standing behind you when you're looking in a mirror/window, etc. It's the bloody damn loud screech of the violin, or the unnaturally loud ""caw"" of a crow bursting out of extreme silence. It's not needed in every film. Every genre has this one thing though. In horror, its the loud unnatural noises bursting out of silence. In action, it's the super unnatural explosion. For romance it's the same old make/out sex scene. For comedy, it's...well, lately it's bad juvenile writing.<br/><br/>2.) Ah, who am I kidding, that's the only thing that comes to mind.<br/><br/>Let's look at what's good...<br/><br/>1.) Daniel Radcliffe! I thought it would be a hard transition from Harry Potter to anything else...but he pulls it off beautifully. A very sympathetic character, beautifully acted, and he just fits right in the tone and look of the film. IF he continues to make wise choices on the roles he takes on, then I am excited to see where his career takes him.<br/><br/>2.) The direction is outstanding. This feels like an old European hammer classic. There is a scene of dread that carries on through the whole film...and I mean that in a good way. While Daniel Radcliffe is slowly advancing down a dark mysterious hallway, while a the sound of something rocking at the end echoes through, he holds an axe in one hand a burning candle in the other! I loved it! Classic, clean, and beautiful! <br/><br/>3.) The cinematography/costumes/and set are amazing. Beautiful and rich with detail. This comes close to the look and feel I had with ""The Wolfman"" (2010). Tim Burton and Tod Browning would be proud.<br/><br/>9 out of 10 stars. If you liked this movie or you would like a better recommendation on a similar sort of film...check out ""Nosferatu "" 1922 or ""Lady in White"" 1988.<br/><br/>Over and dead, <br/><br/>Fox Rain Matthews"

I've only ever watched one Harry Potter so perhaps I don't have the same perception of Radcliffe as a one character actor. <br/><br/>We viewed this in a small theatre and there were plenty of jumps and nervous screams and laughs from the audience around us - which all added to the enjoyment of the movie.

This movie excels in every way to creep you out.<br/><br/>The other movies that I thought had a similar effect were: The Ring. Cannot think of anything else, may be Paranormal activity (first part) for the director being creative in approach. Have fun watching it...The movie is a must see if your expectations match mine."

","In the early 1900s, young lawyer Arthur Kipps (Daniel Radcliffe) is sent to a remote village to go through the papers of a recently deceased old woman. He finds the villagers oddly hostile, yet sets about his work in the woman's creepy, old house. There, he begins to unravel the story of a mysterious woman believed to haunt the place.<br/><br/>If you're looking for a scary movie, look no further. There are scares every four minutes or so once Arthur starts (voluntarily and against all common sense) exploring the house, endlessly going from dark room to dark room while the eerie music and sound effects build to get-ready-to-shriek levels. The movie has little dialogue, with Arthur alone most of the time just looking for the ghost.<br/><br/>This kind of alone-in-the-house part is usually played by a beautiful, helpless, young woman but Radcliffe does a good job and comes off as serious and mature and not too scared of the dark. If you saw the movie without sound, it probably wouldn't be nearly as frightening, so a great deal of credit must go to the music and sound effects. CiarÃ¡n Hinds is good in a rather undemanding, supporting role. The titular character rather disappointingly resembles a mannequin in a high school haunted house.<br/><br/>The movie makes the most out of people' primal fear of the dark and genuine shocks come on a regular basis. I found the movie a bit unsatisfying, though, because it's so unpleasant and there's little to relate to since Arthur is a rather stoic, one-note character."
