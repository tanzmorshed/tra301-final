","This third installment is just as long, fixes some of the damages but adds along new ones. At Worlds End improves on its CGI magic but still possesses that dragging story that is just too long and confusing."
"tough_guy007","7","164","233","28 May 2007"," Good conclusion to the series, same problems as the 2nd
","AWE was a decent close to the trilogy (although they did leave it open for the possibility of a 4th).<br/><br/>Lets go down the list: 1) Holy cow. The CGI is breathtaking. The details on the sets is just as breathtaking. The filming sites were beautiful. These are a talented group of folks I tell ya. GREAT job.<br/><br/>2) Acting .. both good and bad. Sparrow, Barbossa, Beckett, Norrington, Jones, and Gibbs provided some very good acting and funny moments. However, they were offset by Pintel and Ragetti (they got annoying in the 2nd film and it didn't stop here. While I enjoyed the idea of Tia Dalma's character, I wasn't impressed with the performance by beautiful Miss Harris. I haven't especially liked Keira all that much in other things she has done and it was the same here. Decent actress but not overly impressive. Stellan's portrayal of Bill Turner was decent enough but a notch down from what we KNOW he can do. Now the best for last. Im a 100% hetero male and even I can say that Orlando Bloom is a VERY good looking guy. But for the love of pete, this guy is one of the most terrible actors ever and strangely, he was cast in two of the biggest, most profitable trilogies ever. He has essentially played the same character in every movie, just with different costumes. His mannerisms, his low ""sexy"" voice, his facial expressions .. ALLLL the same, all the time. Sooo blahhhhhhh.<br/><br/>3) The story was good but there was too much of it. It has been said here but I will say it again. At one point, I just stopped trying to follow along and just enjoyed it. Everyone stabbed everyone else in the back at least once. It wasn't ""hard to follow"" but a movie like this isn't supposed to make you think. You want that, go see .... Clue :P the whole Singapore thing was just unneeded. While it did add a new element to the film, it just seemed too forced.<br/><br/>4) Running time was a tad bit long but it passed fairly quickly due to the great action sequences.<br/><br/>All in all .. I was impressed with the movie, but it has its problems. Much like part 2.<br/><br/>I say go and see it. You wont be disappointed but you wont walk out thinking you just saw a masterpiece either.<br/><br/>Just my thoughts ..."
"Joe Fixit","8","43","58","30 May 2007"," At World's End
","The more I think about this movie, the more I like it. This is strange, considering my low expectations. The first film was fun, and I was very happy to see swashbuckling returning to movies, but I never really bought into the script. I wasn't convinced that pirates were some sort of blood-bound ""race"", and I was powerfully confused by the distance between and physical relationships of various locations. But, still good fun. The second film just kind of made me mad; I loved the ending, but it was just one example of how much it was a standard sequel: every single quirk of the first film was referenced, every single character had to return, and it HAD to be structured - nay, plotted - like Empire Strikes Back. This included re-introducing the Han Solo-Leia love story where the female lead wants the anti-hero, just to appease all the screaming Johnny Depp fans. It begged to be liked, but aside from a great score, great effects, and some very funny moments, it just came off as trite.<br/><br/>And then we get At World's End, which has everything you could possibly want in a pirate fantasy film: Legendary ships riddling each other with cannon fire in a whirlpool, screaming buccaneers swinging from one ship to the next, sword-fights on crow's nests, and all that in about fifteen minutes. The rest is an admittedly convoluted story that is much more clearly plotted than the second film, while still taking breaks for letting us spend time with characters we weren't so sure about last time, but are once again fond of. Maybe it's Geoffrey Rush as Barbossa, or the overall simplicity of the plot, but it just worked, and I had a great time.<br/><br/>I was legitimately surprised and concerned at what the plot did with our heroes and villains, and was very satisfied with everyone's status in the end. I guess I wouldn't mind seeing another Pirates movie now, but I kind of think everything that needs to be done is in this film.<br/><br/>I can't wrap up without mentioning the very nice abstract stuff Verbinksi and co. did with the journey to Davey Jones' Locker. It takes guts to do really surreal stuff with a $300 million Happy Meal blockbuster, but they really did some new, interesting things with their bottomless bag of tricks.<br/><br/>A- Curse of the Black Pearl: B+ Dead Man's Chest: B"

","(contains spoilers... but trust me, that won't matter).<br/><br/>it's safe to say that Johnny Depp single-handily made the 'pirate' series a success. if not for Depp telling interviewers Keith Richards inspired his captain jack-isms, Keith Richards would certainly not have appeared in the 3rd movie. in between the excessive amount of canon balls/sword fights scenes, i couldn't wait to get home and tear this movie to shreds. <br/><br/>it's such an easy formula: three parts jack sparrow, eleven parts talking about jack sparrow, two parts love stories, six parts pirate ships emerging from water, five parts capturing, five parts rescuing and ten parts action/violence/sword fights. mix haphazardly against elaborate sets and computer graphics. let set for three hours until the audience rises.<br/><br/>the movie could be broken down into FOUR major flaws:<br/><br/>POOR WRITING. it seemed the writers were very aware that audiences were only going to see 'Pirates' for Jack Sparrow, so they thought... ""hmmm, if people love Jack so much... they'll love THREE jacks, or FOUR jacks, or even MORE Jacks!!"" so they made scenes reminiscent of Alice in Wonderland where Jack hallucinates and sees many of himself. the mood and overall appearance of these scenes drastically contrast with the mood and overall appearance of the film. for a minute i thought i was watching an Oompa Loompa scene from Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.<br/><br/>TOO MANY CHARACTERS: accompanying poor writing was the addition of too many characters. in a nutshell: jack's crew (which was two crews combined), the British crew, the squid's crew, and a new Asian crew all have different agendas that (of course) require the other crews to be killed. Elizabeth (Knightly) becomes captain of the Asian crew, Orlando bloom becomes captain of the squid crew and Jack bounces between every crew as he is traded and captured for deal-making. Orlando bloom's character wants to free his father, Jack wants to be immortal, Kiera Knightly's character wants to be with Orlando Bloom again, the squid wants the sea goddess, Elizabeth wants to kill the British captain for killing her father, the British crew wants jack dead and the Asian crew wants to be a part of whichever crew is getting the treasure. but is there even treasure?!! the object they're all after is a beating heart. and yes, it's as confusing as it sounds.<br/><br/>OLD JOKES. just like the second, all of the ""comedic"" moments in the third movie relied on recycled material from the first movie. the humor in 'pirates' can be attributed to six subjects: 1) the wooden eye: kudos to whoever thought to give that guy a wooden eye because you added 30 pages of plot to each film!! 2) jack, the monkey: the only character whose acting improved by the third film. he's also in a lot more of the scenes in the third movie. my boyfriend thought he was the best part. and he was right. 3) rum jokes: the first movie relied heavily on rum jokes. since the third movie didn't know what the hell it was doing, it hit up the booze too. 4) the sexual tension between jack and elizabeth. the cliché ""trust me, it would have never worked between us..."" lines return again. 5) jack getting slapped: yes, women love to slap jack sparrow. we got that one already, thanks. 6) sheer stupidity/slapstick humor: the other nanoseconds of anticipated (but unreceived) humor relied on the dumb antics of the fat guy and the skinny guy with the wooden eye. <br/><br/>CONFUSING PLOT. it felt as though the writers made this movie up as they were filming it and when they were running low on plot someone said, ""i know, let's make one of the crew members turn out to be a sea goddess!!"" and since there are only two female main characters (one being Kiera Knightly), the Jamaican-sounding chick landed the role of sea goddess. this made the plot entertaining for about 20 seconds when the Jamaican chick turned into the 50 ft. woman and started talking like the Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man and then exploded into millions of crabs at which point i leaned over to my boyfriend and said, ""haha, she had crabs!!"" needless to say, i don't plan on seeing the 4th or 5th or 6th Pirates movie. but i will be curious to see if Depp stays aboard. <br/><br/>bottom line: if you were planning on seeing pirates, go see Waitress instead. written by: Jena Ardell"
"phantom_lover_1881","9","47","66","29 May 2007"," Best out of the ""pirates"" trilogy...I'm not disappointed!
","I'm a huge fan of the Piates of the Caribbean movies, but I was a little nervous about seeing this third installment because of the not as good other third installments. I still had pretty high expectations, and I was not disappointed! The plot was brilliant and very creative, with plenty of exciting twists and turns. As always, the acting was incredible. Johnny Depp always does an amazing job, but his Captain Jack Sparrow is probably one of his bests works yet! I still don't see how anyone could be so brilliant... Anyways, overall, just a really great film. Better than the other Pirate films in the trilogy (and you know how good those are!) See it, you won't be disappointed!"
"evilgrinlord","4","552","903","28 May 2007"," I wanted to like it, but...
","It was very disappointing.<br/><br/>I adored the first movie to pieces. I own the DVD and regularly play it on movie nights with my friends. It's great unexpected fun, quotable, and a visual spectacle. The characters are surprisingly likable, and Depp comes roaring in like a breath of fresh air as Capt. Jack.<br/><br/>The problem with the third movie (as well as the second) is that it lost touch with it's roots. The first movie, while heavy with the supernatural stuff, was still pretty grounded in a fairly accurate real world. The characters were over the top, yes, but still believable, and above all, relatable. Their motives and predicaments all made a great deal of sense (i.e. Elizabeth wanting to marry Will, Barbossa wanting to be free of the curse, Jack simply wanting to get a boat so he could live his life of freedom). Unfortunately, in the new movies, the writers have lost touch with the first movie's charm. The plots are so convoluted it's difficult to decipher, much less remember, a character's desires and motives. It's much less emotionally grounded. It has also become so thick into this supernatural fantasy land that it has hardly any link to the real world at all. This would not have been a problem were the filmmakers not so intent on special effects and visual spectacles that they forgot to tell a good, solid story.<br/><br/>I believe this movie would have been better if the writers had kept to a more straightforward plot and toned down much of the ""grand spectacle"" stuff which really dominated the movies."
"xander34","7","257","414","30 May 2007"," Not bad
","Less than a year after the previous installment of the popular pirates trilogy, Jack Sparrow and company return in Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End. The film should be great, given a three hundred million dollar budget, huge anticipation, and the closure a third installment inevitably brings to a series. While this film does show its budget and is quite visually arresting, it lacks a fair share of resolution to the trilogy and confuses with its overflowing exposition rather than purely existing to entertain.<br/><br/>Even in an action packed pirate movie, overly chatty sequences will simply bore audiences just because it's too hard to follow what exactly is being said. The movie really just had too many vague or unnecessary plot points that didn't affect the main plot at hand.<br/><br/>All the acting was perfectly fine, with Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow and Geoffrey Rush as Captain Barbosa unsurprisingly being the standouts. The introduction of Depp's character in the pirate equivalent of Hell called Davy Jones' Locker is a particular favorite, as well as the scenes at World's End, which somehow involves a giant, deep waterfall. Keith Richards' hyped cameo as Jack's father is nothing to go crazy for, he does a decent job, but his screen time lasts only about two minutes.<br/><br/>Director Gore Verbinski and his crew knew going into this that the reviews would be mixed and the plot would be confusing (in order to encourage repeat viewings), but honestly, at nearly three hours, the more the film confuses you the more it becomes an endurance test. Also, rather than providing a satisfying conclusion to the series, the end opens up the possibility for a fourth installment, which might not even happen. The crew put every penny of the film's budget on screen, made evident in the hour or so of its bloated climax. The film looks and feels like a true epic, shots are wide, locations are vast, costumes are extravagant, and the scope is large. However, the film needs to scale down its plot in order to let the characters we fell in love with stand out and shine, as that's what makes these films unique."
"Boba_Fett1138","8","423","708","24 May 2007"," Despite its many flaws, the movie still left me hungry for more.
","The Pirates of the Caribbean-movie serials is probably one I'll never grow tired off. The characters are fun and great, always adventurous and spectacular to watch. <br/><br/>It's really too bad that this time they felt the need to make things even bigger, more complex and conclusive than the previous two movies. Really not needed. In my opinion the first movie ""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl"" is still the best because of the reason that it's simple, fun and choices to be purely entertaining. They already went wrong with this approach during the second movie; ""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest"", when they put in more new characters and different hard to follow plot lines. ""Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End"" goes on in the same trend as the previous movie. There are more new characters and as far as the new many plot-lines are concerned...well let me just say that after a while I just gave up trying to understand the movie and just let the movie take me away with its visuals, humor and other entertaining elements. And this movie regardless should really be able to take you away on a roller-coaster-ride of pure entertainment.<br/><br/>No doubt in my mind that this movie could had become the best one out of the series. It had all the potential and budget for that, now if they had only cut down about halve of the script...Most of the plot-lines seem redundant and are actually far from believable because they contradict from what happened in the first two movies. The many betrayals among characters and side-picking became really confusing after a while, till it reached a point when you just didn't knew who was fighting for what. But like I said before, after a while you just stop caring about it and simply enjoy the movie for what it brings you. It all is also the reason why the movie is now nearly 3 hours long. Now the movie is not as good and entertaining as the first but maybe just slightly better than the second one, because of the large scale of this movie. <br/><br/>The movie is definitely big. There is no lack of action as some people claim there is. There is just as much action as there is in the first two movies, only difference this time is that the movie is nearly 3 hours long and therefor the movie also has some more talking-sequences and slower moments in it.<br/><br/>The movie is also big with its musical score by Hans Zimmer and he actually succeeded in composing a new great theme for the movie. In its action moments the movie gets definitely uplifted by its musical score.<br/><br/>The action sequences are definitely well constructed and at times pure eye candy. So are the special effects, although I feel that the second movie was still better on that. It seems like they tried to overdo things this time and I'm mainly talking about the end battle, when it comes down to its special effects, by putting in some complex shots. No matter how good CGI is these days, you still see that it's CGI. <br/><br/>Most roles get extended in this movie. Marty, Tia Dalma and even Jack the monkey and Cotton's parrot. But of course the movie still remains the Jack Sparrow-show. Really one of the best characters in recent years, all thanks to Johnny Depp, who provide the movie with its biggest laughs and most hilarious absurd moments. He still plays the character as good and fresh as he did for the first time 4 years ago. You can't just ever grow tired of Jack Sparrow. I was also very pleased to see Geoffrey Rush back as Barbossa. His role was bigger which allowed Geoffrey Rush to shine even more. Bill Nighy was also as good as always as Davy Jones. Orlando Bloom's and Keira Knightley's acting also has really improved over the years. I was actually surprised to see how much of the movie Keira Knightley carries this time and how well she does this. Even in the sequences with Geoffrey Rush she does. She also gets to do more interesting in the movie when it comes done to action. In a way she has taken over the Will (Orlando Bloom) role in this movie this time and Will himself gets pushed more to the background this time compared to the first two movies, which really shouldn't bother most people, unless you're a teenage-girl of course. She handles both the action- and comical sequences really well. And even Keith Richards shows up in an already classic cameo as Jack's father. But some role also got narrowed down to my regret, such as Jonathan Pryce's and Jack Davenport's and lets not forget the Kraken.<br/><br/>Still, I really wouldn't mind seeing more Pirates of the Caribbean movies in the future, if needed with new actors and characters, as long as Johnny Depp stays as Jack Sparrow. The serials still have more than enough potential and haven't dried up yet.<br/><br/>8/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
"ozq","9","268","445","24 May 2007"," Nobody move! I've dropped me brain!
","I adored POTC 1, was a bit disappointed in POTC 2 (mainly the ending) and found POTC 3 to be a mix of the previous two. The awesome music is still in place, it's a bit faster paced than 2 (even with sections of dialogue in place), and the majority of characters get their come-uppance. There's heaps of sword fights and more cannons than I've seen in my life. The special effects are seamless and mix with great cinematography and top notch costumes & makeup. Many characters are more fully fleshed out, which was nice to see.<br/><br/>However the ending is NOT pure Disney, which surprised me somewhat. Major characters die, and all is not rosy sunsets and fluffy kittens. That was a bit of a surprise, a couple of characters seemed to just disappear and there's an obvious link left open for another movie. Whether it's made or not is another thing entirely (and unlikely from what I hear).<br/><br/>One more point... stay until the end of the credits for an interesting extra scene."
"dol_fan_in_tampa","10","49","74","30 May 2007"," Great film lives up to expectations.
","This movie is truly spectacular!!! Non stop action, with a surprising ending. If it weren't for the silliness of the Jack Sparrow clones, I would give it a 9 and 1/2. It takes a little away from the film's momentum. As far as the final battle rivaling that of the LOTR trilogy, I would say no. This trilogy will go down as one of the great trilogies. Breathtaking special effects, and fabulous scenery. All in all, a great film. It must be viewed in the theater. It is better than Dead Man's Chest, but I still like the overall story line of Curse of the Blach Pearl better. As always, be sure to stick around after the credits for an extra scene. This one adds to the plot of the film and gives viewers some closure after a heart wrenching finale. Make sure you check this film out."

","I have to admit that I was just along for the ride when accompanying my husband and daughter to the movie. I'd seen the other two, and, while I thought they were entertaining but wasn't a huge fan.<br/><br/>I'd planned to be entertained by this one, but wasn't expecting to be overly fond of it. I was VERY wrong.<br/><br/>I absolutely loved it, in fact, I convinced my family to join me again in seeing it again two days later. I will admit that you have to follow carefully to make sure that you understand who is making a deal with who to double cross someone else (yep, that's a bit confusing, but it is a bit of the part of the fun of the movie).<br/><br/>I won't say that it is the easiest movie to follow that I've ever seen, but it was a great deal of fun overall. In my son's words, the sword fight scenes were incredible.<br/><br/>**Major Spoiler** I've read some comments saying that they didn't like the Will/Elizabeth scene in the midst of the battle. However, I have to say that their unusual wedding was my favorite part."

","I haven't hated a film in a long time. Usually, I can sit through bad or boring films with a shrug and find its hidden merits. During Pirates 3 however, I was beset with ill-feeling. I hated this movie.<br/><br/>Perhaps it was due to the fact that I haven't seen Pirates 2 since last year, or maybe it's just me, but this film was making no sense! Characters would change sides without any apparent reason or consequence. Chow Yun-Fat was around for about ten minutes of screen time, and did nothing. And the love angle between Keira and Orlando was nonsense. The final beach scene anyone? And Johnny doesn't even show up for at least 20 minutes! (His first scene was the best one in the film in my opinion.) And the thing is, I really enjoyed 1 and 2. Pirates 1 was great and 2 was tolerable. But for some reason, this installment triggered something in my mind that I could not let go.<br/><br/>And SPOILER OK they have a god. What do they come up with?

"aniterz","Null","38","58","29 May 2007"," Give this movie a chance!
","I liked POTC: At World's End very much. Let me explain to you why:<br/><br/>I liked the scenario. The first time I saw the movie it didn't seem right, and I felt that it was made up to cover plot holes. I though that Will taking Davy Jones's place on the ship was just a petty excuse for a plot twist, and most of the stuff that happened seemed pointless. But I went to see it again, just to give it a second chance. In the end it seemed to me that the scenario was logical. You can finally understand why Tia Dalma brought Barbossa back to life and helped him find Jack. It was all because of the fact that she wanted to come out of her human bonds. Also, Davy Jones's death can be explained. First of all, if he hadn't died, Will would have died instead. Secondly, if he hadn't died, Tia Dalma would have probably killed him, since she was so angry with him for imprisoning her to her human body. After dying and falling in the whirlpool, it was like he was falling in the arms of Calypso, since she was what made the whirlpool. But it is a tragic irony that Davy Jones did not know that Tia Dalma was mad at him. So, after Jack gave his sword to Will to stub the heart, Will should take his place on the ship. So Elizabeth stayed with Will, or at least with nobody other in her heart but Will. <br/><br/>I believe all the above was a smart way to end every love story. Everyone was finally where he or she would be happier, sort of. <br/><br/>But the true ending of the story was really the last scene. The scene where Jack is on the port of Tortuga, once again marooned by his crew and Barbossa. Gibbs is not among those that betrayed him, just like it happened in the first movie. Also, Barbossa is after some treasure that gives eternal life, but Jack knows the only way to help him find it, since he stole the map. Just like it happened in the first movie, when only Jack knew that it was William's blood they needed, not Elizabeth's. Jack and Gibbs repeated that line they said at the first movie (""Take what you can Give nothing back""). Also, I think that the way the movie ended (with Jack humming the song he was humming at the end of the first movie) was a great way the writers came up with to tell you ""Know what? This is not the end. It is the end of the on-screen trilogy, but not the end of the lives of the characters. It's just another beginning"". <br/><br/>And, one last element that made this movie the best way to end the trilogy is the filling that it gives you. It's the feeling that Captain Jack is always going to run after his precious Pearl, never quite being the captain for a long time. <br/><br/>But, come on! You can't expect this movie to be like the first POTC movie, especially since Pirates 2 seemed to be selling more Hollywood than pirates. If you don't want to like it, it's your right to do so. I am just suggesting that you give the movie a chance to impress you. I did give it a chance and you know what? I loved it. Sorry if I made you have a headache with all that I said about Pirates. I just think that it is a misunderstood movie."

","Do not listen to the stingy critics!! This movie is AMAZING! Everything you hoped for and more. I can't wait to see it again. The fact that it is a long movie makes it all the better for the viewer because you get more of all the adventure, romance and breathtaking scenes. The writing is incredible, the acting is the best it has been since the beginning, and the artistry is second-to-none. There is no fluff, every scene means something. It's funny, intriguing and keeps you on the edge of your seat. My heart didn't stop pounding until long after the credits ended. It's the kind of movie that stays with you. It's satisfying IF this is the last Pirates, and it leaves you wanting more IF we are to be blessed with a fourth. Bottom line is: go see this movie, and have a great time doing it!"

","The third movie in this series is truly a lazy effort from all involved. The story is mundane, unimaginative and basically a rehash of what we have already learned from 'Dead Man's Chest'. For a family adventure movie it is unforgivably boring, with long sections of humming & hawing punctuated only by brief action sequences that look like they've been shot by the 2nd Unit director in a couple of hours.<br/><br/>The humor has been reduced to catchphrases, the script forcing Johnny Depp grind a likable character into the dust until it's nothing more than tiresome. The special effects while still excellent (notably Davy Jones' tentacles) offer nothing more than what we have already seen in the first two movies, and certainly nothing with even half the imagination of the original's moonlight skeletons. In a 3 hour 'event' movie it's shocking that not a single set-piece was in anyway noteworthy, from stunted opener to fizzling finale.<br/><br/>Geoffrey Rush deserves an honorable mention for keeping me in my seat during what has to be one of the most contrived love scenes I've ever witnessed. His performance as Barbossa, the quintessential pirate is deserving of a far better movie. This alone will earn 'At World's End' its one star, but yet I still can't help feeling like I'm being ripped off."

If that wasn't enough then the screenplay is ""complicated"" for a reason, you can watch it over and over and it does not get old because you gain something else from it every time you re watch it.<br/><br/>The writers, director, and score all hit their mark in this one.

"michboudreau","2","13","18","19 June 2007"," Terrible. They forgot the story!!!
","I've been reading the reviews and seeing rows upon rows of 10 star out of 10 ratings and I just don't understand. Haven't all these people watched the same movie as me? Then, every 15 reviews, there's one review giving the movie 1 or 2 stars which I completely agree with.<br/><br/>This movie was absolutely terrible! It started out somewhat promising with some really cool scenes and an actual story where Barbosa and friends are sailing off the ""end of the world"" to go rescue Jack Sparrow. Then the story shifted gears and went all psychedelic-like with Jack hallucinating and talking to himself and 15 other himselves and crabs made from rocks which transport boats across the sand into the ocean and the shipwreck of 3 crews worth of people on the exact spot at the exact time on the exact beach where Jack Sparrow's boat is dropped in the water by the horde of crabs. And that was the good part of the movie.<br/><br/>The rest of the movie basically is a conglomeration of a dozen mini-stories, none of which seem to really go anywhere. There's some surprise sea-goddess Calypso who's released by the counsel of Pirates, and then who grows really big and transforms into crabs, which fall in the water and disappear. I thought that when they finally released her, she would unleash all hell on the Armada and the Pirates would end up victorious that way. Instead, she becomes a bunch of crabs and jumps into the water, never to be seen again. Then two pirate ships attack one enemy boat (out of hundreds), on which the captain somehow cannot find the will to shout ""Attack"" and therefor his boat is destroyed. That boat had double the canons of the two pirate ships combined. It should have pulverized them. Instead, the ship explodes! (Must have been the gasoline??????) Wow! What a Hollywood crap-fest!! After this the 199 other ships get scared of the two pirate ships and run away. How fitting! Genius! I'd have been scared too.<br/><br/>Oh yeah, I forgot the marriage scene. The marriage scene was an absolute abomination! I was embarrassed for the filmmakers through the whole thing.<br/><br/>This movies was so bad it hurt. The worst movie of the year so far."

","The third installment of Pirates of the Caribbean is not, as popularly believed, disastrous or incredibly confusing. At the very start of the movie I was hooked again.<br/><br/>The movie contains a lot of information to process, but if you actually sit down and follow it you'll find it is not confusing at all. As the third and hopefully not last Pirates of the Caribbean movie, I believe they did an excellent job. Although the movies have become more serious they are still funny and a lot of fun to watch.<br/><br/>Not only did this movie create another cliffhanger ending that leaves us wondering if there will be more but it also immortalized characters such as the famous Jack Sparrow.<br/><br/>I personally think that the second movie was not as bad as people said it was, it was also quite good. The third was definitely better, and allowed you to see the characters in a much different way.<br/><br/>So stop believing people when they say this movie wasn't good at all, it was excellent!"
"Harbinger70","1","123","223","26 May 2007"," Quite Possibly The Worst Action Movie Ever Made
","I love action adventure movies. Indiana Jones, Jurassic Park, and yes, Pirates of the Caribbean. But not this movie. Not by a long shot. Whereas the first movie was fun and original, and the second one a little more cartoony but just as entertaining, this third Pirates film just nose dives, completely missing that mark each and every time.<br/><br/>Jack Sparrow was such a cool character in the first two pirates films. He seems so uncomfortable here. Depp almost appears bored with the part. Orlando Bloom is not a good actor. He's annoying, and I have no idea why. Furthermore, his character is a pain to watch. Whose side is he on? What is he fighting for? Why should I care? He is, at this point, the only thing making it possible for there to be an overblown cliché love triangle between Jack, Elizabeth, and Will. And folks, men and women, you're not watching Keira for her acting. She's not good at that. But looking hot in just about anything (less is more, in this case) is something she does exceedingly well. I'll watch her for that. Other performances - dull. Drawn-out. Uninteresting. But I will say this: the best overall performance in this film comes from Jack Davenport, as Norrington. He plays it with such conviction, such sincerity, than even the dumbest of lines sound decent coming from him. The storyline sounded as though it could open a unique chapter in the story when he reappeared in Pirates 2, but I believe audiences will be very disappointed in how he's handled in this film.<br/><br/>The plus side - good special effects. Negative side - everything else. Boring and dull performances all around (except by Davenport), a very slow and often confusing storyline that went no where without explosions or action sequences (the movie could lose forty-five minutes), and the broad sense that this film was both too rushed and too poorly conceived. Had the writers been given a couple years to really pound out a good script, the movie would have been as good as the other two. Instead, it truly stands out as being one of the worst movies I've ever seen."

"rparham","7","119","216","29 May 2007"," A reasonably fitting ""end""
","Once you start downhill, it's difficult to halt the momentum. So to apply this metaphor to the world of cinema, once a film franchise delivers a poor entry, it's almost impossible to not deliver poor ones from then on out. So, imagine the surprise when, after the lackluster Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest, that screenwriters Ted Elliot and Terry Rossio and director Gore Verbinski are able to deliver a superior third entry in the Pirates series with Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End. It is hardly perfect, still far too long and lacking in emotional depth, but for a summer spectacle, it still manages to deliver the goods to a degree.<br/><br/>At World's End opens not long after Dead Man's Chest, with Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightly) joining forces with recently resurrected Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) to rescue Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) from Davy Jones' locker, where he was dragged to by the Kraken at the conclusion of the last film. While they are on their way to the afterlife, Lord Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander), has exerted his influence over Davy Jones (Bill Nighy) and is using him to bring the pirates of the world to their knees. With their very existence on the line, the pirate lords meet to discuss the possibility of joining forces to combat Beckett, but since these are pirates, there is a wide variety of skullduggery and backstabbing to be had.<br/><br/>Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End is rife with dazzling visuals. As with both previous films, At World's End has spent it's almost-certainly astronomical budget on what actually goes on the screen. The sets, costumes, and stunning visual effects are impressive, to say the least. You might be excused for actually believing that what you are seeing is real at times, not just movie trickery. The make-up artists have also once again proved that they can be the go to guys for the creation of unappealing looking characters, as almost no one in Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End looks like they have taken a bath or brushed their teeth, well, ever, which, in this case, seems to work for the film. If you want to see a visually spectacular motion picture, especially on the big screen, you need look no further than At World's End.<br/><br/>On the other hand, if you are interested in depth to go along with the glittery outside, then At World's End will prove to be somewhat lacking, although not nearly as much as Dead Man's Chest. The key problem to this film is that the characters are underdeveloped. Most of what makes them up is played out again without much added to the proceedings from the previous entries: Jack wants everything for himself, Barbossa wants what Jacks wants also, Will wants Elizabeth and Elizabeth wants, seemingly, to be a pirate. Frankly, it's a bit sad that the character with one of the best emotional arcs in the film is one of its villains, Davy Jones, who has an almost touching degree of pathos added to him thanks to a scene about halfway through the film. Perhaps it is the film's never ending attempt to keep the audience uncertain where the various characters loyalties lie that also works against the audiences' identification with almost anyone. When it seems that everyone is out only for themselves, it's hard to work up much enthusiasm for them.<br/><br/>The film's cardinal sin, as has been the case with every Pirates entry thus far, is its bloated length. At World's End does not have nearly the lopsided running time to substance ratio that Dead Man's Chest did, but it still overstays it's welcome. Much like fellow summer blockbuster Spider-Man 3, the filmmakers seem to believe that bigger is better, and that is sometimes just not the case. In the film's defense, there is quite of bit of plot to fill the minutes, but it could have still been trimmed back to some degree while maintaining, and perhaps even increasing, the entertainment value.<br/><br/>That being said, At World's End still manages a few surprises, and the ending does pay off much of what has gone before, and even though the ""love"" between Elizabeth and Will seems almost non-existent, a key scene at the end on a beach does manage to be effective. The actors also generally deliver once again. Johnny Depp is entertaining as ever as Jack Sparrow, although he finds the screen time a bit split amongst the various other characters this outing. Depp seems to be having a good time in the role, and it's hard to not understand his public statements that he would be willing to go more rounds as the character. Rush is also effective as Barbossa and Keira Knightley shows a bit more energy than in the last entry, as does Orlando Bloom in the part of Will.<br/><br/>So, what began as a seemingly bad idea (a Disney theme park ride turned into a summer film) has concluded three films later with one of biggest displays of blockbuster film-making, in terms of scope, as has been seen in recent years. That the spectacle isn't quite in service of an appropriate amount of core material is disappointing, but Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End is hardly a loss. It provides a decent amount of entertainment, buckets of eye candy and a good laugh here and there. While filmmakers should perhaps aspire to more, what they manage deliver isn't half bad. I suppose that might sound like damning with faint praise, but you just have to call them as you see them."
"andydreamseeker","7","174","323","28 May 2007"," Movie Review: Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End
","Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End is the third and last of the money spinning trilogy, or so they say. Everything has led to this, or so they say again and I kept my mind opened. The first of the Pirates series, The Curse of the Black Pearl was good. It was a movie out of nothing or more correctly a movie inspired by nothing more than a Disney theme park ride. Having said that however the creation of Captain Jack Sparrow was nothing short of inspirational. Captain Jack played by the charismatic Johnny Depp became the talisman of Pirates of the Caribbean. Thought to be dead when we saw him charging into the jaws of monster octopus Kraken toward the end of Dead Man's Chest (the sequel), he is to be brought back from the dead in this latest film.<br/><br/>I have to be honest; I hated Dead Man's Chest. Its various plots and subplots were terribly tangled and confusing. It was hard to follow what sort of story or motives the movie wants to say. I blamed my lack of understanding for not comprehending Dead Man's Chest. That was summer of last year but since then I have done my research, for the billion dollars making movie was to have a third installment. Having seen one and two, I have to see three. But if I do not understand two then how can I go ahead with three. And so after a better understanding of two I saw three. You should know this. For all my efforts I was still robbed by the pirates.<br/><br/>I was led happily out into the open sea before being robbed. I was enjoying the first third of the 168 minutes film. Captain Jack's crew arrived in Singapore to look for Captain Sao Feng (Chow Yun-Fatt), pirate lord of the South China Sea for a ship and a map, so they could sail to world's end and rescue our favourite captain from Davy Jones's Locker. Davy Jones's Locker is a ghost realm of the netherworld where the dead Captain Jack Sparrow is being kept for eternity.<br/><br/>There appears to be some oriental influence in At World's End. Firstly of course we are introduced to a Chinese pirate, Captain Sao Feng. Secondly, the costumes and all were very well designed in an exquisite oriental fashion. And there was Singapore, a South East Asian country where Captain Sao Feng can be found.<br/><br/>The Singapore set features a bathhouse and I couldn't help relating it to Japanese animation master Hayao Miyazaki's Spirited Away. The popular animated film, released by Disney in the west has a bathhouse theme. The relation did not stop there, and I wondered if the scene where Captain Jack Sparrow is isolated in Davy Jones's Locker was inspired too by Hayao Miyazaki's work. The part where thousands of strange and curious yet harmless rounded stone-like crab helping Jack move his ship, The Black Pearl across a desert aroused my attention to this perspective. It was through the hands, eyes and imagination of the acclaimed animation master, Hayao Miyazaki that made famous the approach of detailing stories with thousands of mini little intriguing creatures. And it was fun to watch.<br/><br/>I was enjoying At World's End, laughing merrily at all the pirate jokes that the characters are lashing out at one another, feeling the thrill of the sword-fights and of course attracted to the sometimes witty, looney and mad character of Captain Jack Sparrow. That scene of him engaging himself to his many different personalities while alone in the deserted Davy Jones's Locker is a real gem.<br/><br/>But with all the oriental influences, the filmmakers probably did not take note of the teachings of Zen, where less is truly more. For when after the crew rescued Captain Jack Sparrow and brought him back to the mortal world, it all happened again. The tangling and confusing plots and subplots manifested once more and killed whatever is good about the film. In my opinion, if At World's End had ended after rescuing Captain Jack and had a straight approach in the gathering of forces to deal with Lord Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander) and Davy Jones (Bill Nighy) with a fitting spectacle of a finale fight, the film would have been great.<br/><br/>I was trying to understand the story. In reflection I probably should not for it amounted to nothing. It just isn't worth it. It would be tiring for me just to list them all out. So just be warned that in the film, every character have their own personal agenda. It is ""me"" first and ""you"" later if ""you"" are still there. If that is the purpose of the story-writers to represent the meaning of how pirates are, then they have succeeded. In fact it was so successful that they lost me.<br/><br/>It bored me so much I no longer laughed at the jokes. It dragged on so long I no longer felt compelled to see the ending. I just want the film to end there and then. Enough was enough.<br/><br/>""Take whatever you can and give nothing back."" Thanks a billion, filmmakers, or is it thanks me instead?<br/><br/>This entire Pirate series is like a ride on a pirate ship in a theme park, it was thrilling for a start but as it swing back and forth too many times the nauseas will come and when it stops you find yourself displaced nowhere.<br/><br/>Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End is a fine example of a good film gone bad because it had too many tangling tales to tell. I maintain that it is worth watching for the first third of the film but save yourself from seasickness in the middle just so you can enjoy the spectacular fight sequence toward the end."
"eched","1","21","32","5 September 2007"," Confused?
","In order to try and turn Pirates into the greatest/biggest epic of all time the makers of this film have all decided to give it the most epic plot of all time. To bad the plot is to massive for its own good.<br/><br/>Believe it or not, but it would take me at least twenty pages to summarize the plot. Yes, it has that much to it. I'm not even going to bother to try and explain it. Short to say, there is a new plot point about once every ten minutes, and sometimes three or four all at the same time. This makes the film next to impossible to fallow. By the end I was so lost I just didn't care anymore.<br/><br/>Also, many plot points were simply added to add spice and were not thought threw. There is a massive goddess subplot that ends up going no where and when they at last bring forth the goddess she does nothing more then explode into crabs and doesn't really help anyone out at all, making the whole plot line unneeded. It simply had no pay off.<br/><br/>Also, since a lot of the story lines weren't thought threw they come to moronic conclusions. The ending with Will is so dumb I don't even know where to start. Plus, there's the ending to the love story which has Will and Elizabeth getting married in mid battle. The scene is so corny I can't even put it into words. It felt like a school play with a big budget at that point.<br/><br/>Lastly, there are no more heroes in the series. Everyone is now stabbing each other in the backs to get what they want and they all secretly want to kill each other. Will, who in the first film was a noble man trying to save the love of his life, has now become a heartless backstabber who only wishes to save Jack just so he can kill him and get his ship. Elizabeth is also heartless and betrays all she meets. These are not the heroes you came to care for at the start of the series. They're all just greedy brats in things for their own gain. Will use to be a likable guy. Now he just comes off as, well, mean.<br/><br/>Other then that there is not much to say. The film simply is a confusing end to what could have been a great series. Sad really."

"allenblake21","9","32","52","30 May 2007"," It's Almost Sunset....
","There has been a lot of ""talk"" about Pirate's of the Caribbean: At World's End that I do not quite understand. If you know me, you know that I am one for opinions and everyone is allowed to allocate and share it, but I have begun to realize that people are not appreciating art. I mean, I am obsessed with movies and soundtracks to the point where that is what I want to do professionally (record), and so I have seen and own my fair share of classics, new and art form movies. To define art form, let me give you some examples: Gone With the Wind, Vertigo, Amelie, The Hours, Somewhere in Time and Lord of the Rings. These movies are in themselves amazing feats, but they are ART. What I mean is that the shots are so beautiful and every single camera angle is a masterpiece. This is what I feel like the Pirate's of the Caribbean films are. They are art forms. Yes, movies are there to entertain, but they are also the Nouvelle forms of expression. At World's End is in every sense of the word Glorious. There has been discussion that the plot is too heavy or dense (which I guess compromises for the (not my opinion mind you) lack of one in Dead Man's Chest (as I roll my eyes)). Well, if people begin to realize that these movies are based on famous folklore, they will notice that they are not superfluous pits of script vicariously strewn together to create action. They are in themselves deep, thought out archetypal patterns portraying the imagination of the 18th Century seas. As I have stated several times as well, one cannot judge a movie by one thing. Therefore, I am going to give a list of reasons why this movie is utterly outstanding and amazing. The plot, as I have discussed, is intertwining, complex and extremely amazing, and in reality, one of the best I have seen (out of the hundreds I own and have previewed). The script is not to serious and not to funny. It is the exact amount of intensity and humor needed. The cinematography is jaw dropping. The art design is sensational and well thought out. The costume design is even more awefying than previous pirates (which is really hard to come by). The casting for each roll is perfect. The musical score is daunting. It really brings out emotions and portrays exactly what is happening on screen. An interesting thing about the score is that it evolves along with the plot. This is made evident by the theme portrayed during the ""Antarctica"" scene (or track 3) in comparison to the ""One Day"" scene (or track 12). The make up is once again sensational. The special effects are so realistic (another reason why they won for Dead Man's Chest). The acting is outstanding. I could keep on going on forever discussing the amazing qualities that this movie has. I don't mean to bash anyone who has these opinions of disgust towards this movie, but I really do not see where these narrow minded ""self called"" critics get their outrageous and egregious ideas and perceptions about such an amazing movie. I honestly do not understand. Yes the ending is tragically depressing, and yes I have cried all the times I have seen it, but that does not denote a movie to doom-dom, and there was one uproar that I would like to solve: ""What are they fighting for in the way too long fight scene at the end?"" Well, what I have to say about this is, if the fight scenes were any shorter, people would have complained as they did in Spiderman 3. Therefore, people cannot and will not be satisfied because they are looking for the perfect amount of fighting, which can never be found  therefore don't criticize. In regards to the moral base of the fights, here is where the folk lore falls into place: Lord Beckett is fighting for all of humanity with his greedy soul to destroy the wicked pirates of the world and gain control over the sea, hence the capture of Davy Joneses heart in Dead Man's Chest. Then Davy Jones is out to save his hide and control the seas once again, since he has lost that power (which is made evident when he kills all those in control over him). The Pirate Lord's and all the characters are protecting themselves and trying to destroy Lord Beckett and Davy Jones, otherwise they will be killed and trapped in the locker forever. I do not understand why people try so hard to punish decent material because it does not apply to their specific wants and needs. This is all I have to say - ""You go try and make a better movie than they did and see if you become more successful...what? No volunteers? EXACTLY!!!"""
"CaptSC","1","22","34","25 May 2007"," Bloated and overrated,
","I went to see the 9:30 show yesterday with five friends, and we were pumped. Actually, they were, since I had the feeling that Pirates 3 would end up as another Pirates 2: too long, special-effect heavy, and a nonsensical plot that passed itself as being ""heavy"" but making no sense.<br/><br/>Yes, the movie opens up perfectly, and offers hope. But after that, the movie goes down. Way down. There's all these little things flying around that try to come together, but most of the time I was scratching my head, despite having seen the previous two movies.<br/><br/>There is, of course, bright spots. When Johnny Depp FINALLY comes back, the movie becomes more interesting. The English antagonist is decidedly evil and plotting, and there are back stabs throughout the movie.<br/><br/>Really, it aspires to be an epic pirate movie, but there's too much wind for its sails.<br/><br/>There are some awe-inspiring and epic scenes, no doubt, but the movie as a whole will leave anyone but the most die-hard fans (which by from the ratings are many) wanting to walk this Pirate's plank."

","To go and see this film would be a mistake. To see it twice would be an insult to any great film ever made. To see it a third time would most likely induce an uncontrollable fit of vomiting. This film is disgustingly, uproariously bad.<br/><br/>Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End stands as a stoic testament to the fact the millions of dollars worth of CGI B.S. doesn't equate to a worthwhile film. The plot of this film becomes so uselessly and uninterestingly convoluted that I wished my seat at the cinema had an ejector button. It isn't wonderfully convoluted like ""The Big Sleep"" or any other noted Film Noir, but rather the twisted, intangible web of double crosses and love dodecagons drags the film along tediously until its undeniably bathetic ending.<br/><br/>The acting in this film is, at times, laughably terrible. Depp, as usual, is able to carry the weight of his role as is a competent Rush. Keira Knightly's acting is painfully bad. This is as simply as I can put it. Orlando Bloom does his darnedest to make everything sound dramatic and manages to maintain a squint for approximately 80% of the film's arduous duration so I have to give him an E for effort. It's a sad day in film-land when two day-players acting as 'wenches' give a more memorable performance than two of the main characters.<br/><br/>If one were to make a documentary that drew attention to this film's every flat joke, empty promise and dismal piece of acting, it would be longer than the film itself, impossible as this may sound."

"Aralith","1","48","82","27 May 2007"," Verbinski, why hast thou forsaken me?
","Well, after seeing Pirates II, I didn't think it was possible for III to be any worse.... I was wrong. This is quite possibly the worst film I have ever seen. I understand that some movies are made just for ridiculous, but fun, action sequences and little or no plot line, and you can definitely tell which movies those are, but this one tried to have a decent plot, and failed miserably. Yes, the action sequences were fantastic and full of some of the most ridiculous stunts imaginable, but they in no way saved the horrible attempt at a plot line. With hardly any character development, far less Jack Sparrow than there should have been, the abandonment of the love triangle, the overly-dramatic attempt for an epic, and the complete lack of trying to be at least somewhat historically correct, the writers have caused cinema to reach a new low.<br/><br/>The first problem with the movie is that Jack Sparrow isn't seen for half an hour. Johnny Depp is pretty much what has made the Pirates films. And when you do finally get to see him, he has been downgraded to the status of comic relief, rather than the humorous hero he has played in the past. It is because of this that you actually start to wish that you see less of him. The corny, one-line jokes that just seem to perpetually flow forth from his mouth get old very, very quickly.<br/><br/>The second problem is, of course, the total lack of true interaction between the characters. Most of their speech is devoted to furthering the already failing plot, and the little that is actual development of their relationships is poorly written. Though I hated the idea of the love triangle between Will, Elizabeth, and Jack introduced in Pirates II, I was sad to see them completely abandon that idea, acting almost as though it had never happened.<br/><br/>The main problem that I had with the plot for this film is that it never really settled down. It was either moving forward far too fast for most of the audience to keep up with, or so dead still that half the audience was falling asleep (though the latter was far rarer). Plus the introduction of so many different plot devices and magic just made the story seem so implausible. I mean, I am a firm believer in the willing suspension of disbelief in small doses (such as the amount of disbelief I had to suspend in the first film), but if I was going to actually enjoy this movie, I would have had to have suspended it for almost the entire length of the film, and that's hard to do for near three hours.<br/><br/>And finally, the first film, as far as I know, was pretty much on par in terms of historical accuracy and pirate mythology. That is, it was very true to the era it was based in, and didn't have to add in all sorts of fantastical, magical things to give the film a sense of adventure. The only magic involved was the curse of the medallions. Which, while it may have dominated most of the plot, was rooted in some history and was presented in a plausible way. For that, I can suspend my disbelief. But when they start giving physical manifestations to Davy Jones (granted that was introduced in the second film, but still) and start calling Greek sea-nymphs (Calypso) Pirate goddesses; I'm sorry but I just can't do that. Not to mention them trying to claim that the pirates, as treacherous and murderous as they were, were actually all united under one flag is just ridiculous. No historical value (and very weak story value) whatsoever.<br/><br/>All in all, this film surpassed how terrible I expected it to be so horribly that I am honestly considering walking back to the theater and asking for compensation for the three wasted hours of my life."

","When I first saw the film, I was confused by all the constant betrayals amongst the pirates, but then I remembered what Chow-Yun Fat's character said: The only way for a pirate to survive today is to betray other pirates. Everyone has their own agenda, yet they fight for a common purpose: To defeat Beckett and Davy Jones.<br/><br/>Make no mistake, they do so in a thrilling final battle that puts war movies to shame. Those who complain of the lack of Jack in the 2nd one will not be disappointed. In fact, they might find there's a little too much of him! Keira Knightley has brilliant moments, and looks even more beautiful than before. And as always, Barbosa and Jack make the perfect duo. The ending has great twists and are unlike a Disney film. They really do an excellent job of avoiding any clichés. <br/><br/>The visual effects are stunning, the acting is superb, and once more the final battle, as well as the score, is godly. Fans of the first two will not be disappointed for this truly is the finest of the trilogy. It is by far the fastest 3 hours you'll ever watch and at the end you'll only be wanting more!"

Sure, there were a few laughs, but to me it seemed like this movie was more serious than the other two. It may have been a little fast-paced, but they had a lot to wrap up. I loved the bittersweet ending. Remember to stay after the credits for an extra scene. All in all, I thought it was a great film and one with great replay value.

","I don't know how anyone, cast and crew included, could think that 3 hours is a good length for this film. The film could be drastically improved--but not saved--by cutting out an hour. Or maybe even an hour and a half. And that is not a complaint that I have too often. I don't mind long movies. But this one just drags and drags and drags. And I don't mind slow movies either. But the ""plot""--if you can even call it that--is much too convoluted. There are too many things going on at any given time for you too actually care what happens to any of the characters.<br/><br/>And if you haven't seen the first two films, do not see this one. You will have no idea what is going on. You would think that with 3 hours the writers could properly introduce you to all of the characters. But you would be wrong.<br/><br/>Obviously, this movie will have a huge opening weekend. But look for it to drastically drop off on its second weekend as word of mouth spreads. Just like Spider-Man 3.<br/><br/>This movie epitomizes everything wrong with Hollywood today. There is way too much time spent on over-the-top action. And almost no time spent on characterization. Every year movie theater attendance goes down, and every year ticket prices go up. And this film will only worsen that problem. There will be tons of people who walk out of the theater and say ""That definitely wasn't worth my time or money."" And it will probably be a while before they make a trip to the theater again.<br/><br/>If the major studios would concentrate on making quality films, every thing else would take care of itself."

What a crappy, noisy, confusing bunch of overdone special effects. I only went to see it because my husband wanted to. And for the record, I LOVED the first movie! Why do they always have to make sequels? Hmmm...oh I forgot, to make more MONEY!!! Not only is the plot confusing, but the whole movie is visually repulsive. Everything and everyone is slimy, sweaty, dirty, and have rotten teeth (except of course for the lovely two leads, who have to be pretty and dirty at the same time.)

","I came. I slept. I left. I wasted my time what a piece of garbage. The thing doesn't move at all, it lasts forever, scenes are overly drawn out and several of them are redundant. It took the film about an hour to establish some sort of premise otherwise it was just wasting its time with eye candy and gimmicks. The acting, including Johnny Depp who was great in the first film, was all flat and boring. The grotesque sea creates Davey Jones and his minions lost whatever appeal they had the feeling of repulsion separated from all other emotion isn't effective. The Black Pearl had at least some legs to stand on, however, wobbly. This series followed (or follows I shudder at the thought) a progression of getting progressively worse and longer. The first was good but too long by a half an hour, the second bad and too long by 45 minutes this one was god awful and shouldn't have started in the first place. Orlando Bloom's character doesn't really die which is a joke and I didn't care about anything that happened in it for a second. And the ending, or should I say endings, may be in fact worse than The Return of the King because at least those multiple endings were preceded by a great film. This one was barely watchable. I liked the first Pirates of the Caribbean a lot and felt, due in part by running time, that I wanted to see the story resolve itself though I really could care less. Now I wish I hadn't."
"AJ_is_Awesomness","10","149","280","21 May 2007"," Hard-hitting, Spectacular, Fantastic- Ends the franchise in style!
","I have been waiting a long time to see this movie, and thus I was happy to buy tickets for a special screening in the US whilst on my travels. Now, as it is, most threequels (or the last in a series of films) are hugely disappointing (look at Jaws 3, Scream 3 etc etc) so I was expecting to be slightly displeased, especially being a life long Pirates fan, so I was hoping and praying that the makers would get it just right, and thankfully-very thankfully they did. In fact, I would argue that Pirates 3 or 'At World's End' is up to the standards (if not better!) than the original- a question I will leave open to other viewers. The story is fairly new- Barboassa, Elizabeth and Will must sail to past the end of the earth to set free the disfuctioning spirit of Captain Jack Sparrows who as we know has been devoured by the hungry and monstrous Kraken (which makes yet another appearance along with other fantastic creatures) and once Jack is back, he has to confront the evil Davy Jones for one final battle which will determine weather our witty, joke-cracking, swash-sing buckling' hero can sail away on the high seas or become a life-long slave on the Flying Dutchman.<br/><br/>And it really is one hell of a battle. This battle makes the one's in Star Wars and Harry Potter look like a sing-song with Alvin and the Chipmunks-really. Its swords at the ready as the ending unfolds into a huge eye-opening thriller. You'll be asking yourself- 'is he really going to do that?' before screaming in delight 'oh my god-he is!!' and when he does you can bet you wont be disappointed! But its not just the amazing ending that makes Pirates 3 a masterpiece of cinematic history- the rest of the film is perfect too, from Captain Jack's one-liners 'Aye men, we must fight...to run away!' to the swash-buckling baddie-turned goodie Barboassa, to the sweet performances given off our young hero's Keira Knightly and Orlando Bloom, who do equally as well in carrying the film along. Another cool aspect of this film is that unlike the second film the pace is kept running with scenes tending not to drag on, plus we see a lot more of Jack than in the first 2, so we have more time to like him and understand him, something the fantastic Johnny Depp can do with charm. The characters are all there and superb. The settings are stunning and beautiful, the music is thrilling and there is something for everyone without getting tiresome or boring beforehand. Pirates 3 completes the series, not just with a bang, but with a Yo-Ho and a bottle of rum!"

"Aaron1375","8","24","38","29 May 2007"," Jack Sparrow returns, though not nearly enough for my tastes.
","On par with Dead Man's Chest, not as good as the first part three still offers a very wild ride. The main problem, I have never had a harder time trying to keep up with so many double crosses and under the table deals as I did in this movie. Everyone had a hidden motive it seemed even Will Turner who in the last movie was just a trusting dupe. I can not believe no one seems to have the problems with this story as they did with Spidey 3 which I found very easy to follow. Add to that the fact that Captain Jack Sparrow, the sole character who made this series is not in it much and you have the disappointment of part two all over again. Granted it was not a huge disappointment, it was a good movie and it was great seeing Geoffrey Rusch back as Barbossa so it did get points for that. The story, this is going to be the hard part, however, I am keeping it as simple as possible. The gang is going in search for Jack, all with differing reasons. Jack is banished to Davey Jones locker and is going a bit crazy. There is a rescue and now there is a pirate meeting to attend, something about a song, a vengeful sea spirit named Calypso and various other obstacles leading to what I have to say is one heck of an action packed conclusion that is packed with great special effects. So there you have it, sure it could use a trimming of the run time as it goes on a while, but it still manages to entertain. I would have liked to see a simpler story though with a bit more comedy as there are some chuckle scenes, just nothing all that super funny like in the first. It was also surprising to see the villain from the last movie Davey Jones play basically a very small role till the very end during the uber action scene. Characters seemingly not all that important in the last film are now somewhat the focal point and you see Keith Richards in a small role as well. So as you can see there is a bit much going on and if there were a sequel to be made I say no Will or Elizabeth, bring back Barbossa, and have Jack Sparrow in it more and keep the plot more lighthearted and simple."

This is not the case with the new ""Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End."" I was lucky enough to get a pass to an exclusive Pre-Screening here in Jacksonville, Fl. I was planning on staying up to see it Thursday night as soon as the first movie hit the screens and am happy for the chance I received. Upon entering the theatre I was excited, especially after waiting in line for two hours. As soon as the movie started my excitement grew to colossus levels. The movie starts with a good old fashion pirates Yo Ho. It continued to surprise me and enthrall me in its wondrous beauty and imaginative world of pirating and swashbuckling. Pirates 3 evokes many responses from its crowd including excitement, laughter and tears. There are parts that make you sit on the edge of your seat while other times you sit back enthralled in the romance.<br/><br/>This movie brings you in, warms you up, coddles you, and lets you go with the knowledge you have been part of something great."

","If you're like me, you just had to read the ""Hated It!"" reviews here as soon as possible after your viewing, as expiation for the passive sin of watching this thing.<br/><br/>I spent no money to watch this film in a roomful of people who spent the same (a local community college screens films for free, with free popcorn and soda, for students and instructors and alumni and their kids).<br/><br/>Still it was too high a price, for time's arrow only runs one way, and I can't get that time back.<br/><br/>Redemption comes partly from skimming the ""Hated It!"" comments here, for the witty one-liners we lay reviewers invent to compensate for having sat through such dreck.<br/><br/>Now, I'm nearly 50, and hardly have brain-room for pointless stories. My brain has experience though, and though it was hopeful at first that the opening scene portended some subtle indictment of the Bush Presidency in the guise of a Disney movie, it quickly set itself to ""Eyes Wide Shut"" mode.<br/><br/>But, what about my young godson's wasted time? Or the time we'll have to waste together while I try to help him purge this thing from his brain? He's nine, his experience is limited. This thing was shown on the same screen where he's watched real movies for kids, and now I have to figure out how to explain how ""Thing: Three"" was not a movie at all, just noise and sound.<br/><br/>For a filmed effort such as this, it's denigatory to useful words, to critique it using the words ""characters"", ""acting"", or ""plot"". Just to use those words, implies that somewhere in this thing some shred of those concepts had life.<br/><br/>I vaguely recall seeing Mr. Depp on Letterman's show earlier in 2007, to pimp this thing. He mentioned there that he'd recently been able to buy some small (Caribbean?) island with his wealth, for his amusement and family escape from the demands of fame as an actor.<br/><br/>So, he's clipped a fat coupon for appearing in this thing, and bravo! to him. It's one gross green way to redeem that the picture was made at all.<br/><br/>I fear there's a karmic curse, like the one for the Bloom character, on everyone who participated in this thing: every ten years, they'll have one day to genuinely shine and make love to the craft that brought each of them to the making of this thing.<br/><br/>It's useless to review this thing in a conventional sense. It begs for a meta-review, as a bellwether of the culture and community that let it be advertised and edited and screened at all.<br/><br/>As a technical exercise, some serious film student might try for a witty parody, but even that effort would pay it more attention than the thing deserves. It barely merits comparison with the tar in the LaBrea tar pits, let alone the bones of the poor creatures who lost life sinking into that oily morass.<br/><br/>Kudos to the monkey. Kudos to the stunt man who pitched himself out of the rowboat early on: that looked real, and if not CGI was a tricky stunt.<br/><br/>The rest? grey noise, shot in the color of money, signifying nothing, not even popcorn action entertainment."

","The 3rd part of the trilogy that has made swashbuckling pirates big screen box office gold once again after many years adrift in VHS Ocean. All the characters are back for another chance to ""Arghh"" on the high seas in PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: AT WORLD'S END - Elizabeth Swann (Kiera Knightley), Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), Davy Jones (Bill Nighy), 'Bootstrap' Bill Turner (Stellan Skarsgård), and the real standout of all three films, Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp). We are introduced to another unsavory character in Singapore Pirate Captain, Sao Feng (Chow Yun-Fat). Lord Cutler Beckett is hunting down and executing anyone who is or has associated with a convicted pirate. There is a rousing rendition of ""Hoist the Colours"" initiated by a ten year old boy, gathered with his nefarious peers about to be hanged on some brutally effective gallows. This cutthroat war that Beckett and the East India Trading Company is waging on pirates everywhere prompts a call to action and a meeting of the nine Pirate Lords from the four corners of the globe convenes at Shipwreck Cove. Will, Elizabeth, and Captain Barbossa have to rescue Captain Jack Sparrow from the land of the dead, Davy Jones' Locker. He is stranded there in a vast desert with the grounded Black Pearl and plenty of hallucinations to keep him company. Lord Beckett has possession of Davy Jones' heart and unites with squid-like Jones to conquer the seas, and the pirates in them. The Pirate Lords want to release Calypso, goddess of the sea, who is revealed to be among them in human form. They unite bringing the nine pieces necessary to unbind her and set her free, in hopes that she will aid them in their fight. Will and Elizabeth are soon to marry and have to work through relationship issues amidst all the action, such as Will's deception on his quest to free his father from the Flying Dutchman. A lot of watery twists and turns occur, as the film builds towards a tremendous climax between the pirates and the amphibious crew of the Flying Dutchman, teamed with the British Royal Navy's fleet of ships led by Lord Beckett. Beckett's ship, The Endeavour, appears to have cannons protruding from every orifice! There is a lot of plot to sift through leading up to a climax that will take your breath away. The visual effects at the end are magnificent, setting a high precedent as Hollywood films get more and more dazzling. It is no secret that Johnny Depp's offbeat performance as mascara'ed Captain Jack Sparrow was inspired by Rolling Stones guitarist Keith Richards. Richard's cameo as Jack's father Captain Teague is one of the film's great surprises. Depp approached him about the part, and through scheduling it worked out. Depp and Richards have been real life friends for over a decade now. Johnny Depp's acting career has always been fearless and unpredictable. His brilliant, comedic turn as Jack Sparrow will be remembered. As for a fourth Pirates movie, Producer Jerry Bruckheimer said he will wait a bit on that. Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush however are both open to a reprise of their pirate characters. Each film in the 'Pirates of the Caribbean' trilogy has been getting longer and longer, 'At World's End' clocks in at 168 minutes  25 minutes in length over the first 'Pirates' which came out four years ago. It is a very long plank to walk at 168 minutes, but dive in if you have ever taken the Disneyland ride or just want to enjoy a lengthy piece of summer ""escape fare"". I distinctly remember the Pirates of the Caribbean ride at Disneyland I rode in the 80's as a child, and while staying true to the ride's theme set forth long ago, at some points the plot was waterlogged. But if you liked the first two, you will most likely revel in the thrills this film offers. Oh, and be sure to stay through the end credits for the final clip shown. Without giving it away, I will just say it is worth the wait. ""Aye, I'll have some popcorn with lots of butter and sea salt. Thanks matey."""
"Xander77","9","96","178","24 May 2007"," A proper epic  the best part of the trilogy.
","The first two movies were warm-up. Setting up the mythology, background, characters and gags. This is the big payoff. And it works so well.<br/><br/>There are oft repeated complaints about the movie  too much stuff/plot/characters, a lot of talk and repetition of things already done in the previous movies. Actually, these are the movies strengths.<br/><br/>It's a movie by fans, for fans. Well, I'm not sure if these are the proper terms it's a movie by someone who loves the setting and characters, for people who love the setting and characters. It rewards you for paying attention to minute details, including those from the last movies, as well as character motivation and mythology. It does not reward ignoring the ""talky"" parts while waiting for the next action sequence and then getting confused about the ""overtly intricate"" plot.<br/><br/>Yes, nearly every plot hook, character, and plenty of gags from the last movies are brought up again. The plot threads are more or less neatly tied together, each character gets the fate s/he deserves and the gags ah, those, are where the movie really inherits a great boon from the last two films. Each gag is used once or twice, to the fullest potential, and then dismissed before it overstays its welcome, or taken into an entirely new context. Only with that kind of legacy can a movie send an audience into fits of laughter merely by having a character beckon a dog to him and say ""Sea Turtles"".<br/><br/>Every element has been fine tuned to near perfection. There's only one full blown swashbuckling/naval combat scene  at the climax, where it belongs. And having waited an entire movie for it, I find it hard to imagine an audience member that would not be overwhelmed and swept along. All the double, triple and quadruple crosses are in place, and they are fascinating. Not only are you always unsure of just which side each character is playing, but the negotiation and parlay scenes are filmed in the same manner as the action scenes  and it WORKS.<br/><br/>Comparisons to Return of the King are nearly inevitable, regarding various aspects of the film, but the most pretient, in my opinion is that this is the first movie in the series which actually creates the feeling that the heroes and the action are in another world, one of swashbuckling myth and wonder - the sort of feeling you got from any given LoTR movie. <br/><br/>Another RotK comparison (as well as a favorable comparison to the first two Pirate movies) - the movie is long. Some scenes could have been shorter. But there are absolutely no scenes that feel as though they are going on too long. There are no ""fight on the wheel"" or ""drowning Will"" scenes that go ""meanwhile, are heroes are doing the exact same thing they've been doing for the last 5 minutes"".<br/><br/>Shortcomings? The huge chunk of unwieldy exposition shoved into the beginning of the movie, a bit of overacting from Rush, and Chow Yun-Fat's characters should have been given more to do, or cut out altogether. Other than that, this film is excellent, and a fitting end to the trilogy, right down to the humorous/bittersweet/ the road goes ever on and on, ending."

Again, Disney can wow an audience with believable effects, especially the grand finale and final battle. Hint: Better than the Battle of Gondor in LOTR: Return of the King. Johnny Depp is, as usual, fantastic as Jack Sparrow with the rest of the backstabbing cast members.

","I think the one thing that actually made me angry about this movie is the way it insults our viewing intelligence. Throw a lot of special effects, big stars, and some clout produced by the first movie and what do you have? Well... not a whole hell of a lot. The plot is convoluted from the get go, the story lines become inane, and the special effects - actually those are pretty good. Let's just say that in three hours time a person could nearly make a trip from London to New York and they would still see more entertainment were they to look out their window. Half way through the film I asked those sitting to my left if they were as confused and disappointed as I was. They were and so I was somewhat vindicated in my response. Among my points of contention are these:<br/><br/>I have not seen such a complicated and unbelievable love story since Pearl Harbor. Davy Jones is suddenly not the scary sea monster/pirate but more of a cuckolded seafaring diplomat. Captain Jack Sparrow, who nearly carried the first film, is reduced to a supporting character. Why are we suddenly learning that all of these pirates to whom we were introduced in the first movie are part of a Lord Council?"

I felt like with Barbossa's cliffhanging return, the creators of the ""POTC"" films were promising their beloved fans something truly fantastic in the third film. Personally, I feel that they delivered on this promise. As I do not want to put any spoilers in my comments I will simply just say that all of the major questions are answered in a most satisfying and creative manner. There are, however, a crop of new questions that have been left for audience members to figure out on their own. I don't believe like these questions were left open for a possible fourth film (lets not all beat a dead horse), but I think they serve as a delightful ""fill in the blanks"" situation for viewers. Its almost as if one leaves the theater feeling like our beloved pirate friends are still out at sea, having the most marvelous of adventures.<br/><br/>As always, this film boasts an impressive lineup of performers. There is always the ever brilliant Johnny Depp who is as fantastic as ever in his role of Captain Jack Sparrow, the handsome Orlando Bloom who showed some great progress and confidence in his delivery of the role of young William Turner and the feisty and adventurous Keira Knightley as Elizabeth Swann. Other notable performances in the film can be found with Geoffrey Rush's crazed Captain Barbossa, a particular favorite of mine and a touching performance my Naomi Harris as the mysterious Tia Dalma. Add a splash of Keith Richards in an unforgettable cameo, Chow Yun Fat, and some Murtog and Mulroy and there you have it.<br/><br/>As a compliment to this constantly high-energy cast we have the usual full blown sets and computer graphics as can be expected in any Disney film. I truly reveled in the sets, stunts, and costumes as well as a stunning musical score composed by Hans Zimmer.<br/><br/>All of these wonderful elements come together in the final 40 minutes of the film.

A couple of things I want of my chest: - As mentioned before by other people, the movie has too many (sub)plots, making it hard to follow as you are constantly thinking about what the last scene meant.<br/><br/><ul><li>The whole calypso character is a joke. In part one, The Black Pearl was 'da bomb'. In part two it was the flying Dutchman and the Kraken. Now in part three they needed something that could top that all and they come up with some fake God which does nothing in the end, except make the weather bad. How cool is that? (Not) - All the action in the film is stuffed together, making the biggest part of the film very boring and the 'exiting' part is over the top. I like action a lot, but this was just too much. Especially with the rest of the movie having only a few small action moment.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>I swear that if Lord of the rings hadn't happened, we wouldn't have seen such a stupid armada of battleships at the end. How unrealistic.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Especially for a Disney film: How lame to let Will die. Everybody would like to see that couple (Will and Elizabeth) together! For God's sake, Capt Jack even wanted to be the next captain of the flying Dutchman, why not let him? Everybody happy! - The worst thing is that because this movie disappoints me a lot, part two has become useless as well! That film (part 2) ends abruptly so we are forces to watch or even buy part three, or else two is unfinished.</li></ul><br/><br/>You probably will watch this movie anyway (I can't blame you, I made the same mistake) but if you don't need to, at least don't watch it at the movies. Just rent it some day. They don't deserve the money.<br/><br/>Thanx for reading!"
"X_Gravity_Girl_X","5","174","337","24 May 2007"," Pirates III: how NOT to make a trilogy
","And so it is proved, once again, that making a good trilogy isn't easy.<br/><br/>Sure, they did a good job in further repeating the now already 'typical pirates humor', portraying Sparrow as the somewhat clumsy yet always charming captain and, well, once again Keira was there to please the male eye. All of this probably because they hoped that this way we wouldn't notice that pirates III actually has... well... no story to it.<br/><br/>The same thing we saw happening with The Matrix: first movie is new, original and has a little something for everyone, in the second one they re-use the story, but add just a little twist and cover it all up with good visual effects. And come the third one, they've got no story left to tell and set the bar so high for themselves it's nearly impossible to reach it anymore, so they just fall back on the old reliable 'success of the other two movies'.<br/><br/>One thing I actually did like were the visual effects, and the amount of detail found in every single scene. That obviously took a lot of time and effort. Too bad that after seeing an army of undead pirates walking on the bottom of the ocean in the first movie, and a whole crew of half-man-half-sea-creatures in the second one, expectations were so high I was bound to being disappointed.<br/><br/>Yeah, nice locations too, again very detailed and everything, but I'm almost sorry I even noticed that, for my intentions were actually to follow the story (you know, tie all those loose ends Pirates I and II left us with) but all I heard coming out of the actor's mouths was ""blablabla *insert typical Jack Sparrow quote here* blabla"" As for the action scenes I can be quite brief: the first two movies they almost had me believing it just might even be possible (the three-man-fight on the big wheel in Pirates II not included), but this time they obviously got carried away. Even a child who 'wants to be a pirate when he grows up, just like captain Sparrow' will go out to find a more credible role model after seeing this movie.<br/><br/>All in all, I rated the movie 5 out of 10. They put a lot of work into the visual aspect of it all, but failed to live up to all the rest of my expectations."
"just_think_about_it","1","39","67","3 June 2007"," Disgustingly bad
","It's disgusting how the makers of this film milked the fans for so much money and provided a substandard job. The first film was the best one I had ever seen with a nice grounding in historical realism but then the awesome supernatural parts. I enjoyed the second one too, not as much, but this was really bad. The writers seemed like they had been reading too much fan fiction. Chow-Yun Fat was brought in, prominently advertised, and then barely used. Strange, unbelievable ideas (a pirate brethren? wtf?) were brought into play just to fix up plot points, in fact most characters and parts were just brought into play to fix up plot points which had been created earlier and suddenly needed to be resolved. I had been expecting a happy ending and it wasn't as I thought, but that ended up leaving me disappointing. And it was too long."
"SteakSalad_101","1","30","50","1 June 2007"," The first movie I ever walked out of.
","When I think back to May 18th when I first saw ""Shrek The Third,"" I laugh at myself for thinking there couldn't be another worse film made in 2007. Well tonight I was shut up, speechless, and left baffled as I took my seat at the 7:00 showing of ""Pirates Of The Caribbean: At World's End."" I will honestly tell you I only saw the first two hours of the film. At 9:00 I grabbed my value Pepsi and practically ran out the theater door, eager to escape the hell I had so innocently trapped myself in on a valuable Friday night.<br/><br/>There are so many things wrong with this film I don't even know where to start. Just like the third Shrek installment, POTC 3 has lost all--and I mean all--of its charm and has now turned into a 3 hour soul-less bloodthirsty action movie with no character development, horrible acting, very few charming Jack Sparrow moments, and just a bunch of angry sea creature pirates eating each other's heads and stabbing swords through other unlucky pirates' torsos.<br/><br/>The acting was absolutely horrid. Orlando Bloom is in his worst role of his career and gives a painfully annoying performance as Will Turner. Kiera Knightley, an actress who I usually adore watching on screen, was also surprisingly below average and left me wondering what the hell went wrong on the set of this movie. Even veterans Johnny Depp, Bill Nighy, and Geoffrey Rush seemed bored by the whole thing, like they knew the movie sucked but also their contracts with their signatures on it kept them from ducking out of the project.<br/><br/>There's too much CGI. WAAAYYYYYYYYYYYYYY too much CGI. Part of the reason I loved the first film so much was because it was reasonably realistic, no huge sea creatures, no hammerhead shark pirates, no strange women growing 10000x their size, roaring like some guy from a death metal band, and then falling apart into crabs. There was no unnecessary CGI. The third film excels at this, and it almost felt like I was watching a Star Wars film. Unfortunately, the excess CGI takes away from the backbone of the film, and is obviously a huge weight on the film that only attributes to it's faceplant into the ground.<br/><br/>Gore Verbinski really is starting to lose his magic as well. He did an EXCELLENT job directing the first film, and did a pretty good job with the direction of the second film. Why, now, does he deliver a terribly amateurish directing job in the third film? It was almost as bad as the direction in Clint Eastwood's ""Flags of our Fathers."" The storyline is ridiculously stupid and stupidly hollow, incredibly and overly complex for a fun popcorn movie like this, and Verbinski tries to balance three separate story lines on one plate and ends up dropping the dishes, spoiling the food, and leaving the viewer hungry.<br/><br/>I could really go on and on about what a gigantic waste of time and money this film is, but a movie like this doesn't deserve such a long review. Really, it's a shame Hollywood relies on sequels to big moneymaking blockbusters to rake in the cash these days. Thank God for indie cinema. Save your money and rent the first instead, which is actually a 9 or 10 in my book."
"inthedump","1","30","50","30 May 2007"," Simple AWFUL!
","Pirate's 1 = AWESOME Pirate's 2 = OK Pirate's 3 = AWFUL<br/><br/>I do not recommend this movie. I feel that the writers ruined the plot with too many jokes, not enough plot, and too unrealistic of things. Like Jack Sparrow...why's he have doubles and shoulder angels? A very stupid effect in my opinion. I wish I could have said that these movies come to a good conclusion but I don't even understand the whole ""let's get married during a big fight."" What the heck! Who would get married during a fight. It seems like this movie went way passed my range of realism. I'm not saying the graphics were bad or the acting was bad. It was the driven plot. Again, if all of the movies were like pirates 1, i would be real happy right now. But, unfortunately they aren't."
"jzappa","8","23","37","28 May 2007"," You Know What? It's Absolutely Fun.
","I was a complete sucker for the effects this time. I have grown to dislike franchise films based on the starving and then desperately feeding sweets to mainstream American audiences, the sweets being computer-generated visual effects. Well, this one got me. Gore Verbinski, the director of all three films in the Pirates of the Caribbean series, has a deep, intuitive understanding of the fear, drama, and peace that can be derived from water. The film may not have the brilliantly elaborate sword fights that its predecessors had, but there are many unbelievably dazzling sequences involving pirate ships and the effects the gargantuan ocean has upon them. Horizons, whirlpools, the deep, reflections of the starry night sky, and waterfalls all have their heydays in this epic pleasure of a glossy Hollywood film.<br/><br/>The story is an extensive, elaborate, complicated, extremely verbose one, and most adolescents and children prone to Disney films will often find themselves lost. That is no judgment on their intelligence, only on the expectations the writers have of their target audience. I, however, thought the story hardly left anything to be desired. The fantasy elements of the series are induced with great creativity, as opposed to many fantasy films, which usually tend to have stories that center around incidentally fantastical worlds, with invented creatures, completely objective goals like finding a ring that controls the fate of a race of beings. The Pirates films are actually heavy on plot, and in this third installment, the travel between this world and the afterlife in Davy Jones's Locker is cleverly done. The humor is also becoming more daring, with cynicism, and extreme dryness that is not R-rated, but gives off vibes as though it is.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp has become such a sizzling hot property, and since his nuclear burst of popularity in 2003 has widdled to a universal liking by all and a box office fueled by a stalker's obsession among angsty 13-year-old girls, that the filmmakers have become extremely self-conscious in their handling of Captain Jack Sparrow. I was impressed very much by his introduction in At World's End, which was very fresh and not so corny emerging from a coffin with his guns in his hands across his chest so that the audience can cheer. It brims with happy-go-lucky creativity, but the gimmick is carried too far by being continued and built upon in several scenes throughout the rest of the movie. But I won't deny that there are points where it gets interesting. If I'm being vague, it's because I don't want to spoil it.<br/><br/>One thing I'm definitely becoming concerned about is the amount of violence that's being allowed in Disney films. Smokin' Aces was released in January, and it was a mêlée of grinding, shrieking action violence complete with several gruesome shootouts and a couple of snippets of torture. It was rated R, and no, it was not released by Walt Disney Pictures, but by the standards being set by this film, which opens with a child amongst a line of condemned being prepared for hanging and has a surprisingly disturbing scene wherein Davy Jones's tentacles impale a single man's head through each orifice, it very well could be. During Smokin' Aces, or any other R-rated action film recently, I was not disturbed, and did not make an irksome face, at any violent scene, though several are shown and the body counts are high. In this PG-13-rated film, there were three sequences where I grimaced. Why would the violence be harder in a film designed for kids that is given a much more generous rating than a film designed for older people that is given a very standard rating that is given away like confetti at a parade? Anyway, the verdict is that it is one vastly entertaining epic ride where the characters, as they always are in the Pirates films, maintain an interesting and hairpin-turning arch throughout the series, and the performances by Depp and Geoffrey Rush are as charming as ever. This is coming from a film buff who begrudges billion-dollar franchises founded upon treating audiences like junkies who are so numb and disabled that all they are able to eat now is ice cream."
"capncrusty","1","31","52","4 December 2007"," You're kidding me, right?
","It's like 150 people were told, ""You can each write 1 minute of the screenplay"", but no one was allowed to see what anyone else was writing; and then those little bits of script were all tossed into a blender, mixed on ""high"" for about a week, and finally splorked out onto the screen like a drunk sailor's vomit in stormy seas. Whoever the ""continuity"" person was for POTC3 should be keelhauled, drawn and quartered, hanged from a yardarm, then forced to have dinner with Gilbert Gottfried at a cheap taco joint called ""The Alley Cat Tortilla"".<br/><br/>In case it's not clear by now, what I'm saying is that THIS THING MADE NO SENSE. Is ""comprehensible plot"" no longer a viable concept? Has Hollywood finally come out and admitted that they'll make only one good movie, then churn out a mess (literally) of crappy sequels, knowing that their investment will make them big bucks no matter what? I hope to Poseidon that Johnny Depp is still smacking himself for ever agreeing to making this piece of trash.<br/><br/>And while I'm in the mood, politically incorrect as it may be, a skinny, diminutive, pouty-lipped blond won't be a convincing swashbuckler no matter HOW MUCH SHE BELLOWS!<br/><br/>For what it's worth, I loved the first POTC, tolerated the 2nd, and am a big pirate fan, in that I own my own swashbuckler costume, as well as a copy of ""Treasure Island"", have been spewing Robert Newtonish ""piratese"" for literally decades, and observe ""Talk Like A Pirate Day"" as my favorite holiday.

","This movie had no character development, comical sequences like Davy Jones and Tia Dalma, we never really got to fully understand Keith Richard's character Captain Teague, and many other disappointing sequences of just action. The special effects were unbelievable, the music was unique, but it doesn't matter because the movie was pointless. I felt no nostalgia or any sense of good dialogue it sounded like they were all playing a different character especially Davy Jones. We never really got to understand Jack Sparrow's purpose as a pirate neither did we understand ""Bootstrap"" Bill Turner. Elizabeth's relationship with Jack never ignited any further neither did Will's relationship with her. Why did Weatherby Swann die or how did he die? At World's End is a huge disappointment to fellow fans like myself and too many critics alike."
"Tomw343-1","8","32","54","30 May 2007"," Extremely entertaining, if a little bemusing!
","The third film was always going to be the most explosive, and my god, it does deliver. At the very beginning, you are thrown into a very complex, but nevertheless entertaining plot, and the movie grabs you by the scruff of the neck and takes you through just under 3 hours worth of adrenaline filled fun.<br/><br/>Laughs are plenty, and although the film is much much darker than the previous two, it never loses its comedic value. In the major battle scene near the end, a war was being fought, but the jokes and little sketches provided plenty of laughs. The Characters? Depp is amazing as usual, and you're almost wanting him in every scene! Keira and Bloom are much improved, and Barbarossa is a very welcome return. Adding to that, the cameos from Keith Richards and an increasingly influential role for Barbarossa's Monkey! However, the film's plot is rather confusing - after 1 or so hours, you might find yourself thinking ""what?!"" as yet another twist is revealed, but although very complex, you'll never lose complete control of what is happening.<br/><br/>Overall, this film is not quite as good as th first, but it shat's all over Pirates of the Caribbean 2 in my opinion. The action is superb, The characters are much improved, added to the genius that is Jack Sparrow. It's genuinely entertaining and funny, and although the plot is in places too complex, it draws you in for the long running time.<br/><br/>8 - 8.5/10"

I wish I had skipped DMC and AWE until the reviews were in. I believe that the franchise took itself way too seriously in the end and forgot that it was supposed to be FUN.<br/><br/>Also, in reading around the 'net the explanations going on about the bonus scene and what it meant- that dialog explaining the end of the curse at 10 years got cut out, doesn't help me at all. If you go by what was said in the movie- they did the equivalent of condemning Luke Skywalker to an eternity of servitude. Not to mention killing off other characters for NO reason and the multiple Jacks? Idiotic. What was up with the opening of the film? Am I the only person who, as a parent, found it absolutely horrifying? Absolutely heartbreakingly disappointing. So many other endings would've made sense. This one made none. Now thinking about the trilogy- especially the first movie which has been my favorite movie of all time since it was released, just makes me sad.<br/><br/>Maybe I like happy endings, for a movie made by Disney and based on a theme park ride, I don't think that's too much to ask."
"zipirovich","1","18","28","15 December 2007"," Plain bad
","POTC1 was one of the best movies I've ever seen. POTC2 was pretty good, though with some reservations. POTC3 is by far one of the worst. I wish I hadn't watched it. I feel like ripped off -- not only did I lose three hours of my life for this crap, but it also successfully killed all of the enjoyment I had for the first movie.<br/><br/>As it's already been said here by other reviewers, I attribute all its crappiness to the writers/producers team. The plot is as stupid and pointless and plot less as it gets. They killed all the lightweight enjoyable humor and spirit and feel of POTC1. They completely lost touch with reality. They even managed to spoil the Jack Sparrow character, first by not showing enough of him, and second by giving him such horrible lines and actions and behavior that made me wish they'd better not showed him at all. They... basically, everything that could be done wrong they did even worse than that.<br/><br/>To be fair, there are some good things about the movie. Sometimes good features can save an otherwise not-so-great movie; alas, that's not the case here -- on the contrary, it just makes me feel sorry for the effort wasted on this crap. E.g., although I have a problem with the whole resurrecting Barbossa idea, I enjoyed very much Geoffrey Rush's work in POTC3, he's just a brilliant actor and did a brilliant work, best in this movie.<br/><br/>I don't know what exactly they were thinking after the well-deserved success of the first movie, but turning into a trilogy (G-d forbid they decide to go on!) was a great marketing idea whose sole purpose obviously was to rip the world public for lots of money. This has nothing to do with movie-making. Can we sue them??"
"thebluebasil","1","10","14","6 May 2008"," Deserves to walk the plank.
","In summary: Dreadful with a capital D. One of Hollywood's worst.<br/><br/>This is a long overdue review but a necessary one nevertheless. I had the misfortune of attending the gala premiere of this film in late-May 2007, and never have I been so physically uncomfortable in a cinema hall before.<br/><br/>True fans of the P.O.T.C. franchise will cringe at this cinematic debacle. An incoherent plot, insipid cinematography, contrived comedic timing and uninspired acting all add up to two hours of pure torture. The premise of the first two movies were gripping and compelling; and it was no surprise that At World's End enjoyed very successful opening weekend box office sales, given that people were ready for a fabulous final installment of the trilogy. At World's End, however, is the cinematic equivalent of garnishing an exquisitely made soufflé with a piece of lard.<br/><br/>The over-reliance and over-emphasis on Jack Sparrow's drunken stupor silliness becomes old after 17 minutes. The maelstrom-fighting scene lasted no less than 45 minutes, by which time most of the audience were actually struggling to keep the coke and popcorn down. Keira Knightley's stubborn refusal to display emotion of any sort was equally vomit inducing. I've also seen pedal-powered wheelchairs that had more relevance than Chow Yun Fatt's random bizarre appearance.<br/><br/>Perhaps the only redeeming factor of the movie was the fact that the set and props were admittedly intricate and very well-crafted. The CGI was top-notch as well. But if Mr Bruckheimer and Mr Verbinski sunk into the backseats of their Bentleys and thought, ""Okay, the plot's rubbish, the acting is beyond awful, but hey! The CGI's great and we've got Jack Sparrow, that's enough to plaster up the festering wounds of this horror show"", they were sorely mistaken.<br/><br/>No warm-blooded human being will walk out of this movie feeling satisfied and entertained. If you're looking to get some great swashbuckling underwater action with oodles of creepy sea creatures and brazen barnacles, I highly recommend any episode of Spongebob Squarepants."
"ccthemovieman-1","6","10","14","9 December 2007"," Entertaining, But Too Long
","The good and bad of this third - and perhaps last - of the ""Pirates of the Caribbean' story:<br/><br/>It's not easy to keep people entertained these days for almost three straight hours, and the film-makers accomplished two-thirds of that. I might have ranked this higher, but it's too long at 169 minutes (almost three hours) .....way too long. Two hours would have been more than enough for this fantasy-adventure film. After that, I found myself getting bored with too much action and much of the same things I had already seen for two hours.<br/><br/>What I really appreciated in this movie was all the humor. I expected decent special-effects and diverse characters. There are a number of good laughs in here and they are provided by a variety of people, not just Johnny Depp as ""Capt. Jack Sparrow."" Even the parrot gets several laughs in here.<br/><br/>Since the entire cast was still intact, I was more interested in seeing some new faces and I really enjoyed Chow Yun-Fat whose major contributions came in the beginning of the film. Why he basically left after the opening part, I don't know, and the movie suffered for it. Mostly the film features a bunch of familiar people, none of whom we can predict what they'll do next. One minute they are good guys; the next minute, the bad guys. Unfortunately, that makes the story confusing in parts. So - if you got lost a few times, don't feel bad. It's understandable.<br/><br/>The only character who rubbed me the wrong way was the too politically-correct and almost insulting role of ""Elizabeth Swann,"" played by Keira Knightley. Why do filmmakers insist on giving us the pretty girls-who-beat up-all-the-men roles? It's so stupid. Overnight she becomes a super-skilled swordsman? Please, movie makers: stop giving us Rambo with makeup and cleavage! Let women be women and men be men!<br/><br/>Also, I wanted a high seas pirate adventure story, not some voodoo theology mumbo-jumbo, which took up too much of this story. What was this: Pirates of the Caribbean or Harry Potter? At times, it resembled more of the latter.<br/><br/>Geoffrey Rush as ""Captain Barbossa"" was the most interesting person in the film, in my opinion. He was terrific in every scene. Depp is always good, but I missed hearing him say, ""Savvy?"" He didn't say it once!<br/><br/>Overall, fun but overdone. Savvy?"

This movie went from nowhere to nowhere at a glacial pace, with a confusing, tedious plot that defied all good rules of writing. Uninspiring, overly-staged sword fights occasionally interrupt the tedium. Not only does the main plot (whatever it is) tank, the side plots also go nowhere. The pirate lords are lame, Calypso drains the bath, and our shrill-voiced pirate king is a Hollywood bimbo. By the end, I was hoping someone would rip my heart out so I could be relieved of having to see one more minute of this expensive waste of time. But would that doom me to see it again and again?

","A great film trilogy is a rare thing. Most trilogies have one film that is way below par (Indiana Jones for example). Others begin sucking after the first (Smokey & The Bandit). Very few trilogies keep the same quality throughout, although it has happened occasionally (Star Wars; Lord of The Rings). Perhaps the rarest of all is when the third film of a trilogy surpasses the previous two. In fact, it has only happened twice in the history of film. The first time was The Good, the Bad, & the Ugly in 1966. Forty-one years later, it happened again. This is the 2nd time.<br/><br/>Not only is this the best film of the year, it's the best Disney film ever. In addition, it is the greatest film in the (WARNING: I DO NOT WISH TO OFFEND ANYBODY SO IF YOU ARE A STAR WARS FAN STOP READING THIS NOW) greatest film trilogy of all time.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most special thing about this film is the fact that it manages to be both the darkest and the funniest film of the series. The opening scene was so grim that I thought I had gone into the wrong movie. The opening is the last thing you would expect from Disney (for that matter, so is the closing, but I won't ruin that for you). However, it is also the hardest I've laughed during a movie since Borat.<br/><br/>I won't give away any of the plot, but I will praise some of the performances. Johnny Depp (the greatest actor of his generation) is great as always. Orlando Bloom has came a long way since the first film and he gives a terrific performance. Keira is as hot as always and this is also her best performance to date. It was a real joy to see Geoffrey Rush back in the series. Chow Yun-Fat was great as the villain and Keith Richards' cameo was one of the funniest moments in the film.<br/><br/>One of the biggest criticisms I've heard is that the film is hard to follow. I don't understand this. It took me two viewings to figure out Dead Man's Chest, but I found this one very easy to follow.<br/><br/>I'll close by making one final point. This film deserves every Oscar available, with Orlando Bloom and Geoffrey Rush sharing the honor for Best Supporting Actor.<br/><br/>Will it win any Oscars? Maybe a few technical awards and possibly Best Score. However, the major awards are all going to go to smaller films that nobody will see until after they win.<br/><br/>And why is this? Well, to paraphrase Stephen King, ""The critic's definition of over-rated is: something that too many people have enjoyed"".<br/><br/>Enjoy the film."

","The gangs all here for the third installment in the Pirates series and its a hell of a ride. The likes of which I can only make small comparisons but in the end have never seen. I grew up watching Indy and Han Solo and as those movies progressed and eventually aged they sort of lost their magic. I have also seen the resurrection of these films in the form of mummies and computer programs crash and burn. The Pirates of the Caribbean movies have delivered a nice trilogy one I have been waiting for my whole life. I know the script was rushed. I know there are flaws everywhere of all different sorts. But for me there's has never been a moment in any of these movies where my attention wandered. I love how by Worlds Ends conclusion everything has come full circle. I love how certain questions are only partially answered and left a little open. Jack is still Jack. Yet Elizabeth & Will are somehow forever changed but no worse for the wear in fact they are weathered and stronger than ever by the end of part 3. Isn't that life?!?! The bitching and moaning about the length of 3 or how convoluted the whole thing is has to be coming from the mouths of those who never really enjoyed the film from the start. I walked into at Worlds End expecting there to be a lot of exposition. In fact I welcomed it so long as they didn't muck up the existing story line too bad and they don't. Plus the pacing is sharp and and always keeps you on your toes. Now the Chow Yun Fat & Keith Richards argument about how they are either pointless or underused. Bulls*@t. I could and did find cons things I didn't like but these negative remarks are so misleading and not my concern at all and pale to the overall amazing job everyone who worked on all 3 of these movies did with such a short amount of time. To sum it all up. Pirates 3 is a really good movie with some bad parts. Not a really bad movie with some good parts. The latter of which seems to be the theme in just about every movie out there now exspecially these big budget popcorn movies. A Pirates life for me indeed."

I hope there can be a prequel expanding Chow Yun Fat's character, it was too brief in this film to have any significant dimension.<br/><br/>The strained love affair between her character and Will Turner resembled that of the Greek myth between Orpheus and Eurydice.<br/><br/>However, although they say there are no more POTC's, there are still unanswered questions - what happened to Sparrow's quest for Ponce de Leon's Agua De Vida? Will Barbossa stop Jack from reaching Florida? Were Calypso and Bill Nighy's un-squidded human sailor be reunited in pure passion? What of the Black Pearl, whose is it really? Or does it even belong to another?"

","I hated this movie. The story line was impossible to follow. I had no idea who was fighting who for what almost the entire time. The only time I perked up was when Keith Richards made his much anticipated appearance as Jack Sparrow's father. Even that was a disappointment as his role was minimal and lines few.<br/><br/>Keira Knightly's costumes were absurd. Where on earth would she have picked up those outfits and managed as many changes as she did in the mêlée? Not to mention the stupid hat she wore throughout most of the movie. <br/><br/>I loved the first movie in the Trilogy, but I have to say that the second and third were progressively more disappointing than the last. Let's hope we have seen the end of the story before they ruin the memory of the first entirely."
"ShowStoppar","10","16","25","3 June 2007"," You would love this brilliant work if you're intelligent and observant.
","One of the best movies I've ever seen. Truly amazing. Nothing was amiss in my opinion.<br/><br/>Let me start by saying that for anyone to enjoy this movie, they would have to have a good sense of observation along with a wee bit of intelligence. Because I know many and have seen many people who could not understand this movie even though they have seen the previous two. My only conclusion would be that they are a wee bit short of the brain clan...<br/><br/>The movie was fantastic. I loved both the first two. In fact I liked Dead Man's chest more than the first one. It seems that the PoC movies keep getting better with the sequels (at least for me).<br/><br/>Not only are the special effects and stunts BETTER than almost any recent movies you might have seen, including spiderman 3, the way they were executed and placed doesn't make any of it seem unnecessary.<br/><br/>In the last two movies though, I found the movie's charm only in one person, Jack Sparrow, AKA Johnny Depp. No doubt that Jack Sparrow is the best thing about this movie too, however, during the short intervals where we couldn't be blessed with his presence on our screens, the rest of the secondary characters provided fulfilled fun entertainment. <br/><br/>Geoffrey Rush was simply superb in his role as Barbossa again. It was a pleasure seeing him. Even though my favorite character is Jack Sparrow, the most realistic pirate in the whole franchise seemed like Barbossa courtesy the amazing acting by Geoffrey Rush.<br/><br/>We also got to see a bit more of Orlando Bloom AKA Will Turner and Elizabeth Swan AKA Keira Knightley. At first I would have thought that anything that comes in the way of more screen time for Jack Sparrow would make me mad, but I was pleasantly surprised when their storyline was not the romantic balderwash I was expecting. It was entertaining as well.<br/><br/>Bill Nighly as Davey Jones was great again. Bill executes the Davey Jones character with extreme acuteness. Along with Barbossa, Davey Jones sounds like the most realistic Pirate. And his fight scene with Jack was amazing. Also the character manages to get in a few laughs in his dark character as well, like in the last movie.<br/><br/>Other characters like Lee Arenberg AKA Pintel and Mackenzie Crook AKA Ragetti gave us many many laughs and they also executed their characters to perfection.<br/><br/>(SPOILER) Tom Hollander as Beckett played his part extremely well. Specially the scene where his ship is being sunk and he stands amidst the wreckage waiting for himself to sink with the ship, after all the evil he gave the pirates, you couldn't help but feel a little sorry for Beckett, a little though, not much. (SPOILER)<br/><br/>And of course, the heart and soul of the movie, Jack Sparrow AKA Johnny Depp. I have been a big Depp fan since I watched Donny Brasco. But this Jack Sparrow character, he just plays it to pure and utter perfection. He does nothing wrong. I can imagine why he loves this character so much. To have the pleasure of transforming yourself into Sparrow anytime you please is quite like a superpower in itself. The entertainment this character brings with its charm, wit, intelligence and the most important, the drunken swagger. Seeing Johnny Depp play Jack Sparrow is a delight like no other. <br/><br/>And watching Keith Richards as Sparrow's dad was amazing. I could think of no other who would better fit that profile. However, prior to watching the movie, my idea of Richard's as Sparrow's dad was a little different in character, as in more like Jack himself. But still, that was pretty amazing as well. Though I would have loved to see Keith do the drunken Swagger Sparrow popularized. <br/><br/>Before I leave I would like to address one last issue, many have complained that the movie was too long, well I found that an added bonus, in fact I was just thinking throughout the movie 'Please let it go on forever, oh please' I mean, there just wasn't one scene which wasn't interesting. <br/><br/>If I could, I would rate this movie a perfect 10/10."
"zekelyndon","2","11","16","13 July 2007"," Terrible
","Well, after seeing Pirates II, I didn't think it was possible for III to be any worse.... I was wrong. This is quite possibly the worst film I have ever seen. I understand that some movies are made just for ridiculous, but fun, action sequences and little or no plot line, and you can definitely tell which movies those are, but this one tried to have a decent plot, and failed miserably. Yes, the action sequences were fantastic and full of some of the most ridiculous stunts imaginable, but they in no way saved the horrible attempt at a plot line. With hardly any character development, far less Jack Sparrow than there should have been, the abandonment of the love triangle, the overly-dramatic attempt for an epic, and the complete lack of trying to be at least somewhat historically correct, the writers have caused cinema to reach a new low.<br/><br/>The first problem with the movie is that Jack Sparrow isn't seen for half an hour. Johnny Depp is pretty much what has made the Pirates films. And when you do finally get to see him, he has been downgraded to the status of comic relief, rather than the humorous hero he has played in the past. It is because of this that you actually start to wish that you see less of him. The corny, one-line jokes that just seem to perpetually flow forth from his mouth get old very, very quickly.<br/><br/>The second problem is, of course, the total lack of true interaction between the characters. Most of their speech is devoted to furthering the already failing plot, and the little that is actual development of their relationships is poorly written. Though I hated the idea of the love triangle between Will, Elizabeth, and Jack introduced in Pirates II, I was sad to see them completely abandon that idea, acting almost as though it had never happened.<br/><br/>The main problem that I had with the plot for this film is that it never really settled down. It was either moving forward far too fast for most of the audience to keep up with, or so dead still that half the audience was falling asleep (though the latter was far rarer). Plus the introduction of so many different plot devices and magic just made the story seem so implausible. I mean, I am a firm believer in the willing suspension of disbelief in small doses (such as the amount of disbelief I had to suspend in the first film), but if I was going to actually enjoy this movie, I would have had to have suspended it for almost the entire length of the film, and that's hard to do for near three hours.<br/><br/>And finally, the first film, as far as I know, was pretty much on par in terms of historical accuracy and pirate mythology. That is, it was very true to the era it was based in, and didn't have to add in all sorts of fantastical, magical things to give the film a sense of adventure. The only magic involved was the curse of the medallions. Which, while it may have dominated most of the plot, was rooted in some history and was presented in a plausible way. For that, I can suspend my disbelief. But when they start giving physical manifestations to Davy Jones (granted that was introduced in the second film, but still) and start calling Greek sea-nymphs (Calypso) Pirate goddesses; I'm sorry but I just can't do that. Not to mention them trying to claim that the pirates, as treacherous and murderous as they were, were actually all united under one flag is just ridiculous. No historical value (and very weak story value) whatsoever.<br/><br/>All in all, this film surpassed how terrible I expected it to be so horribly that I am honestly considering walking back to the theater and asking for compensation for the three wasted hours of my life."
"ven2s","9","27","46","29 May 2007"," Convoluted? Are you kidding???!!!
","I almost did not see this movie because of a number of reviews that reported the storyline as convoluted. Convoluted, are you kidding?? This movie was intricate with an ending, I believe, few could have figured out. The effects were excellent, with some magically memorable scenes. But anyone but a child or someone who does not want to think while viewing this movie, would find it convoluted or meandering. Are there holes, sure, but I know of very few movies without them. Although it has what could be considered multiple endings, these are character resolutions that help to complete this installment. Make sure that when you see this movie, that you sit through the end titles, because, as usual, there is a surprise at the end. Who knows, there may yet be another installment, but I doubt it."
"samwisegenius","10","29","50","29 May 2007"," POTCAWE was absolutely amazing!
","I loved the entire movie. All of it. I thought it was fantastic. It has plenty of action and plenty of laughs. I felt kinda sad when Chow Yun Fat died though because I think he is awesome. Keith Richards played a pretty cool part for the 10 minutes he was in the movie. I didn't see the other pirates doing much when The Black Pearl was going head to head with The Flying Dutchman either. I really feel kinda sad and I wanted to cry when Will had his heart cut out and became the new captain of The Flying Dutchman. I wish Calypso was gone or would lift the curse or something. I hope that in the next one, something happens so that Will gains immortality and the curse is lifted on him, cause if the curse is just lifted he would die cause his heart is already cut out. Maybe he'll become immortal due to the Fountain of Youth. Who knows? I don't, but I sure hope so. Anyways, the movie is fantastic and one of the best of the year. It's up there with 300 on my list."
"sethlong-67988","10","3","3","27 March 2020"," I cannot be the only one who understands this plot.
","These people saying that Pirates of the Caribbean 3 is a disorienting, jambled, cartoonish movie with almost no plot are some of the dumbest movie reviewers ever. The movie has a plot. Let me show you this and it will seem obvious then<br/><br/>Let's not forget that ""At World's End"" is a third film in a story. It's not a stand-alone movie. Let's also not forget that the second movie ended with a cliff hanger. At the end of Dead Man's Chest, Jack Sparrow was sent to Davy Jones' Locker along with the Black Pearl. Barbossa was brought back from the dead by Calypso, and Lord Beckett received the heart of Davy Jones, meaning he has full control over the Flying Dutchman.<br/><br/>Now we are at the beginning of the third film. Some time has passed since Dead Man's Chest. Beckett has been using the Flying Dutchman to sabotage pirates across the ocean in order to protect his company. Elizabeth Swan and Barbossa are trying to form a team to fight against Lord Beckett by reuniting the Pirate Lords. They travel to Singapore to confront one of the lords (sorry I can't remember his name), but Will Turner has been taken prisoner there, and Elizabeth makes it obvious that he's with her and Barbossa. The lord is enraged by this and orders his men to attack. But then Beckett's men begin invading Singapore to stop pirates from possibly uniting.<br/><br/>In short, Elizabeth, Barbossa, and Will escape and they attempt to find Jack Sparrow, trapped in Davy Jones' Locker. Crabs help Jack reach the shore of the Locker, and the crew trying to find Jack fall down a gigantic waterfall and meet him at the shore. They need Jack to come back to unite against Beckett.<br/><br/>Jack comes with them. They all make it back. What now? Beckett.<br/><br/>The story explains itself for the rest of the way, guys. It isn't that hard to conclude that the beginning of the third film might have something to do with the end of the second film. They both connect with each other.<br/><br/>Anyways, great movie with one of the best final battles I've ever seen."

","This is yet another Jerry Bruckheimer totally over-produced movie, very much like Pearl Harbor. It's useless crap leading nowhere.

Best enjoyed if you're brain-dead, really. Very dull and a total waste of time. Thank goodness I did not see it in cinema but only on free TV. Money well saved. For me easily one of the most uninspired movies of all times. For an entertaining pirates movie see the lovely Geena Davis in Cutthroat Island.

"thumpergirl03","9","3","3","12 November 2007"," Excellent to top off the series except ...
","Let me just start off by saying that I'm a huge fan of Pirates of the Caribbean. I like the ride at Disneyland and Disney World. I've noticed that as i've read the comments, there are no OK's. Either people hate it or they love it. I went to see this movie the second or third day after it came out and just loved it! To be honest after Dead Man's Chest I just stopped caring about understanding the storyline and just started to enjoy the special FX and entertainment. Jonny Depp delivers his famous role fabulously as usual as do Orlando Bloom and Ms. Knightley. Goeffrey Rush has a lot more character development as Barbossa than he did in the original.Bill Knighey reprised his role also Davey Jones and some of the other less important characters. The soundtrack is probably the best movie soundtrack i've ever heard (some times i get He's a Pirate stuck in my head) although it's at a bit faster pace in this one. My only spoiler is Keith Richards as Jack's father, maybe it's because i hate the Rolling Stones. Other than that an excellent movie!"

","What an AWESOME movie!!!!! It was a great way to end series, but it also left it open for a fourth one just in case they decide to do it. It had the entertaining humor that the first two had, and the battle scenes were edge-of-your-seat exciting! Johnny Depp did an amazing job (as usual) acting out the witty Captain Jack Sparrow. Geoffry Rush is back as Captain Barbossa (the one thing that Dead Man's Chest was missing) which creates a humorous captain rivalry with Jack. The humor, adventure, and action in this movie were remarkable. It is funny how the critics always trash the best movies. The Pirates movies have to be the greatest movies ever made, because no other movie that I've seen has ever combined humor, adventure, action, danger, and fantasy quite as well as the writers of pirates did. I recommend this movie to anyone and everyone!"

Jack got on my nerves at times and that is never a good sign.<br/><br/>The best performances were set by Geoffrey Rush and Keira Knightley.

","I have become a massive fan of 'Pirates Of The Caribbean' lately. I was only about 9 or 10 when the 'Curse Of The Black Pearl' was released,so that is why it is my least favourite, which is strange because everyone thinks the first one is the best. I saw 'Dead Mans Chest' in the cinema 3 times because I thought it was totally awesome. Then, just 1 year later, the 3rd Pirates movie is made, and this is what I thought of that; I was HUGELY excited about seeing this film. I saw it on May 25th 2007. But I have to admit, when I first saw 'At Worlds End', I didn't exactly like it that much. It was only when I re-watched it on DVD today when I realised how amazing it really is. Captain Jack Sparrow is back and it seems he is here to stay, as this movie contains a HUGE battle at the end. Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley are back, which it a great exception. It was great to see Barbossa is no longer evil but is now on the good side. I am loving Davey Jones, just like I did in the previous movie. Bill Nighy is perfect for the role!!! The evil Lord Cutler Beckett had a much bigger role in this, which was great, as he is plays SOOOOO well. The new characters, like Captain Sao Feng were well done, too.<br/><br/>This movie really sucks you into it. The action is completely awesome and the humour, the fighting and everything else makes this movie a definete must-see!!!!"

If you can brave the run time and actually decide to have a good time you will enjoy this movie.<br/><br/>I won't spoil any part of the film because its the type of film you have to watch a few times to really appreciate how good it is, but overall it has good action scenes, and when the pace is slow it manages to keep you in the mood with some witty and funny moments.<br/><br/>So all in all don't read negative comments and automatically think to yourself that you don't want to watch the movie, It is enjoyable and comes highly recommended.

","Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End (2007, Dir.

It's not going to be easy, as they must rescue Sparrow, convince all the pirate lords to join them and defeats Beckett, whilst each individual pirate has their own route which they wish to follow.<br/><br/>It's often a sad time for me, when i see a trilogy come to an end. There are so many great characters that you really do start to miss them. Unfortunately, trilogies always seem to have the problem are living up to the previous movies. 'At World's End' falls into this category. The characters are great as always with Geoffrey Rush bringing Barbossa back to life as much as he did in the first movie. The special effects are amazing again, with some beautiful crafted fight sequences and Davy Jones looking even more realistic. The music is fun again but disappointing compared to the first two films. The main problem with this film is the story. It's not the most easy to follow story and can really make you think for a bit.

","Curse of the Black Pearl was a great movie unto itself and can easily stand alone without any problem. Dead Man's Chest, on the other hand, was a mild disappointment. It had many flaws and left you wondering what you just watched.<br/><br/>At World's End is a great movie all-around. From the heart-wrenching opening scene, to the heart-pounding, edge-of-your-seat sea battle, and of course the final scene before the credits (and don't forget the scene after the credits are over), AWE takes what was great of the first movie and takes it even further.<br/><br/>The action is awesome in this film. Cannons, muskets, and the clang of swords are everywhere, but it doesn't go overboard, nor does it seem out of place (like that wheel-balancing sword-fight in Dead Man's Chest). It just seems right.<br/><br/>But then there's the humor, that was ever-present in the Black Pearl, but seriously lacking in Dead Man's Chest. It's back, and boy is it great. Black Pearl became known for doing a great job at intertwining action and comedy, and At World's End brings it back and does a great job. Again, the comedy is no where out of place, and the timing is perfect.<br/><br/>Those in the press who gave this movie a disappointing rating need to see it again, and actually pay attention. Those who go into this movie with the predisposition that it'll be disappointing will only find disappointment, and thus will miss the great experience that At World's End is. The storyline is beautifully done and leaves you wanting more.<br/><br/>And to those who call this a finale, not so fast. There is plenty left open, plenty of questions to be answered, and the ending scene following the credits, along with the last scene before the credits is proof of this. Will they make a fourth Pirates? Who knows, but I'm hoping so, and that fourth Pirates would easily make a finale.<br/><br/>With the resurrection of the comedy and action found in Curse of the Black Pearl and the elimination of many of the problems with Dead Man's Chest, At World's End is a great film that is going to be on my buy list when it hits store shelves (Blu-Ray, of course). I highly recommend this film for those who loved the first movie and either loved or even felt disappointed by the second.<br/><br/>I give this film, its actors, actresses and crew, a 10 out of 10. Anything less would be piracy."

","You know those wax deserts that they bring out at restaurants like Johnny Carino's and Red Lobster. They look really good, but try taking a bite out of it and all you get is a mouth full of wax. That's how Pirates of the Caribbean at World's End made me feel. It has amazing visuals. Duh. Every special effects movie made from here to the end of eternity is going to have amazing visuals. If you haven't noticed by now nerds with computers can do some really cool stuff if you throw enough money at them. Back in the 90's good visuals could carry a movie, like say, Independence Day, but they can't do it any more. In the past 10 years we've seen people fly and dodge bullets in slow motion, we've seen New York City destroyed in a disturbingly large variety of ways, we've seen the armies of Rohan ride to the rescue of Gondor crushing orcs under foot, we've seen every imaginable object or animal anthropomorphized from toys, to cars, to penguins several times over. All that to say you can't just impress me with visuals anymore. I demand a story I can follow and enjoy; is that too much to ask of a good movie? I'm not asking for Dickens, not even Tom Clancy, just a passable story that an intelligent person can follow. Pirates doesn't give me this. And more than that, it takes lovable characters and diminishes them by placing them into this joke of a script. You know why the first Pirates movie was good? I didn't know a person who sat down to watch it who didn't like it. Now 90% of the audience is walking out of the theaters scratching their heads."

The acting from Johnny Depp is good as usual, and the action/CGI sequences are even more breathtaking than the previous 2 movies. They throw in some good laughs throughout the movie, though sometimes the situations are a bit more absurd than they should be (especially near the end).

Now it time for a new one in ""Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End."" Does this movie have a chance at succeeding at the box office? Will it be a success or a failure? Read this review and find out for yourself.<br/><br/>""At World's End"" takes place shortly after the events of ""Dead Man's Chest."" The crew members of the Black Pearl, with the help of Captain Barbossa and Tia Dalma, must set out to ""Davy Jones' Locker"" in order to save Jack Sparrow. In the mean time, Lord Cutler Beckett and the East India Trading Company has teamed up with Davy Jones to destroy every man, woman and child that has ever had anything to do with piracy. Now these pirates are forced to unite in order to keep living the way they do.<br/><br/>If you are a fan of the first two, you will dig this movie. All of the great elements on the series are still here. The action scenes and special effects were even better this time around. The fantasy elements are still present. Jack Sparrow steals the show with every scene he is in, which is a big sign that his antics have not gone tiresome. Han Zimmer has another brilliant film score. This all means that if you liked the others, you will enjoy this.<br/><br/>The acting was acceptable. Of course, Johnny Depp can play Jack Sparrow in his sleep. It was very nice to see Geoffrey Rush back in action as Caption Barbossa. Keira Knightley has improved a lot since the first film as Elizabeth Swann. Bill Nighy is wonderful as Davy Jones, even with all the CG. Newcomers Chow Yun-Fat (Captain Sao Feng) and Keith Richards (Jack Sparrow's father, Captain Teague) gave great contributions to the movie.<br/><br/>A note to parents: this movie is the darkest and most adult of the series. There are a few scenes, biggest one in the first scene, which seemed strangely placed in a Disney flick. There are also some sexual innuendos in there as well. It definitely deserves the PG-13 rating. This film did not feel like a Disney movie, but then again, none of them do anyway. Nonetheless, if your kids can handle it take them because it is a great family flick.<br/><br/>Overall, if you a fan of the first two, you will love these. This is just as enjoyable as the first two. This is one of the must-see movies on the big screen. If you did not like the other two, do not see it because you will not like it. One small plot hole was brought to this reviewer's attention after the movie ended but it is neither big nor noticeable so it is not a big deal. At the end of the movie, there was a lot of applause from the audience and it truly deserved it. ""Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End"" is extremely recommended! <br/><br/>Don't forget to stay for the credits."

","First of all why does this movie have a rating of 8.6 when it is clearly an awful movie. Most perplexing to me is why people are liking the film, when I looked back at the viewers' faces during a lighted scene the audience was engulfed. Did the directors think they were making an earth shattering shot sequence when they showed the East India TC Captain moving in slow motion while the ship was exploding? Not to mention the marriage of Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley, performed by Geoff, which reduced function in my body. The most important inconsistency being where Lord Cutler Beckett does not give a command while the pirates attack; the crew does not order fire respecting the Lord's command, but then they decide to abandon ship? Rubbish. Robin Williams~""One robot's 200 year journey to become an ordinary man."""
"suzy-60","9","17","28","30 May 2007"," What's more fun than a barrel of monkeys?
","I really don't understand the naysayers. While this movie was long, it captured my attention for its entire running-time. While it was convoluted, I had not trouble keeping up with the plot. While it was big and spectacular, it dared to go to places few movies ever do (see: the very first scene, the very ending).<br/><br/>I admire that in these movies, you're left with ambiguities, not everything is spelled out anviliciously. For a perfectly random example, at the end of the film ""Van Helsing"" we find out that the heroine's family is now able to enter Heaven via a long sequence of ethereally-smiling faces badly superimposed over clouds. Nothing as clunky or over-spelled-out is done here; in fact, if anything, the movie errs on the side of silence. Sometimes this understatement works elegantly (as when a certain character dies, relatively early in the movie) and sometimes it doesn't work at all (see the end credit scene and the furore surrounding it); but either way, as long as you can stick with the main plot, a good time will be had.<br/><br/>The movie is the darkest of all the movies, and while the storytellers' goofy heads are still trying to come up with wacky ideas, they're running out a little; nothing is quite as mad or inspired as some of what we saw in the second film. Yet it's mad enough to please if you're ready to be pleased; and if you're not, God help you, because this is a three-hour pirate acid trip.<br/><br/>The movie's strongest emotional punches come near the end, as the destiny of Will Turner is revealed. It was at this point that the movie became truly set apart from the usual popcorn movie fare and became really good in its own right. I'll say no more than that over the last two movies Will's story has been masterfully handled; this gives him a fittingly legendary, mythic ending.<br/><br/>Do remember to stay for the scene after the credits! It's worth all the waiting and far more important to the movie than the previous scenes. Remember what the flash of green light means, btw; I'll say no more than that, but merely point in the direction of that wildly raging fan controversy over there."

"peter-liddle-1","1","9","13","12 June 2007"," The only piracy was committed by the producers
","I'm writing this review for two reasons: first, to serve as a warning; and second, as a form of therapy for what was a shockingly horrific experience. If you enjoy movies in any way, avoid this one. Here be monsters.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed 'Dead Man's Chest', which, to say it was based on a theme park ride, had a real swashbuckling feel to it. The second movie was disappointing, but 'World's End' was insulting. One character mentions that ""its only business"" and you get the distinct feeling that it was an often repeated line by those making the movie. The only form of piracy was the fact that people had to pay to see this movie.<br/><br/>To criticise the plot seems a little pointless because there really isn't one. The movie stumbles like a senile blind-man from one character to another as we are supposed to be convinced that everyone is out for themselves, but they're all lovable rogues really. You soon come to hate each character for wasting your time before the plot kicks in (which it doesn't). It truly proves that a mass of characters does not in itself make a movie.<br/><br/>The outstanding thing about this movie is how you are constantly surprised. After a scene that leaves you feeling that that must be the lowest point, another pops up that's even worse. When one of the characters attempts a rousing speech the collective sigh of the movie watchers was very impressive. The speech itself was as shrill as it was clichéd.<br/><br/>To all the movie-goers out there I say: avoid this movie or simple post in your money to the producers and save yourself a couple of hours. To the makers of this movie I recommend reading Capt. Charles Johnson's 'A general history of the robberies and murders of the most notorious pirates' either that or using a dictionary. P is for Pirate.<br/><br/>How can you make a pirate movie without any piracy?"
"lilwest29","10","9","13","5 June 2007"," Great movie and finale though Pirates 1 is still the best
","This movie is hands down great. Great finale for such an epic. I mean everything was good about it. There was some good comedy and great action. I don't think it was too long either. With this great of a movie it had to be very long. Also the cast was exceptional again with another great performance by Johnny Depp as Jack Sparrow. Also the visual effects were amazing, in my opinion the best visual effects out of the three. Also the cameo by Richards was great as Depp's dad. They acted very alike. Oh by the way this will smoke Shrek and Spidey as the top grossing of the three. But I was very surprised that it did not beat Spidey in the opening weekend record. But I'll take the record for four day opening. But anyway this movie was very good and I think this is a must see for everyone. Don't wait for the DVD, if you are reading this I suggest you go and see it and if you have seeing it again."
"nsanehops","3","9","13","25 May 2007"," A Boring, Agitating Mess
","Being an optimist, I walked into Pirates 3 expecting a proper adjustment to be made from the second installment, and a picture that followed what worked in the original. Instead, the film expanded upon everything that I detested in the sequel. I squirmed in my seat for nearly three hours, desperately clinging to every mildly funny one-linerthe only source of relief from the torturous boredom.<br/><br/>The fact that I say ""boredom"" is rather ironic considering Pirates 3 is nothing but frenetic stimulation. But my senses took in all they could handle in the first hour before they just seemed to shut off involuntarily.<br/><br/>One perpetrator is the bombastic scoreunyielding, and punctuating absolutely every dramatic moment with piercing, orchestral emphasis.<br/><br/>While the acting is at least competent, the script dictated that almost every moment of dialogue be treated as a revelation of the highest order. Characters rattled on with grave seriousness about mystical secrets, fearful creatures, and budding betrayals. It seemed inspired by The Lord of the Rings, minus universal themes, a moral compass, and a plot that anyone cares about.<br/><br/>I might have cared about plot if it wasn't so overly complex and often incomprehensible. Part of the problem, not unlike X-Men 3, was the juggling of too many characters. Even with a running time approaching three hours, there is no time for real character development. With so many talented actors fighting for screen time, Gore Verbinski continually bounces from one to the next just so we remember who's in the film.<br/><br/>On the upside are the fantastic special effects, meticulous and impressive art direction, and well-crafted (albeit totally unrealistic) action pieces. <br/><br/>But the story problems simply sucked out the joy from any of these cinematic pleasures. After about the fifteenth double-cross (and having lost track of allegiances in the first place) I felt like screaming ""I don't care!"" and running out of the theater like a deranged 8 year-old girl."
"misterjolly","2","9","13","24 May 2007"," Special effects in search of a plot
","A disappointing sequel. The special effects were great, but the humour was slapstick at best and the plot (such as it was) seemed little more than a vague attempt to connect one CGI scene to the next. <br/><br/>I appreciate that the series is based on a theme park ride and that I shouldn't expect Chekhov, but I enjoyed the first film for its imagination and sense of fun. However this third outing cast aside all ideas of story and seemed to have run out of any ideas beyond ""make it bigger and louder"".<br/><br/>I would suggest that this effort is a definite case of more being decidedly less. Very poor."
"robert_hennah","7","18","30","29 May 2007"," A good movie but sure isn't of Curse of the Black Pearl standard
","OK, where to start. Pirates of the Caribbean, Curse of the Black Pearl is one of my all time favourite movies, it was a great family adventure picture that could keep all ages entertained. Johnny Depp kept the film lighthearted, Keira Knightley brought a little something for the guys, Orlando Bloom was the ""heart throb"" for the girls and superb actors such as Jonathan Pryce and Geoffrey Rush filled up the ranks. This movie was near perfect and as a result people may have expected a little too much of the sequels. Pirates of the Caribbean, Dead Man's Chest has been critiqued by many a fan as being drawn out through the use of tiresome kraken scenes, although generally a solid film it was a disappointment in comparison to Curse Of The Black Pearl Now, Pirates of the Caribbean, World's End. Not a lighthearted family movie. Sure, Captain Jack is in it bringing his quirky comedy but even this does little to lift the spirits of a movie that appears to be declining rapidly into depressing squalor. The action scenes are great, the special effects are nothing short of astounding, watch Barbosa's pirate ship sailing the sea at night, absolutely beautiful. The performances given by the cast is commendable but...the storyline, cringe. Whilst not a complicated plot in itself, in fact in retrospect it is a very simple plot line, however, in the film this plot line becomes weighed down by poor explanation. So little time is given to fully explaining essential plot points that the film, although long, feels rushed along at a the speed of a freight train leaping from one scenario to another and back again. Davey Jones loses all credibility as the villain of the piece, a title that Verbinski seemed adamant about passing on to Lord Beckett (Tom Hollander) but, whilst an obviously scheming character, Beckett is never really perceived as a villainous threat. What's more is that the Kraken is disposed of outside the realms of the film reel, thus making light out of the primary threat from Dead Man's Chest, one can't help but think that, although the Kraken scenes became tiresome in Dead Man's Chest, there should have been an overcoming the odds situation in which the Pirates destroyed this thing...afraid not. Instead we're treated to a washed up corpse of the Kraken on a beach having been told that **Spoiler** Jones was told to destroy the Kraken by Lord Beckett **End Spoiler** Geoffrey Rush gives another truly epic performance as Captain Barbosa, as did Johnny Depp with Captain Jack Sparrow, it's unfortunate that the film could not obtain the epic recognition that it's actors have claimed for themselves. An entertaining film with some laughs and some tears (if you're that way inclined), some astounding special effects and marvellously inventive action sequences, however, a disappointment in comparison with Pirates, Curse of the Black Pearl. An overcomplicated story with more twists than a pig's tail wasn't needed in this fantasy world, this film alienates the audience it was once aimed at, primarily children and family. The quick witted banter is toned down and a depressing mood is invested in most scenes, gone are the beautiful sandy beaches, gone is the sunshine, instead rain and whirlpools are the flavour of the day. The main theme music used in the previous instalments for the action scenes has also been replaced, in what I personally believe was a foolish move. If you're a fan of Pirates of the Caribbean then nothing I say will stop you seeing this movie, it has to be done, just... don't go in with high expectations, whilst this film doesn't seem as long as Dead Man's Chest it also fails to invest the charm of its predecessors into it's reels."

","Before watching the film I was very sceptical of whether it would be any good as I found the second film was becoming more mainstream. Boy I was surprised. The film was brilliant, some of the set - pieces in it had to be seen to be believed and I was in awe by the end. I was slightly disappointed that the tone of the film was not darker than it was , (it was dark but I found there was possibly to many comedic moments).<br/><br/>All in all it really is a brilliant conclusion to the series and in my view better than the second film but not quite as good as the first.<br/><br/>9/10"
"Lemstim","10","139","290","23 May 2007"," Wow! Just wow...
","This movie was by far the best from the trilogy! I left the house this evening, with little hope. The second POC sucked, and was way too long + the story was just bad. When I came out of the cinema after 3 hours and a bit, I could not stop talking about this fresh, and very surprising movie. It is by far more violent than the prequels, and the special effects are way more impressive. <br/><br/>Jack Sparrow as usual amazing, but he did not have to ""carry"" this movie as much as the other two. Outstanding acting from all the cast, especially Tia Dalma, Barbossa and Keira. And You have got to LOVE that monkey!<br/><br/>A million times better than Spieder Man 3, so go watch it! NOW!"

","No matter what you hear from critics or people who don't like sitting in a theater chair for 3 hours, Despite its long running time of 168 minutes, this film has everything you could want in a movie. Action, Adventure, romance, humor, and lest we forget the Enormous Maelstrom Battle! This movie is Curse of the Black Pearl and Dead Man's Chest combined into one enormous movie, with some Chinese thrown in there for the audience. The ending is spectacular, and if you didn't like Dead Man's Chest, you will still love this movie! It has many Hilarious sequences! For example, After the pirates win the war with the East India Trading Company, all the pirates are throwing their hats in the air. Surprisingly, this is what Jack says - ""Mr.Gibbs, you may throw my hat if you like."" So after Gibbs throws his hat and it hits the ground, Jack remarks ""Now, Go get it back."" :) Hilarious! Trust me, This movie is one you will not want to miss. You will not be disappointed - count on that!"
"soxlade","4","59","116","23 May 2007"," Confusing and muddled third part loses its sense of fun
","Saw a spanking digital print of Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End last night and I came away puzzled, confused and disappointed. The entire franchise, which was heading for the rocks with middle sequel Dead Man's Chest, has finally sunk to the bottom with this third installment. <br/><br/>Firstly, the plot. Well, I'm not entirely sure there was one amongst the crosses, double crosses and triple crosses that pretty much every character inflicts on every other character. Add in occult mystics, a goddess of the sea, a love struck villain (aha motivation! - oh no, it's another double cross), pirate councils, nine pieces of eight (huh?), hundreds of crabs, four lead ships, three separate crews, a wedding, several battles/swordfights and you can't complain that Pirates 3 doesn't offer lot for your entry fee. It's just a shame that it doesn't make any actual sense. <br/><br/>The trouble is that every now and again, almost hidden beneath tons of turgid exposition dialogue, bizarre hallucination sequences, and loud, confusing action, lie some real gems of comedy - mostly involving Depp and Kevin McNally. Keith Richards is also excellent, though his scenes are much less fun than they should have been. Geoffrey Rush as Barbossa is still a fun character and the two pirates Mackenzie Crook and Lee Arenberg have much more to do than in the second movie and are a good watch. In virtually every scene is Knightley, who does a good job of developing Elizabeth Swann and actually acts a couple of times, but basically spends her time looking extremely pretty. <br/><br/>However Chow Yun Fat, Orlando Bloom and Tom Hollander are bland, dull characters who are paper thin. Biggest crime of the two sequels is the treatment of Jack Davenport's character Norrington, who could have been interesting to watch develop, but was abandoned in favour of Hollander's. <br/><br/>Ultimately the characters, the plot, the script and the fun are all overwhelmed by the (admittedly fantastic) CGI. Though Depp pretty much saves every scene he's in, he can't save the full three hours. Pirates 3 has its moments, and at times is really great fun, but it is too long, too confusing, and too dull to be really worth the price of admission - though I suppose a feeling of being robbed could add to the pirate experience. <br/><br/>Shame."

","Changing their loyalties in blink of an eye yet being kind hearted at the same time this is exactly why we all love Pirates of Caribbean. The third part is finally out with lots of surprises. The story takes off exactly from where it was left with everybody trying to rescue Jack and he being locked in Davy Jones locker. The story matures at a quick pace and takes very piraty turns (unusual).The action sequences are great, so are special effects. The director has controlled everything superbly, hats off to him. Johnny Depp once again outshines everybody as Jack Sparrow but others were great too especially Geoffrey as Barbosa and Orlando as Will Turner. Orlando Bloom this time paints the perfect picture of a man caught in the war of his own emotions. On one hand is his determination to save his father from the clutches oops tentacles of Davy Jones and on other hand the looming terror that he has lost his love to Jack Sparrow. Special appearance of Keith Richard was a true delight. All in all the film is total fun to watch.<br/><br/>The ending of the film is not happily ever after so I am ""KEEPING AN EYE ON HORIZON"" for more coz ""YO HO YO HO A PIRATES LIFE FOR ME""."

","I am voting 10/10 because this movie was, while flawed, simply amazing. Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End does have its flaws... Firstly, it is so long it'll make your but go blue... they could have trimmed the script a bit. Secondly, once again there are too many plots... this movie, like Dead Man's Chest, does not have the simple brilliance that Curse of the Black Pearl had. However, the positive points rather...I guess overshadow the flaws I guess, so it's all good [= Characters really develop in this movie, and Orlando Bloom really grew as an actor. Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) learns to bargain and keep his cool [ Tea party scene, etc. ] and overall, matures greatly. Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) is as great as always, and Depp does a fantastic job portraying all those different personalities while Jack is hallucinating. And Hector Barbossa (Geoffery Rush) was... possibly just as good as Captain Jack. He was amusing, pirate-y, and overall a great add to the movie, and those scenes with him bickering with Jack were awesome and added much comic relief. All the minor characters were generally great as well. Davy Jones (Bill Nighy) is less inhuman and Pirates 3 shows that he does indeed have emotions and had once loved Calypso. But since he has no heart... well, you end up feeling pretty sorry for him which is great. Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander) is great as well, being the evil midget of snark every movie needs. His death was probably the best one in the entire movie (which is kinda sad I guess, that we have enough deaths to say which one was 'the best'), being resigned to his fate and not dying the way typical villains do. Kudos to Ted & Terry. Yes, there are too many deaths in this movie. I was disappointed in how much they trimmed down James Norrington (Jack Davenport) and just killed him off in a way that was really unsatisfying. Ted & Terry, in my opinion, abused Bootstrap Bill's character having him just be this tool to add drama and not really a character. However, I heard that Jack Davenport had not agreed to do a fourth so maybe that was it, but you didn't hear that from me. Overall, this film was great fun and while it does not beat the classic Curse of the Black Pearl, it gives the amazing trilogy a truly grand finale (and definitely beats the second)."

","The last thirty minutes of Pirates of the Caribbean 3 feature plenty of swashbuckling adventure and a few brave surprises. Sadly, what precedes them isn't always as thrilling. <br/><br/>Will (Orlando Bloom), Elizabeth (Keira Knightley) and ex-villain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) attempt to locate Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), while Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander) controls the Flying Dutchman's captain Davy Jones (Bill Nighy) and his monstrous crew.<br/><br/>Within the first two hours there are droll moments, but also a terrifying amount of bloat: lots of scenes should not have made it past the editing room. See, for example, the hallucination with the multiple Jacks, an interminable piece of slapstick which goes on and on. The whole movie needed a good trimming; director Verbinski has many qualities, but brevity isn't one of them. <br/><br/>Knightley is a firecracker as usual; Bloom is still a bland actor, but his Will has grown into a darker, more interesting character. The great Bill Nighy brings pathos and a delighted wickedness to the role of Davy Jones. Depp and Rush have fun hamming it up.<br/><br/>The Black Pearl is still the best of the trilogy by a (nautical) mile, but this final chapter surpasses the second (which was a bloated mess) and offers enough exciting set-pieces to make it watchable.<br/><br/>6/10"

","After the tragedy that was Dead Man's Chest I wasn't very hopeful for this instalment either. You know what? I had reasons to be. There are the obvious gripes that it was too drawn out and long but the basic flaws are as follows:<br/><br/>TOO MANY CHARACTERS: Oh look, some new pirate lords we're introduced to. One from France, Spain, India, China, Singapore and Africa. That's great we'll get some interesting banter between them all and they'll be essential to the plot. WRONG. Curiously in the last battle, NONE of these lords do anything but watch! If you're going to bring these characters in, at least give them something to do! <br/><br/>MESSY SCRIPTWRITING: So Will suddenly betrays everyone, just for a chance to save his father, despite the fact he loves Elizabeth...hmmm...I'm sure there's something missing there. Comically Tia Dalma turns into a 50 ft Giant which is something we haven't seen since the the beginning of the 20th Century in B movies. Then she explodes into millions of crabs...why? What does that symbolise? Furthermore, then she doesn't appear at all for the rest of the movie....I was left struggling to comprehend why they bothered in the first place if she was just going to disappear from the film all together...It would have been so much better if she'd taken Davy Jones' body away but hey, that's Hollywood. Sao Feng thinks Elizabeth was Calypso. Was that ever explained? Was it just a ploy to bring her on the ship so he could do wicked things to her? We're never told and then suddenly, everyone seems to know that it's Tia Dalma who's Calypso....what?! The Kraken is mysteriously dead, we're never told how or why. Certainly it's a chilling image but did it have to be killed? Who gave the order? How did they defeat such a massive beast? Nobody knows. The cream of the crop for unbelievability though is how the dog carrying the keys managed to escape from the cannibal island....it just wouldn't happen! I also have another gripe with Ragetti asking why Tia couldn't bring Jack back if she brought Barbossa back. It's like the writers sat down and said, 'we know we messed up in the first movie with that ending but how do we convey it to the audience? I know! Let's just tell them because they'll never figure it out for themselves!'<br/><br/>LACK OF HUMOUR: 1)How many times do we have to listen to that grating joke about sea turtles?! 2) Too many rum jokes. It's only funny if you're actually drinking rum.<br/><br/>I do have to admit that Jack the monkey stole the show though and some of Jack's one liners did provoke a snigger but the film is just too serious for it's own good. Hello? This is Disney!<br/><br/>ACTING: First I shall commend some actors for their fine performances, Geoffrey Rush, Johnny Depp and Jack Davenport. Hats off to you. The rest of them were terrible, shoddy and excruciating.<br/><br/>Visually stunning but as engaging as having a paint watching tournament."
"megahip42","10","12","19","3 June 2007"," A must see for everyone!
","I was amazed by Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End. That might be because much of what I loved about the first film was back in this one, after taking a brief hiatus in the second one. For example, the huge battles that don't involve weird squid-like creatures; the somewhat risqué humor (during the scene with the telescopes, my friend leaned over to me and said ""That was subtle""); the sense that Jack Sparrow might be either completely brilliant or completely insane, it's impossible to tell which. Not to mention the ending, which was what I expected in a completely odd way (yes, Will and Elizabeth were going to get together, but to be married . . . during an epic battle . . . by Barbossa of all people . . . and then not able to see each other except once every ten years?!?!?) but not exactly what I was hoping for. (Never would have worked between you? What do you call this, wedded bliss?) Anyway, my wishes aside, this was an excellent movie. Even the most minor of characters gave an stellar performance, and the special effects were literally out of this world. My favorite had to be the ship turning upside down, although the whirlpool and the waterfall were very cool, and the multiple Jacks did not disappoint. It was one of the best finales to a trilogy I've seen, though eventually I'll realize it wasn't that great and the first one will always be the best. (That's what happened with Lord of the Rings, after all.)"

The first one wasn't a ""good"" film by any stretch of the imagination, but it was entertainment and well heck, there really aren't any other pirate films to compare it to. After making a bazillion dollars, they decided a trilogy was somehow needed and they have the actor who could sell used condoms in it, so why not?

","The third (hopefully final) film for Pirates of the Caribbean will attempt to be everything fans would hope for in a concluding trilogy, attempt being the key word here. Short of the few odd adult males attending in full pirate gear though, I am pretty sure most viewers ended up feeling At World's End's excessive running time. Appeasing die-hard fans (apparently there are more then we think) of the franchise to an exhausting degree, the film lumbers back and forth between various back-stabbings and double-crossings going on in Jack Sparrow's crew, all to tediously apathetic results. Likewise, the unnecessarily dense script tries too earnestly to explain all the hackneyed mythology brought up in the first two films and instead makes viewers care even less.<br/><br/>As as result, At World's End is not nearly as pleasurable as the first two's narrative arc would indicate. Bogged down by the detail-oriented plot, casual moviegoers will hardly get most details introduced previously in the series, let alone retain interest in these relatively obscure elements. It seems as if scribes Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio (both having written all three), realized the huge phenomenon Pirates had become, and spent their last screenplay vainly trying to justify all of the minor plot devices they thought viewers were interested in. They overvalued the specifics of this plot and in turn robbed the film of the one thing everybody loves; personality. Instead of letting characters breathe a little more on screen to make a lasting impression, At World's End spends a three hour run time ensuring viewers that every trite plot element from all three films will be given adequate closure.<br/><br/>Faulting the cast and crew would be wrong; At World's End continues the impeccable production values and credible performances that initially set this ship off into our collective wallets. Here though, the over-bloated script just makes the over-boated set design even more frustrating. Once the film's obnoxiously extended and over-the-top finale is underway, the excitement leading up to that perilous showdown has all but been extinguished. The film will still do well in theaters and rightfully so; there is enough big-budget mayhem intercut throughout the epic bore to ensure seats will be filled. But Pirates 3 will remain in my eyes a quintessential warning to all potential popcorn franchises as to not take themselves too seriously, despite any success hinting to the contrary."
"sven-goran-lindqvist","10","18","31","24 May 2007"," Don't listen to the critics,this is a GREAT movie!!!
","Just like Spider-Man 3,Pirates 3 isn't getting good reviews.And I think that just like S-M 3 the criticism is wrong.At world's end is even better than spider-man 3,it has everything:action,humor,romance,amazing special effects and really great characters.The opening scenes of the film is very dark,overall I think that this one is far more scary and darker than the other two.It takes a while until good old Jack enters the stage and although his entrance in this one isn't as spectacular as the ones before,it's still pretty funny.And Jhonny Depp,yet again,steels the whole show as MR.Sparrow.Some really great scenes with captain Jack takes place inside Davy Jone's locker,those scenes are really weird but very cool.Orlando Bloom's Will Turner shows up a new side in of himself in this one and he is much more interesting and cooler in this flick than in the previous ones.Keira Knightley is not as annoying in this one as she was in dead man's chest,Knightley's Elizabeth has some really heartbreaking and beautiful scenes with Will.But the main reason why I think this on is better than the second is because of the comeback of Captain Barbossa,brilliantly played by Geoffrey Rush.He and Depp have a really good chemistry.The rest of the cast is good and Keith Richards does a wonderful cameo.The special effects is even better than those in DMC and the final battle is amazing.The ending is very good although it's a bit sad.And it sort of leaves a door open if they would like to do a 4th one.And stay after the credits for an awesome ""extra"" scene.Final verdict:A great movie,better than the second but not quite as good as the first one."
"DonFishies","7","16","27","25 May 2007"," More enjoyable than I imagined, but still not as fun as the first film
","As much as I was hyped up for it last summer, I am still in disbelief over how disappointed I was when I saw Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest. I had bought advanced tickets, was in a packed and cheering theatre, and still managed to fall asleep from boredom. It was so disheartening, but I still enjoyed it for the most part. Unfortunately, on repeat viewings, I cannot say I have been so generous, but nonetheless, looked forward to the next film, At World's End anyway. And while it does the job a lot better than Chest, I cannot help but think that they really dropped the ball hard after the first film.<br/><br/>End picks up a short while after Chest with Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley), and the rest of the usual crew in Singapore. They meet with the revered pirate lord Sao Feng (Chow Yun-Fat), in an attempt to acquire the maps to Davy Jones' locker, where they hope to rescue Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp). Meanwhile, Lord Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander) is planning the extinction of all pirates, and is using Davy Jones himself (Bill Nighy) to help with the job.<br/><br/>Of course, anyone who has seen the trailer or know anything about the movie can predict what comes from here, and sadly, this is where the film loses a lot of steam. Running just short of three hours, the film packs a lot in, and pads a lot of itself out. Whereas Chest was just a whole lot of build up to nothing, End does build to something, but that something just does not feel as well planned out as it wants to be. Through all of the action, double, triple and quadruple crossings, and all of the laughs, the film just feels very drawn out for no reason but to stretch itself out longer. With the number one complaint of the series thus far being the length of the films, you would have thought a real editor would have come along and chopped out the useless stuff and left just the meaty bits. But unfortunately, this is not the case, and yet again, the viewer has to sift through a vast amount of material where a lot of nonsensical drivel (like numerous useless scenes featuring copies of Jack Sparrow) overtakes actually useful elements.<br/><br/>Where the film does do much better than Chest, is in its focus. While the latter was jumping all over the place, this film actually stays on course for the most part. It is a lot easier to follow, and despite some of the already listed issues, feels like a stronger film. But this comes at the price of basically throwing out almost everything that Chest brought to the franchise. All of those numerous subplots? Only a few are answered, and are answered in such simplistic fashion that they should not have even been questions in the first place. All the ones that are not? They are basically left to rot, and in a way, make Chest feel like a totally useless experience minus the final five minutes. It feels like a total cheat, and while it does not effect this film (in fact, it really enriches what is here), it totally kills anything the previous film had left going for it.<br/><br/>And with the subplots getting underused, so too are the new characters. The mysterious Tia Dalma (Naomie Harris) does next to nothing, and when the big reveal as to the purpose of her character comes, she ends up feeling like a waste of time (if you can even understand what she is saying). Much the same goes for 'Bootstrap' Bill Turner (Stellan Skarsgård), Hollander's Cutler Beckett, and Yun-Fat's Sao Feng. They clearly had something to offer the last film (and Yun-Fat in this film), but here, do a few things, and then not much else. Even the astonishing performance from Nighy as Davy Jones is neglected here, taking away much of what made him such a great character in Chest. Even older characters like Jack Davenport's Norrington and Jonathan Pryce's Governor Swann are pointless, as they get next to no screen time at all.<br/><br/>Thankfully, Depp is even better than he was in Chest. He feels a bit overshadowed again, but his role is still as amusing and often bizarre as ever. At least here he actually seems like he is trying to do something new, instead of just aping his original performance. Bloom and Knightley are strong, and much more independent this go around, adding a great deal of needed emotion to their roles. Rush however, comes out on top of everyone. His over-the-top performance of Barbossa proves to be exactly what Chest was sorely missing. He steals every scene he is in, and breathes new life into the demented character. The rest of the crew, in all of their tiny roles, all help with some much needed humour to help liven up how dark it becomes at times (as a small cameo by a very make-up heavy Keith Richards).<br/><br/>But for all of what it does so much better (the special effects are just as great in this film, looking rather breathtaking in some sequences), the film still does not capture the fun and greatness of the first film. Yes, there is the humour and the action, but it just feels forced. It never feels as genuine or as well captured as it was in the first film (in fact, it teeters on passing ridiculous and becoming absurd, in a bad way). While the first one may have been thought of as a throw away at first, these films just stink of being pumped out just to capitalize on a wildly random success. It may be enjoyable, but for anyone looking for anything but an explanation for how shoddy Chest was, you will be looking in the wrong place.<br/><br/>7.5/10."

"childliketendencies","10","22","40","30 May 2007"," Great adventure - a wonderful end to the trilogy!
","It's fascinating to read through other comments and notice that the majority of people commenting seem to either really hate or really love the movie, with very few voices in between.<br/><br/>It's really quite easy: This is a Disney movie. Movies as a whole don't stick to the truth, not even those which claim they're telling a true story. You don't go into a Disney movie expecting to hear a true story (unless your grip on reality is severely weak to nonexistent), but you look for enchantment, for lurid characters, for great laughs, for something that gives you a tingly feeling of compassion or excitement... for getting transported into a different world where anything is possible.<br/><br/>That of the three POTC movies the first one only managed to touch upon any kind of truth about the real pirates of the Caribbean isles and pirate life in general, should be obvious now. It provided a humorous and exciting introduction to the characters and locations. It was tepid amusement with a pirate overtone and some inspired acting. Fun for the whole family. One doesn't need to think, just be able to laugh and be carried away with the story.<br/><br/>The second movie was a bit more convoluted. It introduced some new characters, some new locations, and provided the main characters with an opportunity to flesh out their own story, to add some depth. It was at times a little boring, not because of its plot, but simply because it seemed to add some superfluous story lines (the cannibals).<br/><br/>At World's End brought all those characters together, and showed the necessary continuance of their character development. Elizabeth had been the adventurous heroine drawn to a charming rogue, then had the ground pulled out from under her feet and became a fugitive and something of a pirate herself. The side she had been on turned into the enemy, and she had to make do with what was left to her, to survive. She never was the quiet withdrawn type - she's crafty and courageous, and that turned her into what she became in the third movie. The same goes for Will, who had only been fighting for his love, to find that on shaky ground. He came face to face with his father who had abandoned him, and since he thought his love had left him, he shifted his ambitions to the rescue of his father. Similarly, everyone else in the movie are following their own ambitions in whichever way they can - so what we get are plots and subplots, everyone crossing everyone else, in a wonderfully crazy way. Throw in some myths turned flesh (Davy Jones and Calypso) and the ruthlessness of the East India Trading Company's designs, and you've got 3 hours of fun.<br/><br/>This isn't a movie for people who just want easy action, and it's definitely not a kids movie. Some of the plots and jokes are extremely subtle. The movie takes some of the lose ends of the previous two movies, adds some more - and manages to solve most of them. It also leaves some others open to speculation and possibly more movies to follow. The best way to watch this movie is to sit back and simply keep an open mind, expect the unexpected. The writers took some amazing leaps of faith in their actors, and made some unusual choices. The idea that Jack being banned to Davy Jones' locker would mean he'd have to captain a Black Pearl full of alternate versions of himself, and even when returned to life he would retain some of this unstable mindset - that was a stroke of genius added to the movie (Leaves the question whether whatever happened in the movie after the ""rescue"" of Jack couldn't also be interpreted as just part of his own ""imagination"").<br/><br/>Even Davy Jones and Calypso - their characters suddenly had more depth, because there were a hundred little clues and some interaction between them that told us a lot to make their story the darker side of the parallel one to Will and Elisabeth.<br/><br/>The action sequences were fantastical - great fantasy. They kept you breathless and wanting more - and you never knew quite how a certain situation would end. Maybe that's one of the other advantages to the movie: the plot was never completely predictable like so many other movies have been recently.<br/><br/>I think you have to have a bit of imagination, you've got to have an open mind and you've got to be willing to accept that this isn't standard Disney fare complete with happy ending.<br/><br/>I can understand why some think it's a waste of time and money, but to me it was one of the most enjoyable movies in recent times. And a truly superb finale to the trilogy."
"amblin53","1","7","10","15 June 2007"," What the?
","Why are they making more Pirates of the Caribbean movies? There is no point to them. When I saw the first movie I thought that they did a great job with the story, especially Captain Jack's character. But when I saw the second one, at first I liked it, but when I saw it again it was horrible and made no sense. I am not trying to put the people who work on the Pirates of the Caribbean movies down but they are not really caring about putting a story with a beginning, middle, and end in the movies. All it is, is a bunch of action scenes put together to sell to people who pay to see the movies. In my opinion they should stop making the Pirate trilogy movies and find another story to make a movie out of it."

Hans Zimmer once again supply the musical scores, and they leave nothing to the imagination, making a good film great. Geoffrey Rush played only a small part in Dead Man's Chest, but his role as Barbosa doesn't die there, his presence in this film create a comical rivalry between his character and Jack Sparrow.

","Many people disliked Dead Man's Chest, not me as I personally found it even better than the original, but a lot of people did complain it was overlong, confusing and not interesting. The initially negative reviews of At World's End had however, started to take its toll on me, I began to fear I was letting myself in for a huge letdown. What an absolute relief it is to say that At World's End is not only a great successor to the past two Pirates movie, but also a movie that I might eventually be able to consider the best in the series! Its an action packed, story stuffed, character motivated piece of cinema, it won't win Oscars (well apart from for Effects) but it know that. The biggest misunderstanding people have about the Pirates series is that it is aware its not the most amazing series ever. Its a series designed for pure popcorn entertainment. It doesn't bother being artsy fartsy, it just tells a damn good story with plenty of swash-buckle and comedy as well. Its a mixture of genres that makes this series work, and At World's End manages to masterfully pull it off again. Although I shall confess that the movie is a lot darker than the previous two entries, a fact made noticeably by the surprisingly nasty opening. Anyway At World's End is a truly brilliant movie, and the first great Blockbuster of the Summer so far.<br/><br/>The characters of this movie have really developed now. And the cast itself have become so perfect in the roles. Johnny Depp once again is absolutely brilliant, he is the best pirate there has ever been in a movie. I suppose one moan from Dead Man's Chest is that Sparrow was often used purely for comedic effect. He was still absolutely brilliant, but he became a bit of a clown. Here he is much more as he was in Curse of the Black Pearl. He's clearly a genius, he's still absolutely barking mad, but the man is as clever and witty as ever. In Dead Man's Chest he showed this talent rarely, here he shows it all the time. Some of the best sequences of this movie have to be the ones in Davey Jones Locker, I won't spoil the sequence for anyone but that scene is hilarious and so odd it was amazing. One person who surprised me most in this movie was Keira Knightly, I've always found her passable in these movies, but never amazing. Here she does absolutely brilliant, I suppose its her character who has been on the biggest journey since the original movie. Her character is now fifty times better, her scenes towards the end are very well acted. Orlando Bloom has improved, his character seems wasted at some points in the movie, but towards the end I also realised how well he was actually doing. I was glad to see Geoffrey Rush back as Captain Barbossa, so many people have overlooked him in the original movie. Here he is almost as brilliant as Johnny Depp. Bill Nighy continues to be a menacing villain as Davey Jones, except here he has some genuine character moments that worked well. Oh hell the cast were perfect, no one lets the side down at all. The inclusion of Chow Yun Fat is a brilliant one, but my moan is that Jack Davenport features too little as Norrington. A shame as his character was perfect in Dead Man's Chest.<br/><br/>The action sequences also impress mightily in this movie. The end action sequence will blow you away, its hinted at in the trailer, but you will never understand how amazing it is until you watch it. I won't go on too much about that since its best you see it for yourself. Instead I will talk about the opening sequence, yes it is reminiscent of the Jabba the Hutt sequence from Return of the Jedi, but its well done. For sequence not featuring Jack Sparrow it still stands out as one of the highlights in the movie. Some people might moan there is a lack of action until the finale, but its this lack of action that still manages to impress. The talkey sequences the critics have complained about are never, ever dull. The Davey Jones Locker sequence is priceless, Beckett's mission to exterminate the pirates is engaging, all the back stabbings entertain, and everything just pieces together nicely. Its been well planned out and the movie shows this. The plot concludes perfectly here, there is a little bit after the credits that adds another layer to it, its not necessary to stay and watch it but I would recommend it. So any negatives then? Well one might argue that the movie is a bit long at nearly three hours, others might moan about the dialogue not being the most incredible stuff in the entire world. My response to people who moan about stuff like that is that they would never have liked the movie anyway if they went in looking for flaws like that. This movie has flaws, but the epics scale, the humour and the action overshadow the flaws. This is a perfect ending for an almost perfect series. I'm certain we'll be seeing Pirates of the Caribbean 4 some time in the future, but if they did end it here then they will have gone out with a huge bang rather than a whimper like a lot of other series."

There are a few exceptions of course (LOTR), but with Pirates 3 I wasn't expecting much but no matter how much money you throw on crap, it is still crap: Plot - It was confusing because there were too many subplots. By the end I didn't care who lived or died (maybe they should have waited until they did a second draft before they started filming. The audience wanted Jack to be happy (maybe the writers should have made him captain of the Flying Dutchman?) Children getting hung on the gallows at the beginning? The explanation wasn't enough to warrant a scene. Why do we need to have the dog come back. Wasn't he on Cannibal Island? Let me guess he managed to escape from the cannibals and swim hundreds to thousands of miles. Enough with Jack the the undead monkey! CGI - I'm a little old school when it comes to CGI. I think there is too much of it in the cinema and most of the CGI in this film was useless. I don't mind what was put in the first 2, but what's with Calypso turning into the fifty-foot woman who then transforms into a ton of crabs? Oooh CGI neat! We have ships going down the vortex shooting cannons at each other while an armada of pirates and British vessels wait while a few ships duke it out? I guess they CGI geeks spent so much time on the tidy bowl battle that they forgot that they could have a full naval battle. Also, the lead ship for East India Trading Co./British Navy goes down so the pirates win and the rest of you can go home. That should have insulted everyone in the UK. The British ruled their empire with their navy.<br/><br/>Too Long - Actually this one was 168 minutes too long.<br/><br/>Don't waste your money like we did and watch this drivel.

","Who would've thought that a Jerry Bruckheimer film production of a Walt Disney theme park ride would end up being the most consistently entertaining and subversive film franchise of recent memory? Director Gore Verbinski and the bloated cast headed up by a hilarious Johnny Depp are all back for the rollicking ""closing"" of the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" trilogy.<br/><br/>Following the mantra of its predecessor (bigger, better, more), everything here attempts to one-up what has been seen before. With the exception of the sight gags (which are smaller and more plentiful in ""At World's End"" but nothing like the mind-boggling giant wheel or log-rolling scenes from ""Dead Man's Chest""), everything else is more, more, more. There's more characters (most notably Chow Yun Fat as the leader of a Singapore pirate gang), more plot (the double-crossings are so numerous as to make your head spin), more elaborate and wildly imaginative action set pieces and special effects (the boat flipping scene is especially good), more monkey and midget action, more jokes, more cameos (witness a seemingly un-made-up Keith Richards as Captain Teague), and most thankfully more macabre gallows humor and absurdity.<br/><br/>Gore Verbinski has become a master of the modern action-adventure movie, finely tuning his skills here to rival an early era Steven Spielberg in his sense of visual scope. With these three films he is now an expert in the cadence of integrating computer effects with massive live stunts across sprawling set pieces. He truly deserves accolades for managing to get every character in on the action in the dazzling climactic battle between the Black Pearl and the Flying Dutchman in the middle of a giant maelstrom. There's also one amazing scene of the British Captain going down with his ship as it is cannon-balled into oblivion that in a more serious film would seem quite epic, but in the refreshing silliness of this series is just one more over-the-top element subverting the traditional tone of the Hollywood spectacle.<br/><br/>""At World's End"" provides more fun bang for your buck than any ""third"" in a series since ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade."" It made me feel like a kid again, but being so insanely indebted to the concept of ""MORE"" imagining the series continuing into a fourth installment would be truly gluttonous."

","I would've liked to give this film a higher rating, I can't say that it was disappointing but at the same time I didn't think it was all it could be. Maybe my expectations were too high, maybe I wasn't really in the mood to see it, maybe it was the fact that I finished about a litre of coke 15 minutes in, but I had trouble sitting through some bits of this film. The abstract whiteness of the afterlife (or Jack's afterlife), the strange rocks that turned into crabs, the fact that Calypso's power seemed to be limited to a whirlpool and a bit of rain after all the buildup... just didn't really grab me. I think it was just an excuse for some fancy special effects. It was overly long, and the ending was predictable too.<br/><br/>Marks for the acting, Depp and Rush are fantastic, and the last half hour is fun to say the least, but for me it didn't have the charm and the character of the first film."

"Monotreme02","4","9","14","2 June 2007"," Great fun but the script is a travesty
","These movies are silly. It's not a criticism, just a fact. They are silly and goofy and light. They utilize juvenile humour, harebrained gags and far-fetched scenarios and ideas. And the films are completely dripping with clichés and kitsch, especially the third installment. But all these elements  which I would consider glaring flaws in any other film  are forgiven simply because I wouldn't expect anything different from this genre. The key is that the trilogy never takes itself seriously. It basically announced, right off the top from the first film, that it would be a silly, light, wacky, action-packed action-adventure-comedy. So you're actually looking for the silliness, the lame gags, the juvenile humour. This is not a movie I would expect deep character development from, or even basic movie logic. I expect to have a swashbuckling, action-packed, light, entertaining and just plain fun and enjoyable time at the cinema when I see this  nothing more, nothing less.<br/><br/>In most fields, At World's End delivers unquestionably. It contains action scenes and set pieces that completely dwarf those in the first two installments. The final showdown is worth the admission price alone. Because of the film's nature and edifice, which may be the loosest and broadest of any film, the creative team can essentially do whatever comes to their tremendously creative minds  in all the fields. Indeed just thinking of and constructing these set pieces requires an immense sense of creativity and a complete disregard of logic or physics.<br/><br/>In actuality, the Pirates of the Caribbean films are a dream come true for the creative fields of film-making. Production designers and costume designers essentially have total and utter freedom; because the film is set in a pseudo-fantasy period setting, they basically can design whatever wacky ideas come to mind. Indeed the production and costume design in this film is second to none, completely incomparable and totally unconventional, but looks absolutely fantastic and is wildly creative. The designs of the Singapore city and especially of the Shipwreck Cove construct  entirely made of wrecked ships all stacked and piled up into these massive towers  are astonishing and dazzling. The same can be said of the costume design, which is just fantastic and incredibly imaginative.<br/><br/>The film is also a complete masterwork in the technical fields, especially in the special effects sphere. The filmmakers spared no expense and hired the best effects team Industrial Light & Magic had to offer  and the result is more than obvious on screen. The practical and model effects are almost as impressive as the mind-blowing, completely unbelievable CGI work, which just looks completely realistic, absolutely convincing and is integrated perfectly into the actual footage more so than any other movie of this type in recent years. Even Spider-Man 3 had some dodgy and unconvincing CGI work  Sony's mistake was insisting on creating their own effects instead of hiring an external (and more experienced and professional) company to deliver the high-expectation goods. Well, At World's End more than delivers in this department, so much so that the effects that were so mind-blowing in the second installment, Dead Man's Chest (namely the fish-pirates and Davey Jones himself) are almost taken for granted in this film. If you think about it, these creations are nothing short of astonishing, but they're just so convincing and realistic, you don't even think about it. And that is the biggest and primary sign of good CGI work.<br/><br/>That said, the film has one glaring flaw that really hampers the entire experience: the script. This is the usual result of starting to shoot a movie without a finished script, but the story just feels and unfolds as if it were made up as they went along, instead of actually planned ahead of time  even more so than Dead Man's Chest, which also suffered from this problem. But At World's End is so confusing and awkward, it makes the plot in Dead Man's Chest seem actually quite logical and clear. The film essentially has one basic story element: the pirates of the world are facing extinction and band together for one final showdown against the armada of the East India Trading Company. The problem is that everything leading up to this showdown is so unbelievably confusing; it's surprising to learn that only two screenwriters worked on the script. I didn't even bother trying to follow after a while, but I'm sure that if I had I would notice glaringly wide plot holes, and that most of the characters' motives have absolutely no continuity whatsoever. For instance  considering the new information we discover about Tia Dalma in At World's End, one begins to wonder why, at the end of Dead Man's Chest, she volunteered to help the gang rescue Jack Sparrow in the first place? Indeed this is a major problem in the film, not only because it's absolutely impossible to follow or understand just what is going on at any given moment, but also because it is so unbelievably easy to create a story that makes sense. They managed to do so in the first film, and I think that a little more ironing on the creases in this screenplay and they could have reached something truly excellent. Because the general concept is great; it's just everything in-between that makes no sense whatsoever.<br/><br/>Despite this, the film does have some moments where it truly shines, and one scene in particular involving a certain cameo everyone had been talking about since the first film is worth all the confusion that is the film's plot and the frustration in trying to understand it and organize it in your head. Combine these immaculate scenes with the great set pieces, action sequences and amazing technical and creative work, and one is almost ready to forgive the total travesty that is the script. Almost."

","The trivia section states that they started filming this before a script was completed, and boy does it show! It appears in order to come up with a script they got 5 twelve year old boys with hyperactivity ADD who wrote scripts independently of each other and had them randomly spliced together for the final script. <br/><br/>The result was gobsmackingly incoherent. Random and contrived plots popping in and then fizzling out, which isn't helped by the terrible acting. Orlando Bloom, and Keira Knightly were so wooden I got splinters. Keira's method of acting seems to be reading from an autocue and then pouting. <br/><br/>However there are some great special effects; but who is impressed by special effects anymore?<br/><br/>A good liar will keep talking but say nothing, and this is exactly what this film does.

I had not read any reviews or story lines. I slept off and on through the whole movie. It was long and boring and I could not understand anything what was going on. From the beginning to the end, I stayed clueless what the story was about.<br/><br/>The special effects, costumes or masks did not impress me. The magic was definitely missing.<br/><br/>Another proof not to see anything, which is a box office success and has been hyped .

","I've seen the 2nd and 3rd P.O.C. movies on their opening days, and I won't bother to see the 4th until I've read a LOT of reviews of it. This synopsis could be subtitled ""3 hours of my life I'll never get back."" Where shall I begin? Firstly, and surprisingly to me, this is NOT a movie for children. It starts with mass hangings, including the execution of a child, and continues to multiple disturbingly violent deaths. It also contains many bits of sexual innuendo and symbolism, as well as Ragetti looking up Elizabeth Swann's dress. Secondly, there is no story here, and the only characters worthy of the name are in supporting roles. Kevin McNally as Gibbs is superb, the highlight of the film for me. Keith Richards was spot-on in his cameo, and should make more films. I admit that I found Ms. Swann's stepping up to a position of leadership toward the end to be marvelous, and showed a potential for K.K.'s character to become a genuine role model for girls, in a film industry which usually gives females the greasy end of the stick. The attempts at comic relief with the 2 doltish guards and the Pintel and Ragetti characters only emphasized to me the lack of entertainment in the rest of the film. Thirdly, special effects are fine as devices to support the telling of a story, but they should not be a SUBSTITUTE for the telling of a story. This...thing is founded upon too many curses and spells without any human interest to support them. <br/><br/>I love seafaring stories, and consequently enjoy many pirate stories. I would rather watch the black-and-white Wallace Beery/Jackie Cooper Treasure Island daily than ever watch this film again. I would also prefer Cutthroat Island, A Muppet Treasure Island, or Captain Blood. Anyone who wants to see an actual tale of the sea, not a triumph of the Disney marketing department, should run, not walk, to acquire a copy of Master and Commander. It contains no pirates, but when it come to portraying the days of wooden ships and iron men, it is the real thing."
"jonw165","6","12","20","3 June 2007"," A flawed but definite return to form for the franchise...
","The question that was probably on most peoples' minds as they queued to watch the new Pirates of the Caribbean film was a very worrying one: would the third chapter of Verbinski's trilogy be more like the first movie, with its irresistible, light-hearted blend of swashbuckling and comedy, or would it suffer from the same defects as Dead Man's Chest, with an over-complex, rambling plot and rushed direction? The answer is...well, something in between, with, I'm happy to say, a shift towards the former. True, the plot makes even less sense than ever, (and Chow Yun-Fat's much-hyped role as pirate lord Sao-Feng largely unnecessary) with its twists and turns of bargaining till it is no longer easy to remember who is allied with whom- and the various betrayals and double-crossings are still likely to make you groan rather than smile. And there is a great deal, frankly, in this film that Verbinski should not be forgiven for. The now wearied running slapstick gags. A peculiarly out-of-place, indulgent (yet undeniably beautiful) scene set in a bleached, computer-screensaver Underworld populated entirely by crabs. Pretty much everything that Orlando Bloom says or does during the film's duration.<br/><br/>But the movie comes through for us in grand style, and in this manner, riding roughshod over its many flaws, it is truly a triumph. The climactic battle, taking place on board the Pearl and the Dutchman as their crews fight in the midst of a whirlpool (thanks to the superb visual effects the scene manages to somehow be thrilling rather than ridiculous) is fittingly superb- after all, it's what the entirety of this film and Dead Man's Chest have been building up to. There are still some truly enjoyable performances amongst the cast: Depp, despite the new fad amongst critics for playing down his part, is clearly having the time of his life, as is Geoffrey Rush, equally delightful as Hector Barbossa, and getting plenty of opportunities for comic back-and-forth with his co-star. Keith Richards lurks in the background strumming guitars and rasping piratical nonsense. And, perhaps best of all, Verbinski seems to have remembered how to direct. Gone are the dodgy, panicked-looking visuals of Dead Man's Chest, replaced by some scenes of truly startling beauty. There's a surprisingly quiet moment in the film where the Pearl drifts through waters so clear that the stars reflect in them, giving it the appearance of simply floating through the night sky. That was worth the price of an entrance ticket for me alone.<br/><br/>I'd recommend the film, then: pretty much everyone in the world will go and see it regardless. But no matter how sceptical you go in, (and I will repeat that whatever your opinion of the rambling middle section, only a churl could fail to enjoy the final half-hour), it is highly likely that you will come out much as you did after watching the original film: surprised that so much time has passed so quickly, with serious doubts to raise, certainly, but at the same time feeling a little thrilled, a little exhilarated from the experience."
"bmoredlj","9","10","16","1 June 2007"," That nose...
","Yes, the reviews are mixed, and yes, it's perhaps not as pure as the first one, but I've waited a year for the Pirates story to continue and I wasn't disappointed. In fact, I'd give ""At World's End"" 9 stars, being every bit as entertaining as it was often overwhelming.<br/><br/>It's quite an age we live in that visual effects have become so believable, as long as they're done correctly. Pirates 3 is no exception, it looks and **sounds** absolutely fantastic and makes it a superbly thrilling jaunt to view on the big screen with the big speakers.<br/><br/>I braved Towson Commons to see it. Towson Commons has a bathroom with an inch of urine, a carpet eternally soaked in popcorn topping and coke, no legroom, often forgets to turn out the lights, and usually hosts people who wave their glowing camera-phones around or converse with characters on the screen as if they could hear them. (I saw it again tonight at the Senator. It stood up quite well to a second viewing, especially since there's so much to take in.) But I'll tell you something: this new Pirates film sucked me in so far, I forgot what theater I was in, and for a moment, that I was even in a theater, but in Davy Jone's Locker. ""2001″ is clearly an inspiration in Jack's purgatory, which isn't a bad thing. There's a later scene that pays homage to ""Once Upon a Time in the West."" Very nice.<br/><br/>The quirks of Sparrow's character are often amplified to ridiculousness, yet still stays absolutely true to the character. Depp deserves another Oscar nomination for his performance here, which in the trilogy as a whole has to go down as one of the finest comedic roles ever undertaken.<br/><br/>The cinematography, production design, music, story continuity, and huge cast of characters who all work perfectly in concert with one another to create an engrossing escapade. That, and the pacing is excellent...this is a long movie but is so jam packed with forward-moving story and spectacle that you dread having to dip out to visit the men's room and even wish many of the story lines were continued a little further. Hopefully the DVD will have some deleted scenes of interest.<br/><br/>I enjoyed this movie more than Spider-Man-3, while also offering a far grander scale of wonder and adventure To be fair, Spider-Man basically stayed on Manhattan island for the whole three hours, which is nice and all, I've just seen new york before. I know it exists. I haven't seen the (geographic) end of the world, or have any idea what ""Davy Jone's Locker"" looks like...now I know. This movie has a lot of creativity, and isn't afraid to do a lot of weird, almost art-house-y stuff.<br/><br/>I also enjoyed all of the new characters and the development of the familiar ones - too many to mention - especially Chow's character. This is a dedicated actor who you can tell just by watching him that he is having a gas, while simultaneously totally believing he's a pirate lord (well, not totally, but well enough.) And then there's Captain Teague...well, he must be seen - not described. Please, don't listen to the critics who panned it or the people who were too lazy to follow the plot or connect the dots. This is what summer entertainment is all about."
"bob the moo","Null","10","16","31 May 2007"," Forgets to be fun and is overly serious, plodding, dull and weakly acted while Depp is sidelined for reasons best known to the makers (spoilers)
","There are some films where I must concede that maybe I'm just not getting it and am not seeing what everyone else in the world is seeing because with this third and final film in the Pirates series, I find myself reading the reviews and looking at the ratings and juts shaking my head. Did everyone else sit in the same film as myself? From my point of view I might as well repost my review of the first sequel because all the same problems are there (which I suppose means if you like that you'll like this). The first film surprised me by just being good old fashioned fun carried almost wholly on the back on a wonderfully risky performance from Depp that rightly earned him an Oscar nod.<br/><br/>However that key part of the first film seems to have been forgotten in the sequels as ""fun"" is very thin on the ground as the conclusion continues an ""epic"" story that is built on characters I found hard to care for and a narrative that stutters where the original just flowed along with a wink and a grin. It is all to serious and full of ideas and threads that go nowhere. I found it endlessly frustrating that the film would ask me to follow the character connections only to have them go nowhere of value. The most laughable example of me was the building up of ""Calypso"" only for her to turn into a load of crabs and produce a bit of a whirlpool that doesn't seem to bother too many people in the final battle scenes.<br/><br/>With this story, Captain Jack (surely the only character anyone likes) is almost made a marginal character in his own film. Having been carried by Jack in the first film, the focus seems to have shifted to Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann, both of whom resemble their own cardboard cut-outs you see in the multiplex lobbies. Their ""romance"" is annoying and I found their battle-scene marriage to be hilarious (although I suspect this was not the intention). One or two scenes are amusing but mostly it is all too earnest and heavy and I found myself bored and caring less and less with every passing scene. The effects continue to be good but just because you can do something doesn't mean you should; ignoring this we end up with all sorts of silliness ending up with a dizzyingly daft series of fights as the camera spins all around the place.<br/><br/>The cast is deep with familiar and famous faces and in theory they should benefit from having a script with so many interactions, betrayals etc. Of course the script does leave many of them hanging but the biggest failing for me was the way the film is put on the shoulders of the two people least able to carry it, namely Knightly and Bloom. In the first film it was obvious that they weren't really up to the task but they are left really exposed here and can't raise their game to the task. Depp is good as he was in the other films but he is very much sidelined and he only has a handful of moments where he gets the material to work with. The support cast are actually OK but they mostly drive the film to the more serious side. Nighy and Harris are handed bigger characters but left in the lurch by a script that was using them rather than utilising them. Davenport, Pryce, Skarsgård and others are all fine. Rush is a bit too hammy to fit in the newly serious film; some add some nice comic touches but a cameo from Keith Richards is a painfully pointless affair that is at least mercifully short.<br/><br/>Overall then, another step away from what made the original film so good  fun. With little of that on offer I was left with an overly heavy plot, average performances, impressive but OTT special effects and performances that ranged from the serviceable (the majority) to the weak (Bloom and Knightly) while someone seems to have decided to barely use the best weapon in the arsenal and mostly sidelines Depp's wonderful Jack Sparrow. This was my first of the 2007 threequels and I hope they get better than this."

","Pirates of the Caribbean 3: At World's End offers more of the quality stories and plots as introduced in Pirates of the Caribbean. The acting of all actors seems to have increased in power by a tenfold and unlike PotC2:DMC you've always got the feeling the story is going somewhere. The plot involves brilliant turns and switches of loyalty, a powerful - extremely striking range of moments and an overwhelming ending.<br/><br/>The movie does what PotC2 failed to give: It gives a real story, new jokes (some rather good ones at that too) and an ending.<br/><br/>Although they open a door for a fourth movie a bit weakly, hey, such a successful franchise, come on, of course they kick in a door for part four.<br/><br/>Oh yes, the stories of Jack Sparrow and Davy Jones, Tia Dalma, Will Turner and his father, James Norrington and Elizabeth Swann continue in a way we might not have predicted in part two. The story continues at the journey to and beyond World's End to return 'witty Jack' to life, and then continues on with the pirates uniting to save pirates life as a whole from Lord Becketts 'good intentions'. Since Lord Beckett holds the Dead Mans Chest, he also holds the Flying Dutchmans' captain under his command. Jack, Will and Elizabeth thus find themselves sometimes united, but usually betraying each other - and however always friends - facing troubles that are beyond their solving.<br/><br/>The story this time also is far more complicated (according to a lot of people even too complicated) - but it gives a more than satisfactory closing for the stories we've witnessed up till now. The movie is dark, darker even than PotC2:DMZ - but having the pirates as a source of light is always fun to watch.<br/><br/>The sea- and sword battles, loyalty issues and 'pirates life' are brought into view brilliantly under a beautiful soundtrack by Hans Zimmer. A recommendation to anyone who wants to see a entertaining movie, Jack Sparrow fans, Orlando Bloom fans (you did't think the girls really went to see something else?), Pirates fans and cinema fans.<br/><br/>The film is a satisfactory conclusion to all the story lines and I, too, can do nothing but praise the design, cinematography, visual effects and music. The best Pirates movie ever? In my opinion: Definitely."

They didn't, but in the interests of completeness I decided to check out this, the final part in the initial trilogy, in the hope that things would improve.<br/><br/>They don't. Like its predecessors, AT WORLD'S END is a bloated and overblown exercise in style over substance. Featuring a cast that the director finds it impossible to keep track, endless action sequences that have no discernible beginning or end, repetitive sword fights in which nobody is ever killed or seemingly wounded, and a complete lack of realism from beginning to end, this is everything I hate about Hollywood blockbusters.<br/><br/>There's no character development whatsoever. Johnny Depp is still the irritating, one-dimensional character he played in the original movie. There are WAY too many supporting characters and the screen time between them is spread too thinly, so that few get a look in. Yes, the special effects are splendid, spectacular and photo-realistic, but the effects never make a film and these PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN movies are a case in point.

","The third instalment of the Pirates saga has racked up costs of $300 million. That's a lot of money â€“ a lot of money down the drain, or should I say, the huge CGI whirlpool featured in Pirates 3 which serves virtually no purpose, apart from to amuse. But by now, we are not amused.<br/><br/>I chose the word saga at the opening of this review for a reason. Because, collectively, the life-threateningly dull adventures of Gore Verbinski's characters has wasted 9 hours of my life. 9 hours I could of spent of doing anything else, watching repeats of 1980's sitcoms on unknown satellite channels, watching cricket, watching paint dry. Anything but surviving the trilogy which feels like a lifetime. You could take your newborn baby in to a screening of At World's End, and by time you leave, your baby will be a young boy. You will have skipped the nappy changing, the crying, the staying up all night. So, there is a silver lining to the very, dark looming cloud which is the son of cinema's Satan - Pirates 3.<br/><br/>By now, we can care little for the unforgivable mess which is the plot. Ships turning upside down, pirate leagues, rocks turning into crabs, an odd, mumbling witch who talks some of the biggest fantasy drivel ever committed to film. We've had enough, and the illusion which was the charm of the first pirate's film has worn off. Jack Sparrow is just a slow, bumbling character with annoyingly awkward dialogue and Orlando Bloom and Kiera Knightly are so wooden they could be harvested and solve the world's problem of deforestation. The tone of the film is evidently undecided; we can go from a hanging scene involving children to a drunken Jonny Depp in a slapstick comedy scene. There's even an attempt at romance at the end of the film, but the scene is so graceless and discomforting it's like watching rhino's mating on the Discovery channel. Ugh, just ugh.

","And the team is back with a third movie. However, this time the plot is more complex (and confusing in the beginning). New characters are introduced, thus new plots. The characters who had smaller roles in the previous films, like Tia Dalma, the parrot and Jack the monkey, have more to do here. Unfortunately, some likable characters have been killed off such as Davenport's Norrington and the Kraken. I also did not like how they concluded Tia Dalma's story. She just becomes a giant, then bursts into crabs and becomes a storm? The action sequences are cool to watch even though they are a little over the top. I still preferred the ones that were more creatively executed in the second one. I think the main problem with this one was that it was much more over the top than the first two.<br/><br/>Yet, it's still a fun flick even though it doesn't live up to the first movie. The humour is definitely there and it still works great thanks to the hilarious dialogues like in the scenes where Jack talks to his conscience and the one where they all come to get him from 'purgatory'. The cinematography is spacious and the performances are consistent. As always, it's a Jack Sparrow show and of course, 'Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End' is unimaginable without Depp. Geoffrey Rush gets scope to display a lot more comedy and the actor is exceptional. Keira Knightley has a lot more action and she's probably furthest away from the feminine princess in the first movie. Orlando Bloom is mostly overshadowed by his co-stars as he's often relegated to the background but he has his few shining moments. Chow Yun Fat managess to kiss Knightley before getting killed off. Naomie Harris and Bill Nighy are good.<br/><br/>The ending does leave space for more and I wonder what a fourth movie would be like. I wouldn't mind seeing more. If the makers do decide to end it here then that's not so bad either. It's a decent conclusion, one that could have been fantastic but remained entertaining and adventurous nonetheless."
"supersabref100","3","4","5","7 December 2007"," Terrible and Surprisingly Boring
","This movie basically has nothing happening for almost 2 hours. Boring. Snooze fest. The final battle is nothing spectacular. I am stunned that people love this movie. It's terrible. I loved Pirates 1. Pirates 2 was disappointing as it lost the joyous, fun feeling of the original but still had some exciting action scenes mixed in with a dumb plot. Pirates 3 only has the dumb plot with no action. At 169 minutes long this a chance to take a nice long nap. Pirates 1 ran long but was forgivable. Pirates 2 was way too long and Pirates 3 is just an exercise in the loss of self control and editing blunders. I know you won't listen to me but don't say you weren't warned. See it at your own risk."
"ToeCutterZero","2","4","5","24 November 2007"," Ridiculous plot, barely perceivable after watching twice..
","Be prepared for perhaps the most senseless plot of any ""blockbuster"" movie ever released.<br/><br/>Throughout several plot ""twists"" it's so easy to be left behind by shallow explanations of what the characters intend to do next, that is almost seems as if it was done intentionally to cover the gaping holes left in the story.<br/><br/>The 30 minute climax of the film is a perfect example of summer blockbuster overkill, as most viewers will be completely overwhelmed by sheer volume of things happening on screen. It calls to mind the feeling of spinning a car out of control, sitting helplessly waiting for impact or for the car to eventually roll to a stop.<br/><br/>The film is visually satisfying, with large ocean vistas, sailing ships, SFX, etc. But how it managed to garner a score above 5 is a wonder to me. I could not have cared less about the characters, their motivation, or even success as the story was excruciatingly convoluted. More time was spent on setting up slapstick gags (most involving Sparrow or the pirate's monkey) than actually trying to tell the story. <br/><br/>It seems as though folks don't expect much from films these days. This film, followed closely by ""Transformers"" demonstrate huge budget films with mind numbingly dull plots that still manage to do well at the box office. Expect more of the same as the studios continue to make money from these sickeningly boring movies."
"mythicsam","9","4","5","29 June 2007"," The most entertaining movie in years
","The first Pirates of the Caribbean, released in 2001 to a skeptical and wary public, was an instant classic that broke box office records and stunned critics worldwide. The second film, while it paled in comparison to its predecessor, was still a great popcorn movie that became the third highest-grossing film of all time. Pirates three certainly had a tough act to follow when it came out, and I was very worried that it wouldn't live up to the hype like Shrek and Spider-Man. Fortunately, it did.<br/><br/>POTC 3 wiped the floor with Dead Man's Chest and was nearly as good as the original in terms of entertainment. The acting, sets, humor and action were all superb, and standout scenes never ceased. Although it is almost three hours long, at World's End never seems to drag,and this movie will have you riveted from the beginning to the climactic finale.<br/><br/>The acting was almost uniformly superb. Jonny Depp stole the show as usual( I can just never get tired of his character!) but the other actors were fantastic too. Geoffrey Rush was even better this time around, as he had much more screen time, and Bill Nighy played Davy Jones (one of my all-time favorite villains) to perfection. I LOVED Mackenzie Crook and Lee Arenberg. Their conflicting personalities and stupid, yet strangely erudite conversation made for metric tons of laughs. Most of the other characters were great too, especially Sao Feng and Gibbs. Even Kiera Nightly and Orlando Bloom did well this time around.<br/><br/>At World's End is on a much bigger scale than previous Pirates movies, with bigger battles, more grandiose sets, more plot lines and many more characters. However, unlike others have claimed it would, POTC 3 never confused me, and I thought the plot was genuinely good. <br/><br/>POTC 3 is certainly the most visually impressive of the three, and you can really see were its 300 million (million!) dollar budget went to. There are a number of eye-popping CGI scenes that look so real you'll swear that they were filmed in real life. The sets are absolutely phenomenal( if you don't gasp when you see the pirate city of Shipwreck, seek your psychiatrist before it's too late), and the battle scenes look absolutely incredible. The final battle was a masterpiece of choreographing and CGI, and is definitely one of my favorite fight scenes of all time.<br/><br/>At World's End is not perfect. The ending was somewhat lackluster and some of the plot lines could have finished more satisfactorily. Also, I was sad that Norrington and Gov. Swann had miniscule roles, as I believe that they could have added a lot to this movie. Nevertheless, At World's End is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time and a fitting conclusion to great trilogy."

","I have to confess I had never seen the first two before going to see the third instalment. I decided to go see three to see what all the fuss was about. I was not disappointed, I absolutely loved it and then went home and spent the next week watching one and two and all of its extra material not once but twice. I have since returned to the cinema and watched the third one and got so much more from it. I like Johnny Depp's quirkiness and the rest of the characters add to the whole essence of the film. I actually worked out most of the plots from the first time watching so can't understand why most people find it confusing and that is without watching the first two. Yes you have to think about it and watch very carefully to follow it, but at least it gets your brain working and is a great topic for conversation. I would like to think that Jack Sparrow will continue his adventures as it is he is really entertaining and brings lightheartedness to the movie world once more."

","Okay, it's a mess, it's busy, but oh BOY is it FUN!!! A fitting end to the POTC trilogy, (Hmm, we'll see about that!) ""At Worlds End"" sees the gang reunite to fight the East India Company for their freedom. It's a whole lot of fun, the script sparkles and Johnny Depp relishes his role as Captain Jack Sparrow. It's fair to say that he's carried the series. Keith Richards makes a surprise appearance halfway through the movie as Capt Jack's father, and the interaction between them is hilarious. Orlando Bloom's character Will Turner seems to take a back seat to Elizabeth Swann which is a great pity because Miss Knightley is not the world's greatest actress and screeches half of her roles like a fishwife in a market. Geoffrey Rush also has great fun with his role as does Bill Nighy as Davey Jones. The addition of Chow Yun Fat is a good one, he also has great fun in his role. All in all, a fun movie for the family, so long as the kiddies aren't too young as the three hours plus running time may be a little too much for them."
"kit-payumo","9","4","5","18 June 2007"," A New Hope for the Threequel Scenario
","Ah, the summer movie spectacle. This year I thought the latest crop of movie ""Threequels"" were the beginning of the end.<br/><br/>It started with Spiderman 3. How could everything have gone so terribly wrong? Coming off the spectacular Spiderman 2, Spidey's third outing was a sloppy and strangely, emotionally detached mess. I couldn't believe how bored I was.<br/><br/>Then came Shrek the 3rd. Why don't these Hollywood types ever know when the joke's just not funny anymore. Sure this installment had it's moments, but they were just that: moments. Nothing coming close to the second installment's inspired mayhem.<br/><br/>And just when you think all hope is lost for the summer, POTC: At World's End pulls into port. All I can say is: WOW. OK, also that it's way better than Dead Man's Chest, which was such an extreme disappointment. Nobody thought they'd be able to fix something so fundamentally broken, but they did! And boy did they ever! So why only 9 out of 10 stars? Because it's not perfect. Like it's forebear, this movie is still way too long. Jerry Bruckheimer just can't seem to get the fact that sometimes more is not necessarily....more. In fact, this is one of those perfect cases where more is definitely less. Too long and an over convoluted plot. And yet we've got a keeper here. First of all, it's tone is much darker than the first two and it's pace is much slower and studied than the mad mayhem of Dead Man's Chest. The acting is still top notch, with extra kudos to Bill Nighy. All the characters also get their just comeuppance, or their redemption (a certain Commodore comes to mind). All culminating in one of the most incredible fight scenes ever put into celluloid. But most importantly, it had that emotional spark that was so lacking in number two (that extra scene after the credits was the perfect postscript). All of this makes for an enjoyable conclusion to one of filmdom's most lavish summer outings."
"phillipstephenso","9","4","5","14 June 2007"," Avast
","If you like romance, fantasy, and whimsical dialog, you will love this film. The setting ranges from Singapore to the ends of the earth and beyond. The actors include pirates from every conceivable sea-faring country in the world and every accent from London Cockney to Valley Girl California.<br/><br/>Orlando Bloom, whether dead or alive, stirs the female heart to romance, even as cannonballs fly by enraptured faces amid pirate mayhem. Meanwhile, Johnny Depp rises from the dead to lead the Black Pearl to new miracles of bravery in the face of overwhelming forces, whether the English Navy out to stretch Johnny's neck or rival pirates, who want to merely eliminate the business competition.<br/><br/>This is the latest of the trilogy of films called Pirates of the Caribbean, and it sustains all the energy of its predecessors in its battle scenes and with the originality of the dialog. In addition, the score for this film features splendidly performed and stirring orchestral music.<br/><br/>Of course, the plot is murky, much like the Lord of the Rings trilogy, with lots of fantastical creatures and situations. So, this film might be even better at the second viewing, as somewhat puzzling dialog and motifs begin to resolve.<br/><br/>Ahoy and smartly there, me hearties, mates, and sea dogs. Don't miss boarding for this pirate voyage, and learn something at each new turn of the helm wheel at your favorite theater."
"mykie7","5","32","65","23 May 2007"," sadly lacking
","In spite of a talented cast, a remarkably appealing concept, and all the money in the world, Pirates 3 falls sadly short of satisfying.<br/><br/>As promised, it was visually appealing, with special effects on a scale to match its epic image. But, like all things of unnecessary grandeur, the effects are compensating for something... the absence of which detracted significantly from the movie experience. A purpose. True, entertainment can be considered a purpose, and it is here for the finding, but entertainment need not be as painfully drawn out as this.<br/><br/>So, if not entertainment, what is the point? Certainly not to tell a unique or provocative story. It's absolutely baffling how a film with a stomach-churning number of plot twists can still be predictable.<br/><br/>The final result is that neither casting, (the inclusion of Keith Richards while unnecessary, was inspired) expensive effects, nor a plot as twisted as the tentacles of the Kraken can rescue these Pirates from utter vacuousness.<br/><br/>Yet it doesn't seem to matter, Pirates 3 is an inevitable blockbuster. This Pirates owes its predestined box office success to 2003's ""The Curse of the Black Pearl"", an exceptional film, easily eclipsing its counterparts in quality, entertainment, and does so in less time. <br/><br/>Perhaps guaranteed success will assuage the guilt on the part of the filmmakers for inflicting this film upon audiences worldwide. Or perhaps audiences are simply foolish to expect anything of substance from pirates such as these."

","They did it.<br/><br/>Did what? They screwed it up. ""At world's end"" is not able to continue the trilogy. The movie did one thing: Putting random scenes together.<br/><br/>But let me explain it.<br/><br/>First of all: The movie was made for people to laugh. There were so many ""You have to laugh"" scenes, that I got sick of it after 30 minutes. The humor was not like it has been in the other parts, it was a forced and boring kind of humor.<br/><br/>Second thing: They had such a great plot and base. The cliffhanger of the second part was amazing and had so much potential what they did not use.<br/><br/>Third thing: Characters. They tried to develop characters, great - but they screwed it up. I don't want to spoiler anything, so you have to see it on your own. Just one note: Character development is only good, when it's logically and there was nothing about logic in ""at world's end"".<br/><br/>Fourth problem: Love story. I hate love stories when they totally miss the point. Yes we know, that Elizabeth and Will are in love. But why do they have to put that in an action scene where they fight for their life? This were just four things I hated about the movie. 3/10 points is a very, very kind rating. If you want to see a pirate movie with a special kind of humor do not watch the movie and save the money. If you want to know how it's possible to mess a great cliffhanger and plot up watch it."

","This line from Jack, sums this movie up perfectly. I feel like I had a full frontal lobotomy after seeing this movie. I was nearly brought to tears by this film. Not from emotion, I don't think there's an actor in the film who could elicit that, but from how much money must have been spent on this travesty.<br/><br/>From the ridiculous opening scene with the dubbed over song, to the utterly pointless end battle, this movie had more in common with Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas than Pirates of the Caribbean. In fact, I've probably seen people on acid make more sense. Getting married in the middle of a battle? WHAT THE HELL?!?! And speak more clearly. The combination of mumbling and accents in this movie was a blessing in disguise to spare us from more trite and terrible dialog. Now put that to cannon fire and you have a truly unintelligible 3 hours of spoken line. And speaking of cannons, do they have any effect in this universe? 3 films, roughly 7 hours of film, each containing firefights and not one ship sinks, not one character apparently dies, from cannon fire! Until the very end, when it happens in about 2 seconds. I can't even form a coherent thought on this movie, that's how bad it, and the effect it had on me is. This is simply the worst movie I've seen since Ultraviolet. I wish there was a rating worse than 1 star.<br/><br/>I firmly believe that with the exception of Lord of the Rings, and possibly X-Men, the 21st century is destroying trilogies and sequels as we know them. Pirates, Star Wars, Spiderman 3, The Matrix, all gone to hell. I only pray that the Bourne Ultimatum is spared."

But the bad thing is that I don't really care. I liked the first two, and I was pumped to get to see it before most people. Unfortunately, now I have the burden of shielding people from this piece of crap. The movie tackles too many character story lines, and falls flat on all of them. You might be thinking, ""Oh I love complicated movies because they are fun and intriguing!LOL!"". Think again. This isn't complicated in a good way like The Departed or Memento. No. No. No. This movie is complicated in a way that you assume that the writers just made stuff up as went along. Yeah the movie looks cool at times, and there are aerial shots of tropical islands and whatnot. But I'm sure there will be plenty of large budget movies with great CGI this summer that might actually have a decent and somewhat sensible plot.I don't want to say anymore because I don't want to spoil the film for those of you out there that like to be in suspense while watching sh*tty movies, but I will say that I hope you like terribly crafted jokes involving a monkey, and I hope you like them in mass quantities.

There are precious few new characters, and director Gore Verbinski relies on Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) and his camp goofiness so heavily it should be called the Captain Jack Sparrow Show.<br/><br/>As the plot builds towards a final showdown, the love story continues to revolve around William Turner (Orlando Bloom), Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) and their 'will they-won't they' merry-go-round. Snore.<br/><br/>It's a similar story with At World's End's special effects. They're impressive, but it feels like we've seen them all before.<br/><br/>The best are stolen from the far superior Dead Man's Chest, with only a short sequence featuring Sparrow hallucinating in Davy Jones' locker showing any signs of inspiration.<br/><br/>Thankfully, the much-hyped appearance of Keith Richards as Sparrow's father is well worth the wait. Richards is brilliant, and if there were more of him he could have single-handedly saved the film.<br/><br/>But it's a wasted opportunity, much like the rest of the film.<br/><br/>To get to the climactic overblown whirlpool battle, you'll have to navigate a massively complicated plot that features more twists, turns and double-crosses than a con artist convention.<br/><br/>You'll need more than a compass, an eyeglass and a map marked with 'X' to understand what the heck is going on.

","I loved Dead Man's Chest and will never forget the sensation at seeing Jack Sparrow return to the Black Pearl, Elizabeth holding tight to his leg, the amazing kiss, Jack's escape only to heroically face the Kraken. One of the most romantic scenes in cinema I can remember.<br/><br/>If that stirs up great memories, brace yourself, because At World's End has none of this. Into the first half-hour I knew it was going to be bad (it was bad from the beginning, but I was trying to stay positive!). The violence depicted is nasty and unnecessary. The ""magic"" is nonmagical (but this goes for most of today's ""magical"" films). It is unfunny (the audience was dead silent for most of it). There is no real emotion even though the actors emote well enough. There are some great visuals but even they left me cold. <br/><br/>Johnny Depp, as some have noted, seemed somewhat removed, and vacant. Keira Knightly looks good and gives a rousing speech, but her Elizabeth comes off as annoying and I did not feel for her (in fairness, some of this is the writers' fault). Orlando Bloom doesn't even get to do his best Errol Flynn, which usually redeems his weaknesses (for the female viewers, at least). Jack Davenport is great - but wasted (and he must be thankful his character gets an early exit). Chow Yun-Fat - a handsome man - is uglied up and doesn't have much to do with anything. <br/><br/>If only they'd stuck to the Caribbean! The last three minutes are the best part. The writers have forgotten what is means to write a decent movie, let alone one about pirates (they should have been forced to watch Captain Blood, over and over till they got it right). Whereas with Curse of the Black Pearl they revived the pirate genre, they have with At World's End managed to kill it off for good. RIP."

","Captain Barbossa (Rush), Elizabeth Swann (Knightley) and Will Turner (Bloom) go to Singapore to get a crew and a ship but more importantly, to get the map that will lead them to Davy Jones Locker to rescue Jack Sparrow so the Bretheren Court can meet. The Bretheren Court is a court made up of the nine lords from all around the world fighting for pirates good will and freedom and Jack is one of the nine. But trouble is on the way, Lord Cutler Beckett (Hollander) along with his army are turning the pirates against each other and forcing them to surrender or fight, while Davy Jones (Nighy) is looking for something more.<br/><br/>The film has an amazing story line with beautiful and breathtaking sequences including underwater shots. The characters have been developed in the last two movies and are now able to show what they are capable of. Captain Jack Sparrow is still the same witty character but slightly more manic after being trapped in Davy Jones Locker. Will Turner seems to have something else on his mind. He wants Elizabeth but there might be drastic consequences. Elizabeth Swann doesn't seem to have much of a purpose until a change of events put her in charge. But the flirtation between Jack and Elizabeth is not hinted at which I think is a good thing, as it would distract from the main storyline. The movie manages to fit in humour, adventure, action, romance, drama and so much more. The movie starts off I little slowly but it is needed to explain the rest of it. Even with the slightly slow start this film takes you on a wild adventure that doesn't stop until the credits are rolling. The movie is somewhat darker than the first two but it has to be as what kind of epic battle that determines the fate of pirates everywhere is light hearted. Overall the 168 minutes of high seas adventure is one well spent but make sure you stay after the credits for an extra scene. I just have one question. What mark did Jack leave on Beckett???"

WE EVEN SEE A PARACHUTE SCENE!)We are talking about PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN,not Jason and the Argonauts or the adventures of Sinbad!!<br/><br/>The visuals were breathtaking and spectacular: incredible sets and costumes,dazzling and very realistic effects (though overused)and as always, Johnny Depp did his miracle; his acting is an extra bonus for the film.

After watching it, i can say this; the more is not always the better..

Now so far this May, the sequels have been disappointing, excluding 28 Weeks Later, they're just not as good as the originals or their sequels. When I asked my friend how Pirates 3 was, she said it was a major disappointment, oh, man, that got me nervous, since her and I have virtually the same taste in movies. But my mom and I wanted to see this film still, just see what it was about, and I have to say that I actually enjoyed this film more that what I was lead to believe it was.<br/><br/>OK, I'm not sure how to explain the plot, since there is so much to say, but I'm going to give it a shot. Will and Elizabeth's relationship is on the rocks since Elizabeth has not told anyone that she was the cause of Jack's death. Jack is needed to help Will get his father back, so he and the crew bring back Jack from Davy Jone's locker. The English Command has hung everyone in the town who has done anything to do with pirates, and are out to kill every last one of the pirates. Captain Barbossa is back and he is in a fight with Jack on who is captain of the ship. Traitors reveal themselves into the biggest pirate battle you'll ever see! <br/><br/>I hope that helps somewhat, there are a lot of stories to follow in this film. But it has great acting, superb effects, and terrific stories. There are a few ridicules moments that are unbelievable, but I think that if you just relax and give the movie a break, you may find yourself having a lot of fun in this great sequel. It was a great ending to the story, the only story I didn't like how they ended it was the story between Will and Elizabeth, but I'm not going to spoil it for you. But please just give this movie a break, it's really great when you give it a chance.<br/><br/>9/10"

","I just recently watched this film and I personally thought is was superb! The plot of the film was clear, and the actor, or actresses were at their best. The movie could've been shorter, but most of the time, it was thrilling. Johnny Depp's character was very Jack Sparrow-ish, making this movie worth watching. The love story in the movie was clear, but I cannot say anymore because it will ruin the film. I must say, it is worth my money, compared to the other movies I've seen over the past months. I am really sad that no more Pirates of the Caribbean movies will be filmed, at least that is what I heard. I recommend anyone who has watched the whole series , won't be disappointed with the film."

","After seeing the reviews and hearing how disappointed people said they were about the third Pirates of the Caribean, I was very pleasantly surprised when I finally got to see the film today. I enjoyed part three every bit as much as parts one and two, although it may have been a bit longer than desirable. The characters seem true to their previous behavior, there are enough twists and turns to keep one guessing about the plot, and the film is visually very beautiful. I am still amazed that the computer effects can be inserted so seamlessly into the live action, and the cinematography is just beautiful. I really enjoyed the adventures of Jack Sparrow and his conscience or should it be consciences? I didn't think that the plot was predictable and I enjoyed the squabbling between the pirate kings. All I had read were negative comments about Keith Richards' performance as Jack Sparrow's father, and I thought he did a good job. The comic touch about Jack's mother was definitely unexpected. This movie is certainly a great way to spend a hot summer afternoon with friends who know the tale, a packet of popcorn and a cold pop."

","""The curse of the Black Pearl"" was a direct shot blowing your brain away with a big bang, ""Dead man's chest"" was a really funny and enjoyable sequel, so what do we have here, at world's end? Yeah, it's really an end, can you believe it? It seems that Disney studios hadn't saw such a lot of money since... never! And now it's gone. Well, it's bad only for a Disney, 'cause it was right thing to do. In the end, we have a perfect final for a trilogy. The movie has it all: humor, action, charismatic characters, brilliant dialogs, groundbreaking special effects... hell, you saw the first two movies, you know what I'm talking about. And it really looks like an end. Well, at last for some characters. There still some hope for a some kind of spin-off, but I don't want a fourth movie, the story is completed. Oh, yeah, this movie has a best wedding scene in a history! There's all what I can wish for. I'm happy."

","The final installment of the Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy. It fit right into the other two movies and their caliber. The brining back of Jack Sparrow was a must because you couldn't do a pirates movie without Johnny Depp. Some of the things that went down in this final movie were things that I would have never expected. More of a story about Davy Jones was told in this movie, it was more about why he cut out his heart. It all and all made a excellent showing at the theater, but the original will always stick out as the best of the three. Even though the second and third movie showed tons of excellence in movie making, you have to go with the original version. Kudos to the pirates trilogy, it was a fun one to watch."

"bleached33","10","7","11","6 June 2007"," Exactly what a summer blockbuster should be!!
","This cinematic gem showcases a real mastery of artistic scenes and a real hold on comic relief by both the actors themselves and those behind the camera. The special effects are magnificently superb, leaving the viewer to almost wonder if Davy Jones just might really be a lovelorn, scoundrel squid-man. This plot line is distinctly more complex than that of the first two, and rightfully so. The locations and costumes are enough to leave one basking in the glory of the blissful feast for the eyes. In this trilogy, the creativity and artistry are often overlooked because of its star-studded cast and its brilliant script. This film is heavier on the comedy, conjuring larger participation by Pintel (Lee Arenberg) and Ragetti (Mackenzie Crook), Jack the monkey, and Cotton's parrot. A more sizeable appearance of Tia Dalma (Naomie Harris) is also a welcomed addition to the plot line and astounding performances of her co-stars. As expected, Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) is fantastically witty and amusing and heavily contributed to the movie?s multiple facets. Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) is especially captivating in this third installment, revealing yet another part of her once-buried personality. Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) no longer takes a backseat to the novelty of Jack Sparrow and has his chance to shine as the strong, surprising pirate rival to his big-name co-stars. He is given ample opportunities to showcase his complexity as an actor and a character. As always, Geoffrey Rush projects the perfect, stereotypically delicious pirate visage as Captain Barbossa. This well-thought-out, staggeringly impressive silver screen knockout is just what popular cinema has been begging for: a phenomenal blend of laughs, artistic genius, and depth."

","Do you think he plans it all out,' asks a befuddled British officer, marveling at one of Jack Sparrow's characteristically miraculous escapes, 'or just makes it up as he goes along?' It's a million dollar (okay, a $400 million) question, one that should be aimed at now uber-successful director Gore Verbinski. At World's End really doesn't seem to have any sort of real script, presumably cobbled hastily by excitable Hollywood executives in an urge to please every demographic.<br/><br/>The result is a tremendous mishmash, a hideous blend of cliché and hammy acting, with a few tiny slivers of wit.<br/><br/>But then, of course, there's Johnny Depp.<br/><br/>It's painfully ironic to consider that Depp -- that quirkiest of the super-talented leading men, the man behind films of groundbreaking ingenuity and insane characters -- seems to have sold his soul to Davy Jones' Dollar. <br/><br/>As a result, the films are now designed around clever Jack one-liners, the bloated plot and thick character stew serving only as backdrop for moments Jack mercifully chooses to come on screen and seduce us, instantly. Except, alas, he doesn't do that enough. <br/><br/>It's as if the old sea dog knows the film is tripe, and couldn't be bothered to help it along more. The plot has an interesting premise,with gallows and song. The East India Company is taking over the high seas (the world, pretty much) and the only form of rebellion is coming from the Pirates. It's a great concept for the world today, spanners thrown into the corporate machinery by swashbuckling purveyors of piracy, freeing up expression and sticking it to the man. The film, of course, chooses to ignore this entirely, getting tangled up in a ridiculous story instead.<br/><br/>And what a messy yarn it is, chock-full of curses, goddesses, alter egos, clones and crabs. And a slew of characters. <br/><br/>Figuratively, that is; Chow Yun-Fat's Sao Feng is admittedly blessed with pretty scars, but that's pretty much it. A bad French pirate and a squeaky Sikh? How's that for wealth of character.<br/><br/>And Knightley is particularly painful, the pouty anorexic expression doing little for the stunner as she overacts her way, chewing up scenery.<br/><br/>Of course, this is way, way larger than life. The budget is massive, and so there is much detailing. The art direction is excellent, as are the costumes, and some special effects set-pieces are simply stellar. It's just that in a film stretching to almost three hours (and feeling close to four), after a point it just all seems like one big wet sword-fight.<br/><br/>This one -- save for the incredible screen moment of seeing Rolling Stones guitarist Keith Richards play dad to Jack Sparrow, the character modeled loosely on himself -- has nothing, really. And is much, much longer.<br/><br/>The first Pirates Of The Caribbean was an absolute corker, a film that made you switch to rum and sport an eyepatch. This new film requires you wear two."
"TOMASBBloodhound","8","7","11","3 June 2007"," ""It's just good business.""
","Another big dumb movie from Hollywood! But like the other two films in this series, it sure is a lot of fun. These Pirates movies are the closest thing to kids movies The Hound will subject himself to in a theater. And indeed there is something prophetic about that final line that Lord Beckett keeps repeating as his ship is blown to bits around him. These films are all about $$$$$$$, but as long as they entertain, is that such a terrible thing? Though this film is currently under performing in terms of meeting its financial expectations, one wonders if there will in fact be another one in the future. And just which of these cast members will sign on for another voyage?<br/><br/>The plot by now has wound itself around in knots more complex than any sailor has ever tied. The early parts of this film deal with the cast members trying to rescue Capt. Jack Sparrow from his virtual prison in Davey Jones's Locker. Once this feat is accomplished, (of course it would be!) the ultimate aim seems to be for all pirates left on Earth to band together to defeat Davey Jones and the East India Trading Company. It looks like there will be an epic battle staged with hundreds of ships, however the final battle seems to consist of only the Black Pearl battling the Flying Dutchman. Each cast member seems to switch alliances with every other cast member at least twice before this 2 hour and 48 minute film finally comes to an end. Muskets are fired, swords are thrust, goddesses are captured then released, destinies are fulfilled, and about 1,000 blue-coated East India Trading Company members are killed.<br/><br/>The film has some funny moments, but neither sequel had as many as part one in terms of laughs. Maybe the funniest thing I saw in part 3 was Davey Jones standing in a rotten old tub of water on a tiny island since he cannot touch dry land but once every ten years. With so many little rules and alliances, I'd hate to have to be a script supervisor on a set like this! How do they keep track of all these things?? Was it great cinema? Well... no, but I got what I paid for. By now most people know what these films are all about, and I really can't see how someone who liked parts 1 or 2 would not enjoy this one. What better way could I have spent $6.50 on a rainy Friday afternoon? 8 of 10 stars.<br/><br/>The Hound."

I really like it very much - although someone may think it's too long, I say - you won't need to check the time because what's going on on the screen will keep you interested until the end. I think all three parts of Pirates are a little bit different and make different impression. The third movie is more serious, dark and huge. The story is good, actors are brilliant. There's everything you need - story, humor, drama, adventures, atmosphere... The music is very good! But what make a surprise is an ending. I didn't think it may turn out this way, but I love it.

Johnny Depp nailed the role of Jack Sparrow once again, and Geoffrey Rush, as Barbosa, might as well have been a pirate in reality.<br/><br/>Also, the movie does contain a fair amount of death. James Norrington in particular had a really bad day. Davy Jones's death wasn't spectacular, but sometimes, a nice, simple death is good.<br/><br/>It remains somewhat comedic at times, such as when Jack Sparrow kills a clone Jack Sparrow thing in a deranged state in the pirate underworld, and of course, Pintel and Ragetti were there to provide a lot of laughs. <br/><br/>In other words, a truly good, well made movie.

"mmallon4","1","2","2","12 March 2015"," Bored and Confused
","For my money Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End represents everything wrong in contemporary blockbuster cinema and anyone who paid money to go and see is contributing to the decline of western civilization; unfortunately that also includes me resulting in the single most boring, confusing and frustrating movie I ever had the misfortune of viewing and in a movie theatre no less! For beginners, the movie's opening scene which shows people including children being hanged should act as a metaphor for the next 168 minutes of terror.<br/><br/>A $300 million dollar budget, and for what? Huge CGI battle sequences with characters I couldn't give a monkeys about fighting each other, well actually I take that back because I don't even know what they're fighting about. This movie is like the First World War, nobody knows what it's all about. I enjoyed the first installment of this franchise was disappointed with the sequel due to its incomprehensible plot but At World's End goes beyond that. I literally don't have a clue what is going on. Whose side anyone is on? Who's that guy? Why are they going to this place? What's that thing? Even reading the movie's plot on Wikipedia I can't get my read around it but then again they did start shooting the film before a script was completed.<br/><br/>While I enjoyed Johnny Depp's performance in the first two movies here he is, no apologies, annoying; very, very annoying. When we are first introduced to Jack Sparrow in this film it isn't just one Jack Sparrow, there are dozens of Jack Sparrows and they won't shut up. Too much a good thing, way too much! One scene which particular aggravated me is when a bunch of characters are sitting around a table debating who knows what and it goes on for an eternity. It's like 12 Angry Men, except it's not and there's only one angry man, me, watching the dam thing. I tend to avoid using the word hate unless I really mean it but few other movies have enraged me as much as this ""movie"". I know every movie on the IMDB boards has a topic in which some proclaims it as the worst film they've ever seen but Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End really is one of the absolute worst films I've ever seen."
"Horst_In_Translation","4","2","2","21 December 2014"," Drowned due to lack of creativity
","""Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End"" is the third installment of the franchise and the last that featured director Gore Verbinski and actors Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley. The film managed Academy Award nominations for its visual effects and makeup work, but I found it quite a downgrade compared to the two previous installments. It was the fourth most successful in the United States in terms of box office and continues right where the second film finished one year earlier, namely with Jack Sparrow's (alleged) death. With the return of Barbossa at the end of film number 2, it left me with high hopes for the third. Almost all of them were disappointed. Maybe one reason was that these films kept getting longer and the third did almost hit three hours and had many insignificant scenes that could have been completely left out.<br/><br/>The Navy now is in complete control of Davy Jones as they have his heart. This was one of the major letdowns. Davy Jones was a pretty interesting villain, but when they showed him as a string puppet controlled by the Navy, who also is shown quite vulnerable in the face of a previous love affair with Calypso (useless character in my opinion), all the magic is gone. He was nobody who needed any more character development. What he needed was to be scary and ruthless just like he was in the second film. Captain Sparrow won't appear until 30 minutes into the movie. I am not a great fan of Depp as an actor, but he does a good job with the franchise I believe and when he is off screen, there is just something missing. Bloom does not have the talent or personality to carry a film like this. Also the whole reviving Sparrow story felt a bit shoddy to me. Also why would people, seconds after they don't kill each other because gun powder got wet, act like colleagues, almost friends again. This did not make any sense.<br/><br/>Then there is the whole Yun-Fat Chow Asian related subplot. None of this wowed me at all and even the parts intended as funny in-between, like the foul breath sending him down the plank, couldn't really make me smile. The main villain here was a real human for the first time and I did not like that. Barbossa and Davy Jones were just so much cooler. Visually, there is not much wrong with this one, but storywise it is all a huge mess. Elizabeth Swann's sudden rise to power felt really unrealistic. Her being a Japanese Kriemhild was cringeworthy at times and that was really the problem of the script, not of her acting. Many people close to her were dying here: the former Commodore and Swann's father to name only two of them. The Brethren Court did not feel interesting at all. There are some pretentious quotes included like the one about living (with yourself) forever and Keith Richards from the Rolling Stones discovering his acting ""talent"" in his late 60s was just so random and weird.<br/><br/>On a more positive note, the monkey and the parrot had some funny moments and the 3 vs 3 meeting with nobody else around was okay too. However, there is really not many more positive things I took from this film. It really dragged a lot and the emotional ending with Swann and Turner on the island just did not manage to deliver the way I hoped it would after everything that happened in this film before. The marriage proposal earlier was also downright bad and felt really thrown in without much thinking from the writers. They must have run out of ideas here. What a shame, especially as the script comes from the same people who did a fine job on PotC 1 and 2. Maybe the story just did not have enough substance for a third movie. I am glad the fourth turned out better again and I hope the same can be said about movies 5 and 6. So far, ""At World's End"" is the weakest installment from the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" series. It is a disappointing ending to the initial trilogy."
"jre-5","1","2","2","31 May 2011"," The worst Disney movie I've ever seen.
","Pirates 1 was great, Pirates 2 was lousy, Pirates 3 is horrible, in fact practically the only reason why I watched it was cause I wanted to know what happens, and it's terrible. There are so many things wrong with it- there are far too many characters, it is too weird, too long, too tragic, and much too confusing.<br/><br/>One of the worst things about it is the story. For a 300 million dollar movie, surely they could've had a halfway decent story. The way that they bring Jack back from the dead is very very strange, not to mention unrealistic. It's so different from how things work in real life that it hardly even makes any sense. I can see why some people may like it, but I think they're going much too far with supernatural items, especially with the things that the witch woman does, and it's ridiculous what happens to her near the end.<br/><br/>There are too many characters involved, and often too many events going on at once. I often could hardly even keep track of who was on what ship. <br/><br/>Another problem is that it's often hard to tell who's good and who's bad, almost everyone, including Jack qualifies for both. It's awful the way that they constantly betray each other, one minute they're allies, and saving each other, and the next minute they're trying to kill each other. Even with Davy Jones it's sometimes hard to tell who's side he's truly on. It's so confusing.<br/><br/>The action scenes and special effects are phenomenal, I can't deny that at all. The problem is that they're going so extreme with these that they really don't feel exciting anymore, especially now that the characters can come back after dieing, they never should've had Jack die, this ruined everything. There were lots of scenes in the first movie that had me really on edge and excited, but almost none in the 2nd and 3rd. Bigger is not always better, they're going too far.<br/><br/>Not only is the story horrible, but it's also very tragic, starting with Elizabeth's father who is killed early in the movie. Why would they do this? I had really been looking forward to him being restored to power. To make matters worse, he could come back like Jack, but for some reason he refuses. James Norrington also gets killed. He was never really a good character, but he's not someone who should've been eliminated. But by far the worst part of all is what happens to Will Turner. He doesn't actually die, but is made into the next captain of the Flying Dutchman, essentially becoming the next Davy Jones, which means that he can only be on land once every 10 years. And it's not like when Jack died in the second movie in which you know that it's going to change, this is permanent, unless they make another movie that takes place at least 10 years later. WHY WOULD THEY END IT LIKE THIS? <br/><br/>To sum things up- the action and special effects are extremely impressive, but rather pointless, and the story is horrible. The first movie was good, and usually I really like sequels, but these are getting worse every time. I now have virtually no interest in the 4th."
"VerdantGreen","2","2","2","13 November 2009"," Disappointing, but judge it for yourself
","The first Pirates of the Caribbean movie was a welcome return to the action/adventure genre and was a movie that I thoroughly enjoy watching. The second movie was not as good as the first, but fun nevertheless, a few minor flaws, but nothing that was not forgivable. This movie, however just takes the rip completely.<br/><br/>I will organise this movie's flaws by way of points.<br/><br/>1) The opening scene. The film opens with a bunch of pirates (including a child) being hung. I gather that this was to establish the darkness of this movie, but how exactly is it darker than it was in the previous movies? They hung pirates in the first movie, so how is this worse?<br/><br/>2) One scene involves Eliabeth finding her dead father on the way to Davy Jones' locker and tries to save him, but the voodoo woman does not let her. Um....why not? They brought Barbossa back from the dead, and they are about to bring Jack back from the dead, so how is this different?<br/><br/>3)Chow Yun-Fat. Chow Yun-Fat is NOT in this movie. He appears briefly at the beginning and once again at the end, barely doing or saying anything. It would not have bothered me if he was supposed to be just a cameo appearance, but no. This movie was marketed as starring Chow Yun-Fat, he appeared in the trailer, on posters, on the sides of buses and even on the cover of the DVD. It reminded me of when Darth Vader was put on posters for Revenge of the Sith when he was barely in it (I mean the actual Darth Vader, not Hayden Christensen). Chow Yun-Fat was in this movie for nothing more than publicity.<br/><br/>4) The locker. The whole scene with Jack in the locker was flat out ridiculous. Jack is there with the Black Pearl. But wait, why would Jack still have the Pearl if Davy Jones spent the whole of the last film trying to get it off Jack? Then Jack gets out the Pearl and for no reason starts trying to move it with all his might. Then a million crabs come to life and start moving it for him. I watched this scene in total disbelief that this scene had actually been written by someone and made it past production. It was just ridiculous and non-sensical.<br/><br/>5) The pirate's code. I know that the code was touched upon in the first movie, but it was referred to and I quote ''more like guidelines than actual rules''. So why have these guidelines transformed into a full-blown code that all pirates live by? And why would pirates want to live by a code anyway? They live a life of freedom and lawlessness, so why, why would they have all these rules? They even have a big meeting and establish several 'lords'.<br/><br/>6) The boring-as-hell pirate's meeting. This scene was so boring, repetitious and redundant that it may as well not have been in the film at all. It got the film nowhere, it had no payoff and should have been completely removed from the film during editing.<br/><br/>7) Not faithful to the source material. We all know that the Pirates of the Caribbean films are based on the Walt Disney World ride, which I myself have experienced on several occasions. In the first movie, the writer's had been heavily influenced by the ride and managed to transcend the fun of that ride onto the audience. The second film did this to a forgivable lesser extent. However this film bears no resemblance whatsoever to the ride and captures none of the imagination or fun of the ride or the previous movies.<br/><br/>8) Redundant special effects. The special effects in this movie obviously had a lot of work put into them, but the effects themselves were absolutely ridiculous. Case in point, one scene involves the voodoo woman growing to enormous size (somehow managing not to crush the relatively tiny ship). Then she shouts something incoherently and, get ready for this, I kid you not; she dissolves into a million tiny crabs and vanishes into the ocean. Where is the sense in this scene? Where is the logic? I really should be typing in all capitals here, but IMDb disapproves. This scene was ridiculous, non-sensical and above all, retarded.<br/><br/>9) Length. I think that saying a film is too long is a bit of a lazy criticism, I mean look at The Godfather or Lord of the Rings. These movies can weigh in at up to 3-4 hours long, but captivate us nevertheless. This movie is just under three hours long and trust me, it feels much longer. The pacing of the movie is atrocious and a large number of scenes simply go on far too long.<br/><br/>Some people live by the logic that if you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all. So I must give the one thing I thought was okay in this movie. The acting. The actors in this movie give their best efforts with the preposterous script that they have.<br/><br/>This movie grossed around 950 million dollars worldwide, which is typical of a blockbuster sequel. However I was surprised to see how many people actually liked the movie. You may be one of those people, who right now is sitting awe-struck in front of their computer thinking ''why are their people like you in the world?''. If you are, then fine. I am just giving some warning to those who have not seen the film yet.<br/><br/>I rate this movie at 2/10. The only reason it does not get a 1/10 is because of the efforts put in by the actors and special effects artists. Rent it and decide for yourself."

","I am ashamed to see Disney's name associated with this film. This was definitely not a family movie. It contains graphic violence,gore, perversion, and overall crudeness. <br/><br/>The first scene is the hanging of a small boy and other pirates. You are immediately punched in the face with a disturbing and depressing image. Compared to the rest of the movie this is a tame and cuddly image. However, countless people dangling at the brink of life merely sets the bar high. The rest of the movie is a chaotic struggle to top the previous horrific image. Many children, as well as adults, would find some of it disturbing and hard to take in. <br/><br/>Yet, this reckless display of horror is balanced out with absurd humor that a child would find funny. The movie is riddled with old jokes. To hear yet another and another joke about sea turtles and rum being gone was too much. It is as if the writers said, ""it worked before, maybe if we repeat it a bunch of times it will work again."" I know that many people enjoy the immature and childish humor that movies seem to revolve around today, but enough is enough!<br/><br/>So who was the target audience for this movie? The overstocked stores of Jack Sparrow dolls tell me children, but the gore and sexuality tells me adults. By exposing the audience to polar themes such as stomach wrenching gore to abstract zaniness the movie is in a constant state of imbalance. They're attempt to rope in as many age groups, only succeeds in disappointment for all ages. <br/><br/>I have seen my share of R rated movies. If there are things in here that made me cringe, I can't image what this doing to the impressionable mind of a child that this is marketed to. Men, women, and children were either stabbed, shot, strangled, blown up, suffocated, mangled, or impaled, to the extent to where death was irrelevant. You can't take away the images once you've seen them, and a child will walk a way, not only confused and disappointed, but because this is such a popular movie they will believe that it's acceptable entertainment. <br/><br/>More offensive than the exploitation of a wide children based audience, was the exploitation of the characters we have gotten to know and love. Several main characters were slaughtered. Sure, death doesn't discriminate, but in a Disney movie, it should. It's more that just ""good guys live, bad guys die"". A character's death must have a thought behind. Death should not simply be shock value. They were so untrue to the original characters, by the end of the movie I didn't care what happened to them. <br/><br/>Let's start with the ""villains"", if they can be called that. The super villain Becket, who controlled everyone's fate, justified all of his evilness as being just ""good business."" That's weak. Becket lacked the *umph* of any respectable villain. Barbosa and Davy Jones were stripped of their dignity and respect they earned in the previous movies. The ideal villain must, to some degree, be feared, mysterious, and above all respected by the audience. In this movie I pitied them. <br/><br/>The heroes suffered the same fate at the villains, death by bad writing. Will Turner was probably the most disappointing hero. He turns out to be a blood thirsty jerk. The force that drove Will in the first two movies was honor and love. The pitiable force that drove him in the 3rd was hate and revenge. His obsession with rescuing his father from Davy Jones turned out to be out of control and pointless. The presence of a strong leading lady, Elizabeth, was replaced by an obnoxious object used simply for sex appeal. All respect was literally stripped from Elizabeth in her first scene. I can forgive the writers for trying to invent a reason for making Elizabeth half naked in a fight scene,(have to keep the males entertained), but I seriously question their sanity when they compromised her as a symbol of sex appeal when she dislodges a particularly large musket concealed in her butt (tacky). The fascinating manner and wit of Jack Sparrow was sadly gone. Jack's exuberant character from the first two movies were always balanced by his cunning sophistication and his random flamboyance. The writers of 3 clearly decided that the audience would prefer Jack at a constant, heightened state of abstraction, and that he would be more marketable as a clown side kick.<br/><br/>The plot was scattered through out the movie, mostly in-between the tedious, lengthy fight scenes. The interesting part of the plot, about the pirate lords from the 4 corners of the earth meeting together didn't get deserving attention. The characters are worse off in the end than when they started off in the beginning of the trilogy. After all the speeches about brotherhoods and loyalty the ending theme is ""every man for himself.""<br/><br/>Pirates 1, and even 2, had a consistency about them, but 3 was off the map. At the end of the second movie there were many things I expected to be resolved in the third movie. Such as a confrontation of the Captains Barbosa and Davy Jones. To have two actors of such high caliber in the same movie not meeting is criminal. Even at the end there were still a lot of lose ends that were not tied up.<br/><br/>Many people will disagree when I say how disappointing this movie was, but I propose to them that perhaps they, in their minds, just want it to be good. Because the first two were entertaining and enjoyable, they don't want the conclusion of this epic to end on a sour note. It needs to be looked at objectively. I am a huge fan of Pirates and Disney, and I really wanted this to be good. There were not enough good reasons to redeem it."
"actorlink","8","2","2","21 October 2007"," Pirates Should Be Pirates!
","I am unable to understand the need to overcomplicate plots in Hollywood these days. It seems to be the trend of the contemporary film but I think it's a disease and an urgent cure is needed! It's either too many twists, often boring the viewer instead of working to grab his interest, or too many generic patterns! The first of this trilogy held my attention well and offered a welcome surprise. I had grown nostalgic for the classic adventure genre and reminisced my days as a youth when films like Indiana Jones added excitement to the realms of the big screen. Curse Of The Black Pearl was in my view a pleasant deviation from the wannabe quick thrill action flick of the current day.<br/><br/>Captain Sparrow offered a hero female audiences could swoon over for good reason. Let's face it we all fantasized defiant pirates during some stage of our childhood! They certainly held my fascination when I was a little girl.<br/><br/>Unlike the initial movie though, Dead Man's Chest had disappointed me because it played too much on certain aspects of the rebel captain's character that were off-putting. He appeared far too effeminate, cowardly and comical. I believe his humorous punch lines were enough for the comedy element and his character didn't need to be degraded to a farce through baby jargon and girly flee from the scene to survive tactics! The drunkenness and eccentricity of Sparrow in part one of the trilogy were enough to maintain the mystery that infatuates audiences with lead roles.<br/><br/>Thankfully World's End is closer to Curse Of The Black Pearl in the sense that it doesn't present as cowardly a Sparrow as Dead Man's Chest but although I will contradict my comment on the generic style of action movies nowadays, some things should remain as they were in older eras for a reason. We all seek escapism through a hero who toys with death and isn't afraid to embrace danger. Pirates should be pirates: rough cut, rope-swinging, free spirits.<br/><br/>Which brings me to the excellent portrayal given by Geoffrey Rush and Keith Richards. Rush as Barbossa is every bit the outlaw of the high seas, embodying thrills and territory that shouldn't be trespassed without thought. Richards creates mystery and an aura of fear. His presence spells danger, exactly the way an exciting pirate's should.<br/><br/>World's End runs too long. After the awe of part 1 was spoiled for me with the way Depp's character was written, I haven't been able to feel the same way. What the actor did with the role was magic. The sexy grungy appearance of Sparrow and hints at an eccentric rum-drinking sea master with many legends backing his reputation were all part of the enchantment for viewers. But the director and script writers should have drawn the line when it came to the motives of the Black Pearl's captain. ""Save my own butt"" and that's all that matters isn't really turn on material. Neither is the new age effeminacy. We want our leading men strong and larger than life! That will never change! We love pirates because they defy, challenge, test, roam free, put up with hardships and risk death. World's End is better than Dead Man's Chest but movie makers should pay attention to the main principles that made the 80s adventure genre work: simplicity. Keeping the plot simple does not always mean resorting to pedestrian role portrayals. It just means allowing the opportunity for audiences to escape to a new world and dream for a while that they are swinging from mast to mast with the heroes without having to ponder for too long how something happened and why it did.<br/><br/>Films like Indiana Jones, Romancing The Stone/Jewel Of The Nile and for a more recent example The Mummy, worked because they had simple elements: fun, adventure, handsome/masculine heroes, gorgeous/thrill-seeking heroines, comical/greedy/cowardly little antagonists and scary villains for contrast. If you're gonna return to the adventure genre you must do it right. Times have changed but human instinct and what appeals to us has remained the same. We're still primitive inside. At least the film ended in a true pirate way: ""Drink up me mateys!"""

","Watching this movie was something I'll never forget. It was absolutely something I will treasure forever. This entire trilogy is something I'll never forget. I've never had another set of movies do to me what this one has done.<br/><br/>When I was little I always had a thing for movies. I always loved them more than most people. But when in 2003 the first Pirates came out I became addicted to them. It was the first time that I couldn't explain how I felt about a movie, because it moved me that much. Then when the second Pirates came out I had my ticket for opening day days in advance & I even dressed up for the showing. I was amazed how once again I was just blown away by a movie. Now 4 years since the first film I am a 16 year old sophomore in high school, my ticket was bought weeks in advance & again I was dressed up. Sitting there watching it I couldn't believe what I was seeing. It was like magic. To this day I can't explain what this trilogy means to me to other people. It honestly changed my life. When I think of certain quotes from the three films tears come to my eyes because they have such meaning for me. This is a trilogy that I know I will watch hundreds of times, I'll be able to share it with my children, & my grandchildren. I'll be able to grow up with it, just like a whole other generation before me has grown up with Star Wars, Indiana Jones, & The Godfather trilogies. I'll never be able to put a price on how much this set of films means to me."

","Although I may be partially biased in my rating of this film because I LOVE the series, I must say that I was genuinely impressed. My only real doubt is how they will top it in the upcoming sequel that is, of course, inevitable. The film opens, much like the others, with a chilly, grey scene of a mass hanging overseen by the tyrannical Lord Beckett, but a sword-fight in a Singapore bathhouse between Chinese pirate lords and our heroes (Jack being temporarily replaced by the compellingly devilish Barbossa) soon thrusts the film into action. Viewers will be stunned, cheer, scream, be confused (mostly about the happenings in the parallel world of the dead that is Davy Jones' locker) and, quite possibly, cry from all that is put into this mind-boggling third epic. The focus of the series moves even further from Jack, who continues to engage more in buffoonery, although thankfully less. Previously Jack was the focus of the film as well as the character whose antics give the film some of its appeal and hold it together, but now, after briefly stopping for heroic, adorable Will, the focus has now shifted towards Elizabeth, who makes an impressive and welcome transition from beautiful damsel in distress to still-pretty Pirate Queen who is totally capable of kicking her fair share of ass. This is one second sequel that totally delivers everything expected! But the adventure continues on..."
"mbrook6","10","2","2","26 May 2007"," I was really surprised by At World's End.
","Turning a ride into a movie is risky. Turning that wildly successful movie based on a ride into an epic trilogy with budgets of $300,000,000 a piece and running times of almost three hours each is almost akin to investing in ""Sahara"". I agree that DMC definitely had its share of glaring problems (i.e. that entire waste of time with Jack and the natives). In addition, the shift in tone to from the more lighthearted aspects of the first one into the emotional and complicated story lines of epics was off putting at first. I enjoyed it, but it took another watching for me to appreciate the movie, and to fast-forward through the natives. At World's End did not suffer from any of these problems. Arguably, a few of the talky scenes could have been trimmed, but every other frame of the movie is used to masterfully tie up the three movies as a semi-cohesive and vastly entertaining trilogy. After the bastardization of Spiderman, I walked into another second sequel with an enormous cast and even larger budget with trepidation. I was blown away. The special effects were truly awe inspiring. Davy Jones continues to be the finest example of what CGI can do when used correctly, and the maelstrom finale is just jaw dropping. However, unlike Spiderman 3, the special effects do not move the movie or the storyline, the characters do. Despite the enormous amounts of money and time that goes into the final battle sequence, it is still about people, love, loss, fear, and that is why is so much more successful than Spidey 3 or X3. They did not forget that no one really cares about a glorified video game. Despite raising the bar for special effects to unimaginable heights, At World's End never loses sight of the fact that we really like these people and care about the story. Despite the complaints that the story is complicated and it does beg a few continuity questions, everyone involved gave everything they had to make this upward hill battle a rousing success."

It definitely has the best ship fights of all of them and an awesome ending. Plenty of comedy on behalf of all the cast(near all) and while I was never a huge fan of Orlando Bloom he did a lot(LOT!) better than the last two. And as usual, Johnny Depp is hilarious and cool. A lot of the story is finally explained but don't watch this if you haven't seen the first two. My friend went with me and he had no Idea what was going on. But the movie isn't confusing. Visual effects are awesome! They finale make me give looks of awe that I did for King Kong and maybe even impress me even more than KIng Kong.

","To dare or not to dare... that's the question. And most movies, especially the big ones, tend to lean to the latter. They don't dare. They give you what you expect (and, in effect, thus always less). Most movies play it safe. 'At World's End,' on the other hand, doesn't. It dares. And in a big way too. In that respect it's just like it's two predecessors, where the constant charting of a new course was the order of the day  and in all respects  be it acting-wise, staging, plotting, what have you.  So, is this closing chapter of (this particular) trilogy a perfect film? Most likely not. Some of what's happening is beyond me, some seems missing on occasion, some too much. But, you know, that's just fine. To wind up at a dead-end or two (before picking up steam again) is what happens when you go where no one has gone before. And this particular journey is always fun. I cannot remember a movie where every  and I mean literally every  new frame holds a surprise, brings a new turn of events, offers up a new world. So some of it doesn't stick. Some doesn't work. Who cares? These are pirates for crying out loud! If they don't dare who would?  And the unpredictability of the characters featured in these tales is exactly the kind of unpredictability the artists make perfect use off in telling them. Here's form following function for you! To think now that this would entail just mere childish playing around, as some critics have suggested, would in my view be to seriously underestimate the cleverness (and the prowess!!) of those at the helm  be they the producers, the director or, in particular, the writers. They know their game, the stories of sea-faring men of yore, the tales told below deck, of the end of the world, where dragons live, of men who lose their hearts (and souls) to the sea, where the heaving of a hidden treasure might just bring about the resurrection of ones soul. Myths all of them are, sure. Just like Jack, Will, Liz, Davy and the lot of them  neither one of them really alive nor (for ever) dead. Present they may be but not tangible. To me, that's magic in it's purest form. Rarely have I been so entertained. Rarely have the years of my life been pealed off so perfectly back to the time when the world seemed endless to me, and full of adventure. When everything I could dream of was possible, at least in my mind. When I dared, too  even (or especially) if the sword I was fighting foes with was as imaginary as they were. If you're up for a trip into another world  and a trip in more ways then just one, this is the ticket to buy. That's if you dare."

","After enjoying the first Pirates moderately, and becoming a bigger fan of the series with number two movie, I am sad to report that the third installment completely lacks the action, humor and sheer fun of the first two movies. I'm amazed that the same people who put together the great romps of the two first movies could produce something as altogether lackluster as this one. Looong story with maaaany ho-hum relationships, and a lot of the story and the relationships are not followed up on in the end. And where's the humor? There were maybe two chuckle-out-louds in this movie. It was ridiculously boring to sit through.<br/><br/>The most unforgivable aspect of the movie is the TOTAL LACK OF ACTION!! Every time something big is about to happen, something else happens which totally defuses the situation. Even in the climax, after setting up a huge naval battle, all we get is two or three ships clashing, and then the entire rest of the fleet just turns around and leaves. This is one of the most disappointing blockbusters I've ever had the misfortune to watch. Boy oh boy, what a misfire.<br/><br/>3 out of 10."

","After Spider-man 3. (which could have worked very well if Sam Raimi was not pressed to include the character of Venom) and Shrek the Third (with about 10 new characters taking away time and plot from the heroes) Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End suffers from the same fate: too many characters, too many story lines in one movie. It is not a problem for me that the series transformed from the pirates/horror/adventure genre to pure fantasy by its end; the problem is in this movie we have about ten characters who have their own storyline, their own aims and it's a, hard to follow and really care b, simply too much for a movie (or two movies cut in a half); this many characters should have a TV series not a movie. Of course this also means that the characters from the original have a bit less screen time than they should, while the new characters don't necessarily bring too much to the table. For example, Chow Yun-Fat's character is simply not too well developed and you can see even the writers could not really find out what to do with him. About the 'old' characters: Davy Jones is more interesting now than in the previous installment (and his f/x is even more credible); Will Turner is still not too entertaining (but at least he does not have too much screen time), Elisabeth is okay, Barbossa makes a really welcome return, and Jack Sparrow... Well he is Johnny Depp. I felt his role was overplayed (not by him; by the direction) in Dead Man's Chest; now this is not the case; now he is simply not as entertaining as before due some post-mortal craziness. Actually these 'crazy' scenes are a bit bizarre (but at least this is something really new, not only rehashing old jokes). Compared to Dead Man's Chest: 1. there are less jokes (and still there are some bad and badly played jokes just like in the first and second movies), the tone is more serious which is okay for me 2. no classic fun actions like the one with the wheel or the bone cages; instead of them the last one hour of the movie rocks; very spectacular. 3. between actions and Jack Sparrow scenes DMC had totally boring and senseless dialog's. This one still has lots of quite boring dialog's in its second third but they are acceptable (they could have been trimmed by deleting some less interesting story lines; as I have mentioned in the beginning, this is the biggest problem with the movie).<br/><br/>But unlike Spider-Man 3. or Shrek the Third, the movie is not lower in quality than the previous one; while in some aspects it is even slightly better, for the first two thirds it is a bit less entertaining. Still, quite a good ending for the series.<br/><br/>(By the way, if you are a Pirates fan, watch Sinbad - Legend of the Seven Seas. You will be surprised how many elements were 'stolen' from that movie alone.)"
"Jay_Exiomo","5","18","37","23 May 2007"," Third go's more exhausting than thrilling
","Capping a month of underachieving third installments, ""Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End"" suffers the same problem as its immediate predecessor has: it's too long and overstuffed. It's visually arresting up to a certain point but one might get a case of blockbuster fatigue long before every subplot (and there are lots) has been resolved. It's essentially a sugar rush, initially appealing, and then exhausting, finally leaving one bloated and dazed.<br/><br/>Picking up after the events of ""Dead Man's Chest"", ""At World's End"" begins with a crew composed of Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley), and Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) journeying into the World's End, where Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) has been held up after his encounter with the Kraken. Then together with Captain Sao Feng (Chow Yun-Fat) of Singapore and other pirates that comprise the Brethren of the Coast, they set the stage for a large scale battle with Lord Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander), who has been determined to eradicate piracy. With Jones' heart  and consequently his service  in tow, Beckett poses a threat to the pirates' survival. Jack and the others now have to go up against The Flying Dutchman, Jones' ship from which no ordinary ship stands a chance.<br/><br/>While ""At World's End"" does the job in terms of action scenes during the climax, it does so at the expense of its running time. Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio's script is confusing and it takes too long to get to its main point with gratuitously intricate plot lines that get the better of what should have been a straightforward escapist fare. By the time the film gets to the main course, the abundant starters have already more than filled one up.<br/><br/>It doesn't help that much of the novelty and zing of the franchise is missing. Sure, Depp has still enough verve to deliver some of the film's limited amusing scenes but the film's myriad of characters constantly yanks one out of his character that eventually, one might wish there would be less of others and more of Captain Jack (not literally though, if you get the drift). There's also not much intimidating factor as far as villains go resulting to a lack of tension, and with so much turncoats going around it's hard to actually know who you're supposed to be rooting for.<br/><br/>As far as spectacle is concerned, ""At World's End"" succeeds. But it's too self-absorbed with its own mythology, cramming so many elements and achieving little. Fans of the franchise probably won't mind; but to everyone else, it's a sorry exercise of overindulgence.<br/><br/>And, oh yeah, you might want to stick around after the credits for an extra scene that hints, well, another go for a ride."

Even the scriptwriters themselves felt the need to remind the audience that they had, indeed, seen the first film, by including ""nostalgic"" throwback jokes every twelve minutes. These were thrown in amongst the already- contorted plot, with more subplots than tentacles on Davy Jones' face (and, like the tentacles, most of them ended with gaping holes).<br/><br/>Please, see this movie in all its brilliant absurdity, its terrific incongruity, its epic stupidity."
"kenchu","3","20","43","24 May 2007"," Not as good as the two first ones
","Let's face it... Jack Sparrow is the character who make Pirates of the Caribbean so good. I totally love Jack Sparrow. Ever since the first time I saw him in the second movie, ""Dead mans chest"", I fell in love with his personality. Jack Sparrow, the slightly deranged person with that immovable self-confidence, making an excellent foundation for extremely funny scenes. You just gotta love him.<br/><br/>That is why I didn't like ""At Worlds End"". The Jack Sparrow being depicted in it isn't the Jack Sparrow I know. Instead of being that so utterly cool person, ""he's"" now just weird and, quite frankly, scary - in a bad way. Sure, there are some brilliant ideas being presented in ""At Worlds End"" with Jack Sparrow, but the scenes in which they are in always tend to be unsatisfying in the end. It's like they're trying to build up something unbelievably funny and add more and more strangeness to the scene, and in the end it really wasn't anything more than just that - strange - resulting in a big ""meh?"".<br/><br/>And it's just not Jack Sparrow, there are more things. For example, when it came to all the ""grandiose"" scenes, and when all that powerful music started setting in, it didn't feel right. The music being played wasn't coherent with what I felt about that being displayed on the screen. Instead of being exciting and all that, it was just silly.<br/><br/>There were some good and funny things about this movie here and there, but they were far from frequent enough to weigh up the overall poorness of it. One can only hope that Jack Sparrow will return in yet another movie, to set things right."

And don't get me wrong: I really liked the first movie. I got the impression that someone put together different parts of a puzzle - which don't fit - just to boast ""wow, did you see that!? We can do ... whatever"" Okay, Johnny Depp is great. I like his acting throughout the 3 ""POTC""-movies. Still, that's not enough to make a good movie.

","After the end credits of POTC3 which last fifteen minutes, one's head is spinning. How could thousands of people who contributed to this idiotic movie believe it had anything going for it? The problem here is the problem of life: meaning. Virtually any movie that makes even a token stab at meaning is better than this, which doesn't even try. Each meaningless, arbitrary development arrives and is dispensed with without ever engaging a viewer. Your eyes are occupied by the shrill visuals, but none of it reaches your brain. About ten myth extensions show up the very second they're needed to get the characters to another special effects sequence, which is dependably more overdeveloped, tedious and moronic than the last. It's all pointless and loud. Ultimately the myth in the movie has no internal logic whatsoever. Because the plot arrives only as needed, up until the ending, a viewer has no hope of figuring out if the movie has two big sequences left or twelve. All this and a villain who's a total femmy wussbag.<br/><br/>I lost interest in deciphering the stupid plot at about the 20 minute mark, and I was numb loooong before it ended. Any of Sparrow's charm or Depps talent from the 1st film is now completely squeezed off the screen. A whirlpool sequence goes on for twenty five minutes until any semblance of a threat has been neutered. That goes for every sequence. Here's how you can write POTC4: Add another rule to the myth, crank the volume & blow some sh*t up. The movie is also a study of bad skin.<br/><br/>The duo who are supposed to be the comic relief are some sort of weak, corny writing I haven't seen since the 70s. It's family-oriented crap like you might see in Pete's Dragon.<br/><br/>The first movie was a comedy, a pirate movie and a romance BUT became a blockbuster. The next two went straight for blockbuster, and just became crap. Noisy. Insipid. incoherent. shrill. exhausting. bloated. charmless. laughless. overproduced. overdeveloped; the same hideous qualities that we refused to watch in musicals from the 60s & 70s. How did we get to a place where we think this is entertaining instead of stupid and obnoxious? ...Oh that's right, Star Wars killed the 1970s film renaissance, and introduced thoughtles drivel as the norm.<br/><br/>At World's End is every bit as terrible as Dead Man's Chest, which I walked out of at the 2 hour mark.<br/><br/>The AMC theater chain owes me two hours of air conditioning after turning it off after the first hour.

","The politics of summer movies is strange indeed. Critics seem particularly out of tune of viewers excepting for gross ranking. After the second weekend, word of mouth trumps advertising, so it will be interesting to see how this current crop is rated by IMDb viewers after that. As action movies go, what matters to me first is the cinematic experience. Story, characters and such need only be sufficient to give an excuse for optical adventure. That's why I like Stephen Sommers and Peter Jackson. They understand dimension, and provide it to me in ways that are new and exciting.<br/><br/>""Spiderman"" in all three episodes should have been at least as good as the best. Instead, as with all the Marvel productions, it was far less rewarding than average. They are boring if you can't get excited about the characters; I just can't imagine anyone who could. We need a ""Doctor Strange"" movie. And we need some other filmmakers than have been seen in the Marvel corral.<br/><br/>For that Doctor Strange movie, we could do a lot, lot worse than go with Verbinski. I'm impressed by this movie. It's not of the ""King King"" class, but it has quite a few interesting elements.<br/><br/>What most people will remark on is the characters, led by Depp. They are good enough excepting the ""girl"" pirate who is so far below the others in charisma it will set female imagination back a couple decades. It was a mistake made in the original, a soccer snooker that we got stuck with. We needed Geena Davis, or her successor. If Geena was the new Sigourney, who's the new Geena?<br/><br/>The story is very well tuned to my mind. Every major character has some duplicity, not all of which we can guess or even understand after we get the whole movie. I believe they did this to give the movie legs, so that it will be watched over and over again after the opening honeymoon is over. But it has an effect that I appreciate: the narrative is sliced and diced as we jump from story to story and shifting intents. Its by some otherwise crass writers, but in this context doesn't seem overlarge.<br/><br/>What's nice are two cinematic effects.<br/><br/>The first I have remarked on before. The intent of the film is to merge cinema with theme park, a unified monetizing strategy with two different media. That means the film is more extremely architectural and spatial than usual. A reward for those of us who appreciate space. As with the two previous films, each episode on a ship establishes the ship first as a space, and then the characters within. Its rare; its hard; its effective; it empowers imagination and lucid dreaming. And probably sells Disneyland ride tickets as well.<br/><br/>The second cinematic value I appreciated was the variety of styles and effects. Usually a summer blockbuster is pretty much the same noise from beginning to end, with the only variety coming from the different tools used by the effects subcontractors who lead different action scenes. But there was so much design here as we moved from one storyline to another, it made the thing seem as if we were visiting different rooms, each with its own world dynamics. Its most obvious when we first see Sparrow in his limbo, a ship frozen Shackleton- wise in a smooth surface of ice. This, by the way really does quote the amazing Hurley photos of this very real episode in history. Somebody knew their history of cinema and pushed that perceptron button.<br/><br/>That business about crab-stones is inspired. (Oddly the paired effect  when Kalipso is ""unleashed""  is the least memorable in the film.) The idea of having Depp encounter versions of himself is extremely clever and I know of no one else who could have pulled it off. Its what he does in his mind when acting anyway. These scenes justify the ticket price.<br/><br/>This isn't the best adventure film, but surely the best of the season, and definitely worth watching.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."
"sportsguru19","4","24","55","24 May 2007"," Can't wait for the director's commentary on this one...
","If not for the success that was the original film I hardly would've been motivated to go see 3 after sitting through 2. If not for Depp, and his always entertaining and fascinating character, and the lovely Keira Knightley this movie would be wholely miss-able. The first film was the only stand alone of the bunch you can watch that and be content at the conclusion though once you have begun the 2nd there is no choice but to sit through almost 6 hours of film to complete the story. The bizarre nature and confusion of this saga coupled with the fact that they leave so many parts open-ended so as to leave one wondering, ""Pirates 4?"" Foreshadowing and minor omissions also mar this film. Items that might otherwise come as a shock were ruined by glaring hints one can't help but miss while other aspects were left out completely leaving one to assume events took place that would seem fitting to show.<br/><br/>Overall it is a long tale that will leave you with many questions of the trilogy wondering why they tried to do way to much with it, for it surely wasn't for lack of time (the whole series runs well over 7 and a half hours). If not for Depp and Keira this film was truly lost at sea. Bloom's persistent presence is another blemish on the film as his character, for another film in his life, is entirely hatable."

I like much of the added plot, with Davy Jones's locker, the new pirates, and especially, the multiple Jack Sparrow's. Don't be confused by the somewhat confusing intersecting plots; as far as I can tell, everything makes sense eventually. The only real problem I had with the story is with the final sea battle where many, many people are killed on screen. I remember that the second movie had lots of death at the end, but it didn't seem as real with the giant tentacles as it does in this finale. And for a movie that's supposed to have a romance at its core, the resulting union between Elizabeth and Will is a little sad because of the subsequent curse. Overall, I enjoyed this more than the second film, and as a trilogy, this is a very satisfying way to kill a weekend watching TV."

","If ever a film prematurely broadcasts a sequel, it's ""Pirates of the Caribbean 3: At World's End."" Halfway through the three-hour plus feature, one gets the distinct feeling that there will be another installment. Near the end, there is no doubt Capt. Jack Sparrow & Co. will be back for more.<br/><br/>Especially if these movies continue to almost double their predecessor's take.<br/><br/>Here, no expense is spared in CGI, effects, cinematography, set design and location costs. It's too bad the story is a bit muddled (certainly not as much as ""Dead Man's Chest"") and the running time is too long.<br/><br/>Other than that, part three is all about action and entertainment with a few nice twists at the conclusion. It about 40 minutes too long, but what there is of it, holds one s attention fairly well.<br/><br/>Here's the plot - if I can synopsize it with any clarity: Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) is in the Land of the Dead (the Bonneville Salt Flats) where he is doomed to haul the Black Pearl over the alabaster turf for eternity.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the British-sponsored East India Company (led by Lord Cutler Beckett - Thomas Hollander) has cracked down on Pirates throughout the Pacific Rim (aided by the Flying Dutchman), hanging dozens of criminals and their associates in efficient, economical multiple executions.<br/><br/>In far off Singapore, Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightly) and Capt. Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush, Oscar winner for ""Shine"") meet with Asian pirate lord, Sao Feng (Yun Fat-Chow, ""The Replacement Killers,"" ""Bulletproof Monk"") to convince him and his charges to oppose the EIC. A series of firefights, however, disrupts those plans -for a while, at least.<br/><br/>William Turner (Orlando Bloom), sent to serve on the Flying Dutchman to pay the penance for Sparrow's misdeeds, once again vows to his father, Bootstrap Bill (Stellan Skarsgard), to deliver him from the clutches of Davy Jones (Bill Nighy).<br/><br/>Finally sailing ""over the edge and over again,"" Barbossa, Swann and the pirates rescue Jack and begin sailing to Shipwreck Island to meet with all nine pirate lords to discuss the freeing of the Goddess Calypso (Naomie Harris), who has assumed human form.<br/><br/>Later, in the movie's most unintentionally hilarious scene, during the climactic battle between the forces of Davy Jones, the East India Company and the pirate federation, Calypso begins to grow until she resembles a 50-foot Michael Jackson. I cannot think of anything creepier than that, friends.<br/><br/>Some highlights include Sparrow's hallucinating conversations with himself; thousands of rocks/crabs that transport the Black Pearl through the desert; a gory hanging sequence; some typical swashbuckling and daring-do; beautiful set locations from the Bahamas to Singapore to the Antartic; and some decent acting (for this type of film).<br/><br/>Moments of incredulity do occur, such as Lord Beckett's complete idiocy as an 18th century English sea commander, Swann's conversion into a silly Ang Lee heroine and some overdone subplots, but overall, the experience is a positive one.<br/><br/>Critics and others who say this completes the trilogy, though, must not have watched the film as I did, since the ambiguous conclusion leaves no resolution and the last frames almost announce to the world, ""Argh! There be a sequel coming!""<br/><br/>Also, while it may be a chore to some, try to sit through all of the credits for a small but interesting payoff."

At best, the cinema was always a lesser art, but at least it once had some claim to be called one. Chaplin, Hitchcock, Ford, Welles, Bergman and Kurosawa are a few names that randomly come to mind. But now we are living in the age of Jerry Bruckheimer, who compares to any of the aforementioned luminaries in roughly the same way that Salieri's footman's chamber pot compares to Mozart. Yes, I know it's supposed to be mindless entertainment, and there has undoubtedly always been mindless entertainment of one kind or another, but how low can human beings descend before they start to devolve back into slugs?<br/><br/>I deliberately waited until the ""trilogy"" was finished (if it really is finished), and the dust settled, before uttering any comments, if only because I wanted to reflect upon which of the three films was the most idiotic. Unquestionably, that dubious honor has to go to this one. The first movie at least made some minimal sort of sense, perhaps in the same contorted way that an episode of Spongebob Squarepants makes sense. The second was little more than an incoherent mass of special effects, but at least it mostly obeyed the laws of general science, if not physics. But this one! Good god almighty! Saint Edward D.

So it turns out that the pirates live on a flat earth, and they go sailing off the edge to bring ol' Cap'n Jack back from the land of the dead. Then, in order to return to the land of the living, all they have to do is rock the boat until they flip it over? Really? I had no idea it could be that simple, or that death could be so impermanent. But it only gets worse. I can hardly bear to write about it. Brethren court? Pirate lords? Keith Richards on the way to his twentieth nervous breakdown? If Scheherezade had recited this nonsense to the sultan, he would have had her drawn and quartered on the spot. Please pinch me, slap me, drive nails into my head until I wake up. I used to play better stuff than this when I was three years old. The only ""pirate lords"" I ever heard of (or even imagined) are the ones that sit in the boardrooms of the corporations that control and periodically emit this kind of brain-shriveling rubbish, and the only ""code"" they seem to have is best summarized by the quote from the film given above.<br/><br/>Do yourself a favor.

Instead it ranks next to X-Men: The Last Stand as the worst. <br/><br/>I demand a page 1 rewrite to this...what's the right word...story? The film begins with the hanging of hundreds of people. I thought these films were funny. Then it almost gets back to the right foot, although it skips ahead a ton from part 2 and creates tons of pointless footage before even getting to the rescuing part. Jack's prison however, couldn't have been better. Definitely the best part of the movie, and yes, on par with the first 2. However, after his rescue, everything goes downhill. Literally hundreds of side-characters, no cohesive plot, and never-ending action scenes populate the second half of the movie. Plus, killing off Norrington is the worst plot-twist in any movie...ever.<br/><br/>It seemed like the filmmakers thought there wasn't enough material leftover from the second film to make a third, although there was plenty. The death of the kraken is the most anti-climactic death in a movie...ever! The set-up of the Tia Dalma/Davey Jones romance in the second is not carried out. It's like the filmmakers sat down and decided that it just wan't interesting enough and they needed a character to be ""Calypso: Goddess of the Sea"". Naturally, Tia Dalma got the part. And then, to finish off the abomination of a plot-twist, they don't even do much with Calypso. Just a Mealstrom? She's the goddess of the frickin' sea! <br/><br/>The Pirate Lords was also unnecessary. They just ate up screen-time that could have been dedicated to more important things, like character development. Sao Fen joins the mass of unnecessary characters swimming in a film I would like to call a drifting row-boat, but really it travels head-long the wrong way into a storm of insanity and overall crap.<br/><br/>The Ending is arguably the worst one ever. In ""Dead Man's Chest"" Will promised his father, ""I will not rest until this blade pierces his (Davey Jones) heart."" Not that he himself would stab it! Jack should have stabbed the heart, he would've been happy enough, but no. Plus Beckett needed a far more sticky end. He didn't deserve to go down with the ship. <br/><br/>Finally, as hinted from the first scene, this film is too violent and dark and grisly and has the biggest shown body-count for a film ever. And then there are jokes. It doesn't work. It's too funny too be serious, but too serious to be funny! It doesn't work! This film is undoubtedly the worst Threequel of all time, surpassing X-Men the Last Stand. It is also the worst expensive film of all time, with it's painfully large 300million dollar budget. Most undoubtedly the worst part of the film however is, that they plan to make a fourth, and made enough money to do so. Unless you want to see Pirates 5 6 and 7, don't watch part 4! I know I won't."

The fact that Orlando Bloom is considered an actor and is actually getting work continues to baffle people all over the world. This movie proves once again that Orlando Bloom does not belong on the screen. This movie lacked not only talent (with the exception of Jonny Depp) but it had a serious lack of plot. For most of the movie Jonny Depp is talking to his imaginary self. I hope for everyones sake there will not be a Pirates of the Caribbean 4.

The action is top notch the last 45 minutes whizzed by as its filled with relentless action and very memorable moments. Johnny Depp is hilarious as always as is the rest of the cast. In my opinion the ending is great and it really works well. It has conclusion while yet leaving it open for another one (once you see it you'll know what I'm talking about). The only complaints I have is mostly the same as everyone else's, the plot has a lot of twists and turns thats really hard to follow, and it did seem to run a tad long but like I said these are only minor.<br/><br/>If you want a movie with action, humor, and all around fun go see this movie you'll have a good time and won't be disappointed :)"

","While certainly not up to the first Pirates, this one had some substance and a degree of watchability over the 2nd Pirate. Still, the overall movie was dark and brooding. The subject can be blamed for much of this, but the humor was only an occasional quip or minor sight gag. It lacked the redeeming humor from the first show, but was not so slap-stick outrageous as the second. The length is not as much a problem as the last, but the fight scenes do tend to drag and Depp's sanity bogs down and is tedious almost from the onset. In all, it is worth a look, though many will find the convoluted plot mismanaged and hard to follow."

I give all 3 pirate movies a 10 out of 10 but that is just my opinion. We are all individuals so therefore we have own thoughts about certain things, especially movies. Every movie that ever comes out will either be loved or hated by people and that will never change. Pirates has a fantastic cast who are all very talented and the people behind the scenes on movies like these should be admired for their dedication for brilliance even if you did not like the movie.

"fwomp","8","5","8","5 June 2007"," Length Aside, It's Still A Great Action-Adventure Film
","Placing your brain on cruise control can be fun whenever you watch a film. Thinking takes a backseat to blatant entertainment while you let your worldly cares dwindle away, immersing yourself in a time and place you know never really existed (except in this case, they do, at the Disneyland Parks).<br/><br/>THE PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN series are really the only successful films based on one of Disney's rides. The appallingly bad HAUNTED MANSION shouldn't even be considered here, so I won't mention it again for fear of some poor reader losing their lunch.<br/><br/>For those who've seen the previous two installment in The Pirates Franchise, this one's just as fun if a tad overly plot heavy and exceedingly long (bring your hemorrhoid donut). Clocking it at a whopping 2 hours and 48 minutes it is the longest of the three Pirate films and the lengthiest film this summer. I'm not one to complain about film length, simply because if the movie holds together well I'll sit through it regardless of gluteal discomfort. But this time the complaints about length are justified simply because the many plot lines introduced don't add anything to the film.<br/><br/>This time we find Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp, CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY) in a true bind. He's dead. ""Living"" out his own personal hell within Davey Jones' locker, Jack battles multiple incantations of himself, often killing off these nuisances (Freud would have a field day with this one).<br/><br/>Meanwhile, back in the land of the living, Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush, PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: DEAD MAN'S CHEST), Will Turner (Orlando Bloom, HAVEN) and Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley, STAR WARS EPISODE ONE) need to get Jack back to the land of the living so that they can convene a gathering of pirate lords who will help fight off the dastardly East India Company that threatens to plunge every last pirate ship to the bottom of the sea. And Jack is one of the pirate lords.<br/><br/>Barbossa and his crew sail their ship ""to the end of the world"" and find Jack. They bring him back to the living world (to the dismay of Davey Jones) and proceed with the gathering of pirate lords. The choice is made to fight the East India Company after some heated debate and a surprising election. This is also where we get to meet Captain Teague (Keith Richards), the keeper of the Pirate Code. Richard's is spot-on perfect for this role and has some hysterically funny dialogue with Depp.<br/><br/>There's a lot more going on, too. Will turner is determined to free his father, Bootstrap Bill (Stellan Skarsgard, BEOWULF & GRENDEL), from the clutches of Davey Jones' boat. Elizabeth simply wants to get Jack because ...well ...I'm not sure why. It seems she's a bit confused as to her love-life, too. Will she choose Will Turner, Jack, or someone else? Barbossa simply wants to keep The Black Pearl to himself and will do almost anything to insure it. Calypso turns out to be someone we've known for some time and it is her revealing that takes up most of the useless time added to the length of the film. A ""relationship"" between Calypso and Davey Jones (Bill Nighy, SHAUN OF THE DEAD) is hinted at but then summarily dropped Â— and rightfully so.<br/><br/>There's also the nonexistent demise of Governor Swann (Jonathan Pryce, BROTHERS OF THE HEAD) which, although seen through the eyes of his daughter, Elizabeth (Knightley), feels completely lost amidst the substantial length of the film (I believe this entire bit took up about 60 seconds of film time).<br/><br/>Now that I've completely thrashed Pirates 3, you might be wondering about my positive rating. Well, the Pirate Films were never meant to be taken too seriously. They are conspicuous action entertainment and, on that level, this newest movie succeeds quite well. Never a yawn shall escape your maw while watching this, I'd wager. The ship battles. The sword fights. The storms. The ship battles while there are sword fights going on within a storm. It's just fun to watch. And Johnny Depp is his usually wonderful self as the swashbuckling and sashaying Captain Sparrow."

","Despite the 2 hour and 45 minute length of this film, the story remained lively and entertaining throughout. Excellent acting performances were delivered in the leading roles, and the cinematography was very impressive. CGI seamlessly blended in with reality throughout this impressive film, and it is hard to distinguish reality from the pirate world we are swept into during the course of this movie.<br/><br/>I absolutely loved the 1st Pirates, but the second one was a bit overdone and just didn't work for me; there were dull moments and weaknesses in the story line of #2. This third installment, however, was quite possibly the best of the three. The first was hard to compare with, because it was something entirely new, yet this one takes the series to an entirely different level. At World's End is among the best movies to come out in modern times with respect to musical score, special effects, and creativity of story line. Jonny Depp also delivers one of his best performances 'till date in this one.<br/><br/>The level of imagination went into the story was remarkable, and what great promise has been established for future sequels! I was especially impressed to see how well the various qualities of this production were seamlessly intertwined to deliver an exhilarating, uplifting, and awe-inspiring journey from beginning to end.

"Carycomic","10","5","8","1 June 2007"," Things have come full circle. Or, have they?
","OK! Just as there was no actual depiction of Jack Sparrow being captured, between ""Curse of the Black Pearl"" and ""Dead Man's Chest,"" so it is with ""At World's End."" Specifically; we--the audience--do not actually see Lord Beckett coerce the captain of the FLYING DUTCHMAN into working for the (thinly-disguised) British East India Company. It is merely referred to in explanatory exposition. Backed up, a little bit later, by the discovery of the Kraken's corpse.<br/><br/>That, however, is this film's only flaw. The rest of it is just as delightfully macabre as the first one. From the opening action-packed sequence in Singapore (where Barbosa, Elizabeth, and Will have to steal a map to the Gateway of the Afterlife). To the purgatory where Jack Sparrow commands a crew of hallucinatory clones of himself. From the revelation that the FLYING DUTCHMAN is actually supposed to be guiding the souls of those who recently died at sea. To Elizabeth's shocking discovery that her father is one of those recently deceased.<br/><br/>Yet, the biggest surprise of all (and I mean that, literally) is Naomie Harris. Her character, Tia Dalma, turns out to be more than just a French West Indian voodoo priestess. She's actually Calypso, the ancient sea goddess! <br/><br/>Man! What terrific CGI in her transformation scene. Including what might have been a subtle double-entendre (although, I have no way to prove it).<br/><br/>In short, this film is well worth the price of admission. So, I'm only going to post one more spoiler. The ending hints at the possibility of a POTC 4.<br/><br/>We can but hope, me hearties!"

But ""Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End"", is the biggest let down I have ever seen. I kept waiting for ""POTC: At Worlds End"" to get better, but after the first hour went by I realized this wasn't going to happen and began to wait for it to end, but it seemed that also wasn't going to happen any time soon either as I looked at my watch more and more. The humour and heart put into the first two films is gone, replaced by jokes that are cheap and forced. The only time I genuinely laughed was when Keith Richards made his cameo appearance, but it was 130 minutes too late and then he had left the screen almost as soon as he entered it, as the next hour of extreme boredom began. Orlando Bloom seemed as bored as I was, and I don't blame him as his lines were beyond cringe worthy. Johnny Depp's performance as Jack Sparrow was just a load of recycled crap which came off as annoying, not funny. Even though Johnny, to give him credit, tried to spice it up a little he failed. The movie also seemed to rely completely on CGI during some scenes in a attempt to distract the audience from the awful plot, plus the dialogue was terrible and very confusing, it seemed they were just making it up as they went along, cramming the movie with plot twists and characters becoming traitors for no apparent reason. A lot of the time I didn't even understand what the characters were saying, but I really didn't care.<br/><br/>Overall this was a huge disappointment, and I strongly recommend you don't bother wasting three hours of your life watching this. It's a huge shame, as I once considered myself a ""Pirates of the Carribbean"" fan. This just goes to show three times is not the charm, 2/10"

","This may be a biased review, but I am not really a big fan of the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise. I mean the first one was pretty okay, it was fun and enjoyable. The second one was okay, but it kind of felt more like Jack Sparrow mania. The third one was just horrible. This movie felt like it was a half hour too long, and it felt like they could've cut a lot of it out. It felt like some of the scenes didn't make sense. Also, some of the scenes dragged on at some points. And the humor that is usually in the movies was just worn out, and just awkward, and by the end pathetic. And towards the end, they try to tie up random loose ends like Will and Elizabeth's relationship during the final battle. During that scene, I was like really. And the whole relationship between Davy Jones and Tia Dalma, just felt ridiculous, and just didn't make sense when Calypso was revealed. It felt more like the second movie, more like a Johnny Depp fest even though he didn't appear in the movie until about thirty minutes in. I really wanted to like this movie more than I thought I would. But I didn't. The worst part of the movie was I kept thinking why was everyone praising this movie as the best movie ever, and Spider-Man 3 the worst movie ever. For the record, neither Pirates 3 or Spider-Man 3 is either the best or worst movie ever. Here's why I brought up Spider-Man 3. Pirates 3 is on the same level as Spider-Man 3. Both featured too many extra characters, both felt too long, both dragged at times, and had numurous plot holes. The only difference is that I thought Spider-Man 3 did it better than Pirates 3. Why would people hate a movie for many reasons, but like a movie even though the same things are in the same movie that everyone hated? It just seemed hypocritical. Sure, the whole Spider-Man 3 comparison might of been irrelevant, but I just thought of it when I was forced to watch Pirates 3. It's the not the worst movie of all time, but it is one of my least favorites."

","First off, i really liked the first movie (The curse of the black pearl). I thought it was a fun action movie with great acting from Rush and Depp. Heck, even Orlando was O.K.<br/><br/>Now the final movie in the trilogy is a very confusing movie. I admit i didn't ""get"" the plot when i first watched it. THe sheer amount of characters is amazing. We have Jack Sparrow, Turner, Swan, Barbossa, Norrington, Davy Jones, Calypso and more... That's right. The movie has so many main characters and so many side-characters it get's totally lost. Before the end i didn't know who was supposed to be the good guy, who was this calypso and where did she come from, why is Jack doing certain things etc. I read they didn't start shooting with a finished script and i must say, it shows. Introduction of a major character in the last part of the movie, with no mention of the character in previous films. You can just see it was a last minute decision. So after re-watching the second and this part, reading the FAQ here, i ""got"" the plot. It's not that the film requires too much thinking to be understood, this isn't 2001 Space Odessey, it's just complicated due to bad script writing.<br/><br/>As for the acting, the only one i liked was Rush. He does just the right amount of silly acting whilst others don't do so well. Depp is back and is a bit annoying as Sparrow. He almost made the first movie, while here he's a bit too wacky. An idiot at times. Orlando Bloom's character is confusing, since now he's pirate? What's the point? He was supposed to be the upstanding, honest guy. Doesn't bring much to the table. Knightly is just plain bad. Don't think it has much to do with her but more with the script. She came from a lady turned semi-pirate, in the first movie, to Xena the warrior princess in this one. It's really stupid the way she gives a motivational speech to the pirates about their battle for freedom (pirates=freedom get it?). And the constant shot's of her shouting ""FIRE"" just so out of character...<br/><br/>On the whole, the trilogy shouldn't have been made. The first movie was a light fun movie. The second was effects heavy and started to complicate things. Didn't have the charm of the first and Sparrow turned into an idiot. The last is just plain bad."
"fearfulofspiders","4","3","4","6 September 2008"," Not A Whole Lot Going On For This Picture...
","The Curse of the Black Pearl was a very nice summer film that made me laugh and gasp. Dead Man's Chest wasn't funny, and even with some nice fight sequences, I didn't gasp. At World's End didn't improve, and only made me gasp at a waste of a nearly $300 million budget for such a clunker in terms of story, character, and action. Highly disappointed that Pirates of the Caribbean slowly decreased in ""power"".<br/><br/>While Dead Man's Chest and At World's End may be some of the biggest blockbusters yet, they ultimately fail in giving us anything new. Johnny Depp's portrayal as Captain Jack Sparrow is tired, and unfunny. What sparked laughs from the first are reduced to ho-hum jokes that seem ripped from Shrek the Third. Orlando Bloom is okay, though his tone in some scenes can go astray. Keira Knightley made me laugh the most, because for how sexy she may be, she cannot deliver a battle speech to save her life. Geoffrey Rush is the best of the bunch, but his lines are just too over-the-top at times.<br/><br/>Hans Zimmer's score is better than Dead Man's Chest, which had hardly any originality and only one interesting theme. The music for At World's End soars during some tracks, and the romantic theme is probably the best piece of music of 2007. Though the score as a whole is disappointing, as when it is not sweeping or soaring, it is boring with the quirky theme of Sparrow's madness. Well worth a buy, though slightly disappointing.<br/><br/>The visual effects are amazing, and probably the only thing that lasts from start to finish and always clings onto its realism. However, there's just too many. The special effects overwhelm the story, and instead of being awed by the action, it is the look of Davy Jones that has everyone's eyes.<br/><br/>The script is the ultimate killer of this film. By taking what worked in the first and the second, they (the writers) have infused it with a nonsensical story, where our characters have no motives, and the plot is revolving around the climactic battle. Well worth a Razzie for some of the most dimwitted dialogue, corny and o-l-d jokes, and some lackluster action scenes.<br/><br/>All in all, I wouldn't say that Pirates of the Caribbean -- each movie separately -- is awful, it's just poorly written. Gore Verbinski's direction sheerly lacks an eye for story, but is keen on eye-candy. There's some things that work in At World's End, and a whole lot that doesn't (i.e. the releasing of Calypso's body was just hilarious, and totally silly... that could've used hundreds of rewrites).<br/><br/>I recommend seeing all of the Pirates of the Caribbean films, just for mindless entertainment. They're simple films with character's that have no distinguishable motives, nice music, and intriguing visuals."

","The Good:<br/><br/>GREAT cast. Some nice costumes (though I've honestly seen better on Xena). Good score. Great bloopers. Moments (fleeting) of genuine interest and/or pathos.<br/><br/>The Bad:<br/><br/>What was UP with the plot??? I spent most of my time totally confused. Characters deviated massively from previous direction. Depp's characterizations (I hesitate to call it ""acting"") were less energetic, focused, and purposeful than previous versions. Too. Many. Freaking. Explosions. We have seen it, seen it, seen it. Likewise ""sticky"" sound effects and ""gross-out"" humor. The absolutely pointless folderal of making Elizabeth the pirate king and then having her turn all her power over to men and then -- what? Pirate king? No idea what you're talking about (the plot devise disappeared). The ending -- pick whichever one you like, it was emotionally unsatisfying.<br/><br/>The picture showed some promise by taking a much darker turn than the first two, but the plot was so impossibly & ludicrously tangled that it sank under its own weight. And after all the time we've invested in the various characters, to have so many killed off or otherwise sidelined, not to mention the ridiculous fate of Will -- I just don't even have the words. A betrayal of the audience. These are supposed to be old-fashioned adventure flicks, not Wuthering Heights, for pete's sake.<br/><br/>Take Frank Capra's advice and cut the third reel. Focus on tight plot and development of characters along pre-existing arcs. Have some strong, compelling over-arching value that the plot is connected to. (The value could've easily been ""freedom"" but it became ""freedom from this confusing mass of explosions."") SHOW THE CONSEQUENCES OF ACTIONS. Elizabeth's near non-reaction to her father's death, and the fact that it had zero impact on her relationship with Will, was one of only a bajillion examples of plot grenades launched at the audience.<br/><br/>A good pair of scissors, or perhaps a flow-chart of Current Betrayals on the left side of the screen, could have made all the difference."

This was probably the first time I didn't even care to learn how the movie ended or what happened to the characters in the end. I simply couldn't bare to watch it. And then I remembered how good was the first Pirates of the Cariibean movie and how much I liked it. Second one was okay, I suppose...But the third one left me wondering how does one go from The Curse of the Black Pearl to this???"

","The following is a quote given by Johnny Depp's Captain Jack Sparrow in the disaster that is Pirates of the Caribbean: At Worlds End. The same quote could not only be used to describe the film, but also Depp's performance as well. Been there, done that. Nothing is remotely interesting at all in this film. Not the special effects, the dialogue , etc. It is just one gigantic bore fest.<br/><br/>The whole film really feels in a way, pointless. Countless double crosses and backstabs. Character inconsistency after inconsistency. It just goes on and on and on. And then there is Orlando Bloom, who tries giving his Will Turner character a more of a harder edge... and yet he comes out reminding me of Pierce Bronsan's James Bond. The worst of it all though, belongs to Keira Knightley and her 'speech'.<br/><br/>Bloody pirates."

","The first Pirates movie is great. The second one is alright. I feel disappointed with the third Pirates movie. Every good movie should be acted by good actor, directed by a nice director and containing an attractive story. The third Pirates movie is acted by good actor, directed by a nice director but containing a BAD story which destroyed the good impressions of the audiences. The plot of the movie is fragmented so that the audiences cannot understand the movie well. Some scenes are piled up and it is boring and unnecessary, especially the dialogue between Swann and Sao Feng, so that the movie can last about 2 hours and 40 minutes. In this 2 hours and 40 minutes, about one-fourth of it is trashy. Thanks god that some scenes had already been cut away. There are many jokes in this movie but just a few of them are funny. It is definitely a waste to invite those famous and senior actors or actresses to act this movie. It destroy the whole Pirates series."

","This film is shockingly bad. The 1st amused, after the second i thought 'ok it was not great but they're building up to the finale' but this 3rd installment is a travesty to all of cinema. if this is the future for films, and after the money they made (of which unfortunately i contributed my own money) and the 7+ rating it has on here i fear it might be, then i may never go to the cinema again. i mean the acting is bad (at best), even Depp can't carry it, Orlando Bland is the worst culprit, and Knightley is not far behind at by any stretch. <br/><br/>*may contain spoilers* knightly as the head pirate? the Giant woman made from crabs? the final scene? and many more poor points<br/><br/>i asked myself did they even have a script, later to find out that they wrote it as they went along..boy you could tell<br/><br/>1 outa 10 at a stretch... give me my 3 hours backkk please?"

","***MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS*** I was in deep regret that i went to watch this film when I came out after watching it. i didn't expect that quality of the storyline and direction would fall to such a low level in the third installment. What were they thinking about when making the film???<br/><br/>The only high-point of the film was its starting. The treatment of the World's End was well enough. But again a lot of explanation was lacking regarding how Jack Sparrow reached that place after facing the Cragon in the 2nd part. Was he dead or alive?? everything's a mystery and those silly crabs were worth forgetting. But at that part the film still looked bearable and hence the five stars i've given it. but after that it slumps into a kind of pit from where it never manages to come out. characters keep coming and going without any effect. there were hardly any laughs compared to pirates-1 and 2nd. the characters didn't inspire at all. they were trying to show their emotions but looked more comic without any laughs. it was a confused plot and no substance at all. Davy Jones came up with his love story but in vain. It didn't inspire at all. The East India Company looked devoid of any sort of drive and enthusiasm. But the biggest letdown was very little screen-time for Jack Sparrow. He hardly had great scenes in the movie.<br/><br/>Overall it was a sorry affair and i hope they don't think about continuing the series. It's all over and out for the Pirates. Gore Verbinski should look for some other story now. Depp should hunt for some other character."

","I loved this movie, it was full of excitement. Most characters were very well done, all funny and believable. The action was continual, and if there was no action it was compensated by humor and a great story. Speaking of the story, it was such a complex story, I loved it. Being a vivid fan of potc I managed to catch up with enough ease but my mom was too slow to catch up, so anyone who has either not understood the 2 first movies or never seen them you should either watch or re watch the two first movies once more. The effects were the best of all the movies, the fight scenes were so thrilling that I did not even go to the washroom. The battleship in the swirling water was so awesome too, everything about the movie was great. I will not reveal the end but everyone should watch it, its such a good movie. Go watch it!"

","Once again a mind-blowing accomplishment of visual effects, sound, and editing which makes a strong case for finest blockbuster of a dire summer 2007 cinematic campaign. The third installment in ""The Pirates of the Caribbean"" series sees a whole wide range of characters from the first two films linking up once again in a crazed and whacked ""Around the World in 80 Days""-styled saga where seemingly every player is not quite what they seem and all have their own individual motives. A dark alliance between the British (led by Tom Hollander) and ghost ship captain Bill Nighy has joined together to try to rid the globe of pirates forever. Orlando Bloom is still trying to save his father (Stellen Skarsgard), while Keira Knightley's own father (Jonathan Pryce) may be in danger. And of course there is Johnny Depp, the straw that stirs the entire series. In a wild and somewhat schizophrenic role, Depp dominates once again playing arguably the greatest cinematic character since Anthony Hopkins' Hannibal Lecter in ""The Silence of the Lambs"". Former Oscar-winner Geoffrey Rush is back well-deservedly as the prototypical pirate captain, one of seemingly dozens from around the world that show up here (Chow Yun Fat is particularly memorable as an oceanic boss from Singapore). Even Keith Richards, who Depp's Jack Sparrow has always been said to be based upon, shines as the superstar's father who holds secrets for all pirates within. Once again, the screenplay is window-dressing to give all performers their moment in the sun. The film is nearly three hours long, but it still sails effortlessly through potentially dangerous movie-making waters to be a highly fun and entertaining crowd pleaser. Director Gore Verbinski deserves a standing ovation tackling a concept which has always had somewhat primitive beginnings (being based on a thrill ride at a theme park) and sometimes even more primitive story advancements. Technologically superior and just plain fun, ""The Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End"" is a roller coaster ride of epic summer proportions. 4 stars out of 5."

","In don't want to get into detail into PotC(Pirates of the Caribbean) because its would contain spoiler beyond belief and i think everybody should wait to see it so i will give a slim review.<br/><br/>PotC is very fun but a little dull. It provides a reason for everything in the, has some nice sets, and a couple of bad-a$$ action scenes. There is some comedic scenes in parts to brighten up the mood, which everyone likes. I liked this movie because of Johnny Depp. He brought excitement and interest to the movie which kept me nailed to the seat and watching. <br/><br/>The bads... There was really a a lot of very SMALL things that were bad. For one, when the action was over, it was OVER in a SNAP! There was a lot of talking, boring talking at that. That almost made me sleep, but the thought that this was the last one kept me awake and then some action scenes pop up which makes the movie more interesting. But if i think about it, the talking was very well placed to calm down the situation. <br/><br/>IN the end, i think PotC was very good, and even I thought Will was going to WHOO her, well you'll see."

","It's really a great movie, characters, action, music, visual effects, story, and script. Johnny -in this series- has made the role of his life, excellent, it cannot be better. Geoffrey Rush shines in his best. Orlando Bloom's role steps backward, and unfortunately, Knightley's role is too too wide for her, she's still young -in experience- to fit in. A pitfall in the series (as i see) and in most movies, where and when could an innocent, princess-like girl learn fighting and sword arts?

","Pirates 3 is up there with one of the most entertaining movies of the summer. There's no denying that. It's hard to hate Jack Sparrow with his flamboyant charm and his funny dialogue. He's just a lovable character, and many others than myself agree to that definitely. As the third film in this series, it's definitely a great stand out compared to most ""threequels"". Like the Ocean's movie series, the 1st one still stands out as the best, the 2nd one sort of disappoints, while the 3rd one lives up to it's expectations, even if it doesn't surpass the 1st one. I'm very glad that we didn't have to wait another three years to watch this movie just like we did with Dead Man's Chest, which left me dissatisfied with the results, but Jack Sparrow was great as usual.<br/><br/>Awaiting for this movie, I didn't know what to expect. Now that I have seen it, it was definitely more violent, and pretty much so for a Disney movie. But it still maintained that feeling of what Pirates of the Caribbean is all about. I was also intrigued by Keira Knightley's performance, as she stands out quite a bit more here. The return of Geoffrey Rush is also a great treat. Finally, the intense battles sum up the pure entertainment of this film. This is why we go to the movies, to enjoy ourselves, and Pirates 3 gave us that enjoyment.<br/><br/>All in all, this movie will not disappoint fans of the Pirates series at all. Like I said, while the 1st one still maintains the height of all three, this one comes closer than the 2nd one. Go watch it now while it's still in theaters! By the way, make sure you stay after the credits to watch an extra scene."

Amazing battles, magnificent special effects and ships and stuff, plenty of laugh(especially there with the rock-crabs that carry the ship) and the most unusual but romantic (for me at least) wedding. The end though left me very disappointed. First I cried when I thought that Will had died but then I see him as captain of the Dutchman. That was definitely worse than death. And it was very unfair that he just got married to her and he only could see her one time every ten years. I mean, what would happen as she grows older? And eventually she will die. Of course then he could stab his heart himself, die and meet with her in heaven. Well, conclusion: It really blew me away. It was absolutely fantastic. I can't wait for the next one( if there is)."

"freebird-64","7","12","25","24 May 2007"," Redeemed by a streak of anarchic comedy
","By any objective standard, Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End does not work. It is ineptly directed by Gore Verbinski, who turns the action set-pieces into chaotic hash while failing to make the movie's convoluted plot coherent. Its script (by Ted Elliot and Terry Rossio is a mish-mash of twists and developments that ultimately lead nowhere. The movie's second act, in particular, may leave the audience feeling as tipsy and off balance as Jack Sparrow himself, with the characters pursuing their own agendas while confusing plot twists fly aplenty. The climactic showdown involving the Black Pearl and the Flying Dutchman is by turns chaotic, generic and confusing.<br/><br/>But, guess what, I still left the theater smiling. Why? Simply because the filmmakers seem to have acknowledged their weaknesses and given At World's End a streak of absurd comedy that its predecessor, Dead Man's Chest, did not have. Its as if they decided to give in to the anarchic, fun-loving spirit of Jack Sparrow.<br/><br/>One example of this approach is the final showdown between the soldiers of the East India Company and the pirates. It starts as a purely generic fight scene. And then in the middle of the scene, Will Turner abruptly asks Elizabeth Swann to marry him. When she accepts they ask Captain Barbossa to do the honors. The result is a loony delight, with Turner and Swann kicking soldier butt while pledging eternal fealty, and Barbossa enjoining Will to kiss the bride in between gunshots.<br/><br/>The intention to fill the film with absurd comedy is actually communicated early in the film with the first appearance of Jack Sparrow. He is aboard the beached Black Pearl, which is now crewed by duplicates of him. The real Jack then proceeds to shot one of them in order to gain possession of a single pea. Shortly after that, a group of white crabs carries the Black Pearl back to the sea.<br/><br/>If that's not enough, just wait till you find out what the Brethren Court's nine pieces of eight actually are. Or Captain Teague's (Keith Richards) morbid response when Jack asks him, ""How's Mum?"" The movie actually opens with a scene you thought you would never see in a Disney movie: mass hangings conducted by Becket's men, with a child as one of the victims.<br/><br/>The film also possesses a surprising sweetness and melancholy. Witness the reunion of Tia Dalma and Davy Jones, in which Jones momentarily regains his humanity. Or the final fate of Will and Elizabeth, which is either incredibly romantic or incredibly sad, or a combination of both. Either way it's oddly life affirming, particularly a brief coda that happens after the end-credits (so stick around for it).<br/><br/>One victim of the film's inept execution is its attempt at social relevance. In some interviews the filmmakers have said that At World's End is a kind of anti-globalization fable, with the East Asia Company cast in the role of a ravenous corporation gobbling everything in its path and the pirates as small traders who fight the corporation for the right to exist. But if that was part of their intention, sorry, but it definitely does not communicate this message in the midst of the film's general atmosphere of mayhem.<br/><br/>Definitely, props have to be given to the actors for whatever success At World's End achieves. Johnny Depp is predictably outstanding, but Geoffrey Rush is just as good. Even Keira Knightly gets to boost her game; at one point she even gets to deliver a ""Braveheart""-like speech about the need to fight for freedom. But Orlando Bloom remains bland, and Chow Yun-Fat is wasted in an underdeveloped role as Capt. Sao Feng.<br/><br/>Definitely Dead Man's Chest will go down in history as one of the most undeserving films ever to earn a billion dollars at the global box-office. But At World's End redeems the franchise somewhat, even as one hopes that the producers choose to end the series on this (somewhat) high note."

Just dreadful.<br/><br/>Let's start with the constant ""multi-Jack"" scenes which would have been good for a laugh in a 1 minute bit, but were used repeatedly taking 20 minutes of screen time and adding nothing to the entertainment value of the show.<br/><br/>Then we have a split ending, one that had promise with Jack on his way to another adventure while the other was a horrible fate for the Swans."

","Pirates III, in my opinion, is better than the second, but not as good as the first. Where Pirates II seemed to be in-cohesive, Pirates III offers resolution to the various topics opened in the second installment.<br/><br/>Captain Jack doesn't come across as funny in the third film, but I suspect that's because we have come to know and love him, so all his eccentricities, which were humorous in the first film, have become a part of him to the point we no longer see them as funny, but just part of his charm.<br/><br/>There's a surrealistic sequence somewhere in the middle of the film which reminds me a little of Close Encounters of the Third Kind, and that's one of my favorite parts of the movie. A close second is little Jack's performance. But Jonny Depp is incomparable, and he's by far one of the greatest actors of our time.<br/><br/>Special effects are wonderful, and over the top (which works in a film of this nature).

"elfflame","9","4","6","18 June 2007"," The best of the series
","If you are a fan, go see this movie. It is the best of the trilogy, hands down. And I never say that about sequels, so that's saying something. It is the perfect culmination of everything that's come before.<br/><br/>Just go.<br/><br/>Now...for the spoilery bits...<br/><br/>There was one of two ways this movie could go. It could devolve into a mess of nonsense that no one could follow, or worse, try to copy itself. Or it could follow up on everything we've seen these two movies leading up to. It did the latter. Perfectly. Now, if you didn't care so much about the first two films, or didn't pay attention to them, you'll get lost within the first ten minutes. But if you're a fan? It's absolutely amazing.<br/><br/>Let us not forget that this movie started out about a little girl with a dream and a wish. Elizabeth is the centre of these movies in so many ways. She is the one who has the medallion. She is the one who loves the idea of pirates, and freedom. In the second film, she is the one who doesn't trust Beckett and takes her fate into her own hands. Jack has his own agenda--not that we ever have any clue what it is. As does Will--when he's not letting others push him around. It's Elizabeth who gives the movies their backbone and direction. Without her, it all falls apart. Not only did Keira stand up to her role in this movie, but she literally blew me away. From the moment she appears on screen, she's stronger and more amazing than she was in either of the first two films.<br/><br/>But she's not the only one who's finally gotten a backbone. For me, one of Will's failings in the first two films is that he's such a wimp. His sole purpose in life is to respond to how others think of him. We get a small glimpse of who he might be once in a while, particularly the scene in Curse where he finally takes his fate into his own hands and ""fixes"" the curse. Not here. Finally he has a true purpose. Yes, it's still about someone, but for once he's standing up for himself, and willing to really do what it takes to get what he wants. He's so much stronger in this film than in either of the others. I just love him so much more. Oh, and his hair at the end just made me drool. *happysigh*<br/><br/>I was completely impressed with the complexity of this story. The first was rather straight-forward, and the second, while a bit complex, was only a bit more so. For this to be a summer movie, especially of the blockbuster variety, was incredibly impressive. I came out of the theatre completely satisfied that every loose end that needed to be was tied up. I loved it.<br/><br/>Favorite bits:<br/><br/>* The song gave me chills.<br/><br/>* The Asian pirate town and Shipwreck Cove, or whatever that pirate town was called, were both absolutely cool. I particularly love the first view of the pirate city, all lit up. It was gorgeous.<br/><br/>* Pentell and Ragetti were wonderful as always, and their new little friends at the end of the movie were great. :D If any continuation of this should be made, it should definitely focus on those four.<br/><br/>* The moment the Black Pearl crested the sand dune, I knew they'd done it right. So perfect.<br/><br/>* Loved the mythos in this. They took everything in the first two films and added more that just made it work. Particularly the addition of Callypso. I loved the parallel between Callypso and Davey Jones and Elizabeth and Will. And the idea that one of the other pirates might have thought Elizabeth was Callypso was terrific.<br/><br/>* Keith Richards's cameo was lovely, and I loved seeing he and Johnny on-screen together.<br/><br/>* The pirate council was terrific, particularly the fact that each pirate was obviously a different nationality. I also loved that their pieces of eight were pieces of junk, and that Ragetti's been hiding Barbossa's the whole time.<br/><br/>* Oh, and while we're on Ragetti? Him breaking the spell on Callypso was gorgeous.<br/><br/>* The ""rocking the boat"" scene was great.<br/><br/>* Seeing Davey Jones's original form was lovely, and the scene between he and Tia Dalma was perfect and so bittersweet...<br/><br/>* And that was the best wedding ever. And the climax of the fight--with Jack and Davey followed by Will and Elizabeth and Bootstrap... Even expecting something, the fullness of the scene was so unexpected as to startle anyone watching. Excellently done, and the wedding only lent to it.<br/><br/>* Bootstrap Bill's part in this film was so poignant...between his memory loss, and his role in his son's fate... Amazingly well-done.<br/><br/>And whatever you do? Do not leave before the end of the credits!"
"Polaris_DiB","5","4","6","18 June 2007"," How to make a successful trilogy.
","Here's how contemporary trilogies work: the first movie introduces characters and circumstances that capture the imagination. The second movie goes by the rule ""the same, only more of it"". The third movie has the same rule as the second movie, but this time it twists the situations around a bit more and organizes the characters differently. Often the third film is known as ""darker than the other two"" (have you ever noticed how often that happens?). Thus, we have Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End, the almost three-hour action adventure story featuring Jack Sparrow.<br/><br/>I like it! But then again, who doesn't? It's exactly what it promises to be, and that's what makes it good. The rule of thumb for this situation is, if you liked the other two, then you'll like this one. If you didn't like the other two, then why are you even taking the time to read a review of this one? C'mon man, it's more of the same! Just go out to see it like you're supposed to.<br/><br/>Anyway, the plot is a little lengthy and convoluted to detail in this space at this moment (plus I'm still a little exhausted from it, so it's kind of hard to write all that much about it), but the whole company is back and battling the forces of evil, which I think is the trading company and their new merger, The Flying Dutchman, but since the ongoing joke is that pirates are only self-interested, really it's more like a continuous saga of bickering with each other. Captain Barbossa is back, but unfortunately Geoffrey Rush and Johnny Depp aren't given as much time to be foils to each other, which is literally the relationship that set off the series and really made the first movie so much fun to watch. However, at least there's enough Jack to go around and have seconds, and best of all, there's the scene where Jack goes slowly insane... which is one of the most fun and funniest moments in contemporary mainstream cinema! I loved it! If there's anything I would really say is ""poor"" about this movie, it would be the unfortunate tendency of the music to play over the dialog. Actually, on that note, I'd really appreciate it if somebody could e-mail me and tell me what, precisely, giant Calypso was saying, as I kind of want to know and was very disappointed when I couldn't hear past that ""Womm woomm grarrr raaahhh!"" tempestual voice she had.<br/><br/>--PolarisDiB"

To do this they try to get all the pirate lords together to fight. I find this movie very funny at most parts and the fight scenes are amazing.

Anyways, these pirate movies are so good. Now admittedly, I like the first one the best but part 3 was a good ending/closure point. I used to like part 2 a lot until I saw it everyday on STARZ...then I got bored with it. The plot at times is a little confusing. Maybe that is the only bad thing about it. I really didn't like how cartoony they made Jack's madness turn out but that doesn't really bug me. Personally, I'd take Barbosa over Jack. Barbosa is a bad ass. Jack's just Johnny Depp acting weird (big stretch eh?) as in all his movies. Good, enjoyable film. 8/10."

"grlonfire80","9","4","6","5 June 2007"," Don't Worry The Third Pirates Movie Is Better Than The Second
","I loved Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, so I was a little disappointed by the second movie, which was...well...not as good as the first. But I knew a third one would shortly follow it, so I was hoping that it could make up for all that was bad in Dead Man's Chest and hopefully wrap up the story properly. However, after seeing both Shrek 3 and Spiderman 3, I was feeling very apprehensive that POTC 3 would do much better. (Shrek 3 is not terrible, but save your money and don't see Spiderman 3, rent it when it comes out on DVD and as soon as Tobey starts dressing in all black, looking emo, and dancing, just skip the scene, and maybe the movie will seem alright to you.) The movie however starts out with a very serious hanging scene and some child singing...mirroring the opening of the first movie. I was like ""yes! it might actually be good!"" And it was.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp was brilliant, adding a whole new layer to the crazy Jack Sparrow and even showing a more serious layer behind the character who really hasn't been explored as much as the others. Geoffery Rush was awesome and is possibly the character that the Second movie needed because he brings the pirate spirit back to the pirate movie. Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightly's characters are fighting for a large part of the beginning, and although it is not fully explained why they work it out, just assume that true love conquers all, and let it go. Also, be sure to stay after the credits to learn more about their love relationship. Speaking of love, Davy Jones and his love get a more fleshed out story line, which was also not completely explained, but Davy Jones's story is at least finally explained. Keith Richards's character was not a huge roll, but was much more than just a cameo, so I was happy. The character Tia Dalma was excellent! As for everyone else that I haven't mentioned, they were all very good--I have no complaints.<br/><br/>As for the plot, well it is filled with back to back betrayals and the switching of sides happens possibly more often than Dead Man's Chest, only it isn't as hard to follow. The only part that gets a little confusing is the nine pieces of eight...because the line explaining it properly is delivered too suddenly. The main reason the plot is less confusing is because the majority of the plot just adds to the characters' stories, which is a good thing for me.<br/><br/>The couple of things that were probably over done was the over stereotyping of the other pirates from the other countries. Captain Sao Feng was the only character that was not completely a terrible stereotype, and that is only because the character is given a more detailed story in the film. There were also a ridiculous amount of lines referring back to past movie jokes. The first few were fine...but they manage to cross the limit on how many times you can do it before it takes away from the movie.<br/><br/>Basically: Pirates is funny and entertaining. I still cared about the characters and enjoyed the new ones as well. It was much better than Dead Man's Chest and a good addition to the series. It was a feast for the eyes and was action packed. I liked, I loved it, I saw it twice, I'll probably see it again and I'm going to buy the DVD."

","The Pirates of the Caribbean is one I will never forgotten. The scene are very cool and spectacular, but not the best. The characters in some scene are fun and with the excellent actuation of Johnny Depp this film show to us the spectacular adventure in the sea.<br/><br/>In ""At world's End"" the film show different scenes of each character, like Sparrow, Elisabeth, David Jones, and others characters. The best part of the movie in my opinion was the figth in the sea with David jones and the grapics are very cool.

"Sparrowmaniac","10","4","6","2 June 2007"," A worthy ending to a dazzling trilogy
","Like last year, pirates is the best movie of this summer as well. Hands down, the swashbuckling Jack Sparrow, the suave Hector Barbossa the courageous Elizabeth Swann and the determined William Turner. All of them together in one 3 hour epic. At World's End is the one movie, which really brings out the truth about Pirates as a whole. Betrayals for their own needs. Throughout the movie until the very end, almost everyone is ready to defy anything to match their own needs. Every character throughout the whole trilogy has some say in this movie. Apart from the aforementioned four, the sensational Sao Feng, the good minded Jack Norrington, the evil Davey Jones, the comic Raghetti and Pintel(There are many more, rest assured). Each and everyone meets out their ends.<br/><br/>This last part of the trilogy starts off with death, signifying the end of the realm of piracy. but things get interesting from there on. Action packed and fast paced, we witness the fellowship of pirates braving the strong winds, the chilly weather to get to Davey Jones' locker. The story moves on and after they all get out of the locker, things get even more interesting (and confusing?). Its not until the final parlay is decided upon, that the odd viewer would get to know whats gonna happen. The final battle sequence is one to remember for a long time. The sequence of the Dutchman and the Pearl in the midst of a whirlpool was absolutely mind blowing. Not to forget the witty tactics of Sparrow swinging on a rope. In the end however all works out well. And its strange irony that about the fate of the characters which is so different from the one chalked out in the beginning. Turner becomes the captain of the most notorious ship of the seven seas and Elizabeth becomes the Pirate lord. Sparrow as usual the witty sailor gets his ends meted out floating on a dingy with his destination on course, Barbossa suffers from Jack Sparrow's wit.<br/><br/>The producers did leave an opening for a sequel and I pray they do so. This entire trilogy was great. I never thought that only 3 years after the Lord Of The Rings we will be showcased to such a epic event of this magnitude. But undoubtedly Captain Jack Sparrow will be one of the most coveted and unforgettable characters in Hollywood history.<br/><br/>No point harping on the cinematic of the movie. Right from the acting, the direction, the background score, the plot, screenplay, cinematography, visual effects. Everything was stunningly exquisite. Although one might say that it was a tad to long. But I felt it was just about right. Though I did feel Gore Verbinsky had too many sub plots. And that might have bogged the movie down a slight bit. He could have played the sub plots a bit longer that would have put a lot more focus on them, or could have clipped a few of them.<br/><br/>Needless to say this should be showered with Oscars. Thank you Jerry Bruckheimer for a wonderful trilogy. Thank you Gore Verbinsky for an epic cinematic experience. And thank you Johnny Depp for creating Jack Sparrow."
"dob111283","10","4","6","1 June 2007"," Fantastic conclusion not seen since Return of the King!
","First of all, I'm sure most of you have read the reviews from moronic unintelligent critics, stating that this was confusing, there was too much action, blah blah boo hoo. Well let me be the first to say that if you found this trilogy at all confusing, you need to take an IQ test and review your life, not to mention your lack of credibility for being a critic. This movie was absolutely fantastic, and like the second one, which I thought was the greatest action/adventure movie of all time, this delivers everything you could expect from a fitting end, and more. As much as I thought the second one was superior to part 1, I think this might have been as good as part 2, if not better. This is due largely to the fact that Barbossa was in this one and he was tremendous. Furthermore, to the people that think episode one was the best. It was great and fun, but they went miles above and beyond expectations when they created a deeper, darker storyline that turned this into an epic action/adventure trilogy. I saw At World's end at the 8 oclock showing and I was blown away. This may be have been the best trilogy ever made, with the exception of Lord of the Rings and the original Star Wars. Way to go POTC!!"

I was eager since I saw Dead man's chest about what would it happen next?, and it didn't disappoint me. Throughout the flick I felt different sensations that made enjoyable my time, at the end I discovered a lot of surprises that never would have passed through my mind, that's why I consider it, excellent!.

The whole movie is awesome with some great sword fights and humour especially with the pebble but the last hour is edge on your seat action and completely blows any pirate fans mind away. OK the major complaint is the length and yes it is long but most cinemas have a interval and also i don't think they could of cut out any of the movie without losing any major plot points. Another complaint is that some of it doesn't make sense but its a nine hour trilogy and you cant expect them to get every minor detail to follow up seriously give them a break they have made two great films already and yes it is confusing but Disney is growing up hence the 12A certificate and after a while all the confusing parts seem to make sense.<br/><br/>And to finish of all i can say hats off for pirates 4 they have to make it !!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"dfranzen70","5","10","20","29 May 2007"," Confusing junk - wait for director's cut?
","The third Pirates movie is a bloated carcass that seems to consist solely of people running (or sailing) from Action Scene to Action Scene, with only a convoluted plot to keep them afloat. It doesn't always work.<br/><br/>Clocking in at 165 minutes, ""At World's End"" contains several endings too many. ""Ah,"" you think, ""that's the end!"" and then more stuff happens, and you fall asleep. It's as if the producer (Jerry Bruckheimer, of course) looked at the clock, noticed that a mere two hours had elapsed, and ordered his writing minions to crank out more implausibles to stretch the running time for no apparent reason.<br/><br/>So. Did I like the movie, you wonder? Well, I sat through nearly three hours of it, so I suppose I should find something positive to say. Things blew up, and that was awesome. Plus, I decided that Keira Knightley was far manlier than Orlando Bloom, who I'm told is actually a man. (No, seriously!) And that Johnny Depp wears mascara better than Knightley, who's apparently not a little boy.<br/><br/>All kidding aside, the biggest problem with the movie is that it's overplotted. We make fun of dumb action movies that have minimal plot and are basically excuses for explosions, but here's the mirror image - there's so much going on that the typical viewer will be confused and disoriented. Which is good, I suppose, in that it'll distract him or her from the actual storyline problems.<br/><br/>When we last left the Good Guys, Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) had been claimed by Davy Jones (Bill Nighy) and imprisoned in (believe it or not) Davy Jones' Locker. The resurrected Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), Will Turner (Bloom), and Elizabeth Swann (Knightley) must rescue him. To do so, they have to team up with or defeat or betray Singapore's own legendary pirate, Sao Feng (the wonderful Chow Yun-Fat), as well as various Pirate Lords, the British navy, and so on.<br/><br/>The biggest problem facing Barbossa is that the one force that can help him and the other Pirate Lords against the likes of Lord Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander) is that of an ancient goddess, who has been bound to a human body for years and years. Barbossa wants to unleash the goddess in hopes that she'll aid them all, but clear thinkers around him are more of the mind that she'll instead beat the snot out of them for imprisoning her in the first place. Of course, this being a loud action movie, there's no way in heck she's going to stay bound in a human body, right? Hilarity ensues.<br/><br/>The cast is game, but typically wooden performances by Bloom and Knightley are countered by an equally typically nuanced and often hysterical one by Depp - not to mention a bombastic, scene-stealing turn by Rush. But plot oddities abound. Elizabeth seems awash in makeup that never, ever comes off or smudges in the teeniest, despite one protracted scene taking place in a torrential downpour. I also liked the time Elizabeth was ambushed by British soldiers, one of whom puts her in a headlock; when she recognizes one of the other soldiers, Elizabeth merely throws off her captor's arm and escapes. Why she didn't do this throughout the movie, when she was in constant peril or capture, is a mystery. Or how the entire British navy, upon seeing one of their own ships decimated by pirates, says, ""the hell with this,"" and sails away.<br/><br/>As I implied, though, the movie's murky plot is its ultimate downfall. Who's on whose side? You know going in that there will be treachery, but when a movie has every character essentially turning on every other character, the whole novelty of the doublecross is long since vanished. After a while, you come to expect someone doing someone else wrong, all the more so if those two characters sort of were on the same side at one point earlier in the series. Once you tune out important details like who's on which side, the movie's sort of lost its way.<br/><br/>And here's more bad news. The conventional wisdom in Hollywood now is that franchise films should be three movies long, no more, that three's about the limit for the typical moviegoer. But the ending very strongly hints that there will be a fourth Pirates movie. This might wind up being wishful thinking on the part of Bruckenheimer and director Gore Verbinski (who have done all three movies), rather than reality, as the second and third movies were filmed simultaneously.<br/><br/>All in all, this is a butt-numbing disappointment. If you gotta make it long, make it worth my while. If you're gonna have crap blow up, make it interesting. If you're gonna have double and triple crosses, make me care."

","All movies should not have sequels and Pirates is one of them. There were numerous story lines, not enough action, it was confusing and the only part of the movie that intrigued me was standing in line to get my nachos. Everybody in the movie was hard to understand and the heaven/hell scene with the crabs was weird and not needed. On top of that, the movie seemed to be thrown together and too long. If Johnny Depp wrote off on this movie, he was either drunk or depressed. I thought the second movie was OK but the original is the best out of all three. I don't even think that Mr. Depp previewed this movie, because if he had he would have thought it was horrible. The whole scene with bringing Jack back to reality was stupid. It was like the writers couldn't come up with anything better. IT was a complete flop for me and Ill never get those 3 hours back. TO Disney: MAKE BETTER MOVIES."

","Quick background. i loved the pirates - the first being my favourite. lots of people will not like this movie. they may find it long, slow and not as brilliant as the first couple movies. but i loved it. the feel of the first movies has still carried through - the slightly dark, very real atmosphere to the movie is a complete contrast to the comical natures of almost all the characters. the humour is brilliant - but one must have a penchant for corny humour, silly puns and very graphic humour. but it's not that it's bad. they do it all very well. that was my catch. at one point, one captain is setting up a line and i predicted word for word what he would say...and he said...and i STILL thought it was brilliant because the acting is so above par. corny humour - silly jokes and pirate humour that you must be able to appreciate for it being that and being pulled off. the storyline itself is not that complex and one may feel that parts of it result in anticlimaxes and some parts are left hanging. but overall the story that is trying to be told, is told. for me, it wasn't about all these nitty gritties. it was about the movie as a whole which is pulled off in spectacular fashion and i can't wait to watch it again.<br/><br/>as a footnote - johnny depp - still brilliant as captain jack sparrow with his mannerisms and craziness but in this movie i even think he was one upped by Geoffrey Rush as Barbossa. without doing anything fantastic, he delivered a performance where you wait for his every line - delivered to piratey perfection. BRAVO!!!"
"luna_d_l","6","12","26","23 May 2007"," Doesn't top the first one...
","While I am a huge fan of the Curse of the Black Pearl I feel that number 2 and 3 has moved away from the original style and feeling of the movie. I like number 2 although it's not nearly as good as Curse of the Black Pearl but the delicacy of Captain Sparrow and his adventures are beginning to be so extreme that the story being told is forgotten. That's a shame cause the writers have really made something original here. As for At World's End I think that the tone of the Curse of the Black Pearl has been completely lost. Not that the third movie is bad or anything but the artistic link between the first and the third movie has disappeared. The characters have went from original but still likely to highly unlikely people destined to be something greater than we got the impression of in the first movie (especially Will Turner whose fate has just gone so unrealistic - still love him though). That annoys me a bit. The greatness of the first one was that it was so down to earth in an elegant way. The second and the third has lost that.<br/><br/>With all that said I quite enjoyed At World's End as a movie although there has been put a lot of more simple comic in it which (I'm sorry) makes the mood of the movie pretty ordinary and unoriginal. The spirit of Curse of the Black Pearl has disappeared.<br/><br/>But it was great to see all the characters again after all. The verbal fights between Captain Jack and Barbossa was just great.<br/><br/>All together the third movie doesn't top the first but is still entertaining although in a more ordinary way. Captain Jack will live forever ;)"

","I think poking my eyes out slowly with a fork would have been more fun than sitting through this. Trust me... unless you have seen the movies before this and were REALLY into them do not bother. I can't believe Rolling Stone actually thought this crap deserved a cover. It is very boring, often confusing, no skin from Keira, a muddled plot... shall I go on? I suppose I have to given the ten line minimum for reviews here. I kept watching this sea of fake English accents and affected acting thinking of how much money Johnny Depp is making for this retarded franchise. He probably has a mansion in France thanks to these films and doesn't even bother to learn French while he's there. Do I want my ten dollars back? Yeah- plus the 3 long hours of my life that went with it."

","I was really pleased by this third installment of the POTC series. Overall, I left the theatre feeling satisfied, but still with lots of questions. The audience is presented with a lot of information in POTC 3, honestly too much to be processed in one viewing. Some things were almost too bizarre to take seriously, but by the end of the show they didn't matter. The action scenes were plentiful and exciting, but I felt some of the gore was over the top for younger viewers. There were plenty of twists and the climax left me feeling like I'd had my heart ripped out. The movie was nearly 3 hours long, but the plot continually develops throughout, so I never felt bored. I wouldn't say that this is my favorite movie, but it does the POTC series justice."

This is were most people will cry about it being long and boring. its the same thing that effect the last matrix movie, for some reason people just have a hard time listening to dialog. which i don't see why its explains a lot of whats going on and tying up ends in the story.<br/><br/>This is going to be the action packed movie that people want and also the deep story telling that people will love. unless your just really immature and just want nonstop action. which will take away so much from the movie and story.<br/><br/>I don't want to write much cause i don't like giving away any spoilers. but this movie PG-13? really like thats PUSHING it. its a Disney film. in the first 30 secs about 40 people are killed by hanging.

","Having watched this enchanting end of the trilogy just this morning, I must say I'm still impressed. In a lot of ways, this film is so different from the first two, although the characteristics of Jack Sparrow are certainly back.<br/><br/>The mood is very different from the first too, but that gives it a nice touch as the end of the trilogy. The characters have gone through an evolution and the story becomes more complex because of this. I expected them to react in a very different way, having seen the first films over and over again.<br/><br/>The joking around is back too, with Jack in the lead, but also some nice lines from other characters, such as Elisabeth. Still, it doesn't bother at all, where in the second one, it really did bother that there was an overload of these.<br/><br/>And although it shows the dark sides of people, it surely is the best film in the trilogy to me, hence my title : a pirate's life for me."
"sinncross","6","13","30","23 May 2007"," Three pirates lives for me...
","It all started with a Disney-them park ride being turned into a film adaption. The translation was nothing short of breathtaking, with an amazing story and well-fleshed characters combined with a vast array of fun humour. It would spawn a great sequel which, while on the same grand level, would ultimately prove disappointing in comparison to it's original, albeit the more lifelike feel of the action was refreshing. It's been merely a year since the last outing, but now Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End, is finally back on display.<br/><br/>Following not so long after the events of Dead Man's Chest, Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) and Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), have all traveled to Singapore to steal a of navigational map from the Chinese pirate captain, Sao Feng (Chow Yun-Fat). The map leads to the location of Davy Jone's Locker, where all three hope to rescue Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), but with varying agendas.<br/><br/>Like the two before, Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End tells varying stories driven by individual characters personal motives, and all of these interweave with ease. This is mostly used in regards to the alliance each character has chosen to side with, either the pirates or the Dutch East India Company, but while at first it does make the story more interesting, it becomes rather predictable as the film continues. The various plots are never convoluted , and always fascinating to watch, but they are somewhat undermined by the action scenes which try to be bigger then those from both the previous films. Also, for a lengthy film, nearly three hours, At World's End never feels so, and it's pacing is due to some fine editing.<br/><br/>The graphical achievements set by the film are remarkable, with some exquisitely stunning scenery, and really prove to help the action scenes along, as they are never tacky and always realistic and are meshed with the rest of the live-action with unbelievable subtly. However the action scenes themselves are somewhat of a disappointment. The first battle was well filmed, but thereafter all interpersonal fighting becomes bland and uninspiring, favouring extreme stunts over the grueling fights. The ship battles are, on the whole, powerful, but the final fight at sea is ruined by some idiocy and by the constant humour that appears forced in such intense moments within the film. Also the film attempts to create the same epic proportions found in such films as Lord of the Rings, to the point where it seems to lose it's own identity. The choreography is nothing less then stunning, and some of the more powerful scenes, while revolved around action sequences, are never those with actual fighting shown. Of course the final moments leave room for another sequel, but it's probably best that the franchise be put on hiatus for a while before embarking on a new endeavor.<br/><br/>A characteristic in Pirates of the Caribbean, is the amusing humour, and while At World's End has its good share, the humour itself is somewhat lacking in power. While it does come in various forms throughout the film, it is rare that it brings in the big laughs, relying heavily on only creating smiles. Considering how funny the first film was, it is disappointing that the third can't sustain this element. There are also moments which require the viewer to be familiar with the events of Dead Man's Chest to help produce laughs.<br/><br/>The acting is once again of excellent standard, with Will being courageous as ever, Swann going against the stereotype of a subservient woman, and Jack being, well Jack. However this is one of the few problems plaguing At World's End: character development. Every individual character is still a carbon copy of themselves from the previous film. Besides learning a few tidbits on even fewer characters, the overall cast never grow in any way, and in fact feel stereotyped by their own selves. One interesting development comes in the form of hallucinations Jack has of himself. While somewhat humorous at the times these hallucinations appear throughout the film, they get rather stale quickly and only serve to detract from Jack's personality, and this gives him less of impact in the film then you would expect. This doe however give other characters a chance to dominate the films proceedings instead of having it solely done by Jack.<br/><br/>Being devoid of sex, nudity and language, At Worlds End is not without its violence. It is never graphic by any means, but can seem rather violent for most children.<br/><br/>What started with smooth sailing, and a bumpy voyage, ultimately ends on a satisfyingly note, but it's not the film many would have hoped for. The magic of the original is mostly not present, the characters lack the depth they had captured from the previous installments, and the humour and action is not of an exceptionally high standard. Still, Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End is entertaining, with some gorgeous scenery and choreography, likable characters, and a fulfilling fantasy story :never has the world of pirates from long ago felt so real and fresh.<br/><br/>--- Also available on Entertainment.Wikia ---"

","I loved the Curse of the Black Pearl. It was funny and had a great story line. Dead Man's Chest was OK but no way as good as the first. At World's End I think was a complete waste of time and money. Its just under 3 hours long and I think I only started to enjoy the film in the last hour. Johnny Depp does give another excellent performance as the hilarious Captain Jack Sparrow and I will admit some parts of the film made me laugh. But these were few and far between. I think they should of stopped after the release of the Curse of the Black Pearl. I think the problem with the 2nd and 3rd film is that because they split it into two films they had to fill time and therefore putting in many unnecessary scenes. <br/><br/>I hope that there is not going to be a 4th movie as I think they have completely sunk this ship."

But, apparently the filmmakers did not learn anything from Part II. This was just more of the same. Confusing, boring, with fight scenes that lasted way too long. For a minute I thought that the director had to be Peter Jackson (same thing he did in Lord of the Rings... and King Kong).<br/><br/>Although visually the film was excellent and the special effects were incredible they spent too much time on this and forgot about a story.<br/><br/>Also, what a waste of Keith Richards. What a waste. I had hoped to see him use some of the same mannerisms that Depp used in his character."
"monk_e_fish","8","4","7","24 July 2007"," Unpredictable and exciting
","At one point in the latest Pirates of the Caribbean film, At World's End, one very minor returning character remarks of our returning hero Jack Sparrow: ""Do you think he plans it all out or just makes it up as he goes along?"" The same could easily be said of Pirates writers Ted Elliot and Terry Rossio. Once more, with At World's End, we are faced with a plot that, like its central character, is completely unpredictable, swinging one way and then the other. Naturally, this is both the great charm of the Pirates franchise and of the roguish anti-hero himself but also its achilles heel. For every unexpected twist, there is a sequence of incredibly confusing double crosses that simply bog the plot down. <br/><br/>One thing is for certain with the third Pirates film. This is no ordinary Disney summer blockbuster, Elliot and Rossio, along with director Gore Verbinski and uber-producer Jerry Bruckheimer, make some bold and surprising choices in the plot. The film opens on a mass hanging of men, women and even children known to be pirates or associates of pirates. This sets a tone that manages to be genuinely dark while still providing the light touch of the previous films. Meanwhile, Elliot, Rossio and Verbinski have no qualms about killing off some quite significant characters from the earlier films. One, in particular, has very little part to play in At World's End but manages a notably affecting final scene as our heroes attempt to return from their rescue of Jack, confined to Davy Jones' Locker.<br/><br/>Indeed, the first third of At World's End, the rescue of Jack, could have made an excellent movie in itself as it is the sequence in which the film is at its most visually inventive and spectacular. Once again, Pirates of the Caribbean benefits from quite excellent production design, cinematography and computer effects. While the resurrected Barbossa sails the Black Pearl's former crew on a junk from Singapore through icy seas and giant waterfalls, Jack is going slowly insane. The scenes of Jack in the locker are over disappointingly briefly as they offer particularly weird fantasies, from the Pearl isolated in a desert crewed by multiple Jacks to the wonderfully strange pebble crabs. Meanwhile, Geoffrey Rush is a delight, back as Barbossa and gleefully chewing the scenery and almost stealing the movie from Johnny Depp. Less evil but possibly more mad than his Curse of the Black Pearl incarnation, Barbossa is the perfect person to lead the crew to losing themselves in the land of the dead, cackling brilliantly as the ship spills over the huge waterfall. Meanwhile, his bickering with Jack as they both attempt to take control of the Pearl is brilliant.<br/><br/>The final battle is equally amazing, providing a spectacle like nothing you've ever seen before as the Black Pearl battles Davy Jones' fish people crew on the Flying Dutchman. The CGI effects are seamless here, even as tentacles and water fly everywhere it looks perfectly real. The sequence is exhilarating and packed with action all over, Jack fighting Davy Jones atop the Dutchman's mast for the chest is a stand out moment. However, the centre piece is the impromptu wedding held in the very brief pauses between the violent action. This scene has everything, genuinely exhilarating action mixed with the breezy comedy of the whole series, Rush presiding over things superbly as Barbossa and Orlando Bloom's Will and Keira Knightley's Elizabeth finally showing the spark and chemistry that Knightley had with Depp in the last film. There are even more twists and turns as the grand battle sequence ends in a distinctly surprising but clever way.<br/><br/>This is not to say that At World's End is a classic from beginning to end. Those who had problems with Dead Man's Chest's messy and sometimes confusing plot will find little to counter their complaints here. The central portion is a confusing mess of double and triple crosses as it is impossible to follow the very allegiances and motivations of the central characters. This all builds up to a scene where the various pirate lords gather to squabble and debate and vote. While it is nice that every time the pirates attempt to get together and unite against a common enemy they end up squabbling and brawling, this becomes a little tiresome and has none of the fun of the bar brawl in Dead Man's Chest. However, one good moment does come in Keith Richards' surprisingly competent and charismatic performance.<br/><br/>Bloom and Knightley have come in for some unwarranted flak for their earlier performances but here they do occasionally struggle with the material. Knightley is unable to convincingly pull off the rousing speech she is given before the final battle while Bloom, always perfectly cast as the moral straight man hero Will, hasn't the talent or the range to cope with Will's turning to darker and more confused motivations. However, the chemistry they have discovered between them allows you to forgive these blips because you are finally routing for Will and Elizabeth to be together, resulting in an ending that proves genuinely romantic in a very unexpected way, their final scene also providing a very un-Disney not very subtle suggestion of sex.<br/><br/>While the ending leaves things open for a Pirates 4, this story would appear to tie things up nicely for Will and Elizabeth. Certainly, the possibly excessive imagination on show here implies Elliot and Rossio have enough left in them for a few more pirate adventures. Probably, it would be better for future instalments of the series to be individual stand alone stories rather than back-to-back sequels, however, taking Dead Man's Chest and At World's End as a whole, what we are left with is one grand, ambitious, long, hubristic, messy, beautiful, funny, exciting, confusing, unexpected, spectacular and, above all, supremely entertaining story. ****"
"marcus40mast","3","4","7","4 June 2007"," What was going on?
","Much like its eponymous hero, Jack Sparrow (or 'Sparragh' as it becomes by the end of the film), who finds himself lost at the beginning of the film, this clumsy, over-produced, over-CGI'd film had little or no idea of where it was going. The entire thing was a gargantuan attempt to waste 3 hours of screen-time with confusing and, at times, strangely rendered CGI and a twisting plot that, whilst I could follow it completely, seemed to have little or no self-awareness.<br/><br/>**BELOW BE SPOILERS** Gone is the charm and the swashbuckling adventure of the first film, replaced by a desire to be 'dark' and 'deep', which merely serves to rob the film of any good nature it may have had. Gone too is the menace of Bill Nighy's Davey Jones, such a terrifying character from the second instalment, now reduced to a mere comedy character in this (save for one moment of skull-crushing), playing second fiddle to the laughable Lord from the EITC who seems as threatening as anyone can in a silly wig and posh accent up against Rush, Depp et al. The quite frankly dull plot from Pirates 2 is here whipped to death and then, for good measure, whipped again with an unlikely and, to be quite frank, confusing conclusion. The resurrection of Rush's Barbosa (one of the few and far between highpoints of the films) is dismissed in a sentence, whilst the other characters, we are led to understand, do not even question why they can trust a man who was, 7 months previous, attempting to kill them all.<br/><br/>In terms of performances; Depp and Rush excel, much as they did in Pirates 1, with Rush nearly stealing the entire movie from under Depp's nose (a reverse on what happened previously) and they make for the sole entertainment. Knightly and Bloom crying out nautical terms is, quite frankly, laughable as is the notion that nay one of a crew of supposedly battle-hardened pirates would listen to them. They are severely out of their depth and have none of the wide-eyed awe that actually made them endearing in ""Curse..."". Jack Davenport's Norrington, who showed so much potential to be a truly dark and unbalanced character in the last outing, is treated as a fopp again for the less-talented Knightly, though his 'Heroes Death' was good to see. Nighy, as said, is a shadow of his former menacing self.<br/><br/>By the time you reach half way through you should be ready to give up, there's only so much CGI will do for a film before you realise ""hang on..this is terrible"" (step forward Star Wars III and The Matrix Revolutions, both terrible 3's in their own rights) but a few things will keep you in that chair; Depp, Rush, a star turn for all of 3 minutes by Keith Richards (providing a genuine laugh-out-loud moment) and the desire to find out exactly how they intend the damn thing to end. That much I won't give away, but I'm telling you this, three-quels are proving to leave on such diabolical endings (again, SW:III, Matrix3, Spidey3) that you shouldn't expect much better here.<br/><br/>Only the promise of the dialogue between Depp and Rush would bring me back for 4, and keep those damn kids out of it!"
"kitten_kong","9","4","7","1 June 2007"," Strange to feel the need to defend this movie ...
","** May contain spoilers ** I know it seems odd, coming to the defense of a movie that's already made more money than all of our families combined :-) But I have to say something because I'm mystified by the negative reviews. I thought Curse of the Black Pearl was brilliant, as legions of fans and critics agreed. Dead Man's Chest had its flaws, though I had a rollicking good time watching it. Regarding the third entry of this series, I'm happy to say that I heartily disagree with the naysayers who don't have the patience or attention span for the intricate storytelling and roller-coaster plot turns of At World's End. Generally, I've found that a caveat of all of three Pirates movies is, pay attention to details and you will be rewarded. This is part of the attraction, to me  imagine, blockbusters that give us something to think about, not just mindless action and explosions. At World's End is a rich film, plenty of drama, intrigue, comedy, surprises, some melancholy, a sweeping soundtrack and the usual top-notch effects and cinematography  and the ever-present guesswork on just exactly who is on whose side at any given moment. With Captain Jack Sparrow, Johnny Depp has given us one of the most entertaining and appealing characters to emerge from Hollywood in years; and what a pleasure to see him once again sparring with Barbossa, played to perfection by the fabulous Geoffrey Rush (sorely missed in Dead Man's Chest). Bill Nighy is to be commended in his second turn at Davy Jones, bringing surprising depth and emotion to the character despite the hindrance of a costume that renders him virtually unrecognizable. Overall, I've seldom seen an entire cast of actors (from headliners to the smallest support part) not only putting their all into their work, but looking as if they're having the time of their life doing it. I've read more than one account of the camaraderie on the set; their enthusiasm for the saga shines through and it's irresistible.<br/><br/>Aye, it's a summer blockbuster that begs more from the audience than kicking back and idly chomping popcorn. So have a little patience, pay close attention to details, and revel in some good old fashioned yarn-spinning (and stay for the final scene at the end of the credits, it's lovely). At World's End pays homage to the classic seafarin' swashbucklin' epic while maintaining the unique quirkiness of the POTC franchise. Never mind the records being broken at the box office  the biggest miracle of all? Johnny Depp has brought Disney Productions and Keith Richards together. Funny ol' world, innit?"

"ltf242","8","4","7","27 May 2007"," Its big, its loud, its stupid, but its freakin awesome!!!
","First off one has to realize that this is a summer action film. Summer action films consist of no plot, to much visual effects, bad dialog, and moments of just pure cheese. Understanding this can make or brake your viewing experience.<br/><br/>This is one of the first summer action films I have enjoyed in a long long time. I don't know why, but for some reason I had a total blast watching this movie, and its strange because I have not been impressed by a summer action film since 1998.<br/><br/>Hans Zimmer's score really stood out. It just worked for me. Even the electric guitar crap worked. The score was my favorite part of the film.<br/><br/>I thought the visual effects looked better then Dead Man's Chest. Though it looks like they had trouble (or did not have time) with some of the compositing. I noticed bad green screen keys every so often.<br/><br/>The Acting was strong overall, even when a character had to give a corn ball speech. Orlando Bloom normally can't act, but I though this was one of his stronger performances. Also the love story worked better then expected, I was worried to would be as retard as the new Star Wars love story. In Pirates however I actually felt some sort of chemistry between the two.<br/><br/>Critics have not been so nice to this franchise, but they forget what type of film this is. Its not art, its great trash! Besides I'm sure not a single critic could direct trash this well. Critics are kind of lame, they attempt to appear intelligent by throwing down big words (all of which the average person wont understand) in abstract and empty points that don't really even apply to the actual viewing experience of the film.<br/><br/>Overall At World's End was great entertainment."

I will not be viewing any further movies in this franchise.<br/><br/>Johnny was wonderful but again lacking a quality plot his talents wasted. Orlando and Kiera once again cannot muster chemistry; for whatever reason Orlando messes up yet another romance. Overall, I am sure another Pirates will be rolled out but given the quality of this latest edition it should not do so."
"wheelhot","4","4","7","25 May 2007"," A Disappointment Movie of a Great Trilogy
","Well I just watched the movie and here is my opinion about it, before this I was very excited, the movie looks really promising with all the pirate lords and etc etc, but honestly speaking, I was very disappointed with the storyline of the movie.<br/><br/>Storyline: There is a few mistakes that I found in the movie, the most controversy for me is the 9 Pirate lords, allow me to explain; Captain Jack is the original captain of the Black Pearl, so he is one of the 9 Pirate lords, but then Barbossa took over the Black Pearl and send Jack on a secluded island which makes Barbossa not one of the pirate lords. So why in the movie its stated as Barbossa and Jack as the pirate lords (Captain of each pirate ship)? To prove my point is that they captured Calypso using a item that each pirate lord owns, (Jack - his hair accessory, Barbossa - the guys falling eyeball), and this happens before the the Isle de Muerta incident (before the mutiny), see the mistake now?<br/><br/>Well I cant say that the ending sucks because people has their own opinions, but its kinda sad that Will and Eli is separated, and in the end, Will could be evil because he can only see Eli once every 10 years and mostly he can only see her for about 5 more times before she dies and after that he has no reason to live anymore? So its safe to speculate that Will could just be evil as Davy Jones.<br/><br/>Oh yeah and this movie has a lot of talking in the early part which makes it kinda boring, and I wish there is more fighting scene with captain Sao Feng instead of talking.<br/><br/>Action and funny scenes Well Pirate still maintain the jokes that they are well known in their series, and this movie is still great, they also have some new ideas in this movie which is very cool. The fighting? Awesome, I like almost all of the fighting scenes, but I was very disappointed that in the final battle where all the pirates are supposed to fight the East India Trading Company didn happen, and what you get is a scene where Black Pearl VS Davy Jones. I was like WTF, then why did they bother to bring the whole pirate armada if they will only fight with one ship, it will be much nicer if you can see the pirate lords fight with the EITC instead of watching the fight between Black Pearl and Davy Jones. LAME!!!.<br/><br/>Overall this movie is below my expectation and Its very sad to see the movie ended up this way."

I could not once understand why which character was fighting which character and why all the characters weren't dead (because most of them have died, like 5 times in the series). And why did they let Will Turner live? when he was stabbed, I thought to myself, finally, we are finally lost from that friggin Orlando Bloom, but noooo. He put his heart in a treasure box and he lived. Yes, ladies and gentleman, his heart. in. a. treasurebox. But enough about that. If you never care about a plot (or a plot that is kind of consistent, for that matter), this movie will be great for you.<br/><br/>Because the overblown, laugh-inducingly stupidly over the top special effects will have you raise your eye-brow for the entire movie long. The sad thing is, the movie lacks pace, which is kind of essential, for 'adrenaline-pumping action'.<br/><br/>The Pirates of the caribbean: at world's end, was a movie that was overlong, inconsistent, confusing and with a genuine lack of spice in the thing. It sucked about as much as Shrek 3, Spiderman 3, 300 (basically everything with a 3 in it seems to suck this summer), because the story sucked.<br/><br/>I just hope that there will come a movie this summer that will be properly made, interesting, with a good story, dialogue, plenty of self-revelation, a little bit of bite and a little lack of Orlando Bloom or Keira Knightley, who can't act."

","I had high hopes for this movie, and perhaps that was my mistake.<br/><br/>I went to the theatre figuring that it couldn't be worse than ""Dead Man's Chest"" and hoping for something along the lines of ""Curse of the Black Pearl."" I can say that this was better than DMC, but not nearly as good as the original. Captain Jack Sparrow's role in this story is much smaller than what it was in the first two movies. Subsequently, the focus is primarily on Will Turner and Elizabeth Swan and their romance, an aspect of this entire trilogy that I thought was over done, it was clear from the beginning that they were going to get together. The last scene before the credits was far and away the best of the entire film, because it had the same tone of the original film.<br/><br/>The special effects were well done, but the story was rather boring, and I kind of wish I could get that three hours back of my life. The theatre I went to didn't even have any cool new trailers before the movie.<br/><br/>So far the big summer blockbusters have all been disappointing, to me any way.

"cfaustus","9","9","21","29 May 2007"," A salty tale worthy of the best.
","*** BE YE WARNED, THAR BE SPOILERS BELOW! *** I feel compelled to write because this movie so far overshot my expectations. The first movie was a fun romp the tenor of which I would have been content with in all sequels. Originally, I was expecting a franchise closer to 'Bond' or 'Indiana Jones', (where each movie is connected more by tone, feel and certain elements, but not a chronological story), rather than the ubiquitous commercial 'trilogy'.<br/><br/>After the second movie, I feared the worst: that Bruckheimer had sold out and this was to be yet another ""gee, we made money on the first one, lets slap together enough footage for two more movies and call it a trilogy"". I have grown tired of the anti-hero sagas of late, and Elizabeth Swann's struggle of conscience & apparent ambivalence in love was way too deep for a Disney Pirate movie. So much so that it sapped all the fun out of the second film.<br/><br/>*** HERE THAR BE SPOILERS! CONTINUE IF YOU DARE! *** The third film redeems the franchise! It is darker than the first, but keeps the introspection at a minimum. While there are new characters, it did not pull a Spidey 3 and introduce a multitude of main characters - all new characters are blessedly short on screen time and importance to the plot. While some would love to know more about Jack's pappy or the pirates of the East, their appearances serve as flavoring for the juicy tale unfolding about the main characters without overwhelming the whole.<br/><br/>As a whole, the movie felt a lot more like traditional tales of the sea than the first two movies. A lot of the humor was much more poignant if you have actually sailed a ship, and even more so if you have sailed some of the waters in the film. I found myself laughing alone due to this. The scene with the night sky reflected in the water was stirring to anyone who has had the rare pleasure to see such a sight. This movie reminded me of Treasure Island, The Sea Hawk, Captain Blood or the tales of Blackbeard. Yet while borrowing distinct elements and flavoring from these classic buccaneering tales, this movie managed to maintain a story and soul of its own. <br/><br/>The appearance of Calypso was fantastic. Those who say she did nothing, have obviously never sailed in rough weather, let alone a giant maelstrom! The fact that she loses her corporeal manifestation (50 foot woman) and becomes more of a primal force (the sea) makes sense with the story and sea lore. Finally, the ending (after the credits) was perfect. It was quite common for a sailor to go a decade at sea before returning to his family and certainly is part of ancient maritime lore (Odysseus anyone?). Just as much as the woman waiting on the cliffs for her love to return.<br/><br/>As to those who deem there to be too many subplots and twists, I encourage you to read some good Pirate stories (start with those listed above). You will find this to be stock in trade for these nautical yarns involving pirates - deception, treachery and obfuscations upon envaguelments. The fun is not in following the double-crosses, but in seeing where the chips fall in the end. This being said, the twists and turns are quite navigable as long as you are not used to simply having your plots spoon-fed to you. The 'board room meetings' were also taken from many of these - reread Treasure Island sometime... pirates seem to have done a lot of deliberating - according to the tales.<br/><br/>Finally, this movie also has its dose of camp, but it is necessary to keep the whole from becoming turgid. I especially liked the inclusion of sound effects from the Disney ride during the transition to Jack in Davey Jones' Locker.<br/><br/>A classic! Can not wait to see it again!<br/><br/>BTW: the more I think about it the more I realize this trilogy has in common with the original Star Wars trilogy, with the exception of a weaker, but similarly dark, second movie."

","Don't bother with this movie. Don't even rent it when it comes out on DVD. It is overblown, self-important, self-indulgent and a waste of time. I suffered through this movie until the end. I did leave briefly to check the theater's refund policy. I was told I could not get my money back so I stayed. I have never wanted to heckle a movie so badly in my life. Some of the dramatic scenes are so bad they are good. The scene where Orlando Bloom marries Keira Knightley is so sublimely ridiculous that it is funny. I don't believe that it was supposed to be funny though. The plot is too complicated and convoluted. What little resolution there is to the story lines feels rushed and incomplete. The last 20-30 minutes are spent apparently setting up PoC 4. (PoC= Piece of Crap)"
"ExpendableMan","9","5","10","31 May 2007"," Brilliant! A roller-coaster finale to the trilogy
","It's somewhat ironic that a film where the majority of the action takes place on the ocean is shallower than a millipede's paddling pool but in many ways, that is one of the great strengths of Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End. Employing the same approach as the previous film, it is in no two minds of what kind of world it is set in. The original may have been grounded in reality despite its plethora of undead pirates, but At World's End is rooted firmly in a fantastical universe where normal rules do not apply and by the time a woman grows to nearly forty feet tall then turns into thousands upon thousands of crabs in the final third, there is no question that Pirates 3 is totally and utterly bonkers. It's also the most fun you can have while sitting in a darkened room with total strangers, shovelling popcorn into your mouth.<br/><br/>Beginning with a deceptively dark introduction where several dozen people are led to the gallows by the fascist East India Trading Company, Pirates rattles on rather quickly to Singapore, where Captain Barbosa (Geoffrey Rush) and co are set for a meeting with Chow Yun-Fat's Fu Manchu-style Pirate Lord, Sao Feng. One explosive brawl with a battalion of English marines later and the cast are off on a do-or-die mission to return Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) to the world of the living, unite the Pirate Lords and fight back against the tyrannical villains who are taking over the high seas.<br/><br/>Needless to say, not everything makes sense. Quite exactly how being eaten by a giant squid monster can send you to an otherworldly desert is never fully explained. Neither is how an entire ship can sail off the edge of the world and have everybody emerge unscathed. And with double crosses and triple crosses piling up in such a chaotic fashion that it becomes nigh on impossible to keep track of what exactly is going on, there'll be plenty of ammunition in the bag for anyone who hates this movie to fall back on. But it still doesn't detract from just how much fun this film is. It's a riotous blast through the high seas where a new set piece is always only a few minutes away and the closest a movie is ever likely to get to becoming a roller-coaster.<br/><br/>Sure, the bit where Elizabeth makes a big pre-battle speech and prattles on about freedom is cringe-worthy and the scene where she and Will get married in the midst of an apocalyptic battle is relentlessly stupid, but there's a very simple solution: just turn your brain off. That's right, turn it off. Don't worry about cohesion, character motives, emotional development or sub-textual references and just get caught up in it. After all, nobody who goes to Disneyland to ride Thunder Mountain is likely to sit there complaining about historical inaccuracies with the plastic mining equipment.<br/><br/>At World's End is naturally, a film that will divide audiences. There are already plenty of critics lining up to poke holes in it but there are just as likely to be those who revel in it as pure chaos gets played out on screen. Geoffrey Rush is clearly having a whale of a time, Johnny Depp is as charismatic as ever, Bill Nighy's Davy Jones is a formidable villain and by the time the blistering climactic ship battle has subsided, you'll likely be wondering if you'll see a more insane film all year."
"thatguyandrew","6","7","16","26 May 2007"," This film does NOT deserve an 8.6!
","I just saw this movie yesterday with a couple of friends, and, well... it was okay. Not great, barely even not good, just okay. I mean, it definitely fixed some of the problems of DMC; there's definitely more plot and less action. But that becomes a problem all by itself: there's TOO MUCH plot now. And it really makes this already long movie feel even LONGER than it already is because of bad pacing on the parts of the director and editor. At one point there's even about five, long, awkward seconds of blackness for no good reason. Also, I hope you enjoy wide shots of ships sailing, because there's plenty of it here! But enough about the pacing, let's talk about the characters. Well, the whole crew's still here, and Depp, Bloom, and Knightly all pull off generally good performances, if not their best in the series. Barbosa's back, which is welcome, and makes for some great Jack/Barbosa arguments over the ownership of the Black Pearl, but most of the other characters are lacking in all fields. Even the two big new characters, played by Chow Yung Fat and Keith Richards, feel like pointless add-ons, added for more star power and no more. Fat's character barely has a distinctive personality, and is killed off way too quickly to make much of an impact, and Richards is in it for all of one really quick scene. And, although Sparrow is up to his usual antics in this one, including a very surreal scene in Hell that'll make you go ""What the hell?"", there's no really good ""Jack-Escape"" scene, like in the other two.<br/><br/>One really big complaint I had with film is, admittedly, of no consequence to the actual quality of the film, but it still bugged me. After all of the set-up of DMC for a big, climactic clash involving the awesome Krakken, the only time we see the giant beast is when our heroes stop on an island and find it dead on a beach. I mean, WTF! Couldn't we at least see it get killed? But I suppose it doesn't matter too much.<br/><br/>After all of my complaints, you're probably reconsidering going out to see this movie. However, with all of it's flaws, remember I still gave it a 6. That's because, even after it's flaws, it is still a fairly fun movie to watch, if not a bit confusing at times. And the finale, though not as cool as DMC's three-way water-wheel sword fight, is very satisfying, and is fittingly epic. If you go get a refill on your popcorn and/or use the bathroom during the slow parts, and skip straight to the action, then this isn't a bad way to spend about three hours of your summer. Just don't expect too much, and you won't be disappointed."

","A blind person could see what went wrong with this movie - too much cocaine on the set, like with Cimino's ""Heavan's Gate."" I'm not kidding. Coke might not be the problem here, but some narcotic is. That's the only explanation I can come with for why this film is such a mess.<br/><br/>Take the introduction of one of the main heroes of the film, Jack Sparrow - not until half-way through the film by the way, why the delay? Anyway, he's in the underworld, and his means of escape involves him turning that world upside down. Pure drug-fantasy, circa 1969. Then there's the 'bigger, badder' battle sequence at the end - a confusing vortex of swirling color, flashing lights, crowds running about doing god knows what with pointy objects - a Led Zepplin stage production from the early 1970s.<br/><br/>I don't know what else to say about this bloated, outrageously expensive 'happening' of a promo for action dolls and fast-food drink cups.

"lilythepnk","1","3","5","19 February 2008"," let down *spoilers*
","After the first and second films i was eagerly anticipating the third. However i was bitterly disappointed with At World's End. i cant believe how wrong they got it. first of all they seem to have forgotten that the reason the first film was such a hit was the character of Jack Sparrow, who was expertly acted by Johnny Depp. in this film however he is overlooked and set up to be a supporting character to Will and Elizabeth, he also seems to have become completely insane from being dead, which further adds to him being underused. Depp does his best with the material but still cannot bring Captain Jack back to his full glory as seen in Black Pearl. Jack Davenport and commodore Norrington is also an amazingly underused character but so full of potential its almost a crime that he was used more.<br/><br/>this brings me to my second point. Orlando bloom and Keira Knightly appear to have been given the reigns of the films emotional story, something neither actor is able to handle. they lack the emotional depth, acting talent and believability to lead a film, and cast an unconvincing couple in love and on the verge of marriage and so leave us not emotionally invested in their love, it merely makes them seem to scowl at each other an awful lot.<br/><br/>the plot of the third film is a tangled, twisted mess that has more twists than a Shyamalan movie! everyone double crosses everyone else and its almost impossible to keep track of who is actually on whose side, which is made even MORE confusing when you consider there are 3 sides to pick from (will/Elizabeth/jack -1 Davy Jones -2 lord Beckett -3)and these are very thinly defined by the double crossing. Davy Jones is almost without explanation DE-promoted as villain and lord Becket swoops in without really convincing us hes worse than an undead pirate who commands the sea. the kraken is also written off with one line. all the major threats of the second film have been cast off with not much to take their place.<br/><br/>character development has been reinvented here. Elizabeth is shown to be an outspoken, strong independent young woman who is as rough and ready as her fiancé, but in the end is nothing more than left holding the baby and once every 10 years to please her undead husband who is off doing as he pleases commanding the seas. will decides that his undead father who he has never known is worth more than his fiancé and everything else and risks his life for him, Jack is more insane verging on psychotic rather than the lovable eccentric rouge we all loved, Barbosa seems to have lost his venom, and the introduction of new characters is a complete waste of time. Chow Young fat as a pirate lord is probably the most wasted opportunity for a solid new character. i think if his parts were cut out of the film it wouldn't notice, which is a shame as he has so much promise.<br/><br/>although the visual effects are as stunning as ever, the work of Davy Jones cannot be faulted in any way, its flawless. however that seems to be the only thing salvageable out of the sheer mess of plots and characters. the ending also seems like the wrong characters ended up with the wrong fêtes.<br/><br/>it seems that the writers tried to cram WAY too much in, (half the material could've easily been saved for a fourth) the twists make it very difficult to keep up with what is going on and the characters are lost to this and poor writing and the film in general is too dark (not just lighting). they lost sight of what this was, a kids film that appealed to adults through the action and comedy. at 20 i found it headache inducing to try and unscramble.<br/><br/>i am upset as i thoroughly enjoyed the first 2 films, i pray that if a fourth is made is is kept to the same level of simplicity as the first. of course some do like it, but for me it was way off the mark."
"abbo450","10","3","5","8 January 2008"," You have to concentrate
","I have no problems with critics and viewers commenting on how confusing the script of pirates is. take the the scene on the Asian ship for example. First Will betrays Sparrow because he wants to free his father using the pearl. Then Feng breaks the agreement with Will and captures him. Then it's revealed that Beckett has been behind it all promising him the pearl. THEN Beckett persuades Sparrow to surrender the brethren of the pirates to him in exchange for his freedom. THEN barbosa persuades seng that elizabeth is the living embodiment of the goddess calypso. So seng captures her in exchange for the Pearl. THEN Sparrow Beitris Beckett and flees the Endeavor back to the pearl and then sails off destroying one of the Endeavor's sails in the process. have i made my point clear. <br/><br/>However, if you really concentrate and follow the plot, during the break in the cinema or pausing it on DVD you can keep up with it. And by doing this you are able to keep up on one of the best stories told this decade. Jones & Beckett make great villains with Hollander giving a excellent performance. The humour has been carried on through all the films with Jack the monkey creating a classic. But with some wonderful novelties such as the song at the start and the pieces of eight the already strong story gets added depth. Add that with the wonderful scenes and conclusion of the end and this is easily the best film of the year."
"dndcullens","2","3","5","5 January 2008"," Dead in the water
","Not that I was looking forward to it, but the hype surrounding this movie actually put me off it until I got it for Christmas from someone who should know better. After watching and enjoying the first two episodes, I watch this last night hoping to be reasonably entertained. That I watched it all was proof that it was entertaining but at the end of the movie I turned to the wife and said: ""Wow, I didn't think they could make s**te like this"". She was asleep! The first two movies were funny and brain-dead entertainment which I like to watch on occasions and while this had some funny moments it was far too dark to be entertaining. I am not going to spoil the plot but it seemed to me that the movie was put together to merely tie up the odds and ends of the first two and if that was the case they could have done it with a five-minute segment at the end of part two. Depp is still good, though, as is Rush but the rest of the cast are now just annoying, especially Knightley, who was better in the first two. Disney are now just peeing me off at the moment. My daughter watches a lot of Disney on VHS and even she is disappointed with some of the latest offerings from the company. I have to say that Pirates 3 is just another Disney sequel that falls way short of the mark. 2 out of 10, mainly for Rush and Depp."
"music-fairy","10","3","5","31 December 2007"," Best. Film .ever
","Lets tackle what makes this film great.<br/><br/>Number one, its story line is fantastic!!!! It closes quite a few questions but still manages to leave some open, which gives a possible opening for a 4th movie. While some people find the story hard to follow, I felt that it was easy enough to follow and a very good way to portray it too. The many plots made it more interesting and were entwined perfectly, it could have ended up like Love Actually, which is a great film but its multiple stories are more separate.<br/><br/>Number two. The acting is fantastic, and I mean that of ALL the actors. I have to say that Keira Knightly was one of the best, her reactions during the more emotional scenes were amazing and really made you feel her pain. Johnny Depp was hilarious as ever n his Jack Sparrow garb, using his ability for visual humour as well as verbal humour too, he is a genius. And Orlando Bloom, I heartily disagree with people who say he's a bad actor. He has an amazing ability to act with his eyes. He portrayed hurt and anger and a whole range of emotions with just his his eyes. All the actors were remarkable. His acting ability is very high too, he is just unfortunate enough in this film to act beside Johnny Depp, whose perfectly OTT (in a good way, Johnny Depp made Jack Sparrow the icon he is) means his ability is over looked<br/><br/>Number 3 the characters are strong. Jack Sparrow, his yearning for immortality suits his character image as the slightly mad but funny pirate Will Turner. Conflict. Between his true love and his father. Elizabeth Swann, New responsibilities and also the fact that her heart belongs with Will what ever happens Throughout the film it is clear that Will and Elizabeth constantly think about each other (and their chemistry is amazing) and would do anything to save each other. This films settles the Willabeth/Sparrabeth debate with the incredible beautiful climax and battles makes you wish that your life was like theirs<br/><br/>It is also an incredible funny film, it successfully entwines this with the absolutely amazing fight scenes, most of the stunts were done by the actors themselves which shows how high their ability is, and the tear jerking emotional scenes. This film contains the best sword fighting scenes ever and really took the word ""swashbuckling"" to a whole new level"

"The_Void","7","3","5","23 July 2007"," Nice ending to an entertaining series
","So here we are then with the conclusion of the strangely quite good trilogy based on a Disney theme park ride, and while I prefer the first two films overall; as an entertaining action fantasy, At World's End isn't bad at all! Filmed around the same time as the first sequel, the plot here follows on from that set out in Dead Man's Chest, and there are a number of surprises stemming from said film's ending. While the base plot itself is rather thin considering the amount of characters and vast running time, once again director Gore Verbinski decks the film out with a barrage of action sequences and Johnny Depp's Captain Jack is always on hand if things start to get a bit boring. The film begins with the main characters travelling to Davey Jones' Locker to rescue the doomed Captain Jack who died at the end of Dead Man's Chest. After getting the map from Captain Sao Feng, the crew sail to ends of the Earth to rescue Captain Jack. But there's more at stake as The East India Trading Company are now in control of Davey Jones, and are using him to get rid of the remaining pirates.<br/><br/>This film is decidedly weirder than the previous instalments and most of the strangeness comes from deluded Captain Jack, who seems to have been affected by his time in the locker. Although he doesn't have the most screen time here, it is, of course, Johnny Depp's maniacal portrayal of the despicable pirate that is the film's centrepiece. Depp clearly enjoys playing this role, and his quips are always a major highlight. There seems to be more of a focus on character building and plot in this film than there was in the last one, but there's still room for plenty of stunts and sword fights  unfortunately, however, there's nothing to rival the hilarious wheel scene in the first sequel. The main reason this sequel is so much fun it down to the diverse and interesting set of characters (which seem to take a fair bit of influence from Star Wars). All the returning characters still work well together and as was the case with the last film, the new ones fit in well too. Overall, this might not be life-affirming stuff - but its lots of fun and this film ensures that the Pirates series ends on a high."
"boomerchinde","3","3","5","10 July 2007"," Pirates Plot is Plodding
","This series started out with a bang and has nosedived considerably in its sequels, with part three a convoluted and boring mess of a movie. Johnny Depp offers nothing new in his portrayal of Jack Sparrow, and even appears to be a bit tired of it. As for the writing, it's taken the characters and plot line way over the top, offering the viewer form over substance, and the form is way overblown. The director of this failing series seems to believe if he inserts enough special effects and strange characters he will have a good movie, and he's wrong. At least the first edition had a believable storyline, even if it did move from adventure into horror. Geoffrey Rush appears to simply be fulfilling his contract agreement instead of acting, and that is unusual for him in the extreme. I actually fell asleep during several minutes of the first half of this boring tale, which is overlong and too full of itself. Just as you think it's reaching its denouement, it picks up again, teasing us into further boredom. I must admit, my interest picked up considerably with the arrival of Kieth Richards, but as suddenly as he appeared, he was gone. If you are aware of the plot of the first episode, it's really not important to go into detail about the next two. Nasty and slimy creatures are once again defeated by Sparrow and his co stars. Ho hum. At the World's End indeed. With any luck, the viewer will be at the series end."

","When I went to see this film, I was actually very nervous. I heard it was going to be gory, especially the beginning, and I am one who does not prefer those types of movies. However, after the first minute or so, I started to really enjoy the movie. It felt darker than the first two, and the acting was sensational. I didn't actually think that the acting would be that great, for the trailers seemed to say otherwise, but some VERY good performances were performed in this movie. Without spoiling anything, a lot of secrets are revealed and a lot of twists and turns take place. I actually had no idea how the film would end, and I find it a very, very enjoyable ending. I hope there isn't a fourth movie, actually, because I don't think they can beat this. It was incredible. Especially the special effects. They literally will shock you on how great they really are. While a lot of reviews tell the story of the movie, I actually don't want to say anything, for I knew almost nothing about what would happen in this movie and I think it is better that way.

What I am saying is there is a huge problem in the world today and the Trilogy if they see a man like Norrington as EVIL and fail to utilize the talents of Jack Davenport to better advantage with more screen time, in favor of miles and hours of superfluous pirate dreg that is a meandering and pointless as one could possibly expect. Why would anyone want to root for the guys who kill, rape, murder, and pillage, and who would slit your throat before looking you in the eye in reality? Not to mention the unwashed and smelly conditions of their apparel, not to mention, and heavens,...their teeth!!!. I doubt I would have been able to get within ten yards downwind from any of them. Where as the brave Norrington cut quite the dashing figure and no doubt had a nice scented hanky to protect him from the vagrant ethers of a scoundrelly mishap. To make matters worse most of the scoundrels in question have morphed into the vilest of skeletons, and slimiest of sea creatures. A clear and certain inference for me that these are NOT the GOOD GUYS. I am worried for the civilized nations of the earth if this is what is promulgated a GOOD. I clearly love watching pirates, but in reality they needed, as Norrington so eloquently pointed out in the first movie, "" a short drop and a sudden stop"". Give me a man like Norrington...you can keep the pirates, even the adorable Depp, who would have dropped our butts on a moments notice in preference to the call of the Pearl. After all he did not get all those whacks from all those surly misses for NADA. Thank God for those who made the seas safe from such men. Norrington RULES!! I had a great time with Pirates at World's End, but I am a continuity nut from my theatrical training and stuff like this grates my bones. And there were SO many continuity problems and story line issues. BUT if you are not a critic and you LOVE PIRATEmovies as I do...have fun!!!!! And remember who the bad guys really are."

","A spectacular third installment of the Disney pirate franchise, where Jack Sperrow must be rescued from Davy Jones' locker. It seems to be that everyone is rising from the dead, including Captain Barbosa (thanks to the help of Tia Dalma, a.k.a. Calypso) in ""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest."" The Black Pearl is even risen from the depths, as Captain Barbosa, Captain Sperrow, and eventually Captain Turner take command. Towards the end, we witness the death of Davy Jones by Will Turner. Therefore, he must take reign of The Flying Dutchman, and spend ten years taking the dead from one life to the next.<br/><br/>Before the credit roll, we see Sperrow reading a map that points to Florida and the mythical Fountain of Youth. I wonder from this, are they planning to make a fourth installment? Johnny Depp has stated that he is interested in doing another trilogy.<br/><br/>We also see Sperrow's father in this release as well, played here by the great rocker of the ROLLING STONES, Keith Richards."
"chellei","8","3","5","11 June 2007"," Worth seeing
","As the last installation in the series, it wraps everything up nicely, yet still leaves enough for the imagination(or another sequel.) Though considerably heavier than Curse of The Black Pearl, you still get a number of laughs.<br/><br/>Pros: Captain Jack is still a swashbuckling scoundrel with good-natured extremes. You smile at his puppyish look compared to his father(played wonderfully by Keith Richards), and can't help but admire his last-minute heroism. Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley fulfill their roles as heartthrobs if nothing else. Geoffry Rush is, simply put, amazing. His acting is fabulous and you end up liking him quite a bit, which feels sort of weird when you think about how much you were glad when he died in 1. You even end up liking the monkey a little. Pintel and Ragetti are back! Enough said.<br/><br/>Cons: This movie turns Will into a pirate a little too suddenly, which can throw you off a little at first if you're not prepared for it. Quite a number of people die. If you miss the scene at the end of the credits, you'll leave with a sort of sinking feeling. You wish you could see more of Keith Richards.<br/><br/>It may be a bit long, but I saw almost nothing that could have been cut. Also, There are quite a lot of twists in the plot, and Gore Verbinski said that it was meant for multiple viewings to be completely understood. It does sort of slack in the middle, but the rest of the movie makes up enough for that.<br/><br/>All in all, it was great. Everyone turns into a pirate.<br/><br/>Jack doesn't need to look for the fountain of life. ""The Immortal Captain Jack"" existed from the very start."
"Baraxis","9","3","5","7 June 2007"," Better than the first? Maybe...
","I must warn you now, I can't guarantee that this will be a spoiler-free review. I try to avoid them, but there are some plot-points that I may bring up. You have been warned.<br/><br/>To start, I believe this to be the best of the trilogy (let's hope it stays a trilogy... stupid Bruckheimer). The first was fantastic, revolutionary. As a friend of mine puts it: ""Pirates is the 'Indiana Jones' of this generation"". The second was less than stellar... To be honest, I hated it when I first saw it. Watching it a second and third time raised my opinion of it, but it wasn't nearly as good as the first. The biggest problem with the second was that it was messy. At World's End, though still jumpy, keeps on track, and stays with the spirit of the first. The plot wasn't that good (but, to be honest, I don't believe any of the PotC plots were intriguing), but it was the acting, visual effects, and action that brought it up a notch.<br/><br/>The acting was brilliant, especially on Johnny Depp's part, and there are a couple instances during the movie where Jack takes from the pages of one of my favourite movies, Secret Window. Geoffrey Rush was great, though didn't match his performance in the first. Barbossa definitely had his moments, but overall felt somewhat forgotten, though it's not like they could've given him much more screen time. Orlando Bloom and Kira Knightly were just as annoying as they were in the last two, though Will actually seemed determined this time. The two have good chemistry, but the characters have just gotten annoying. Bill Nighy is bloody amazing. He did so well showing the weakness of Davey Jones, whilst staying vicious and somewhat frightening. The biggest problem I found about the second movie was that Jones didn't seem as prominent of a villain as Barbossa, but he makes up for that in this film. All of the other secondary characters were great, except Tia Dalma. She seemed randomly broken from the very beginning, as if she all of a sudden started loving Jones again. Her attitude seemed out-of-place from the second film, and it made me angry because she was one of my favourite new characters. The new pirates were cool, but again weren't elaborated on as much as I would've liked. Chou Yun-Fat 's character seemed to be a big part, but was forgotten about rather quickly, and then killed off soon after that. I think Depp's performance makes up for all of the bad. He really deserves the Oscar this year.<br/><br/>As for the special effects, they were amazing. Davey Jones looks better than he did in the last film, as do his crew. The ships are bloody awesome. Incomprehensible. The storm and maelstrom were cool as well. I was very impressed. Also (referring to Jack's performance) the numerous Captains were amazing. For one guy acting out over 20 parts, it was uber-impressive, and looked pretty damn real. It was a high-budget pirate movie... there's not much more that can be said. It looked good.<br/><br/>The plot was... meh. As I said before, I've never been to keen on the PotC plots. They're hokey, but the movie is meant to be fun, and it is successful in that sense. The plot doesn't really matter with the Pirate movies, as it is all about the thrill of the action and the love of the characters. It was one of the better plots (whether it is better than the first is still undecided), but it still had its problems.<br/><br/>The action was fun, fast, and amazing. Some of the best sequences I've ever seen. The final sea-battle was epic. I was so impressed, it was awesome. It was so well done... I can't say much more than that. If you don't want to see the movie, whatever, but you need to see this battle. It is the coolest ship fight I've ever seen. YouTube it, pirate it, I don't care. You must watch this sequence.<br/><br/>All in all, it was a good movie. I think that the performances overall push it above the heap, but I still love the first. If anything, they're equal. It will take a second viewing to decide whether it is better. I highly recommend this film, it's easily worth the $10.<br/><br/>By the way, there are a couple things I wanted to mention that don't really fit into the other categories. The opening sequence is amazing. I had shivers, it was awesome. Unfortunately, once it passed, the movie started out a little slow and rocky. Other than that, it was a great ride. Oh, and there are so many sexual references and innuendos... A little edgy for Disney, but still awesome."

","Having seen the first two Pirates of the Caribbean movies, and having liked them both a lot, I'd been looking forward to seeing At World's End. Now that I did, I can say that it did not disappoint me at all so guess it'd be fair to say that the POTC team did great a job again. I for one am not that impressed with the way the trilogy's been wrapped up, though. Coulda been a more unexpected, somehow different ending to this big series, but well, maybe my expectations have gone too far. But it ain't me to blame for that 'cause the first two movies were so great that I could only hope for more, you know? All in all, the third movie is really, really good (8 out of 10 for me) but part of me says the first of the trilogy was the best of all."

"wahwah007","10","3","5","28 May 2007"," best of the trilogy
","simply put: Quite possibly the best of the series. It has the comedy, the action, the story, and most of all: the answers. While the first one was a stand alone classic by all means the second one lacked just a little bit, but was very very good by all means. Unfortunately a lot of movie series nowadays fall in a slump with the 2nd and 3rd movies (when they are intending a 3 part story) because the second movie doesn't expand as much story-wise and makes up for it in action. This is obvious with dead man's chest, however it sets up the third movie nicely, which is something other middle men in the series seems to lack, greatly. dead man's chest left enough mystery and story so that the finale is a grand finale not a quiet whimper (like the matrix, don't get me wrong i loved it, it just shouldn't have been done the way it was).<br/><br/>Every character remains true to their nature since the first movie and their growth is remarkable. Especially the main core...will, liz and jack. A lot of the reviews i read talked about how confusing the plot was and how it jumped around because it wasn't making any sense. I honestly don't see how it was like that. There was some confusion and twists and turns but just sit back and enjoy the movie, it adds suspense and keeps you entertained. These are family-esquire movies that aren't going to twist and turn your brain with philosophical theories, they are going to explain everything and wrap it up in a nice shiny package and that is exactly what was done. The action, the music, the cinematography and the effects were phenomenal. I personally put spider-man 3 above this one in terms of anticipation but it simply blew it away. Everything that 3peats seem to fail at is virtually nonexistent in these films, the writing was top notch, and the direction was superb. I have very few complaints about this movie, maybe even just one. but its a personal thought as a writer so ill keep to myself and not waste time with personal garbage that other comments might blab on about. i cannot stress enough of brilliantly this product was created. it stands on the same mountain as the lord of the rings trilogy as far as complete excellence. not a single bit of these three movies as a whole falters enough to create a deficit the other movies try too hard to redeem while losing their touch as well.<br/><br/>George Lucas said not too long ago that the summer blockbuster idea is going out the window and movie studios won't put the money out for big budgeted movies in the coming future. I think with the success of this movie and with spidey he was dead wrong. just as he was with the writing of the first 3 episodes, ha. people want quality and gore verbinski and jerry bruckheimer have delivered, as well as the entire cast. not a single character is lacking. period. So if you are a fan of the first two movies, you will love this one no doubt about it. It answers all the questions you have before and during the movie and leaves you a very, very satisfied movie goer. One last thing; Keith Richards' role was just icing on this layer cake of excellence. DO NOT MISS THIS."
"bpierce","Null","3","5","28 May 2007"," To the Locker with the critics--it's fun!
","No, it's not going to win any Oscars. Yes, critics will turn up their noses at it.<br/><br/>That just demonstrates how out-of-touch the typical film critic is with why most people go to see a movie like this.<br/><br/>To be honest, I was a little apprehensive about AWE. The fact that they shot it back-to-back with the second movie, and started filming without a script, made me twitch a little....and then, there was the fact that the second movie was just lacking. ""Dead Man's Chest"" came across as very labored and formulaic, whereas the first movie came across as ""This probably won't go anywhere, but let's make a fun pirate film and have a good time doing it."" After the success of the first movie, it seemed like Verbinski and his cast started taking the franchise seriously. Way too seriously. We had very formulaic, heavy-handed references to the first film, we had about a dozen too many rum jokes.<br/><br/>But then...a miracle occurred. It's as if, by the time they got done filming the second movie, the cast and crew were so burned out that they said, ""Heck with it, let's just make a fun pirate movie"" once again.<br/><br/>I, for one, am pleased with the results.<br/><br/>Oh, it's not perfect. It's a little too long, and the Calypso subplot really doesn't seem to go anywhere, given the amount of screen time dedicated to it. The focus of the film is much more divided than the first two, and some fans may be annoyed that Barbossa gets most of the best lines.<br/><br/>And in the end, none of that matters; it's fun, it's entertaining, it's crammed so full of clever little details and homages to other films (I particularly like the nod to Sergio Leone with the two musical lockets) that you can watch it over and over and see something new each time.<br/><br/>If you want Deep And Serious Film-making, avoid this like the plague. If you want to kick back and wish you were a pirate for three hours, go see it."
"falkar","8","3","5","28 May 2007"," Flawed, sure, but a great ride
","I was pleasantly surprised by the sheer quality of ""Curse of the Black Pearl"" Pirates made sexy again? Johnny Depp finally getting some recognition from the Academy? Blockbusters made fun? It was like a childhood dream brought to life. Like many, I anticipated the sequel. That film, 'Dead Man's Chest', was to me a crushing disappointment, like a similar Part 2 in an epic franchise, the Matrix Reloaded. I didn't hate Pirates 2, but a lot of things were wrong with it, and it seemed to lack the light tone of the original and the overall sense of fun. Despite this, I resolved to see 'At World's End' - and I'm glad I did. Certainly, there are problems with the film, such as: 1) The subplot with Tia Dalma, which is forced and ill thought out. 2) There are too many double and triple crosses, and while they are fun at first, they quickly become monotonous and serve the further complicate an already intricate film. 3) The film is too long 4) Poor treatment of secondary characters .The Kraken is written out, for no reason I could determine, Davy Jones becomes a crony, an insult to a great character and very little screen time for Johnathan Pryce or Jack Davenport. 5) The post credits coda, made meaningless by removing dialogue which explains it was a happy ending. 6) The opening scene, which seems nothing more than a swipe at the politics of the US. While this seems like a long list of complaints, there are many elements which easily make this film excellent - Depp's superb performance (or performances, if you will), Geoffrey Rush, chewing the scenery with even more aplomb than in 'Curse', the magnificent effects work, especially in the final battle and Davy Jones's crew, as well as the man himself, who seems even more real than he did in 'Chest'. Almost certainly, Pirates 3 will win the VFX Oscar next year. I also praise the make up crew, for making so many actors with Hollywood good looks seem diseased and weather beaten. Extra points for the scar tissue and fingernails on Sao Feng, played by Chow Yun Fat. As usual with 3rd films, there are rumours this is the end of the Pirates saga. However, the filmmakers had the smarts to set up the film in a way so that 'At World's End' functions as a satisfying potential end to the saga, as well as providing the opportunity for more adventures with the characters we have come to admire and love with this film series.<br/><br/>Final Score - 8/10"
"Nika_Dawson","8","3","5","28 May 2007"," Not as good as the first, better than the second.
","No movie in a trilogy will ever be as good as the first, but At World's end was a fitting last movie. Yes, some of it was confusing, and it left a lot of questions, but overall it was a good movie. Some people may not like it, some people may. It's really all a matter of a person's perspective. I loved the movie, and I'm sure a lot of other people will. Johnny Depp, as always does great as Jack Sparrow. Rush was awesome as well as Chow Yun Fat, though he didn't get enough screen time. The cameo with Keith Richards was great. Knightly does a lot better in this film than the last two, Bloom as well. Nighy was perfect as Davy Jones, and Beckett turns out to be a more sinister villain than POTC2 showed. All in all, it was actual better than expected."

","This movie is the perfect end. I really enjoyed this movie, but there are som minor flaws.<br/><br/>First of all, the multiple Jacks. It really worked out in Davy Jones Locker, after that it was becoming a little bit annoying (especially the scene when Jack was licking his brains when he was captured on the Flying Dutchman. That was a horrible scene!).<br/><br/>The second flaw was the growing of Tia Dalma. She is becoming a giant, speaks some phrases ( Latin maybe ? ) and then explodes into a million crabs. <br/><br/>After all, a real good movie packed with action, humur and drama. And let's not forget: Captain Barbossa is back !"

Anyhow it had it's funny moments such as the part where they all have guns held to each other, and they don't even work. i also liked the end when sparrow's compass points to his rum. the part where Elizabeth and Will are trying to ""get married"" while fighting. While there were dramatic scenes, and scenes suppose to be dramatic but just plain funny.<br/><br/>Over all a defendly a good final chapter to a good triloge.

","Now this is how to make a Part Three! Where Spiderman, Batman and other franchises failed in wowing critics (maybe not so much the eager escapist audiences) with a third installment of a popular series, director Gore Verbinski succeeds in showing just how to stretch the excitement and enthusiasm even further.<br/><br/>Yes, the movie was long, but you wouldn't feel it so much with all the swashbuckling action going on, the subplots that hint at more important things to come, and the witty repartee (although some might need subtitles to decipher dialogue spoken with thick accents).<br/><br/>It would be helpful to review the two previous Pirates movies to appreciate the characters and the story more, and so would an ample background on popular mythology (I had to keep explaining to my moviemates what happened in the past two flicks).<br/><br/>Sure, as the plot unravels, things get more obvious but you don't mind this because the movie unfolds exactly as you would've pictured it. The sets, the costumes, the attention to detail are all impressive. Pirates of the Caribbean 3 was definitely entertaining.<br/><br/>The cast looks as if they were all just having fun: Johnny Depp reprises his role as the oddball Captain Jack Sparrow and shows once more what a wonderful physical comedic actor he is; Orlando Bloom as Will Turner finally looks more manly than the scrappy metrosexual he's always playing; Keira Knightley could have used better dialogue but at least she's finally put on just a little bit more weight to make her look healthier and more convincing as the strong-willed Elizabeth Swann. Watch out for the much celebrated Pinoy Reggie Lee (from Prison Break, Fast and the Furious) as Chow Yun-Fat's main man, as well as Keith Richards, who makes a satisfyingly quirky cameo as Sparrow's dad.<br/><br/>Oh, and stay till the last of the looong credits roll for a sneak peek at a possible fourth movie, but Pirates 3 can honestly already stand on its own ending with this flick."

The movie is so well paced and full of action that you never notice the time pass. The movie includes the gags and jokes that have made its predecessors so much fun and the Keith Richards cameo was a nice touch. There is some room for romance the heartbreak between Davy Jones and Calypso versus the union between Will and Elizabeth. There is the fun foiled banter between Jack Sparrow and Barbossa plus the rest of the familiar faces and a few new ones. There is one heck of a battle sequence near the end, a truly awesome duel of ships! In short, this is a job well done! Don't miss it! Go now!"
"john-quel","8","3","5","27 May 2007"," Astonishing, thrilling, relentless, but the screenplay . . .
","I am recommending this movie, never doubt that. The good news is that Jack is back and the Black Pearl has him. There are a lot of funny bits, the action sequences are every bit as good as you have heard, and the pacing is just right. The nearly three hours zips right along. And the story resolution among Elizabeth, William, and his father works fine. Yes, do stay for the final scene after the credits. (And for those who hate Bloom & Knightly, go away. The actors are doing exactly what these movies ask of them and doing it very well.) <br/><br/>And there truly is so much here to commend in this film, particularly as we follow our heroes to the ""haunted shores"" of the afterlife. Time after time you will be asking yourself: how did they do that? As a mythology, it never flags and the three movies taken together are a remarkable cinematic accomplishment which took increasing risks that paid off.<br/><br/>So why am I sour on the screen play? Here's the problem. As is well known, when they started shooting the final film (Note: they only completed 40% of AWE when they were filming DMC), the screen play for the third was not yet finished. This is a bad thing. See this movie and you will understand why this is a bad thing. What happens when you do that is story holes open up. And what do I mean by holes? It means a given character acts as the screenplay demands he act -- forget about what the character has said/done prior or what we know about him or have seen him do. He/she has become a puppet to the screenplay. I could easily list three major instances where this happened and I am sure any fan going through the movie scene by scene could come up with many more.<br/><br/>It did not have to be. The two screen writers are first rate as is the director. But once marketing and management got a hold of the thing, it became schedule-driven and I guess it couldn't be stopped. Certainly, Disney did not return my calls. To be fair, probably most viewers will not notice or will not care. But greatness beckoned, and they settled for okay and full-speed ahead for the effects.<br/><br/>Oh well, I'll see it again anyway."

","After seeing the travesty that was Spiderman 3, I must say I was pleasantly surprised by pirates 3. I thought that they would run out of plot lines, but all things considered this movie turned out to be thoroughly enjoyable and totally viable plot wise. A little complicated at some points due to constant backstabbing, but all in all well worth the money. I'm told I need to to write 10 lines... hmm. Well, I could say that Keith Richard's part was mostly an afterthought, that was a little disappointing. Also, two scenes in particular were really pretty stupid, the Calypso scene was really dumb, but thankfully short and not really integral to anything. Also, Davy Jones' locker could have been a bit more interesting, all things considered it didn't seem too terrible a place and certainly not that interesting, but the rest of the movie was awesome!"

Johnny Depp is back in full form, Orlando Bloom is still obnoxious and lame but we forgive it, and Keira Knightly is still one sexy babe. the first act of the film is confusing and a little existential for a Disney movie, but serves for some funny moments and manages without much stumbling to pick up where the last film left off, the second act is the film's biggest problem, it's confusing, it's overconvoluted, and it's flabby. this movie's long running time wouldn't be a problem if they hadnt insisted on flushing out every backstory of every character and making sure that everybody was fit to doublecross everybody. and so we find the third act, this is what we all came to see, some bigtime swashbuckling. the naval battles are incredible, the sword fighting is intense, and there's no lack of Johnny Depp's quips or Geoffry Rush's insane character acting.<br/><br/>bottom line, if you liked the first two, you're in for a treat, this has been one of the most consistent franchises since Star Wars, and it's mass appeal but refusal to placate to any specific demographic has garnered it respect as well as success. i love these movies, and can only hope future generations will as well. no film is without flaw, but in an era of Metachlorians and Rambo 4's, we take what we can get. i couldn't recommend this film more, not because it's the greatest film you'll see this year, because it isn't, but because so rarely do i have such a wonderful time at the movies, that i couldn't have at home.<br/><br/>go see it."

Clocking in at almost three hours, the film is even longer than the second installment and even more confusing when it comes to plot (or lack thereof)<br/><br/>I won't even try to explain what the hell happens - since it's such a jumbled mess that I don't think even the screenwriters knew what they were doing.<br/><br/>For the first hour or so it's a continual stream of characters back-stabbing each other while attempting to rescue Sparrow from Davy Jones Locker where he wound up after being killed by the Kraken in the second film.<br/><br/>Sparrow back-stabs his allies, Turner back-stabs his allies, Swann back-stabs people, there's a sub-plot about the voodoo witch being some sort of sea goddess in human form, something about Davy Jones and the sea goddess having a thing together - like I said - it's a mess.<br/><br/>The final big battle winds up being just two ships - the Pearl against the Dutchman. So much for this big pirate gathering they talk about in the ads.<br/><br/>To add insult to injury - the ending leaves it wide open for a fourth (god help us) with Elizabeth winding up being King of the Pirate clans or some such thing, Orlando is killed by Jones, then stabs Jones' heart - thus becoming the new captain of the Dutchman after his barnacled big daddy cuts out his heart and puts it in the dead man's chest. Not the ending I was expecting - much less the fact that shortly thereafter we're treated to a post-coital moment between Will and Elizabeth as Will ends his one day ashore every ten years thing. I couldn't help but think to myself ""Necrophilia in a Disney flick?"" <br/><br/>The film has more ""endings"" than Return of the King, and winds up with Barbosa and Sparrow both heading off to look for the Fountain of Youth....<br/><br/>As I sit here typing, trying to think back to any moments that I thought were good it is all a blur of noise and cannon fire. Can I recommend the film? Well - the SFX were good - but the film itself as other reviews have noted is a bloated, self-indulgent load of excess that will hopefully prove to be the nail in the proverbial coffin.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, this is not the summer of the sequel. So far, of the three sequels that have hit screens, none of them have matched a candle to their original counterparts. The film will still make probably a billion dollars, but that just serves as a sad indicator of how far down the drain Hollywood has gone and simply reinforces the fact that the American movie-going audience are a flock of sheep that will throw their money willingly at any film regardless of how poor it is. I give Pirates 3 3 stars for SFX and that's it. If you MUST see this film, wait for a cheap day or better yet, wait til December and rent it on DVD."

It's also got dozens of plots going on at once, and extremely surprising twists to keep you guessing.<br/><br/>It does get a little confusing, and some may think the ending somewhat tragic. But in the end, you just have a really good feeling. Everything seems to have worked out exactly as it should, though some losses need to balance it.<br/><br/>To get to the more technical side of it, the special effects were once again amazing (the whirlpool battle, which was absolutely HUGE) and the action scenes really interesting.<br/><br/>And there's a couple of other things I'm super happy about but can't tell you.<br/><br/>This movie ROCKS. Go see it. I swear!!! But leave the kiddies at home to play with those heavily advertised toys that totally don't do this film, no, this WORK OF ART, justice.<br/><br/>This is tmm's friend and i am just saying that if you want a good feeling at the end of this that pulls everything together stay until after the extremely long credits (im talking we could have had four world wars and the credits still wouldn't be over)for the extra scene."

The way the film is shot, all the special effects, the comedy, the twists in plot, and all of the actors makes me want to go see it again...tonight!!!!! <333 Which is why I was even more shocked when I read the reviews in my local newspaper..they gave it a 2 1/2 star rating!!! that's horse pucky!!!! Whoever wrote the review (forgot his name) said that the plot dragged on, too many twists, that Orlando did a horrible job of acting (i thoroughly disagree), and that it wasn't nearly as good as the 1st Potc.

I couldn't stop watching every fight scene, it was truly worth it! Director Gore Verbinski and producer Jerry Bruckheimer did NOT disappoint me!"
"LemonyShepard","10","3","5","25 May 2007"," New Title: Pirates of the Caribbean: Pwning the Box-Office
","Ahhhsmell that? That's the smell of the greatest trilogy of my lifetime (I was born in 1990, so the original Star Wars and Back to the Future don't count) coming to a phenomenal end. Sad? No, actually. This trilogy was absolutely breathtaking in every way, shape, and form, and it's so comforting to know that Verbinski has tied it all up for good.<br/><br/>Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End literally picks up right where the cliffhanging Dead Man's Chest left off. Captain Barbossa (Rush) is alive again, Jack (Depp) is in Davey Jones's Locker, and Will (Bloom) and Elizabeth (Knightly) are trying to rescue him. All the while, the ruthless Lord Beckett (Hollander) has taken control over the Lord of the Sea Davey Jones (Nighy) and his almighty ship, the Flying Dutchman.<br/><br/>This movie takes you all over the globe and beyond, opening up with a fantastically violent brawl in Singapore, where our crew meets up with the Pirate Lord Sao Feng (Yun-Fat). From there, Barbossa leads them to the ultra-trippy Locker, which will have you scratching your head, seeing quadruples, and wondering what the heck the writers were smoking when they wrote this. Still, really fun.<br/><br/>Without giving away the plot, I will say that this movie goes back to the roots of the original in the sense of more fights, less land-locked scenes, and more cannon fire. Johnny Depp, obviously, delivers in a hilarious way, as usual. Kiera Knightly has a more emotional role this time around, something she pulls of beautifully. And Orlando Bloom has hit the target with Will Turner. Let's face it: nobody has ever liked Will. He's such a pansy compared to Jack or Norrington (in DMC anyway). But in AWE, Orlando delivers like he's never delivered before. I was actually amazed by his performance. I would say he was the best character development in this movie, if not for Geoffrey Rush. I don't think there is a fan out there that hasn't missed Barbossa. Seriously, that guy kicks so much, the Spartans would think twice before fighting him. He is a fantastic returning character that everyone will surely love to watch.<br/><br/>Chow Yun-Fat has, actually, a somewhat smaller part in this movie, which is funny because he's been publicized to death in all the commercials and posters. Naomie Harris does a good job as the creepy voodoo chick, Tia Dalma, and Bill Nighy hits it out of the ballpark as the CGI Davey Jones. Angus Barnett and Giles New make their triumphant returns as Mullroy and Murtogg from the first movie, two characters that made me feel at home again. But the real applause roared when a certain rock star appears on the screen as Jack Sparrow's much-anticipated father The movie has no slow points, yet it is extremely long (nearly three hours!) but a true Pirate fan wouldn't be able to tell. There is one scene concerning Tia Dalma that really was justbadI'll let you watch the movie and, no doubt, you'll know exactly what I'm talking about. The end iswow. Unexpected, shocking, and amazing. I won't give anything away about the shocking ending, but the very end (like, right before the credits) goes back to the original humor that made everyone fall in love with the first movie.<br/><br/>But, honestly, this month has just been conquered. The spider has been squished. The ogre doesn't have a happily ever after. This May belongs to Pirates!"

","I loved the movie. I just wished that it would have ended a bit different for Will and Elizabeth. However, the most romantic scene to me was when he kissed her knee as he was removing his boot from her foot. That made me melt. Talk about worship. I also LOVED Will's look as the Pirate Captain of the Dutchman! Orlando should have to wear those clothes in every movie. I just don't think that Liz would have been content to sit on shore while Will sailed off after all of her adventures and finally getting the man she wanted. To me I would have had to go with my man. Especially since I was the King of the Pirates. I'm going to see it again tomorrow so maybe I missed a few things."

","I think this movie was just as good as the first one, if not better. I still don't know what I think of the second movie but I know that I loved this movie, so many things that happen in this movie has a purpose and a meaning for it. The attention to detail for such a large movie is amazing. The ride is a great ride with so much going on you need to see it more than once to catch everything. Sometimes that can be a bad thing but in this case it's a good thing because all the things that are going on have a point to them. The special effects in this movie are better then Spiderman 3 in my opinion. The CG doesn't look fake like some other movies. Also the action is really well done and the acting is superb. Just everything about the movie is a delight."

","Okay, between this piece of crap and Dead Man's Chest, Gore Verbinski owes me about five hours of my life.<br/><br/>I read the reviews before I saw it so I knew it was going to be bad, but even the most scathing review didn't prepare me for just how terrible this movie was. The acting was HORRIBLE in part, I'm sure, because of the hideously bad script. The plot, what little there was, made absolutely NO sense with several plot points building up and having zero payoff.<br/><br/>Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley (who had some sparks in the first one) had no on-screen chemistry what-so-ever.<br/><br/>I also REALLY hated that the mutual respect between Jack and Will was killed and disregarded by the two ensuing movies. I felt cheated.<br/><br/>As far as I'm concerned from here on out I refuse to acknowledge the existence of ""Dead Man's Chest"" and ""At World's End"" and will preserve the excellent acting, writing, and ending of ""Curse of the Black Pearl."""

The result is a truly enjoyable movie that delivers almost 3 hours of pure entertainment without a single slow moment. The acting is perfect, Johnny Depp the best as always as Captain Jack Sparrow, but also outstanding the performance of Geoffrey Rush as Captain Barbossa, returned from the land of the dead to aid the pirate cause, bravo to Orlando Bloom, and here we have a better performance by Keira Knightley. The photography, the sound, the incredible music by a great Hans Zimmer, everything creates that kind of ""swashbuckler magic"" that only these movies have delivered in the Hollywood story so far. What else can I say? You MUST join this incredible trip to the End of the World and return!!! 10/10"
"Superunknovvn","5","4","8","2 June 2007"," Confusing and too long
","The trend must have been set with the two ""Matrix""-sequels: take a successful movie and expand it to a trilogy. Each of the sequels must clock in at 3 hours running time and the original simple story must be complicated as much as possible.<br/><br/>""Pirates Of The Caribbean: At World's End"" the latest (final?) entry in the world's most popular franchise is another example of this approach. Sure, even part 1 was structured strangely but it still worked as a movie everyone could understand. After having already forgotten last years ""POTC: Dead Man's Chest"" you'll have a hard time getting into the story in the first place. What are everyone's motives? Why did Captain Sparrow have to die? What's the meaning of the heart in the chest again? Even if you can remember the ongoings of part 2 well, part 3 will give you enough new story lines and plot points to confuse you completely. There are new pirate lord-characters and a previously unheard of goddess called Calypso. Everybody has a different agenda and after a while you have a hard time figuring out who is who, who is where and if things make sense at all.<br/><br/>If this wasn't the third part of a well-established and overly promoted franchise it wouldn't have become a success. I doubt that most people could actually follow the storyline, but were merely laughing about the weird antics of Captain Sparrow, a character they have come to love so dearly for his wackiness. That alone is not enough to make a good movie. It's bad entertainment. Other characters like Norrington were underdeveloped and barely got any screen time at all. The romance between Will and Elizabeth was virtually ignored until it was clumsily hammered back into our heads in the final act of the movie. Just another badly established plot point in a weak script.<br/><br/>Apart from the fact that ""Pirates Of The Caribbean: At World's End"" is overly intricate it is also unnecessarily drawn out. And hey, that reminds me of the other big blockbuster this year, ""Spider-Man 3"". It has been said before, but it must be said again: Hollywood needs to stop making bad sequel after bad sequel and start showing some originality again. Movies like ""POTC 3"" might make money, but they leave no doubt that right now we are at a new low of American film-making."
"ezink","8","4","8","1 June 2007"," Complex plot and long running time still proves to be enjoyable.
","Being that it is the end of a rushed trilogy, based on a movie that was not meant to have sequels in the first place, Pirates 3 did a good job of mixing comedy with impressive special effects. Given the plot was very complex, maybe to complex for the writers themselves, and certain scenes were a bit out of hand, the movie is very entertaining. The movie actually would have been nearly as good as the first if it had taken away just one of the many twists, and had done the scene were Calyspo turns into a giant differently. The humor from Pintel and Ragetti makes this film really enjoyable, along with our dear Cap'n Jack. People can't expect this movie to have the originality of the first, so enjoy it for what it is; a rushed finale of a unique trilogy."

Also, after seeing how well IMDb users rated this movie I have lost half the respect I had for them. Anyway this movie is as far from a must see as you could possibly get. I AM WARNING YOU NOW do not waste your money to see this film. It was a good waste of almost three hours on top of that. Plus, adding jacks dad was ridiculous, sow as killing the Kraken without showing it, so was the fact that they took over the flying Dutchmen.

","I will tell you this, this movie was better than the second Pirates movie. But there is no way that it is the movie for the year or even the summer. The box office numbers will look good based on the 3000 screens for the preview night ( $14 million in tickets) and the extended weekend of 4 days. <br/><br/>Tired storyline with no emotional attachment to the characters. There were funny moments( not many), there were visually entertaining moments but all in all the screenplay had the continuity of a screenplay written by 2 4th grade classes located in different states and each class were only allowed to see one of the previous movies yet charged with combining together and writing the finale ( lets hope). The story was disconected and lacked originality. Barbosa was the glue that tried to hold the plot together. Beckett was weak as a villain and the story lacked a hero. What was this Calypso crap? What an opportunity to maximize the ending with Calypso causing havoc and forcing heroism from someone...but no ! we get crabs!<br/><br/>If it were not for the skills of Geoffery Rush and Keith Richards the Movie would have gone down with all hands on board.<br/><br/>Too Long! Too Short on storyline.<br/><br/>The final action sequence was so appropriate....two ships spiraling around and around in a whirlpool. Two Turds spinning in the toilet that is POTC 3. I just wish I had pulled the handle to flush the picture after the first hour."
"baba44713","5","5","11","30 May 2007"," Confusing mess, but you do get some more Jack Sparrow
","I remember seeing Star Wars for the first time as a 6-year old kid. I didn't get much of a plot, or anything for that matter, but I found all that swooshing and space battles and laser sword-fighting quite amusing. I did get a sense that the black helmet dude was sort of a bad guy, and all that handsome people the good ones, but that was more or less it.<br/><br/>So I gotta hand one thing to Pirates 3 - they really made me feel like that kid again. I was sitting in the movie theater, enjoying all that fancy sword fights, chases, explosions, storms and whatnot and 95% of the time I absolutely had no idea what the heck was going on.<br/><br/>Let's face it - Pirates 3 is a confusing mess. In fact, Pirates Trilogy is a confusing mess. The first movie was great as a standalone, but further down the road the plot became twisted, mangled, doubled over and tied to a triple Gordian knot. I suppose not even the script writers know what they want to say - every character seems to have his own motivations not even known to them completely, everybody double-crosses everybody, mystical objects, rules and characters get suddenly introduced, expanded and more often then not totally contradicted... as I said, in one word - mess.<br/><br/>Pirates trilogy could really work great as a party game - watch all the movies, divide in teams and every team should try to explain the storyline and fill out all the whos and whats and whys. Fun for the whole family.<br/><br/>Did I enjoy Pirates 3? Sure I was. Johnny Depp as Jack Sparrow is always a joy to behold and Geoffrey Rush as Barbossa is probably the most swashbuckly arrr-talkingly pirate character ever put on screen. Bill Nighy squeezes out the most out of his quite one-dimensional character. The special effects are great and the piratey theme is spot on. Soundtrack is also proverbially good. There are quite a few jokes that do work. The movie passes by quickly, despite it's almost three hour duration.<br/><br/>But I cannot help but wonder whether the same characters could have been used in much more down-to-earth situations, in some less extravagant and more understandable plots where they could develop more naturally instead of using them just as convenient placeholders for whatever the relentless plot requires next.<br/><br/>Pirates could have been a great serial, but it seriously failed the expectations. Good casting is the only thing now that saves it from being downright tiresome. I'm not saying you should not watch this, you definitely should, it is essentially good old Hollywood popcorn cinema - just don't expect too much, and leave your brain at home. Savvy?"

","What a mess. It's as if Verbinski and company shot a bunch of film, cut it into strips, and spliced it back together randomly. Here a scene, there a scene, everywhere a scene-scene. And where's Johnny Depp? He shows up at what would be the halfway point of a normal movie. But don't worry, fans--in this behemoth he still has about 2 hours of screen time to go. The photography and effects are nice to look at, as is Keira Knightley, but it all becomes tedious. Much of the dialogue is lost in the cacophony of sound effects, or unintelligible because somebody was using their best ""arrgh, Matey"" pirate accent. Parents, be warned that the body count is exceptionally high--what a surprise from the usually sedate Mr. Bruckheimer. I took a trio of 13 year old girls to see this, and--even with Orlando Bloom--it couldn't hold their interest.<br/><br/>Of course, it will be a hit."
"ruckingham","10","2","3","23 June 2018"," Amazing movie with nice music!
","I love this movie! The stage of the movie is 18th century in the Caribbean Sea. It has very famous character whose name is ""Captain"" Jack Sparrow. Although it is not known well, he is not main character, but sub character. The main character is a blacksmith named William Turner. The main subject of the movie is William's love. However, the movie has a lot of other stories, for example, ship battle, adventure, mythology, comedy, love of family and something. This thick story catches audience's hearts. 
 Especially, the movie's back ground music is amazing. Each music has each meaning. For example, when ""Captain"" Jack Sparrow appears, the same music is always being played. The music sounds cool, and makes audience get a sense of expectation. On the other hand, each evil character has each music. What another fantastic point is that the music is made from modern music and traditional music. It makes us think that audience is in a magical space between the past and the present."
"Lejink","3","2","3","17 February 2012"," Long (keel) haul
","I quite like theme park thrill rides. Most of the best rides condense the excitement into ten minutes, however watching this dramatised fun-park attraction for nearly three hours felt like being trapped on a big-dipper interminably and that, even to a white-knuckle fan like me, is way too long.<br/><br/>The plot is convoluted beyond belief, characters die, come back to life and then die yet again for barely credible reasons, leaving me confused as to what was and wasn't real. The production strains for bigger and better effects as it goes, from a ship that moves on millions of crabs, to Jack's multi-personality split, to Calypso's giantess metamorphosis, to the final ships' battle on the edge of a raging maelstrom, they just numbingly keep coming at you, interspersed with lots of deliberately exaggerated ham acting and weak attempts at humour.<br/><br/>The actors all have a great time, as you'd expect although it's odd that the likes of Geoffrey Rush, Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom all seem to garner more screen-time than the headlining Johnny Depp although any reversal wouldn't have made much difference. Rolling Stone Keith Richards actually steals the show with his cameo, but of course he's not acting wasted and decadent because he is already,<br/><br/>All told, it just didn't work for me at all and I felt at the end like I'd endured over two hours of being hit about the face by a wet fish."
"spacemandc","3","2","3","17 February 2012"," What a HUGE disappointment!
","Despite the phenomenal popularity of the (thus far) four installments of the ""Pirates of the Caribbean (POC)"" cinematic franchise, I've found it to be a monumental disappointment. Being such a fan of the original Disneyland ride ever since it first debuted back in 1967 (I once got off the ride and got right back in line for it seven times in a row), I can't tell you how eager and excited I was to run out and see the first POC installment, ""Curse of the Black Pearl,"" way back in 2003 especially since it starred one of my favorite cinematic actors, Johnny Depp. Oh how tragic to experience my initial eagerness and excitement quickly fade into bitter disappointment and frustration! What was immediately apparent to me was the almost complete disconnect between the vision and experience created by the ride and the vision now being projected up on the big screen. With all of its extravagant cinematography and special effects and over-the-top and even ridiculous characterizations of characters who never appeared in the ride, the film just didn't have the same creepy excitement and fantasy-world fun generated by the ride.<br/><br/>And these serious deficiencies have persisted throughout all three of the sequels. In particular, Johnny Depp's character of Jack Sparrow is just too fey, effete and just plain silly, Orlando Bloom (whom I despise) is too much of what he always is in every movie he's in – an inconsequential ""pretty boy"" that inspires absolutely no excitement or interest and Keira Knightly, a ""pretty bit of fluff"" who was ""force fed"" into the POC cinematic franchise purely out of political correctness, i.e., ""we (the writers and producers of the POC films) must make sure that the world of the pirate which has been traditionally portrayed as all male is properly ""updated"" in our productions to be politically correct in including at least one woman main character..."" Yes, there are the historical accounts of at least two very prominent women pirates, Anne Bonney and Mary Read, but I'm sure they didn't look or act anything like Keira Knightley's character – and she certainly was never even hinted at in the original Disneyland ride As a result, she is completely out of place and really detracts and distracts from the plot lines of all of the POC installments. She doesn't even work successfully as a ""love interest"" for Orlando Bloom or Johnny Depp as Olivia de Havilland did with Errol Flynn in ""Captain Blood"" or Maureen O'Hara did with EF and Anthony Quinn in ""Against All Flags"" since her (Knightley's) character suffers the confused split personality of being that of a butch female swashbuckler (completely unbelievable and stupid!) and a sexy feminine dish (much more likely)....<br/><br/>Out of a real dedication to my affection for the original ride, despite my bitter disappointment with the first installment, I've forced myself to see every one of the sequels hoping against hope that ""things would get better,"" i.e. the films would get closer to the look and spirit of the ride – and that Orlando Bloom and/or Keira Knightley would be killed off or otherwise just disappear! Praise be to Providence that this actually did come to pass in the third sequel – BUT it's too little too late and I'm still left with the feeling of a lover who has watched the ""perfect woman of his dreams"" become the ""the nightmare hag from hell"""

There's this alliances that's formed between Davy Jones, and Lord Beckett - what ? A strait man and a ghost forming alliance ? Kraken is dead, for no good reason. Jack Sparrow is in the nether land, but come back to life with all his flesh and bones glory. Capt. Barbossa also comes back to life for no apparent reason.

"mopherrabbit","3","2","3","14 January 2009"," Pirates Sink at Sea
","Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End is the sequel to the very popular Dead Man's Chest. And like it's prequel it just doesn't live up to the expectations that Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl laid on it. Dead Man's Chest ends with a huge cliff-hanger where the cast of characters agree they must go to the ends of the Earth to save Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp). Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) makes a cameo and sets up his character for the sequel. This is about as good as At World's End gets and the film hasn't even started.<br/><br/>Dead Man's Chest was a decent, tolerable movie that made some amount of sense. At World's End, decides that it would rather not make any sense and that it will run around outside the lines its prequel set for it. In Dead Man's Chest the reason they go back to save Captain Sparrow is because they are all depressed about his passing. In At World's End, it is determined that they need to revive Jack because he is a pirate lord (the concept of pirate lords is something I'll get to shortly). Which, for myself, throws the movie back into the same hole Dead Man's Chest set up for me. No one likes anyone, even though the prequel left me with some small hope that At World's End would have the characters get along or at least to some extent, like they did in the first movie. But this never occurred. Everybody wants to kill everybody, and anyone will team up with anyone else to kill the person they want killed. Pirate Lord Sao Feng (Chow Yun Fat) bargains with William Turner (Orlando Bloom) to trade the black pearl for Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) once both are recovered. There is another part in the film in wince two deals between characters are revealed, both dishonoured and action is taken on each. That is the story of the movie, deals that lead to betrayals. The only character, who seems to stay true to his agreements, is Jack Sparrow. This adds confusion for viewers of the film, as well as predictability for a second or third time.<br/><br/>Another problem with the film is that there really is no real main plot. The movie is comprised of a whole bunch of subplots which are either not finished or they finish to spawn two or three more subplots. Every single character has there own objectives and sometimes more than one objective, which they all pursue through trickery and deceit. In Dead Man's Chest, there was a main objective, shared by all characters, to find Davy Jones' heart. The plot (for the last half of the film) was based around finding this heart. This objective reoccurs in At World's End, but it is in a different form and it's very minor. There are a few notable subplots, but when you try to think of one of them as the main plot, you remember another subplot that seems of greater or equal importance.<br/><br/>At World's End has another flaw. It has a tendency to abruptly end things it started that have great significance earlier in the film. A perfect example of this is when our adventurous pirates stumble upon the dead corpse of the infamous Kraken. The Kraken, the creature that caused Jack Sparrow and friends (though I can't call them friends) so much grief in the previous film, was just lying on the ground dead from cancer I guess. There was no explanation for its death, except that supposedly Davy Jones killed it as an order, but I only figured that out by reading the Wikipedia article on it (sad thing is I couldn't catch that the three times I sat through this god awful film). At that time Barbossa says ""Still thinking about running, Jack? Think you can outrun the world? ...You know, the problem with being the last of anything, is that by and by, there be none left at all."" Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End should very well be one of the last of its kind and personally I hope that it is the last one left.<br/><br/>All in all, Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End is bad movie. Not only is it a bad movie, but it is a bad movie that makes little to no sense. You can look at any part of the film and you will find something that will puzzle you, or that will just stop you and make you think ""wait what?"" So to contradict this senseless film, I will bestow on it a rating that does make sense, a 1.5 out of 5.<br/><br/>1.5/5 or 3/10 just for IMDb"

Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) ? Gibbs (Kevin McNally) ? The pirates as a whole ? Absolutely no idea. Second, who is with whom ? Why do they betray each other every ten minutes ? If the writers think a twist is when someone change motivations, they should go back to film school. What is left is a magnificent photography with great special effects and amazing settings. No food for thought. No food for the heart. Just food for the eye. 3 stars for the art directors, 0 for the writers."
"Savageheart-1","3","2","3","24 December 2008"," A tragedy
","It's a tragedy: Another case of wrecking a very good movie with a poor second and a poor third part of the story! I hope my abilities of writing in English are sufficient to express what I want to say - they wanted too much. Obviously, the writers wanted too much. This story is much too complicated! And also it is too serious. This kind of seriousness does not compare to the whole story. It does not suit the story. That's why it has lost the charisma of the first part. As far as the first part is concerned, the writers did a very, very good job. Now it seems to me, as if they were experimenting with telling a story. Johnny Depp is great, as he always is, but it seems to me, even he could have been better - he acts as if he was forced to slow down. But there was a big surprise: Keira Knightly. I did't know she is such a good actress."

","and now Im down in it. Look this movie is honestly pathetic. It has one of the most non cohesive story lines of any sequel I have ever seen. There are far too many fantasy elements as well. Jack Sparrow doesn't even appear until almost half way through the movie! The characters are not as funny this time around and everything seemed sloppily put together. It really was a boring movie as well. Please for all that is good, avoid this movie, it does nothing to further any character development and in my mind should never have been made.<br/><br/>The first two Pirate movies are fantastic, this one is so shockingly bad that I almost stopped watching after the first hour.

","I have never been a big fan of the series. The first one was okay, but too long and kinda boring, but I could see why people liked it, interesting premise, solid acting etc. The second movie, I thought was better, I enjoy the clever premise of Davey Jones and his crew being made of sea creatures it was creepy and in style with the film. The action sequences were better, the story was good, and Johnny Depp was stellar. Still it didn't really have an ending and was again too long, good not great. But the third movie is utter crap. I story is way too intricate with too many twists and characters. Also, I hate how Orlando Blooms father looks exactly like the evil pirate from the first movie. Am I the only one who found that confusing? This movie is just filled with unnecessary things that muddle it up. The first sequences in Asia somewhere is just filler that didn't really need to be there. Johnny Depp and Kiera Knightly have no chemistry so why even try to float that boat. The insanity sequences with Depp were just inane. There were so many uninspired and insipid action movie sequences I just wanted to gag. One scene where a voodoo woman turns into a I don't know what, but the transformation was soooo cheesy. Nothing about this third installment screamed originality. It screamed, rushed to make money. I remember a particularly terrible scene where the general of the ship walks down stairs, as his ship was being torn apart by cannonballs and finally it explodes. Well, he got off lucky not having to sit through the rest of this inexplicably terrible film. In trying to make everything grandiose and epic the creators just managed to make a grandiose turd. It gets a three only because I think Johnny Depp has done a heck of an acting job with the series."
"masterjk2","5","2","3","24 May 2008"," At Wits End
","If I could just rate Johnny Depp, I'd probably give it an ""8"", but I can't. He was the one decent thing about this mishmash. A plot would have been nice. Instead we're given 10 or so pinballs that are bounced from one bouncing situation to another to a hole to another flipper... they veer off in some direction... unknown to the director, or even the writers. Just play it by the seat of your pants. There are no rules, no plot, no real characters... just a phenomenal amount of special effects. It was good for the ""actors."" No dialogue to learn... just make it up as you go along. Depp is amusing, and acts as though he's rum soaked through out the entire, incredibly long movie. But maybe he was, thinking, ""Oh, well, it's big bucks in the bank even though the parrot has the best lines."" And don't forget the cute little monkey, everyone's favorite... everyone under 5.<br/><br/>There's nothing wrong with movies like this. And the special effects are special. But it could have been more. The first one was very pleasing. The second less so. And the 3rd, interminable.<br/><br/>More and more movies are made for those under 16. I'm over 3X that. But even at 16, I think I would have found this movie boring, as they go for one more sword fight, one more brawl, one more sinking ship, one more Johnny Depp reproducing endlessly. One more dead person coming back to life and killing someone who had been previously alive. There are no rules. If you were a ship's plank a few minutes before, extricate yourself and tell your tale of woe, or kill someone who is supposedly unkillable.<br/><br/>Although some may like the music, I merely found most of it repetitious, consciously so.<br/><br/>Did I say I don't much care for this animation? Ooops, I'm repeating myself. Must have been inspired by the flick."

","I enjoyed the first two pirates movies although I did think that the first one was a bit overrated and the second wasn't as bad as I'd feared.This one however is definitely one POTC too far.<br/><br/>One of the biggest problems is that they try to cram just to much into this movie.At times I didn't know what the hell was going on and I have to say that I didn't really care.There are too many scenes that just don't work including one that I will come to later which was so awful I watched through clenched fingers.The multitudes of Captain Jack Sparrows,the uninspired comedy moments,the over use of CGI,there are a lot of things wrong here.This film seems to have lost a lot of the charm that the first two had and relies far too much on gimmicks.It is also way too long by at least 30 minutes.<br/><br/>It isn't all doom and gloom.Johnny Depp is as reliable as ever and Geoffrey Rush clearly has a ball as Barbossa.Although there is too much of it,the CGI is very well done.Oh yes,I really liked the monkey as well!One big problem here though is that Keira Knightly is very badly miscast as the tough heroine Elizabeth.This is where we come to the scene that I mentioned earlier.Yes,that's right,it's when Elizabeth gives her William Wallace speech to the pirates.It is truly dreadful and she sounds like a schoolgirl shouting in a playground.I'm not saying that Keira can't act,she most probably can.It's just that she is woefully out of place in this role and many of her tough girl scenes are just laughable.Orlando Bloom?Well,he is certainly good to look at for the girlie's but isn't the worlds greatest actor to be fair.He does look the part though.<br/><br/>I was toying with either a 4 or 5 out of ten for this.I settled for a 5 because the monkey was so good!"
"H_Spengler","5","2","3","22 January 2008"," Pirates...A Letdown...
","I'm an avid Pirates and Depp fan, such great fun it was watching the first movie in the theater! An imaginative, well written, well done movie...even the second Pirates, although nowhere near the first managed to build a satisfying cliffhanger at the end, enough anyway to want me see the third. <br/><br/>AWE, (or LSD as it should be called.) is like 3 movies crammed into one. I saw it opening night, but had to wait for it on DVD so I could watch it and try to understand everything that was going on. Pointless plots and characters abound! And the plots in the story arc that may be remotely interesting are pretty much killed off or flushed away. Let me start with the issues I had with this film:<br/><br/>1.) Shouldn't it have seemed to be harder to reach the world of the dead? A little too easy to get there if you ask me. All they really did was sail, and then fall over a waterfall. Shouldn't it have been some sort of trials, or adventure just to get there? (dare I say Clash of the Titans?? But that's just me.) Absolutely pointless ""eye candy"" of a scene to show of ""neat"" fighting skills with Sao Feng. By the time that scene was over, I had forgotten if there was a point to it. What a waste!<br/><br/>2.) The reason I call it LSD. Which is what it seems you'd have to be on to understand any scene from the introduction of Jack Sparrow in this movie to the reappearance in the ""world of the living"". Hey, i'm all about mental insanity and hallucination caused by months of isolation or whatever causes people to go mad. What was up with the crabs from the rocks? WTF? How and why did that happen and what was the point, that all of a sudden here are all these ""rock crabs"" carrying the ship to water. Hey whatever, but how about an explanation. Could we make insanity a little more interesting than multiple Jacks? Wouldn't one also be shocked to see all these people who showed up to rescue Jack, once he realized it was no hallucination, Especially Barbossa who you supposedly killed off long ago.<br/><br/>3.) Davey Jones....wonderfully acted and portrayed (no problems here) treated like a punk in this movie...too complacent and not very true to the character. Jack Sparrow (played splendidly as usual by Depp). You're almost embarrassed for him by the endless ""trading"" and lame lines he's to repeat. It's like watching football player signings for the season....only like, 6 seasons worth in 2 hours. <br/><br/>4.) Everybody backstabbing everyone else....over and over and over again. My god! And it seems as if it's a ""Spur of the moment explanation."" It's almost as silly as the new plots. I was also unimpressed by the usually great Hans Zimmer's score.<br/><br/>5.) The plot(s) that were completely discarded that were actually interesting. Jones's plight could've been so much more interesting than it was. Although obviously a horrible and hardened creature, in ""Dead Man's Chest"" you could almost see the human being who was agonizing underneath, abut a long lost love, and the tragic story behind it, and the possibility of redemption. Instead we get a ridiculous plot about a silly sea goddess (Calypso) being the long lost love, about 5 minutes of dialog exchanged between her and Jones. (Some schlocky crap like ""you broke my heart"" ""you wouldn't have loved me any other way."" Huh? no resolution....and then his poorly done and anti-climatic demise. <br/><br/>Calypso...talk about throwing in something silly when you realized the other 27 plots you had going you have no end for. I thought ""well this will probably be pretty interesting. Instead and laughably so she grows like the 50 foot woman, belts out something unintelligible and then turns into hundreds of crabs that fall into the sea, and cause a giant whirlpool for no other apparent reason than to make sure those CGI people were cranking out what you pay them for.<br/><br/>The Marriage during battle.....(slaps forehead). I can't say Will is my favorite character but what a downer of an ending for him! Servitude for however long...see your love and child once every 10 years...wow...I need a shot of Prozac after that. <br/><br/>Keira is back! And as anorexic and annoying as ever. Continuing on last movie's plot twist, she's as equally traitorous and out of character in this one. she was fine playing the eye candy, and a light candid role, but anything heavier than that is out of her league in this story, she brings a sort of ""caught in headlights"" persona whenever some emotional scene arises. I didn't like her in the last half of DMC, and she's equally unlikable an unbelievable here.<br/><br/>As much of a sleaze as we may think he is, the death of Norrington is lame!!! He had potential. the British navy thing, ridiculous, the father floating by in boat, silly, and purely plot advancement as he conveniently discloses some off screen plot advancement. <br/><br/>OK if you're still with me, ii'll tell you something I did like about the movie...The return of Jack Sparrow to his scheming ways at the end! The stealing of the charts, and the little boat....priceless...and perfectly in the atmosphere of the first movie! I had to laugh! <br/><br/>This whole point being, not a BAD film if you don't require any sort of coherent script, or you're looking to complete your DVD trilogy the FX are nice, and Rush, Depp, Nighy, Davenport, and Skarsgard are superb, everyone else makes you itch in your seat like a bad rash. ***** out of **********"

"dromasca","5","2","3","27 December 2007"," too much, too long, so boring
","'Pirates of the Caribbean' series is a demonstration that not every good idea should be turned into a three series epic. Sure, the series were commercially successful, but the result was not at all satisfying on my taste. What started as a good epic, with with a great key idea, with a charming mix of history, legends and humor filmed in exotic places continued in the second and third installment with more and more visual effects, but the story simply was not here. More characters showed up in an attempt to create a sea and pirates mythology, rules of life and death were broken freely, so by the end almost every character seems to have died at least once, but a clear line of conflict is completely missing, and that the result is very difficult to follow. Actually even if you follow it I have the impression that it does not really help, because at the end it is not clear what the big conflict is about. The whole series 3 is built to prepare a battle magnificently filmed and computer-simulated, but what are they really fighting for? The film deserves Oscars in a few technical categories, but none in the art ones. I was tired and bored at the end of the film, and I am happy to not hear news about series 4."
"J_Cheever_Loophole","5","2","3","27 December 2007"," A series that lost it's way
","Whilst this is an OK film I firmly believe the makers of this series lost their way after a brilliant initial instalment. It's always difficult to recreate the magic of something like the Curse of the Black Pearl but they mislaid the ingredients that gave it such charm.<br/><br/>Instead they've gone overboard creating 'myths' and supernatural characters, which consequently appear very contrived. The 'normal world' characters now take the 'supernatural' ones as commonplace, hence, so does the viewer. <br/><br/>The writers also cheat, by which I mean that they've changed the rules as they go along. It is very important in Fantasy/SF etc that the writer outlines the rules in which the world they portray operates, and then stick to it. As soon as you bring someone back from the dead, there is no meaning to anyone else dying since they can just be brought back again at any time. Likewise when a character gets into a spot of trouble we don't want to see the writers just invent a new rule/character/myth that gets them out of it.<br/><br/>Maybe it's just too easy when they have a surefire hit on their hands - all they need to do is get a film released and the money will roll in, no matter what. Filling a film full of special effects, big names and scenes is a cop out when what is called for is a good story and script. Rather than invest so heavily in CGI and so much make up, the producers would do better to employ the best authors and writers that money can buy, it'd still be far cheaper. And the result would be immensely better. <br/><br/>As it is, they've wasted the brilliant 'Jack Sparrow' character in an overlong muddle of SFX, manufactured myths and silliness."
"teamplayer","8","2","3","16 December 2007"," Papa was a Rolling Stone
","This franchise is the Indiana Jones trilogy of the 20'oughts. It takes the Pirates series to surprising new levels of the fantastic, supernatural, and weird. The setting, of course, is anywhere but the Caribbean. From the start, the theme is, well, death. There's more darkness and heartbreak in this episode, and British naval villainy was overboard this time. Barbossa is the action hero. It bears careful listening and watching, especially when trying to decode pirate jargon at a pace this fast. Several of the pirate ploys and tricks must have blown by me in my first two viewings, but I suspect the deal on the sandbar had more to it than it seemed."
"kostopoul","4","2","3","7 December 2007"," Disappointing Ending to a nice trilogy
","Disappointing ending to a very promising series of films. The plot gets really convoluted, introducing sub-plots all the time and the characters have major departures from previous offerings. Barbossa is now a nice guy, Will Turner decided to do his Darth Vader impression, Jack Sparrow likes to do the limp wrist and eyeliner thingie and Davy Jones is not the bad ass he used to be. I mean, one scene has him standing in a bucket as to parlay with the pirates. The action sequences try to be great and there is a ton of action going on in any moment but, at least for me, it was kinda safe. You never feared about what will happen, since these are major protagonists and I am sure their agents would not allow them to die on-screen in such a major franchise. The body count on extras is quite high but after a while you will not care. What really ruined this film for me was the lack of a REAL villain. Davy Jones is subjugated to the Director of East India (perhaps the film makers aiming at some ""human worse than average demonic monstrosity"" cheap shot) and they try to add some humanity to its character by giving him emotions and a new sub plot about how he is loving the Voodoo Lady from monkey island in her next gig. Jack Sparrow not only gets too little screen time but forget the swashbuckling hero of the previous offerings, this is a new Jack Sparrow, overdoing his ""gay"" impression (with appropriate eyeliner to boot). There is a ton of CGI and more sub-plots than you can shake a stick at and of course a semi-ambiguous ending (be sure to watch the DVD after the credits, the cinema I have seen it in, decided its ""lights on"" after the directed by credit!!!)."
"dead47548","5","2","3","4 December 2007"," What did I just see?
","As a big fan of the first film and one of the few people who genuinely enjoyed the second one, I have to say that At World's End was pretty dreadful. There were so many characters, all with their own elaborate plots and motivations but not in a ""Wow, this movie is so beautiful and complex"" kind of way. More in a ""What the hell is happening? Why are they doing that?"" kind of way. It seemed like they tried to throw in as many characters and plots as possible and that would make the best film, but it turned out horribly. I spent half the time being completely confused as to whom was fighting whom and for what reason, and everyone just popped in and out of the situations and disappeared back into nowhere with no real explanation. The addition of this insane amount of pirate lords just made me wonder where all of these characters were in the first two films when everyone was fighting over an enormous amount of gold and being destroyed by The Flying Dutchman. Speaking of The Flying Dutchman, the fact that they actually managed to make Davey Jones frightening in the first film was ruined by making him a pushover in this one, just like every other character.<br/><br/>The acting is all outrageously flat or completely artificial, sans Geoffrey Rush who unfortunately came back for this one. It just always felt like the characters knew ten times more about the situation than we did and the audience was supposed to look past that because of all the cool explosions. Every character had in-depth plots and backstories but we see two seconds of that and then move on to the next person. The humor is virtually gone, with a few laughs here and there but for a franchise that builds itself on mixing quirky humor with big action it's lacking in the comedy and tries to make up for it by increasing immensely with the action. Depp, who generally provided all of the comic relief in the first two, is stuck doing lame schtick where he sees different versions of himself that made me laugh...once. That being said it still manages to be entertaining for the parts where I wasn't completely lost and I actually liked the ending, even though it felt like it was never going to come. A letdown, surely."
"gtha-2","5","2","3","19 November 2007"," Not as bad as many people portray it albeit not too terribly great either
","I remember an interview with Chow Yun Fat prior this film's release and his summation was simply ""Pirates meet because they're due to be wiped out...stuff happens...and then we fight for our freedom""<br/><br/>And that is a pretty good synopsis of this film: Stuff Happens.<br/><br/>I'd say this is your typical Hollywood run of the mill sequel that relies off of its predecessors' success rather than break down new doors and barriers for the viewing audience.<br/><br/>And perhaps that's the ultimate crutch of Hollywood today that sickens most moviegoers like myself: money is more important than the substance and content of the presentation. Hey, as long as we support it and continue going, it'll always be the case. <br/><br/>I saw the movie at my school as part of a free showing and I must say that what was impressive in the otherwise convoluted plot were the special effects. Davy Jones again is rather impressive and the maelstrom scene, although roughly twenty minutes longer than it needed to be, was pretty nice to look at initially before the utter redundancy began to set in to my brain. For the effects (save the attack of the fifty foot woman ""Calypso"" who really does nothing aside from make it rain and blow wind) I give the movie five stars.<br/><br/>It's a Disney movie, and for that reason I don't expect excessive violence, and for what violence I do come across I expect it to be animated, bloodless, and comically relieved by the acting of Depp or Rush. However, it's not in this film and it seems the direction seems to struggle with corny sophomoric jokes that appeal to the Disney toddlers whilst trying to maintain a dark story interlaced with darker humor for the adults. The director fails at really deciding which side he wants to lean towards and thus we are given a plot mixed with jokes that don't really tie in to one another. <br/><br/>Again, since we're placed in a f aux animated environment we're expected to accept certain plot inconsistencies(magic being one of them and its use) that for all intensive purposes would need an explanation, however these were questions I felt a few more pages of writing and a few less of action would have been beneficial to explain:<br/><br/>-How does Elizabeth learn to wield a sword so well? -What happened to the Kraken? (The benefit of the doubt tells me this was explained but I must have missed some audio and it couldn't have been more than a one line excuse for why its massive corpse was washed ashore) -Why are there eighty billion different crews whose allegiance is ridiculously flimsy and faltering?<br/><br/>The acting wasn't awful as some of these reviews depict, although it was slightly wooden and more or less seemed to be performances of redundancy rather than passion being portrayed. Jack Sparrow even seems to have lost that charm that kept me interested in the first two, and Will/Elizabeth's romance never really develops and ends with him kissing her knee on a beach....er...<br/><br/>And going back to the plot, it was probably the most jumbled plot I've experienced in a long time. The introduction and dismissal of characters seemed to be more of an afterthought to the filmmakers. Chow Yun Fat reminds me of the dude in Mortal Kombat who pops out in corner, yells something along the line of ""kalihoohoo"", then disappears for no real reason. That's Fat's character: a disappearing non-sequiter with some fancy scars and an infatuation for Elizabeth. <br/><br/>Mentioning the other faults in the plot would be like beating a dead horse and for that reason I'll keep the review short. To reiterate though, I don't quite feel the movie is a complete waste like some people on here state it is, nor do I feel it's deserving of the 7+ rating. It's a decent movie that, by itself, would have been OK but had it been the first never warranted sequels."
"wiseman1024-1","5","2","3","8 September 2007"," A visual demo, not much else
","Performances were good, especially Barbossa and Sparrow in that order. Visuals were probably as impressive as this kind of movie allows. Music was good, though it shone less than in the previous movies.<br/><br/>The real problem with the movie was the plot. It's not that it's convoluted and a bit hard to follow, as everybody is treacherous and switches sides every 5 minutes; this is a bad thing (because it prevents you from feeling identified with the characters and living the movie in first person), but not the worst. The problem with Pirates of the Caribbean 3 (and 2) is that the story writer was drunk and the story is utter trash. Too much fantasy. I was almost expecting Barbossa to turn to a dragon at some point. Every 15 minutes a new fantastic, magic, rule-breaking element is introduced. You simply give up on the story and watch a ""demo"" Â— everything goes, everything happens, there are no rules, expressed or implied, that will guarantee one set of standards upon which you can understand what's going on and what's likely to happen or what's an accomplishment; there are no rules for this game. You don't care about the movie because you know something magic will happen that will turn things around. This is a very cheap plot, the kind children write at schools. If you're going to do fantasy, do it right: introduce a single element or a system of elements with certain rules, then work upon it. If you keep introducing trash, the story can go just anywhere without any justification, as in this movie.<br/><br/>I couldn't feel involved in this movie and didn't care for the characters. So it felt like an average movie to me."

I expected a humorous continuation of the story, with Jack Sparrow as a lead star, what IMHO, the first episode was. The extreme darkness and cruelty started right off the begin, when in the first minute a little boy gets hanged as a pirate (!). The story and the plots are so complicated that Pulp fiction looks like a bedtime story for two-year old. In the end it was a complete mess in my head and i felt it to be too lengthy and unnecessary.

"BarkleyVaderReborn","8","2","3","20 August 2007"," A film with admittedly frustrating flaws but fun characters, good humor, and a mostly satisfactory plot and ending
","I know that this film disappointed a lot of people. I can see why it disappointed a lot of people. I don't blame them for being disappointed. But I sincerely enjoyed it.<br/><br/>The film has a lot of flaws, the biggest being poor character development and an overly complex plot: the flaws it shared with the second film. However, unlike DMC's bloated (although enjoyable) plot, At World's End at least has a destination.<br/><br/>The endless cycle of betrayals occurring between the characters makes it hard to sympathize with the characters. The different steps in the journey do not exhibit the best pacing. If there is one thing I could compliment on that others would agree with, it would be the action and special effects.<br/><br/>Davy Jones was by far the most realistic character. His tormented soul is revealed to the audience as the film progresses, and honestly I enjoyed his scenes the most, even with his funny accent. <br/><br/>While Davy Jones was realistically flawed, Jack Sparrow was the humorously insane star of the show. I thought that the hallucination aspect introduced in the film was very entertaining, although it contributed little to the plot. Kudos to Depp, who even though his performance has diminished from his debut in the first film, managed to keep the audience entertained.<br/><br/>Geoffrey Rush as the fearsome Captain Barbossa did an outstanding job, and behind both Depp and Nighy one of the most entertaining characters in the film. <br/><br/>Chow Yun-Fat as Sao Feng did a very good job, although for all the hype built up to him in trailers and material before the film, I was disappointed by his mere 20 minutes of show-time, compared to the main villains.<br/><br/>The East India Trading Company has proved controversial among fans, but I really enjoyed it. For me, it represented that the freedom-loving way of Pirates was threatened, and the imposing shadow of Lord Cutler Beckett cracking down on piracy everywhere drove most of the central plot to gather the Pirate Lords (Richard's performance as Captain Teague was very highly praised, even by the negative critics, with good reason).<br/><br/>This leads me to the last set of characters: Will and Elizabeth. The love-triangle between Will, Lizzie, and Jack is resolved in a much more satisfying way then, say, the Leia-Luke-Han triangle in Star Wars (although I enjoyed all six of the Star Wars films as well). However, Will's fate left much to be desired, and the betrayal cycle affected their characters the most, although I still sympathized with them for reasons unknown. :)<br/><br/>I know you think I'm being too positive compared to critics' reviews. Apart from the fact that critics are naturally more critical than the rest of the population, their main bone to pick with the film was the plot: not that it was a bad one, just that it was too complex and filled with needless distractions. And I agree, to an extent. It was very hard to follow for people who haven't seen the previous two films, and even for some who did. Of course, I see it as giving the film a re watch value. The one thing that I honestly didn't like was the Betrayal Cycle that occurred with both DMC and AWE; it was silly and often annoying. But when push-comes-to-shove, I'll buy this for five reasons:<br/><br/>1. It is an enjoyable film that will keep you entertained. 2. Plot problems aside, the characters are very fun 3. the humor is great 4. the plot is satisfactory although complex 3. Davy Jones<br/><br/>So, do what sensible Americans (and people of other nationalities, I assume) do every time: Ignore the critics, watch the movie, and have a great experience at the movies with characters that we love with action we enjoy."

","First and foremost let me say, do not listen to any naysayers that dislike this movie because they were incapable of following a simple storyline. POTC ATW is not complicated, or convoluted but rather a richly intricate movie that may rival that of the first in this series. Visually the movie is stunning! The whole movie is so vibrant, and has such presence that you may actually find yourself ducking and dodging the blows along with our lovable pirates. The cast did a fabulous job, and Johnny Depp as always was simply brilliant. True fans that loved the first one, and enjoyed the second, will not be disappointed. I will say if you did see this third installment and did not enjoy it, I truly do encourage you to see it just one more time, and you may be surprised. I personally have seen it four times and believe that it just continues to get better with each sitting. Simply put it was a magnificent and befitting end to the trilogy. Whether this is our last movie with Jack Sparrow has yet to be seen...we can only hope for more."

The problem with the movie is that it has far too many supernatural elements: different kinds of immortality, many possibilities of eternal or semi-eternal damnation, several different magical gimmickries with very weird rules, the ship that's faster than any other for no obvious reason (the black pearl), a very supernatural ship (the Dutchman), and other things I won't mention not to spoil the plot.<br/><br/>If you have one supernatural force, there's no problem: for example the first movie worked just fine, as do Star Wars movies with their ""force"". But the second and especially the third film in the Pirates series just mix too many elements, and that's why nothing seems to matter any more. Luckily the movie has humour and even ironizes its weird characters and multiple cases of supernaturality. Still, although entertaining, the whole experience seems somewhat hollow.<br/><br/>Jack Sparrow is still fun, but the first sequel was more funny and less of a mess than this one, and the first pirates film had a far more coherent plot. Still, if you like adventure films spiced up with humour, and don't care about getting that deep into the characters you'll probably love this. And even if you aren't a friend of these types of films, chances are you'll still like it for its entertainment value."
"goeh90","9","2","3","2 July 2007"," An Excellent movie
","I loved this movie. I actually found this movie to be better than the second, but the first one is still highest on my list. I loved the romance, the humor, the action, and... well i loved everything. Mr.Johnny Depp aka Captain Jack Sparrow, plays his role perfect and without flaws. Bloom and Knightly also do a good job, and so does the rest of the ""crew"". I expected the fact that Tia Dalma was Davy Jones' girl, ever since the second movie... although so did probably several others... I liked that it sort of twined all the movies together, and it is done in a brilliant way. I was still laughing when i walked out of the movietheatre. But seeing that i liked the first movie better than the third, I can't really give it 10 out of 10, so...."
"williameyewtiger","9","2","3","1 July 2007"," certainly the best out of the three
","just like the previous two films, the pirates of the Caribbean at world's end contains moments of great action , humour, adventure and also love. Johnny Depp again succeeds to play the weirdly funny but brave captain Jack Sparrow, which is very entertaining. The rest of the actors/actresses, including Chow-Yun Fat, Keira Knightley Orlando Bloom and Geoffrey Rush also played terrific roles. The plot of the film was qutie straight forward, except for some parts when it was strangely confusing. Apart from good acting, the film also has great cinematography, editing, sound effects and spectacular special effects, and of course the Disney effects which makes it a great action movie. The action and battles involved are even more intense and exciting than the two previous films, which suits the series finale. Although the two previous Caribbean movies are really good, i would say that this is the best out of the three."
"Rostitute","10","2","3","1 July 2007"," 3rd Installment
","To tell the truth I thought this was one of the best ones I didn't like the second one, I mean it wasn't bad but I have to say i enjoyed the first one and the third one better. The first one is possibly just better than the third one but still a great watch, I think it does bring closure to the trilogy it has everything from comedy to all the lovable action scenes with our good friend Captain Jack Sparrow, and this finally brings the team back together for more of the movie, which I believe is what the second one lacked. Like the previous comment said the cinematography was excellent and what else can you expect from a movie with such a big budget, and I can understand that people were disappointed but unfortunately if you make your expectations too high you are only ever going to be disappointed with the final outcome of the movie. I hope this has helped, I enjoyed it and give it a 10/10."
"EijnarAmadeus","4","2","3","10 June 2007"," Pirates 3, you gotta see!
","At World's End is the third movie in the Pirates franchise, and just like the second it's not as good as the first but it's a highly entertaining and highly good-looking movie. Johnny Depp as Jack Sparrow is one reason to go see it, and Barbossa is another, lots of stylish characters are summed up here and though it gets a bit lengthy, it is a pirate's life for me and million others.<br/><br/>The action-scenes are impressive, they are simply dashing whether it's reggae-woomaan going Hulkish or it's Jack Sparrow fighting Davy Jones like to bulldogs eating one bone (hm, well), and though many will find themselves getting tired of both story and gags and excitement, it's a more vital spine to this third outing than the second ever had. The story is just like Dead Man's Chest, a bit difficult to keep up with, but if you look away from that, and focus entirely on the fact that this is a summer blockbuster, you'll find yourself more than amused. The fact that At World's End is more piracy and more spectacle than ever is a spine that keeps it entertaining till the last second, keeps it as witty and un-serious as it is deliciously smooth.<br/><br/>Pirates of the Caribbean is one of the most successful franchises ever, and though people may be moaning about that this is too long, and why did Barbossa return, why didn't Sparrow get more gags...blabla... this is in fact a better movie than many give it credit for."
"rockyunderscore","8","2","3","10 June 2007"," Very Satisfying ending , better than part II.
","Well, what can I say . Its a damn good film. You have everything that you hope for in this movie. Humor, romance, action-adventure, epic battles , dramas and emotions. All smack into 1 film . Especially when it is a final chapter. The 1st film i was blown out of the sea. I mean , the performance was so good and funny . Johnny Depp made me laugh so hard while watching him portraying Jack Sparrow. The action was kinda different from other swashbuckling films (unlike the dumb Cutthroat Island movie). Story was good.<br/><br/>When it comes to the 2nd one , it was good at first . But the more i watch it , the more i found out it wasn't all that good. They are a lot of plots that are unnecessary. Like the fight between Jack, Will and Norrington should've shorten it. Including the scene when Kraken was eating the ship where Will was on.<br/><br/>This 3rd one . I could agree more. It is much of a redemption chapter. The film got everything that I have expected. The humor and the big and final battle at the end . I heard people said that the plot was to complex for them to follow. Come on, I'm 16 and i can even follow through the plot. I found the third to be very similar to star wars return of the jedi. But thats OK. Anyway, the scene i hate the most is the Davy Jone's Locker. It didn't surprise me at all. It was not as funny as i predicted. When Jack meets up with Barbossa he act as if he is not so surprise. But after from there, the chemistry between Jack and Barbossa started to take form. They were so funny. They are like the ultimate odd-couple in fantasy movies.<br/><br/>The climatic was the height of the film. All the characters clash in one big battle. It was a cool scene. The fight is like nothing I have ever seen before in cinema. They really pull of a spectacular sequence for 2007. Overall it was a satisfying final chapter. My hopes is that they don't try to make part 4 cause the story is about pirates. It ends here. All I'm waiting for is a Jack Sparrow spin off.<br/><br/>8.3/10"
"logical-paradox","8","2","3","9 June 2007"," Decent Conclusion - But Still Can't Match ""Black Pearl""
","""At World's End"" provides a decent and enjoyable conclusion to the Pirates saga. I found it to be better than ""Dead Man's Chest"" in which everything went a bit special-effects-happy, but it still didn't manage to reach the brilliance of the first, ""The Curse of the Black Pearl"".<br/><br/>It was pleasing to see humanity return after the creature-focused DMC and battle sequences were quite enjoyable and thrilling. Locations were very interesting as well. Once again, Zimmer's score was brilliant and complemented the visual experience well.<br/><br/>The plot, while a little convoluted, intrigued me - I personally enjoyed the plot twists and ambiguity of where each character sat. However, even this began to wear on me, and viewers with less interest in these plot devices are likely to find the film confusing and dissatisfying.<br/><br/>While the execution of special effects was great, it is the creative force behind the decisions that grated against me. The Davy Jones Locker sequence was enjoyable, but after the departure from the barren landscape, the multiple Jacks were distracting and jarring for the progression of the plot. The Calypso scene was similarly disappointing. For a sea goddess to simply be a giant version of her human form was a let-down - where is the fire and water? <br/><br/>Overall, it was enjoyable film, but it's hard to beat the surprising wit and simple adventure the first Pirates had to offer."
"JesusTwinFish","8","2","3","9 June 2007"," An excellent ending to a brilliant trilogy, but just a tad messy...
","Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End is clearly not meant for one viewing. Any stone cold Pirates fan will most likely watch this more than once however the ones that don't watch it more then once might feel a bit skeptical about it; I know I was. I'm a Pirates fan so I watched it twice (not at the theaters) and I have to admit that on the second time I appreciated it a great deal more. It was a very satisfying end to the Pirates trilogy.<br/><br/>When this movie starts out it has the usual touch to it that Pirates 1 and 2 had to them in that it is going to be awesome. However, as the movie drags on it begins to lose it's focus and just becomes a bit absurd with all the deceiving and different story lines going on at once - confusing. It get's sloppy with how many different things are going on all at once and has to make call-backs to the first two as comical reliefs to save itself. It worked a little bit. It worked just enough to get to the end of the film which seemed to be what most of the effort of the movie went to.<br/><br/>I cannot even begin to explain the uniqueness and fantastic ending (including final battle) that it brings. Some say it ""left room for a fourth"" however I do not think that it did, it left us with a happy and touching feeling of hope that seemed to have been lost at world's end (no pun intended). The loss of hope seemed to also be a major theme throughout the film and it was restored at the end. At the end of this on my second viewing it literally brought a smile to my face; not because it was funny, but because it was so relieving (not in a bad way either).<br/><br/>If anybody is a Pirates fan then this is surely NOT to be missed. However, I think to truly appreciate this movie it has to be watched more then once. Yeah, it get's a tad bit messy in the middle and confusing on the first view, but then the ending is very rewarding and very entertaining. The ending will have you on the edge of your seat and people who are suckers for happy ending may or may not be disappointed (I guess it is the way you look at it) And, that is also what makes this movie excellent - your options are open. Pirates 3 is not to be missed, the final and very rewarding ending to, probably, the greatest film trilogy of all time. So watch it, enjoy it, and, stick through it to the ending, you will not be disappointed."
"cranberry_knickers","9","2","3","8 June 2007"," Great movie, 4 stars!!!
","I absolutely loved this movie. I thought that it was a great way to finish a trilogy while still leaving room for sequels (which I hope very much will come!).<br/><br/>It may not be the best for squeamish people (though I know several who love this movie) but if you have a little children this may not be the best movie.<br/><br/>It is a but long, but I don't mind that. There are, however, a few confusing plot lines but they're fairly easy to work out if you pay attention. I myself have seen this movie three times already and again, strongly recommend it for anyone who loves AMAZING (often breathtaking) special effects, action, romance and even tragedy. Good for almost every age group, and sure to become a classic."
"acbc1976","8","2","3","8 June 2007"," the first pirates was the best in my opinion
","I think the first pirates flick was the best. After each flick came out it seemed like the writers were getting more absurd with each story. Come on, Calypso as a giant and then crabs!!!! and the whirlpool in the ocean with the two ships, a bit far fetched, but if you didn't care about all that , it was a pretty entertaining flick. Thought Keith was excellent, the role fit him to a tee!!! I could believe that Johnny was his son lol ! It also ran a bit too long, I had to go potty during the flick, so when do you go or how long do you hold it so you don't miss anything!!!

Anyone have any suggestions as to what it would be? I am very curious as to everyone else's reactions. I give Keith Richards a 10. Awesome job.

"diac228","8","2","3","26 May 2007"," If you've liked the series so far, you are in for yet another treat.
","Decent third installments are just as hard to come by as decent sequels. Nonetheless, At World's End becomes one of those few exceptions to the rule. Combining an engrossing storyline, excellent visuals, brilliant cinematography, superb acting, plenty of action, plenty of thrills, a lot of humor, and a fitting ending to conclude the trilogy, At World's End is sure to entertain and satisfy the fans of the first two installments. Also adding to the nice package of entertainment lies plenty of references to the ride (yet again), a good soundtrack that actually borrows from the great Ennio Morricone, and a humorous cameo from Keith Richards. However, if you don't like the franchise as of now, there is absolutely no reason to see this one, since it uses the same film structure recipe of the first two. Unlike previous third installments, this one does not disappoint, and delivers.<br/><br/>The final chapter (supposedly) of this franchise follows Will (Orlando Bloom), Elizabeth (Keira Knightley), and the recently revived Capt. Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) and his crew as they attempt to bring back Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) for multiple reasons. In fact, each of them has a different agenda with Sparrow in mind. In the meanwhile, Lord Cutler Beckett has control of Davy Jones' heart, which allows for him to command the most powerful ship in the seas, threatening piracy once and for all. It is up for the remaining species of piracy to save themselves and the career of being a pirate. Taking place directly after the ending of Dead Man's Chest, At World's End starts off very quickly, following the very grim introduction. The cast and crew are back, in terms of acting and characters; some minor characters with much more screen time than before, resulting in more humorous moments. Like Dead Man's Chest, Jack Sparrow runs the show but is not the only show going on; we see plenty of Will, Elizabeth, the villains, and Barbossa.<br/><br/>At World's End does not hold any punches throughout the movie. There are plenty of deaths, gruesome moments, and the introduction sets the tone for some of the events that are about to unfold. Death is one of the prominent themes in the film, as well as love, trust, loyalty, and honor. While it is not as action-packed as the previous two, it more than makes up for it with the final battle, which is jaw-dropping entertainment that could have gone forever and nobody would notice. The special effects, without joking, are some of the best ever displayed on film; if this doesn't win an Academy Award of any sort, there should be very little reason to ever trust the Academy again. The cinematography actually kicked it up a notch, with some beautiful scenery. One particular scene has the ship looking like it is sailing over the stars--absolutely gorgeous. We also have a very nice-looking but rather trippy sequence involving Jack Sparrow and his fate after death.<br/><br/>Helping the magnificent special effects is the acting, which is above average for a popcorn flick. Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush rekindle their chemistry and tension shared in Curse of the Black Pearl, and their performances along with that of Bill Nighy remain the best of the trilogy and this movie. But, the others did well, most notably the varied and unique pirate crew, and Keira Knightley as she develops from damsel in distress to a true pirate right in front of our eyes. Director Gore Verbinski does a fantastic job keeping the movie entertaining even when the plots scattered all over the place crashes into each other. Verbinski also knows how to raise tension when the stakes are high, and handles the special effects shots well.<br/><br/>The pacing and editing of At World's End is far superior to that of Dead Man's Chest, as despite it being a lengthier movie, it doesn't feel that way. There are very few moments of slowdown, and even within the moments of slowdown, there are humorous one-liners or acts of physical comedy to keep us awake and laughing, waiting for the next big plot turn. The relationship between Elizabeth and Will takes a step of importance forward here as the theme of love is in the air, and is the result for the rise and demise of the cast of characters in the film.<br/><br/>The only problem with At World' End is that it does not offer anything different from the first two installments; in which it will not attract any haters of the previous two blockbuster hits. The formula remains the same as we see a slow build-up emerge into a powerhouse action flick. In terms of action trilogies, it resembles Indiana Jones the most because of its blend of action, adventure, humor, and romance. While it is no Indiana Jones, the Pirates trilogy easily is one of the best we've seen in decades. Consistently good and entertaining, this franchise is already and shall remain a staple of pop culture and 21st century cinema history.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: Jack Sparrow and the rest are back, and in the final act maintain the entertainment value of the previous two, arguable even stepping it up a notch. The soundtrack, visual effects, special effects, and musical score are at its peak here, despite the storyline still paling in comparison to the original. The acting, pacing, editing and directing remain successful, even though it will not attract those disappointed or disgusted by Curse of the Black Pearl and/or Dead Man's Chest. There aren't enough popcorn flicks that deliver the complete package, and At World's End just leaves you thirsty for more, especially considering recent disappointments from other film franchises. It is a nice tale of the high seas full of action, suspense, comedy, drama, and romance. Highly recommend; grab some popcorn a huge soda, and sit down and enjoy the wild ride towards the end of the Earth."
"lawals78","10","2","3","25 May 2007"," Shiver me timbers, what a movie!
","Shiver me timbers, what a movie! I would have to say that despite a slow start, this movie made the perfect conclusion to a not so great sequel to, ""Curse of the Black Pearl."" Though Pirates 1 had an independent plot and a genius of a plot it'self, I would never would have considered seeing Pirates 3 if it hadn't been for the ending of Pirates 2 when Barbossa came back. That element being thrown in, left me wanting more and BOY was it worth the wait! I strongly recommend that you ignore any negative reviews (some people have nothing better to do than gripe about good films) and see this move! You will have fun. Stick around after the credits for the surprise ending that will knock your socks off.<br/><br/>Just remember, don't set your expectations TOO high or you might just end up being disappointed. This is after all, just a movie that was made for entertainment."
"Skrilax_CZ","10","2","3","25 May 2007"," Watch this movie at least twice ...
","I very recommend to watch the Dead's Man Chest before you go to cinema to watch this movie. The story is answering all questions, but is very, very complicated and long. But you are not bored and that's the main thing. Two captains on one ship, Barbossa and Jack Sparrow, have no mistake. However, there are many charismatic characters that are in the movie only for their charisma and they do actually nothing. That's quite bad as they just complicate the story. After the great One, a little bit worse Two is now the best Three. And after watching Spider-Man 3 and Shrek The Third, this was the only sufficient Three. And the movie continues after credits."
"ratpac03","8","2","3","25 May 2007"," A fantastic end to the series.
","After being disappointed by Spider-Man 3 and severely disappointed by Shrek 3, I was pretty much ready to sit and watch a big action-fest that would wrap up the series but ultimately disappoint. Dead Man's Chest was a little mindless for my tastes so my expectations were low here. Boy was I wrong.<br/><br/>Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End returns to its roots, remembering what made the first movie so great: the storytelling. Many have called the story confusing. It certainly is tricky to follow, but it's not any more convoluted that fits a finale that sets its sights as high as PotC has. A movie that calls itself ""At World's End"" simply has to be grand in scale.<br/><br/>There is action, to be sure, with a grand final battle between the East India Trading Co and the pirates, and this time it's well done. While I found myself bored during Dead Man's Chest because the scenes dragged on, this film suffers no such problems aside from a rather unnecessary scene between Will and Elizabeth.<br/><br/>Performance-wise, surprisingly, Jack Sparrow and his eccentricities aren't left to carry the film between action sequences. Geoffrey Rush's Barbosa becomes fantastic in a near-hero position, while Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom shine once again. Keith Richards also wins for the best cameo in my memory, making a memorable performance out of little screen time, one that is so good that his own celebrity has nothing to do with its quality. The movie is devoid of weak performances, even among minor characters.<br/><br/>There are few flaws in this film, mostly little pieces that I felt were left unresolved but nothing crucial, likely passed over because the film is already nearing three hours. While I would have had no problems sitting through 180+ minutes, most likely wouldn't have.<br/><br/>All in all I'm glad to hand At World's End a solid 9, a score I haven't felt a movie deserved in some time. After being disappointed by a string of films this year from the aforementioned sequels to renting Babel on DVD, a film like PotC:AWE is a true breath of fresh air. Looking forward to the DVD edition."
"bkostrzewski","9","2","3","25 May 2007"," Very involved, but perfect for this series.
","I believe this film was excellent, and there was very little to complain about. In fact, I find that many of the critics' reviews are immature and baby-ish. The primary complaint I came across was that there was ""too much going on"" or that ""it is too difficult to follow the multiple plot lines"". Grow up! So many movies nowadays are extremely watered-down. Adaptations are stripped to their bare bones, and oftentimes plots are simplified for the sake of a disengaged modern audience. I found this intense and winding thriller a breath of fresh air. I agree that it is difficult to follow, but I enjoy the way I, as a viewer, must be completely absorbed in every moment. I realize that intense movies like this are not for everyone, but it is the perfect ending for this trilogy. The past 2 have been dominated by increasingly intricate stories, making this climax no surprise.<br/><br/>If you do not like intense, twisting, and intricate plots, this movie is definitely not for you. But if you would rather see the movie 5 times and catch every word rather than be insulted by watered down trash, then go see it!<br/><br/>On other notes, the screenplay is an incredible balance between comedy and drama. The acting is very impressive, and the visual effects are stunning. While it is definitely heavy watching, the only thing I was left wanting as I walked out of the theater was to see it again!"

But I say judge for yourself. At World's End is an amazing, thrilling ride that keeps you guessing. I was afraid that I was going to be able to predict what was going to happen in the end. I was dead wrong! You don't see any of it coming. The writers did a wonderful job of bringing this trilogy to a close. The actors are amazing as usual. Of course Johnny Depp is charismatic and charming as usual. For me, he makes the movie. Of course he is supported by a talented cast that makes this an enjoyable ride from start to finish. Too long?

The storyline was a bit full... but i think it was still really good! Enough that i may even go and see it again with a friend because she wanted to see it as well but was going on holiday today and has no-one else to go with.<br/><br/>When Jack's dad appears as the one with the book of the pirates code it was really well done because they sort of looked similar but it didn't say for a while and then it told you by Jack asking about his mum... The monkey has just become a source of humour for the series now which works well.<br/><br/>The ends really depresses me though... i mean Elizabeth and Will don't get to be together???? How depressing, it made me want to cry... it made me think of my ex actually... but Elizabeth looked so helpless without Will when he walked away to go back to the flying dutchman. I would be like that if i didn't see my ex ever again it just felt really emphatic to me! I was almost crying when Will died, i wasn't expecting it, i think my boyfriend thought i was a freak! But it was Orlando Bloom dying! Horrible, but obviously well done because it is only a film and yet i was nearly crying.. i think this shows it was well done.<br/><br/>But i think anyone who didn't know if they should see it or not, should definitely see it!!

"mjg11780","10","2","3","25 May 2007"," Mind-Blowing..... !!!
","It could be said that POTC-AWE could be mind-blowing in both, good and bad ways. Mind-blowing for the unbelievably executed fight sequences and special effects along with an ensemble of brilliant actors or mind-blowing for some who couldn't follow the story line and were left wondering what was happening. Either ways, one word that describes the movie is Mind-blowing. Johnny Depp takes Sparrow a step-up, there is no point in describing his genius rather than just acknowledging that the guy IS pure genius. Bill Nighy and Geoffrey Rush are seasoned actors (more genius added to the film). We see the human side of Davy Jones, which makes you root for the character, wanting him to somehow turn good. Kiera Knightley shows a different side to her character and holds her own, Orlando Bloom's character is slightly more developed in comparison to the other two movies where his only aim was to fight blindly for his bonny lass. All the other characters, Norrington, Gibbs, Pintel-Ragetti,Beckett, Governor Swann, Mercer, Jack the monkey, Mr. Cotton and his parrot, Tia Dalma, Marty, Bootstrap and others play their part to perfection (I hope I haven't missed any). Those of you who are Rolling Stones fans or are familiar with Keith Richards would probably get excited by his cameo, and I have to admit, he is not bad at all. And now for the surprise package of the film, Captain Sao Feng. Brilliant choice of casting Chow Yun-Fat for the role, brilliant. Couldn't think of anyone else to play the part. Amazing screen presence, there is something about Chow Yun-Fat's screen presence which is mesmerizing. All you Chow Yun-Fat fans will know what I mean, the guy is the definition of cool. He portrays the character very effectively and left me wanting him to have more screen time. It is a pity that he had a small role. Even though his role was small, his character is very important. Norrington was another character whom I wished had more screen time. All in all a great movie, worth your money. And to those loyal POTC fans, don't miss the short scene after the credits. There might be those who will complain about the movie, but my suggestion for everybody would be to enjoy the ride, it is one hell of a roller-coaster.......Enjoy"

Wait until the very end of the credits for an excellent bonus! My heaven would be like this movie. There are a lot of twists and deal making which may make it hard to follow for those of under the age of 10. <br/><br/>A new side of Jack Sparrow is seen during a deep scene with Barbossa and it is very sexy.

Brilliant plot, all the characters were excellent. I don't understand some critics, maybe it's just plain jealousy or that they don't have any taste. There isn't anything bad about this movie, the action, the scenes, the music, etc...were superb. Critics might say it was long but it was worth it. All of the POTC movies are just perfect, they are the best pirates movies ever. Fans and everybody else, you won't be disappointed and you will never be bored, trust me. You will love it from begin to end. And after the credits you will love it even more. To all those non-good taste critics out there, eat your hearts out, because there will be more POTC movies to come."
"The_Amazing_Spy_Rises","8","2","3","25 May 2007"," Absolutely wonderful. Hilarious, complex, mysterious, and action packed.
","Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End was a wonderful movie-going experience that must be seen in a theater. The audience participation definitely adds to the incredible movie. Though it is just under 3 hours, Pirates 3 is one of the most well done films I've seen recently, mixing almost every movie element into one amazing action adventure film.<br/><br/>Picking up right where Dead Man's Chest left off, Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) is dead. Now our heroes (Orlando Bloom, Keira Knightley, Geoffrey Rush) must stand together to retrieve him from Davy Jones' locker. Meanwhile, Davy Jones (Bill Nighy) is a reluctant servant to the will of Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander), whose vision is now clearer than ever. Every pirate must die. Each character also has personal motives in mind as well.<br/><br/>As always the acting behind Pirates is nothing short of spectacular, the most spectacular being Johnny Depp as usual. This performance is a little different than the one's we're used to, as Jack is even crazier than before, having been lost to Davy Jones' locker at world's end. Depp is as crafty, charming, and absolutely hilarious as ever before as the most famous character of the 2000's. One thing that really stands out for AWE that makes it better than the other 2 is that the character development is top notch. We really see a lot more insight into the minds of our characters, especially Will Turner, Davy Jones, and Tia Dalma (Naomie Harris). The other actors are just as great as Depp. Orlando Bloom gives probably the best performance of his career as Will Turner changes greatly throughout the film. I really enjoyed Bloom for the first time, and I've seen about 9 or 10 of his movies. Keira Knightley lives up to her Oscar nominated expectations, giving her best performance of the series. I know it's hard to believe, but Knightley is the hero of the movie, not Depp or Bloom. She is believable and inspiring towards the end of the movie. The supporting cast is excellent. Bill Nighy and Tom Hollander excel as the central villains, Jones and Beckett. Chow Yun Fat plays a somewhat secondary villain, but it's hard to categorize. His Sao Feng is a bad man, there's no doubt about that, but at times he's a good guy, and at times he's a bad guy. Naomie Harris and Jack Davenport also deliver, and Harris really shines this time around after limited screen time in DMC. Rolling Stone Keith Richards gives a nice turn as Captain Teague in a brief 2 scenes.<br/><br/>Enough about acting. Now to the technical aspects of AWE. The special effects will amaze you, especially the climactic battle sequence that occurs within a whirlpool (maelstrom, if you want to be scientific). How Gore Verbinski and his team created this movie is unthinkable. Every scene looks like it was worked on for weeks just to get the right mood and scenery going. The epic finale is absolutely breathtaking, not only in the action, but in the events that occur in it. The film is also well written by Disney vets Elliot and Rossio, doing exactly what Spider-Man 3 failed to do: effectively weave the main plot and sub plots together. The film is complex, the most complex of the 3. It has its twists and turns that will surprise most, making for an entertaining experience. There are also plenty of laughs, provided mostly by Depp and the crew. Everyone's favorite monkey is back as well, and he (well, it's a she playing Jack) is adorable as well. The film is an absolutely incredible adventure that should be seen in the theater. I recommend Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End to everyone.<br/><br/>10/10 --spy"

","I was at a private screening last night so here is my opinion. I am a pirates fan to the core, but I was a little nervous to see the final chapter. The first one is legendary... the second one was a great movie, but had a really hard time following the first one in all of it's awesomeness... At World's End was no let down at all. The characters were so well played, and the battle scenes were amazing. They honestly looked real. My initial thought about the ending was like ""is this it?"" but then as it progressed, I could not think of a better way. I rate it 10 out of 10. It truly earned it. In addition to the amazing movie, the soundtrack was not too shabby either. I would vote it best of the three with COTBP running a seriously close second and DMC a third place ribbon. I love it and am sad that the Pirate Dynasty is over (I hope not), But if it is, I am elated to know it will live on forever in the hearts of it's many devoted fans."
"nathan-gregg","10","2","3","25 May 2007"," Literally the second most amazing movie i have ever seen
","I was extremely hesitant to see the first Pirates film only because it was a Disney movie and I was afraid it was geared towards children. Wrong. It took me six months to finally watch the first film and that was only because I had nothing else to do.<br/><br/>Needless to say, I am a fan for life. The first was such and extreme surprise to me and the second was progressively better. The third was an extremely well thought, well acted, well written, well everything conclusion. No bad anythings about Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End, not one single thing. If you are going to see a movie this summer make it Pirates. Also, if you are in the Seattle area go to AMC Cinerama 1 on 4th street. That theatre makes it that much better."
"penguinchica24","9","2","3","25 May 2007"," Now bring me that horizon...
","I've noticed quite a few reviews from users saying that the plot was impossible to follow and boring. Well, half a brain and patience will cure both. Is it a long film? Yes. Are there twists and turns and complicated bits of past events? Absolutely. However, any true Pirates fan worth his salt will leave the theater satisfied.<br/><br/>The movie is packed with outlandish characters, some old friends and a few new, and the action in it follows the storyline and wasn't thrown in just for the hell of it. Questions are answered from the first films, and though it may not be the huge hit the first was, it was a fulfilling film and honestly... who can get enough Jack and Will? The original Pirates was amazing, and At World's End serves as a very fitting end for the series.<br/><br/>P.S. Stay after the credits for an extra surprise!"
"mpstrong1414","10","2","3","24 May 2007"," Thank you Disney....for putting together a fabulous cast and story
","Bravo for a job well done. It's incredible how a story came out of a ride over at Disney world and 'Land,. Unlike Harry Potter, where people wait for the movie after reading the book, and then of course the comparisons begin. Here there is none of that! There is no book to compare it to. Just incredible people who put a story together! Johnny is yet utterly hysterical, in many of his many scenes. For this comment you have had to see the movie to understand. He has made an art of Jack Sparrow, and to see his mentor or I should say Keith Richards as his dad is a real bonus two minutes or not. We are always curious to see what makes a character what they are. Elizabeth lives up to her name Knightly at that. Will Turner is a sup rising character as well as is Little Jack. It is amazing that they brought back most of the cast from the first two movies and merged them in with a new cast. This saga has been told only as Disney can! Great Casting enjoyable scenes..Honestly I felt like I was on the ride of my life! Thanks to the cast and film crew and most of all Disney for having the courage to go on with this story out of nowhere.....and to go along with Johnny portrait of Jack. Two hard pills to swallow at first but use that Disney magic fairy dust and there you go! Perfection on the Big Screen for the whole family...yes everyone in the family can go see it! Nothing offensive here! Nothing politically correct either, just Honor and the Code! Ah Go see the movie and have a great Time! Angel Strong"

","You heard me. Yeah, lets just kill off all the main characters and bring them back to life. Because of what? A silly Jamaican broad that turns into Godzilla? Please. Okay so she was the goddess Calypso. So that means she can see into the future (she obviously knew Barbossa would come in handy, thus resurrecting him), resurrect people (ZzZ yeah), transform (AH MAH GAD, GAHDZILLAAAAAA), little of which were explained. Who is she, Superman? Jack was eaten by the Kraken.<br/><br/>Of course he didn't die, he's *beep* Jack Sparrow, aka Superman! Besides the great zombie factor: this film was long and ZzZ. Boring. It had little action where it was needed and too much where it wasn't. All over the place. Strange, unhealthy diet of action.<br/><br/>My suggestion? Save your money, go rent Dawn of the Dead (the original) and Superman (new one, the crappy one) and you'll get a slightly more pleasing aftertaste if you mix them."

","The third installment of Pirates of the Caribbean is not, as popularly believed, disastrous or incredibly confusing. At the very start of the movie I was hooked again.<br/><br/>The movie contains a lot of information to process, but if you actually sit down and follow it you'll find it is not confusing at all. As the third and hopefully not last Pirates of the Caribbean movie, I believe they did an excellent job. Although the movies have become more serious they are still funny and a lot of fun to watch.<br/><br/>Not only did this movie create another cliffhanger ending that leaves us wondering if there will be more but it also immortalized characters such as the famous Jack Sparrow.<br/><br/>I personally think that the second movie was not as bad as people said it was, it was also quite good. The third was definitely better, and allowed you to see the characters in a much different way.<br/><br/>So stop believing people when they say this movie wasn't good at all, it was excellent!"

"yogsottoth","6","1","1","28 April 2020"," Disappointing finale
","This could have been an epic finale to the trilogy but the writers who did so so well in the first two movies, suddenly got run-off-the-mill-popular-TV-show-in-its-8th-season lazy. So many mistakes that needed major fixes.<br/><br/>1- Why kill off the kraken? Someone as ambitious and evil as Beckett is going to simply destroy a giant pet that would do his bidding and nothing else? In the second film no one ever mentioned the Kraken attacking on its own free will. It would be yours to control. Why kill it without even showing it to us? They could have used the Kraken for this film, do you think we DON'T like seeing awesome, overpowering, gigantic, scary sea creatures? And it would have worked out so well because then you could have Calypso kill it, and that could be the reason why they wanted her released.<br/><br/>2- Why bring the heart with its key and everything to the Flying Dutch man? What's keeping the crew from attacking the British and taking the heart? They are immortal if you forgot? Few men with cannons pointed at the heart is going to stop them? Bootstrap killed the admiral and literally nothing happened. No punishment. Well ok how is the Dutchman yours then? Is this you controlling it? You're not supposed to threaten Jones with destroying the heart, he should be bound to do your bidding once you possess the heart. Otherwise, why bring the heart on the ship where he can just take it from you at the opportune moment because he still has his free will! And how do they even go under with mortal soldiers on board the ship? Lazy writing.<br/><br/>3- Calypso was so underused it's ridiculous. You keep building up releasing Calypso all through the movie and what does she do? Turn into an oversized doll and make it rain? Really? You couldn't give her a cool goddess design? ""Just make her bigger, it's not like we're known for our magical creature designs or anything."" I can imagine so many cool looks for her, and her regular human form but bigger is not one of them! And what was her purpose? She did nothing, helped no one, literally just turned into a bunch of crabs. No resolution with Davy Jones, no revenge, no forgiveness, no help, no obstacle. Nothing. So unsatisfying...<br/><br/>4- The last battle was stupid. You bring all these new characters with their awesome costumes and everything, a whole British armada and only the Pearl&Dutchman go to battle. Why? They're right there! Just use them! And why would Beckett go by himself to attack the Pearl? He would stand at the end and watch his fleet do the job. And the British wouldn't just leave because Beckett is dead?! What are they scared dogs that lost the alpha? This could have been an epic, EPIC, sea battle and they ruined it.<br/><br/>5- I absolutely love the bold ending to Will's story but when you think about it, only Will can't step on land, Elizabeth could always visit him on his ship, stay a few days, go back when he has to work. Because from what we've seen, anyone can get on board and stay on board the Dutchman. It's actually not that sad when you think about it.<br/><br/>6- Excuse me when did Bootstrap Bill turn into a mad man? You've been in service for something like 20 years with eternity to go, you don't just get to be a senile part of the ship until you're old af, which should be at least 100 years. We left you completely lucid, and a few months later you don't know who you are anymore? Tsk tsk. I hate it when writers destroy their own lore and rules.<br/><br/>So overall, kinda hated it. The brethren meeting was awesome, loved the French, bold ending is nice although it doesn't really mean anything when you think about it, the action was forced and not exciting, tons of missed opportunities, the magic just wasn't there. It was paced so fast, with so many things it wanted to tell but it was all over the place with no substance. In the end a simple, thorough story with resolution is always better."

"dockerykelli","10","1","1","25 June 2019"," A Great Film!
","This movie was phenomenal! The overall cast from the first one returned to reprise their roles. Lots of action, laughter and of course love!!!"
"meeshoffmanns","9","1","1","9 March 2019"," A Gigantic and Epic feeling Finishing Blow, although Overcomplicated
","Since the first movie, none of the other Pirates movies seem to have had the same level of quality, according to the general public and critics. In my opinion, this is a big surprise. I like the first one the least out the trilogy, and absolutely LOVE the third one. It is funny, emotional, tense, with great characters and production design, action, music, and visual effects. Basically it is doing everything right for being entertaining. Is it perfect? No, but no movie is.<br/><br/>Acting:
Johnny Depp as Jack was here at the top of his game as usual. By now, you are pretty used to the ticks and routines of the character, but he still makes you hold your sides with laughter and baffles you with his scheming skills and mastery of improvisation. It saddens me that he completely lost this in Dead Men Tell no Tales. Jack's arc is surprisingly well fleshed out in the overblown screenplay, and Johnny sells it excellently.<br/><br/>Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley are both doing great, with each character having their own personal stakes in this, that extracts a heavy toll on them. It is mostly through body language however, since their line delivery is not that smoot a lot of time.<br/><br/>Bill Neighy is back as Davy Jones and BOY is he good! To this day this is a mo-cap performance that impresses me even more than Gollum sometimes. The character is very deep and considering how cruel he is, you actually sympathize with him a lot of times. Bill delivered a fantastic villainous performance that will always be remembered.<br/><br/>Tom Hollander as Beckett gets a larger role here than in Dead Men's Chest, and this gives him the opportunity to flesh out the cold and calculating persona a lot more. He is perfect as the slimy, cruel, yet very smart and composed little man, and although he has very little character he is really fun to watch.<br/><br/>Geoffry Rush as Barbossa is absolutely gold. Seeing him actually play the good guy here gives great opportunities to play off with Johnny Depp, and the scenes that they share are absolutely hilarious and full of character. Geoffry fully embraces the wacky and ragged pirate that Barbossa is, and gives his most enjoyable performance to date.<br/><br/>Chow-Yun Fat as Sao Feng is a bit of a missed opportunity: the guy is a great actor and absolutely nails the creepy yet noble pirate lord that Sao Feng is. He gets really too small of a role in this movie, unfortunately, and could have been utilized better.<br/><br/>Jack Davenport as Norrington is also kind of wasted potential here. His character in the first movie was actually pretty likable, and in the second movie he was pretty great because of the new place his character was in. In this movie, he still has an arc, but it is one that is very quickly resolved and Norrington doesn't really play a further significant part, which feels again like a missed chance.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast is absolutely great as all different types of pirates and scoundrels, including the mo-cap cast for Davy Jone's crew, and a testament how much effort was stuck in this movie to make the world feel alive.<br/><br/>Direction:
Gore Verbinski has been the director for all the three movies, and he once again delivers on both emotional and spectacle level. Not all of the scenes feel as realistic as they should be, with too much of the wackiness taking over, but overall Gore can be proud of this.<br/><br/>Cinematography:
Darius Wolzki, who shot Dead Men's Chest as well, holds nothing back in this movie, with great use of color filters, shot positioning and lighting. This might be his best looking movie yet.<br/><br/>Plot:
This is were most of the complaining comes in. This movie is VERY long, and even with all that runtime, a ton of story and character arcs are crammed in. The movies is way more complicated than it needs to be, and although I could follow it pretty easily, I can imagine that a lot of people don't like how much they need to think with this type of blockbuster. That being said, a lot still falls into place pretty neatly, and the dialogue is often hilarious and entertaining to listen to.<br/><br/>Music: Hans Zimmer, who is great at delivering truly spectacular scores that sound both exhilarating and emotional, has given us his best Pirates score yet, elaborating his previous themes and giving new pieces that are great to listen to even when you are not watching the movie.<br/><br/>Production Design:
This is in my eyes the very best part about this movie: every set and location feels handmade, even when it's obviously digital. It is full of props and the decoration looks stunning on the ships and on-land locations.<br/><br/>Costumes and Make-Up:
Just like the production design, a ton of work was put into this to make every actor look exactly like what he is supposed to be. This deserves an academy award for sure.<br/><br/>Sound:
Not much to say on this, I think that the music is more important overall, but there are nice unique sounds sprinkled throughout with the ""weirder"" scenes(one full of little crabs in particular)<br/><br/>VFX:
Just like Dead Men's Chest and Curse of the Black Pearl, this movie reaches to new heights in the digital department, with incredible motion capture and scenery that makes your jaw drop in the massive action sequences and other locations.<br/><br/>Editing:
This movie efficiently hops between a LOT of characters and plot lines while still making it feel like a smooth and coherent ride(at least for me). Particulary the cutting between big action and small comedic/character moments are great to watch.<br/><br/>Tone:
This movie strikes a great balance between grim drama and hilarious comedy, in addition to having big tense action inbetween. Pretty much everything that needs to hit the mark, does so.<br/><br/>General Concensus:
While the story really didn't need to be that stuffed and difficult, pretty much everything else about this movie is great, and an absolute blast from start to finish.(Don't forget the beautiful post-credit scene)"

","30 May 2007. It feels as if one is at a fantastical end of the end, a surrealistic fantasyland of gargantuan proportions with eye-popping special effects and an almost continuous thrill ride of action and mystery. The eerie and atmospheric cinematic vision feast is accompanied by both increasingly violent scenes (almost too excessive and graphic) along with a good dose of one-liners and balanced humor. There are emotional tender scenes of humanity and serious drama. While the substance still hasn't reached maturity in action films, the plot outline a little confusion in places, and the 2 hour and 57 minute length almost at the limits of American tolerance, the major thrust of action entertainment is met with satisfaction in this third installment.

","The third episode of the saga ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" is rather successful. For me, it surpasses the second without however reaching the summits of the first. There is obviously good and less good, let's start with the least good: it must be said, the couple Elizabeth- Will is not very interesting and becomes heavy in the scenario, going so far as to explain in fight, slowing down the pace or getting married in a completely failed scene in my opinion. We also have the advice of the lords who is cool but who comes out of nowhere, in mode ""It is necessary to resurrect Jack to go to this board"", the scenario is weak and it makes a first part of the film heavy, especially with the moments when Jack is in his head particularly bitchy. The last big fault of this film is its length, 2:40 is too long, really. Let's move on to the positive side, obviously, as in all the Pirates of the Caribbean, a very beautiful film with special effects always magnificent. The big point of this film is especially the final battle which is very successful and that makes this film deserves a 7/10. Better than the second opus."

This was simply INCORRECT. This was the main wheel falling off. This is how this film crashed into the rocks at the bottom of the cliff. It could have survived - almost - all the incredibly tedious derring-do that padded out the rest of it, but not the Kraken.

Sadly, the writers decide to swamp the film with such an excess of pointless plot meandering that the two films come in at about five hours instead. Seriously. Every time you think we are getting somewhere, some idiot chimes in with ""But FIRST we have to go to the place to get the thing..."" Incidentally, feel free to wander in and out while all the above is going on, they explain it in great detail so you'll easily keep up.<br/><br/>Keira & Orlando are a lot more annoying in the sequels grumpily storming about like someone has stolen their milk & cookies.

But this is the only movie that I have managed to watch a whole ten minutes before having to fight an urge to vomit and then leave the premises. No production should be granted such a ridiculously huge budget on such a loony script. Those who wrote this must have been so high on toxic substances that I seriously doubt that they managed to survive the experience.<br/><br/>THERE HAS NEVER BEEN PIRATE KINGS AND THERE NEVER WILL BE. I loved the first episode of the ""Pirates"". It was well thought out, well played and well directed. Then the slightly fantastic twist provided by the curse was blown out of any sensible proportions with absurd resurrections, absurd submarine sail ships, absurd barnacle and octopus-clad wet-hell convicts, absurd rebounds with the characters (Now the girl is a big shot pirate too). And the story goes to unravel until there is no sense left. It looks like a virtual adventure gone seriously wrong, but badly written. You could enjoy reading something like ""Otherland"" by Tad Williams, where a bunch of gamers get trapped into a virtual universe. You could understand that much of the unreal stuff is rooted in the mind of those who build their pocket universes, but there is no jump of faith that'll make me accept the turn of events shown in the Pirates' saga. With the budget given to this insult to the movie industry, literally dozens of stories available on the shelves of the book shops could have been brought to the screen.

But At World's End corrects a few of the second movies mistakes, and is a better movie as a result. <br/><br/>The first half was a nonsensical mess, and really had me wondering if this was just going to be three more hours of an empty plot that served only to carry the viewer from mindless action scene to mindless action scene. But the last hour and a half grabbed my attention again, and I actually ended up liking the way that the story ended. <br/><br/>Sure the action scenes are still too long and the story was as disposable as they come, but I still ended up having fun watching the movie. It's nice to finally have an end to the stories of Will and Elisabeth (though I will miss Keira's gorgeous face, I admit), because the best hope of the next movie being good is to have Jack Sparrow as the main focus, without all the story baggage of Pirates 1-3.<br/><br/>Anyway, At World's End left me hopefully for the future of the franchise, which is more than I expected from it. It's not quite as good as Curse of the Black Pearl, but it easily surpasses Dead Man's Chest."

","First of all, I was a huge fan of the first movie of the series and the second one was much weaker, but still a quite nice and entertaining movie to me.<br/><br/>But this third one is just disappointing. This movie lives only from the great acting of the charismatic Johnny Depp. All other actors look really poor, silly, limited, ordinary and unnecessary next to him.<br/><br/>The story is quite weak, the movie way too long and it all seems to be too forced on some action elements and a showdown with some visual effects, but this is all destroying the charm of the first two movies and the originality of the first one.<br/><br/>I've read somewhere that there would be a fourth part. Maybe the studios want to make some money, because the fans and critics can't be happy about a new film after having watched this soulless and superficial movie.

","Fans of the last two Matrix movies and the last two POTC movies should organize a support group. Or you should get together and go to massive therapy sessions. The two film franchises are nearly identical:<br/><br/>1. Excellent first installments. 2. Sequels that were INCREDIBLY bad, yet super fan boys will not admit it for some reason because they loved the originals so much.<br/><br/>I wrote a similar comment/review on POTC 2. What is wrong with you people? This movie SUCKED. It was TERRIBLE. Why can't you just be honest with yourself? You think in 10 years you'll be watching this? Or recommending it to people? If you say yes you are a liar. You are lying to yourself.<br/><br/>What I don't get is that admitting this movie is bad does not in ANY way take away from the original POTC. It doesn't make it any less great of a movie (which it was - the first POTC was a very, very good movie).<br/><br/>Questions for some of you die-hards:<br/><br/>1. What was with the ""sexual tension"" between Knightley and Depp? The movie started to imply there was something there in numerous scenes, but never got any deeper into it or explained why there was tension at all in the first place. Perhaps just bad acting on Knightley's part? I checked into this and the script never intended there to be any.<br/><br/>2. What the hell was that flipping the boat over crap all about? (DON'T just recite the inane storyline to me, I understood it quite well at the time. It was just completely stupid.)<br/><br/>3. Could there have been possibly one more double-cross? Could the director have possibly squeezed in just ONE more? To make it, by my count, 18 double crosses?<br/><br/>4. The pirate meeting! THE PIRATE MEETING! Where they all get together and it looks like a Michael Jackson ""We Are The World"" pirate music video!<br/><br/>You guys need help. I love how over time the ranking for this movie has dropped, dropped dropped. Soon it will be below a ""7"" and you all will start to get it and admit to yourselves that these were mediocre-to-bad sequels.<br/><br/>UGH."

","I enjoyed the first two ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" movies, but this one proved to be a great disappointment. ""At World's End"" ended up being way too long, dull, and far-fetched. Many parts of this film are just pathetic. The first scene with Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) in this film, in which he is seen in Davy Jones' Locker surrounded by a bunch of clones of himself, is one of the most ridiculous excuses for a movie scene I have ever seen. There are so many side stories in this film that I just couldn't keep up with all of them. It is a very long and confusing film with few moments that hold my attention. The scene where the characters turn their ship upside down has good photography and special effects, but it is still a useless concept for a scene. Also, the bits of humor in this film are also pretty lame, compared to the ones in the first two films. These jokes suffer from poor delivery and poor writing in the first place. Every time you think this film is about to end, there is another boring scene coming your way. I don't even know why I rated it as high as I did. Obviously, this film and the previous one are meant to be seen back-to-back, or you will be likely to forget who half the characters are, as I did. Not really worth watching. Stick with the first two.<br/><br/>** out of ****"

","This film was disappointing. A half-baked story that took 2/3's of the films runtime to get going, actors sleepwalking through their roles, and an action set-piece climax that is as uninvolving and boring as the majority of the film. Among the plusse...(read more) s, the films camera-work is stunning, among the highlights is the scenes showing Johnny Depp in Davy Jones locker. You wont see anything that strange and imaginative in a mainstream summer blockbuster this year. The sparse action scenes before the climax are well done, but boring. The cast does a commendable job as a whole, but they don't bring anything new that we haven't seen in the last two movies. Johnny Depp carries the film on his shoulders whenever he appears, too bad he doesn't garner much screen time in the film. Overall, the film is too complicated and takes its self too seriously for its own good. It seemed half-baked compared to the first two's strong story lines, and contained too many characters and subplots. While the 2nd film had some pirate mythology in the form of Davy Jones weaved nicely into the storyline, the third relies far too much on far-fetched pirate history and mythology to carry the plot...so much so that the world the characters inhabit looses its believability as taking place in our world, and the films endless backstories and subplots carried out for the first 2 hours becomes so tedious and boring that you just don't care anymore. The conclusion of the majority of the trilogy's main story lines did not receive enough screen time, and became lost in a pile of underdeveloped subplots. Disappointing...catch it on DVD."

","I was very excited when it was the day this movie was released. I couldn't wait to see it, and then when I entered the theater I was so happy. This movie is really good, despite some cheesy effects, and some mistakes. The storyline and everything is great, but if you are a very observant you can notice some flaws. This film is nice if you are a huge Pirates fan like me and has plenty to die for. Some particular parts of the storyline are boring, such as Jack Sparrow in Davy Jones' Locker. It gets boring and takes so long to finally be done and you think how you ever survived that. But some other parts such as action and battle scenes are great, and Disney has always been known to be superior in that area. But in a nutshell, this movie is good, but if you notice the flaws, you may be disappointed."
"keesha45","8","1","1","6 October 2007"," Jack Sparrow meets ""Mary Potter"" in uninspiring sequel
","I should have guessed something was wrong when I showed up at my neighborhood Garland Theatre and there were only a handful of patrons to watch this latest PIRATES flick. Of course, it was 9:45 pm, on a school night and this was the last day of its 3-week run at the Garland. But when such a paltry crowd shows up, it makes for a bad omen of things to come. Unfortunately, my fears were realized. This is not to say that this latest epic is a bad picture. It's just not up to the standards of the first two, although many of my fellow commentators rate the third PIRATES ahead of the second. For one thing, the whole story in this series has taken a decidedly darker turn from the first film, which was suitable for younger children without being dumbed down for their elders. The sequel, with its Kraken and bloodthirsty squid crew, was not at all suitable for younger folks, and the most recent work has a much darker tone, with very little of the warmth and humor that the characters brought to life in CURSE OF THE BLACK PEARL, and to a lesser extent, DEAD MEN'S CHEST. AT WORLD'S END manages to bring in some intriguing characters, but never really develops them. The Oriental captain, played by Chow Yun-Fat, never gets to do much and his back story with Jack Sparrow should have been filled in with some flashbacks. The same can be said for Jack's father. After so much hype about Keith Richards coming aboard the PIRATES franchise, he has few lines and little contact with Jack. On the other hand, the witch plays what I call a ""Mary Potter"" character, who's there to bring Jack back from the dead, but performs no magic, and instead wanders around mumbling mostly unintelligible dialogue. Her character and the evil Lord Beckett and his henchmen, which later includes the disgraced commodore, serve to bog the narrative down, and their villainy lacks the spirit that Barbossa and Davy Jones gave the first two films. All in all, my main gripes here are that this sequel is much too long, leans too much to the dark side, and it fails to develop some of its more interesting new characters, although I really liked the scenes with the one-eyed pirate and his bald buddy, not to mention the funny bits with the monkey and parrot. Will Turner also gets short shrift in the plot, but the actors playing Elizabeth, Jack, Barbossa and Davy Jones make up for the deficit with outstanding performances. And the visuals, action and rousing score make this a worthy film to see and to own. It's just not up to par with the first two in the series, and if the Disney people can't do any better than this, it's time for the PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN to walk the plank when it comes to further sequels.

"madonnawb","9","1","1","18 September 2007"," A Fitting Closure
","I must say I enjoyed this third installment - I can't say that it was better than the first one, or amazing by any standard, but I was glad that it was fun but also gave us an appropriate closure. The only problem with that of course is that it was a quite predictable closure: The Bad guys get what they deserve while The Good gang prevails- more or less since not everything can be so perfect for the winning side either. As expected poor Will Turner must be sacrificed in one way or another and severed from his lovely Elizabeth... I shed a tear here (almost).<br/><br/>BUT despite this predictable plot, I sincerely enjoyed the movie. It was a tad long (almost 3 hrs) but the cinematography was great and the screenplay developed in reasonable speed and manner which is something I look for in a movie. Now another reason why I enjoyed it so much could also be due to fact that it is supposed to be the last movie, as whether that will stand true remains to be seen, but I like it when movie-makers know when to stop instead butcher the story and drag in on for years with new sequels and triquels and whatevers coming on annually.<br/><br/>Recommended- even if only as a cheap movie night choice."
"colonel_green","10","1","1","4 September 2007"," A joy to watch.
","I saw the first ""Pirates"" film four times in theatres in the summer of 2003; it was one of my all-time favourite film experiences, and its first sequel joined that illustrious group, almost matching its precedessor in pure fun and entertainment. I'm glad to say, having seen the second sequel, it is similarly entertaining. Many people and critics have fallen out of love with the sequels, but I love the films as much as ever.<br/><br/>First and foremost, I love the incredibly complicated mythology that the screenwriters have cooked up, much of it on the fly. The film introduces a lot of major plot elements that were not previously mentioned, including a whole pirate hierarchy (that does play on some information given in previous films), and, in spite of itself, it all just works. There are so many balls in the air, and so many running jokes, that it all amounts to an overstuffed joy on the screen. You have to pay attention, but it's not nearly so complicated as many critics would have you believe; perhaps they were just expecting to be able to switch off their brains in a summer movie.<br/><br/>The cast is simply brilliant, from Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow right on down to the two guys who play the goofy comic relief British soldiers from the first film. In particular, it is great to have Geoffrey Rush as Captain Barbossa (first name Hector, we learn) back, as he adds immeasurable hilarity to the proceedings.<br/><br/>I could go on and on about this film, but sufficed to say, I loved it."

","The third installment of ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" picks up a short while after the second one, and yet manages not to confuse newcomers at all. The cast performs beautifully, rounding out their characters with new twists and quirks, all of which only add to the believability. Setting and story become ever more engrossing, ensuring that only the most uninterested can walk out without worrying about what they are missing. Jack Davenport and Bill Nighy steal the show, despite Johnny's charisma as Captain Jack, and Tom Hollander's talented portrayal of Lord Beckett, the baddie you love to hate. Plot twists will keep fans glued to their seats, and newcomers wondering what will happen next, and the set design will knock your socks off. Go see this movie before it leaves theaters. There is just no substitute for seeing the final battle on the big screen."

And it really touched my heart how much Elizabeth loves Will, but then made me sad that real life doesn't seem to play out that way. I was still happy for them, and was looking forward to their 10 year anniversary, so they could reunite.

"eagle_eye183001","9","1","1","1 September 2007"," Three times is a charm
","This movie will have you wishing that you were a pirate. This one in a way reminds you og the first movie in that it remains exciting from start to finish and never misses a beat. I loved that Barbossa returned at the end of the second movie and was a huge part of this one because I felt he was the epitome of a pirate (no offense to Jack Sparrow) as he was barking orders fighting muliple enemies i thought that only he came close to Davey Jones (in the climatic battle between the Black Pearl and the Flyind Dutchman in the whirlpool, which i thought was the best idea for a climax overall, as the two ships are descending into the whirlpool Barbossa says ""It would be far too late for us to alter course now maetys!"" and then laughs his trademark laugh to me summed up the movie in all). Only thing that I thought was a drag was the concept of Davey Jones LOcker as it was just an isolated island instead of a heavily guarded prison which was guarded by dead pirates or possibly Davey Jones himself (before I saw this movie that confused me how the Locker was some far off place and yet Davey Jones sailed around the seas forver). one thing that tripped me out the first time I saw it was when Beckett had Royal Navy soldiers stationed on the Flying Dutchman and the thought of soldiers on the same ship as the undead or ""fishpeople"" as one soldier in the movie implied (i still get a laugh out of that scene when the troops first arrive on the ship and one soldier trembles at the sight of Davey Jones' crew and Norrington walks up to him and says ""Easy now!""- how can you possibly remain calm when you're standing next to something that's not human). But overall I thought all of the chatacters did a good job except for Will (he complained too much and tried to be too much like Jack, in my opinion instead of Jones killing him I thought someone should have made him walk the plank because no one needed him for anything, Elizabeth didn't even need him!) and Gibbs (who I though went out like Jack's flunky), I thought it was funny how the Governor died as he was sailing to the LOcker as the crew was sailing from it, Norrington as well as he tried to be a semi-hero (too bad he was on the wrong ship!) and Jones got bad break by getting killed which was unfortunate since he was the villain."

The fight scenes are insane, they are so cool. The ending to this movie is very unexpected, that is all I'm going to say. Johnny, Orlando, and Keira come back with Pirates 3 and it's a knockout. You should see this movie more than once, even though it's very long. It comes out on DVD December 4! Go buy it."
"dbborroughs","8","1","1","26 August 2007"," Great ending to the series
","Let me start by saying that the biggest flaw of the film is that this film simply starts at point A and goes. This is not to say that the film shouldn't do that, no rather I'm arguing that the film needs a bit more of a bridge between this one and the last one. Sue me, for what ever reason I felt like I was reading a book and that some one ripped out two chapters in the middle and that while you can follow what was going on you'd be better off had you read what was missing.<br/><br/>That said, I really loved this movie. Packed to the rafters with plots and ideas and action this is the film that the last film should have been. This is a solid 2 hours 45 minutes that never lets up-even as it confuses you. What can I say this film proves what a mistake the last one was and how you really shouldn't take a 90 minute movie and blow it up another hour. But enough complaining about the last film, lets talk about this one.<br/><br/>A great thrill ride where characters shift and grow and things move along. I loved it. I loved much of the small stuff-The Bootstap Bill stuff, the broken hearted lovers, the romance and everything else. If there is any real flaw to the film its that the villains-the East India trading company don't really make sense are not menacing enough especially compared to Davy Jones and Captain Barbosa (also some of what they do makes no logical sense whats so ever). Caught on the ride I didn't care I just went with it all (though I still wish they weren't so whimpy.) Definitely worth a look see."
"Bing5253","9","1","1","27 May 2007"," Great, but not if you like short movies.
","Pirates of the Carribbean 3 is definitely better than the second in the instalment. The plot keeps you hooked till the end and the acting is great as well. The amazing music still stands strong and all the effect and clothing still look magnificent. The third instalment was also a lot more violent than the first and second movies (watch out for hangings) However, this is not for anyone who does not like epic movies. At 2 hours and 50 minutes you need some food with you to keep you going. None of the film is particularly boring but the time doesn't just speed by like it does in other long movies. I also suggest you watch it with a friend as it will make the film all the more fun if there is someone to talk about it with afterwards.<br/><br/>To sum up, I highly recommend this film to anybody who does not mind sitting through a long movie.

I found that this last piece of work (from what I heard) venturing more into wider part of pirates world. Though I was a bit disappointed of the roles of other pirate lords.

The end with Davy Jones stabbing Will was surprising. I kind of wish that they wouldn't have killed off the Kracken outside of the movie. I would have liked to see the battle where the kracken was killed. I also liked the 9 pirate lords. I thought they were hilarious at the end. The beginning of the movie was creepy with the mass hanging of the alleged pirates. I thought the movie balanced very well. I really don't see why critics hate the movie so much.

"choosetolive","10","1","1","26 May 2007"," A fan's movie
","I am a fan of the Pirates franchise, and as such am very familiar with the preceding movies. Stating that, I say that At World's End is a fan's movie. I enjoyed virtually every second of it, I found it rich and layered and complex without becoming overly confusing. I was extremely satisfied with the experience and can't wait to watch it again. <br/><br/>Its weakness is the fact that it's a fan's movie. If you aren't familiar with the events of Dead Man's Chest (and I think that means more than having seen it once last summer), odds are you'll be confused by what's happening - not a lot of time is spent re-establishing plot points to bring you up to speed. Dead Man's Chest got a lot of criticism for being somewhat disjointed and complicated - criticism I agree with. I feel that At World's End tells a much more coherent and well-paced story without sacrificing an intricate plot. DMC felt like a long movie; AWE is longer but I never once felt it. <br/><br/>I also feel that AWE is much better written than DMC was. The dialogue isn't clumsy, and there's not a self-conscious effort to be funny. While there are humorous moments in the film, they never feel forced or obvious, as happened in DMC. References to the past movies are a joy to discover (there are some really subtle ones, and I have no doubt that there are many I didn't see on the first viewing). I feel like the writers concentrated on the plot and characters almost exclusively and let the humor occur naturally as opposed to the drawn-out, almost slapstick sequences that peppered DMC. The same is true for the effects - there's some gorgeous effects shots (and some gorgeous shots in general) but the filmmakers are no longer trying to best themselves in terms of effects. They simply serve their purpose unobtrusively, which is what effects are supposed to do. Only in one sequence did I feel the effects work wasn't up to par (and it involved models and forced perspective more than CGI). <br/><br/>The only true quibble I have with the film, on first viewing, is a character plot line that I don't feel was fully resolved. Overall I enjoyed the character development immensely, and especially love the arc for Elizabeth. As with the preceding movies, it will require more than one viewing to really appreciate the journey each character takes, and I look forward to that experience!<br/><br/>Overall, an excellent achievement, a fan's movie, one I enjoyed from start to finish and plan on enjoying many times in the future. I couldn't have expected more."

"moviegeek310","9","1","1","26 May 2007"," Third Times a Charm
","Third times a charm with ""Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End."" In my opinion it is the best of the trilogy hands down. I think I would be quite hard to find a movie as fun as this one this summer. Every scene is a blast to watch with the hilarious visuals or dialogue, or a great battle scene. Here's the downer though, the plot is so muddled, and confusing, there are so many times that you have no idea what's going on. Even director Gore Verbinski said he was confused at times. It's not a good sign when the maker doesn't even know what's going on. On top of that, half the time you have no idea who is on which side, as everyone backstabs each other at least once. So I won't even attempt to explain the plot, I would probably mess it up. But did I mention the movie is fun? <br/><br/>Johnny Depp, as always, is spectacular as Captain Jack Sparrow. There were times in the second film when it seemed that the filmmakers were forcing the Sparrow humor, but he has found his niche in this film again. There are scenes, like one with fifty Jacks in Davy Jones Locker, where you'll bust a gut laughing. Keira Knightley actually stepped it up for this one. She no longer seems like just a pretty face, she actually does some serious acting, and has some hilarious scenes. Orlando Bloom, is, well, he's just Orlando Bloom. A huge 'welcome back' goes to Geoffrey Rush who returns as Captain Barbossa. He not only is extremely cool, but he also may have passed Jack Sparrow as my favorite character. He is that good and you'll see why. Let's see, there are so many new and old characters I could mention that were amazing, but that would take up the whole page. There is one more worthy of mention though, Keith Richards. Yep, the Keith Richards as Jack's father. It is only a brief scene, but it is certainly a scene-stealer. <br/><br/>The C/G in ""Pirates"" has stepped it up even more than the amazing effects we saw in the first and second ""Pirates"". For example, the last battle takes place in a huge maelstrom, a battle scene that'll go down in movie history. Your jaw will be on the popcorn-covered floor of the theater. Just a word of warning though, This ""Pirates"" is the most brutal and violent of the three, with the body count innumerable. <br/><br/>This is certainly not going to be the best film-making of the summer, but it will be the most fun and entertaining one. And clocking in at just under three hours; be prepared to spend lots of time with pirates. For me, I could watch 'Pirates of the Caribbean"" movies forever, so a three hour running time didn't hinder me, and it shouldn't hinder you. Everything is wrapped up nicely in the end, but you can tell they are hinting at many more stories for Captain Jack. Oh boy, I'm excited! And like every other blockbuster released so far, critics are roasting it. Don't they ever take a break? People watch ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" for fun, not for excellent film-making. Why can't they get that through their heads? Don't listen to them, see this film and have the time of your lives and be sort of confused."
"BeautyandtheBeast_Fan","9","1","1","26 May 2007"," Great movie
","I loved everything about it...virtually. The only thing I didn't like? - The confusion as to whether or not Will's return after the ten years was for good or for one day, then he couldn't see them for another ten years. Everyone has differing answers...it wasn't clear enough. Some people think that he was going back for one day then leaving for another ten years, but others, me included, think that he was returning for good because Elizabeth was faithful to him.<br/><br/>I really don't know what to think. I want the curse to be lifted because I want him to be there with his wife and.....SON. How cute. But NO ONE can be certain unless a 4th film is made."

It answers all questions left by the second, and is really just so entertaining.<br/><br/>I don't care what anyone says, I hope they make another one! The story is so original and and classic at the same time, and I do think that there is a lot more story that can be told. I think they should do something with the fountain of youth idea that comes up at the very end of the movie, and make something a little closer to the first movie, with more beautiful scenery from the Caribbean (which I feel got taken over by special effects in the other two) and a good old pirate treasure hunt. <br/><br/>All in all, this movie does not disappoint, and has left me hungering for more.

When he was wounded (mortally, as we thought) in the first film, the whole cinema hall cried: NOOOOO!! I doubt if there were people today to cry for Jack again.<br/><br/>At World's End reveals two great characters, brothers in iniquity, Lord Becket and Davy Jones - and they were the main reason for me to hold the attention till the end. A good villain is a half of every successful story; and here we have two great villains. As well as we see under the monstrous mask of Jones the human soul deeply wounded with love and betrayal, we also see the cold cruelty under the soft and comely face of the lord; discovering their inner essence they become more interesting than any good guy (although all good guys and girls become bad ones during the film - at least for a while). And they both have something deeply hidden that we can't expect from them. There are almost painful and heartbreaking episodes - a single brilliant tear falling from the eye of Davy Jones and the superhuman and admirable tranquillity in which lord Becket meets his bitter end. Both of them are doomed since the previous movie; each and every watcher wishes them dead, but they do not die without attempting to reach their goal however distant it may seem. I love the brilliant Englishness of their play, especially Hollander with his haughty smiles and beautiful dispassionate eyes, his tea-times on the very edge of his final battle and his slight to the others. He is a bad man, maybe, but a faultless machine. My type of best movie villains."

'Pirates of the Caribbean' will be part of countless childhood memories carrying the genre over into the 21st century by tying it in artfully to its romantic and exotic tradition from the past and still giving it a distinctly contemporary sheen.

","I suppose that it easy for a high-brow movie critic to pick holes in the film, but if you want a film to be entertaining and fun then POC3 takes a huge amount of beating. For a very long film it held the attention beautifully and a surprising number of people in the cinema sat through the (endless) credits for the short clip at the end. The special effect were out of this world (appropriate!) and the twists and turns in the plot held the attention without the need to underline them. Johnny Depp's wonderful over-acting put him in the same class as Brian Blessed and Alan Rickman and although the rest of the cast were superb, I thought that Kevin McNally as Mr Gibbs was consistently strong throughout all three films. A great bit of fun and plenty of doors left open for POC4.....Please"

After the very ""fishy"" end to POC - Dead Man's Chest I eagerly awaited the inevitable comeback of Captain Jack Sparrow (wonderful role for Johnny Depp). After what I had seen in the trailers (especially the giant waterfall scene) I was filled with excitement as I waited for the release. I came out of the theater and talked about the movie all the way home. It's got everything anyone could ask for: action, laughs (wonderful one liners, catch phrases and facial expressions of the characters) and touch of romance without all the exaggerated, corny, mushy, tear-jerking scenes. *SPOILERS* For instance, I thought that the scene where Will and Elizabeth are fighting the crew of ""The Flying Dutchman"" and Will asks Elizabeth to marry him was going to be another romantic scene that I just wanted to end. But I was actually surprised it was turned into a very comic and action packed scene. Or the scene where Will dies and replaces Davy Jones. You didn't see a lot of crying or comforting and it's one of the first time i've seen something like this. And to think this is a Walt Disney movie... *END OF SPOILERS* I recommend this movie to all of the fans of the previous parts in the series, and to those who haven't's any of the POC movies: GO SEE THEM.

There are not as many jokes as there are in the first two but there are still plenty. There are also plenty of action scenes that look amazing on the big screen.

"deltahalo13","8","1","1","26 May 2007"," A pirate's life for me...
","I attended the 8:00pm showing of AWE on May 24th with some of my friends. We had all been anticipating the film for months (we made some costumes as well). Obviously, there was a lot of hype behind the third installment of the Disney's uber-popular Pirates of the Caribbean. And now, after finally seeing the nearly 3 hour film...all I can say is believe the hype.<br/><br/>The movie picks up where Dead Man's Chest left off: Will Turner, Elizabeth Swan, Captain Barbossa, and their troop of comical, yet useful comrades set off to world's end to fetch back Captain Jack Sparrow from Davey Jone's locker. Meanwhile, Lord Beckett and the Royal Navy plan to remove piracy off the face of the world.<br/><br/>The film is fantastically paced...there are just enough conversations and slow parts to understand what is going on, without taking away from the action and comedy. Then again, most of the conversations are comical...almost too much. I say that with the utmost looseness; I realize that the Pirate's franchise is comedy/action. As usual, Jack Sparrow steals the show with his witty one-liners and physical quirks. Keira Knightley (Elizabeth) has also notably improved her acting skills.<br/><br/>As you've probably heard before, the final battle sequence is one of the best you will ever see. I can't imagine the sheer amount of hard work that went into that 20-30 minute block of film. It is utterly fantastic. I must also note the spectacular scene towards the end of the movie, featuring Lord Beckett. All I could think was ""this is the coolest thing I've ever seen."" The water-fall scene is also quite notable.<br/><br/>Now that I've got the good out of the way, I must note the very minor, yet annoying, negative qualities. I think many people will agree with me when I say that Gore Verbinski should've thought the entire ""Jone's locker"" sequence out so much better. There are many other ways to portray hallucinations than showing Jack Sparrow ""killing"" his mirage for half a peanut. Also, towards the end of the film when Calypso is introduced, you would think that the ""goddess of the seas"" would have a better entrance than a pile of crabs.<br/><br/>With that said, these small annoyances hardly take away from the grand scale and quality of this film. You will laugh, you will definitely cry, and you will love every minute of this spectacular Pirate's addition.<br/><br/>I give it an 8/10.<br/><br/>(Please don't take your small children to this movie...it really is a lot more violent than the other two movies.)"
"JuliaGulia967264","8","1","1","26 May 2007"," Worth the Watch
","The third installment of 'Pirates' is full of action as it follows its numerous plot lines to a finish. However, to those of you who appreciated the humor that accompanied the first two installments, you may be disappointed to see that the third is certainly lacking in the comedy department. It lacks the same character that Captain Jack brought to the first two, and instead focuses on the pirate's battles and Will and Elizabeth's romantic turmoil. Although Captain Barbossa's return (which we see in the end of the second film) is a great addition (let's face it, he's the most pirate-y of them all), his character is this time focused on the fight to save the pirates from extinction. This film is worth the watch, but the comedy is certainly missed."
"victor_manuelle","10","1","1","26 May 2007"," Absolutely beautiful.....A masterpiece
","I couldn't have thought a better ending for this saga then this movie. It is long, but don't worry, the length is needed to convey the AWEsome story line of this movie. It is better then previous movies, with Jack being absolutely amazing (funniest actor). Everyone has their share of betrayals, and its plot is perfect.. It keeps you on the edge of your seat (or should I say, from the Sound FX you will be probably fastened to your seat). it builds up, to the end which is a masterpiece of CGI/Live action integration. By far the best I have ever seen on a movie. Don't be fooled by other trilogies(shrek, spidey) doing bad.., this movie is worth your 7 bucks. I watched it yesterday, and Im gonna watch it again today. It is Disne's darkest movie yet, with I think it should deserve an R rating.Very fun, full with action, and romance this movie is gotta be the biggest film of the year. Gore,Teddy & Eliott have OUTDONE THEMSELVES. The soundtrack fits perfectly, with everything from choruses, to hair-raising fanfare, and other themes its beautiful. I don't want to reveal anything about what happens in the movie, but people, even if you hate pirates, this movie HAS TO BE SEEN!! Also like I did go see it unspoiled because it has such power you need to see it to believe it. People who have seen it agree with me, this movie is a masterpiece and a must see for any movie lover.

"iloveoregano16","10","1","1","26 May 2007"," Completely Amazing
","I didn't think this movie was actually going to be all that good. Seeing as the second one was all a set up for the third, i thought they'd try to make it super flashy and all but have it totally disappoint.<br/><br/>Jack, oh Jack, was marvelous as ever. Then again, it's hard to expect him to disappoint. This was my favorite movie for Keira Knightly/Elizabeth. Elizabeth's character develops really well in my opinion, and I think Keira steps up and plays it really well. Will Turner gets a lot more... dark i guess, and despite my dislike for (most of) Orlando Bloom's acting, he did pretty well. Barbosa's return was definitely a benefactor. <br/><br/>As for the plot, i still don't think it tops the first, but it does comes pretty close. From where they left off in the second movie: -Lord Beckett has Davy Jones heart and is using it to help get rid of all the pirates. Norrington has been appointed Admiral. -Barbosa, Elizabeth, Will, and the rest of the crew are in Singapore, requesting the help of Captain Sao Feng (Chow Yun-Fat) to retrieve Jack -who is hallucinating his life away in Davy Jones Locker<br/><br/>From this, we add the 9 pirate lords, Will's promise to free his father from Davy Jones, Jack's fixation with immortality, and one pretty amazing final battle.<br/><br/>Still not quite as good as the first in terms of plot, but very close. However, At World's End is definitely the funniest. <br/><br/>Oh yes, and STAY AFTER THE CREDITS. They're kind of long, but if you feel like Will and Elizabeth's ending wasn't good enough, you should definitely watch it."
"Hancock_the_Superb","8","1","1","26 May 2007"," Rousing conclusion to the ""Pirates"" trilogy
","With Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) dead and the heart of Davy Jones (Bill Nighy) in his hands, Lord Cutler Becket (Tom Holland) of the East India Company institutes a draconian crackdown on piracy. With the reluctant aid of Jones and his ship, ""The Flying Dutchman"", Becket decimates the world's pirates. Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley), and the resurrected Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), along with Tia Dalma (Naomi Harris) and the usual crew (Kevin McNalty, Lee Arenberg, Mackenzie Crook), rescue Sparrow and call a meeting of the Bretheren of the Coast in order to make a last stand against Becket and the EIC. Also along for the ride are now-Admiral James Norrington (Jack Davenport), whose sense of nobility is conflicted by working for Becket, and Sao Feng (Chow Yun-Fat), a vicious Chinese pirate king. <br/><br/>At first, I was apprehensive about this movie. The second film had been a complete disappointment - leaden, forced, overlong, and convoluted, creating ridiculous story lines that seemed to have little potential. On top of that, most of the critical reviews of this film I'd read were savage. So I was hoping that ""At World's End"" would be at least worth my 161 minutes, if nothing else.<br/><br/>I was not disappointed.<br/><br/>As with any film in the fantasy genre, ""At World's End"" is susceptible to logical pitfalls. In films like this, we MUST accept that characters can come back from the dead without explanation, that there are random Greek gods/goddesses who interact with fragments of nautical lore, that a pirate captain will marry two people in the middle of a vicious hand-to-hand naval battle in the middle of storm, that there are undead monkeys who are fired out of cannons. Anyone criticizing these aspects of the film is a sourpuss.<br/><br/>The point is: I was entertained throughout. While, like its predecessors, ""At World's End"" is overlong by about twenty minutes, the storyline is engrossing and so the viewer doesn't really notice the length. It manages to recapture the humor, double-crossing, and characterizations which made the first film entertaining, and were horribly lacking from ""Dead Man's Chest"".<br/><br/>The film contains many memorable set-pieces, which occasionally (well, frequently) lapse into CGI overkill. The grim opening, with the mass execution of condemned pirates, is genuinely chilling and memorable, as is the sequence where the ""Pearl"" encounters boats of the recently deceased entering the world of the dead. The action scenes are relatively few, with a very impressive final confrontation between the ""Black Pearl"" and the ""Flying Dutchman"" (in a maelstrom, in the middle of a thunderstorm) the high point. The art direction and costumes are gorgeous, particularly the design of Singapore.<br/><br/>I was surprised at how satisfactorily the various plot lines set up in the second film were resolved. While many critics have criticized the lengthy dialog scenes and seemingly never-ending betrayals, all of it actually leads to a point. The many back-stabbing moments force the characters to make a final stand and determine, once and for all, what side they stand on. There aren't any plot threads left hanging in the air, though the possibility of another sequel is left open.<br/><br/>There are, admittedly, some bits which don't come off too well. My biggest problem is the ending - I won't ruin it, though most people reading this review probably know it by now. But suffice it to say, it starts off as an intriguing resolution and changes into a cop-out, half-assed conclusion that neither satisfies the audience nor makes much sense. The whole Calypso bit just doesn't come off well for me at all - why not include Poseidon or Odyssesus while you're at it? And there's only so much humor you can ring out of undead monkeys, midgets, Jack's multiple personalities, and wooden eyeballs. And Will and Elizabeth's impromptu marriage - please.<br/><br/>The most welcome aspect of the film is Captain Jack Sparrow. In ""Dead Man's Chest"", his character seemed tired; he ceased being amusing, and in fact I was almost happy when he ""died"". But here, Johnny Depp is able to make Sparrow the wonderfully entertaining character he was at first, throwing in some nice character development - he actually has a measure of loyalty this time around, without compromising his usual roguish nature. The several scenes played with multiple Jack Sparrows were a bit tiresome, but overall Depp makes a refreshing return to form, with his usual wit, sleazy charm, and style.<br/><br/>The other actors are given more to do than in previous films. While Orlando Bloom continues to struggle with the concept of acting, Keira Knightley manages to make Elizabeth a much more interesting character than in previous installments. While his return from the dead is never explained, Geoffrey Rush's Barbossa is always welcome. Tom Hollander makes Becket, a cypher in ""Dead Man's Chest"", a truly memorable, nasty villain this time around. Likewise, Jack Davenport does an excellent job as the increasingly conflicted Norrington, while Jonathan Pryce makes more of an impression in his brief appearance than in the previous two films combined. Bill Nighy, Naomi Harris, Kevin McNalty, and ""the rest"" continue their usual fine work. There are some performances which don't come off - Chow Yun-Fat, for instance, has little to do and exists solely as a plot device. Stellan Skarsgard does what he can with his much-reduced role as Will's father, which isn't much. Keith Richards' cameo, for all the hype, isn't really up to much. <br/><br/>""At World's End"" is a wonderfully entertaining conclusion to the ""Pirates"" trilogy, and in my opinion the best of the lot. It has many problems which a critic, a cynic, or a sourpuss would enjoy pointing out - but the rest of us can leave our brains at the door and enjoy an entertaining film. Is that so much to ask? All I have to say is: if they make a fourth one, it BETTER be good.<br/><br/>8/10."

","Despite the fact that every character had multiple agendas and half the people in the theater didn't understand the plot, I LOVED this movie. It had it's usual share of funny moments that were hilarious without overwhelming the movie. The same could be said about the special effects--the best I've ever seen, but they were a contributing factor, not the whole movie.<br/><br/>What really got me was the Will story. The whole betrayal thing didn't work for me at first but they turned it around. (though wtf was with that tea scene?) The scene where Will was stabbed by Davy Jones was perfect, and it finally made sense why Will became captain. (my best friend and I cried at this scene) The beach scene was similarly beautifully done, and if you stayed after the credits, you'd see a scene just as beautiful.<br/><br/>The Jack-Elizabeth story wasn't a big part of the movie, maybe because Jack has lost interest since Elizabeth killed him. I'm not sure--it seems like they almost completely dropped the storyline, save that bit at the end where Elizabeth tried to kiss him. Speaking of Jack, I love that he's after his ship all over again. A perfect end to the trilogy."

","I just left the cinema and I can't make a full judgment of this movie It doesn't' disappoint, that's for sure but I don't considerer it a masterpiece.<br/><br/>It is obvious I enjoyed the film, a lot, no question about it. The beginning was darker and the expectation was growing inside me. The first 45/50 (I don't have a precise idea how long took to rescue Jack) minutes were really captivating. But then in the middle of the film I was just wondering to myself if the plot was clear and satisfactory...all that treason was making me a little bit confused and that's why I think the movie was too long. Some dialogs were just pointless. The multiple Jacks were another thing I didn't particularly like; to me was pop-corn easy comedy. Besides this the movie was 10/10.<br/><br/>The special effects and sound were perfect just like in the other two previous movies. The final battle is clearly the highlight of the whole trilogy, awesome, epic, and simply unforgotten as a great fan of Pirates could ever hoped for; it perfectly combines the emotional and action factors as Will tries at the same time to marry Elizabeth and save his father and Jack his neck from Davy Jones.<br/><br/>In terms of acting, Johnny Depp continues perfect in the role, Geoffrey Rush makes an excellent return, Bill Nighy is also great, Orlando Bloom does not disappoint and Keira Knightley was pretty cute and hot this movie, these two are the cheesy couple but I think they are both great. Tom Hollander plays his character pretty well with his calm, unconcerned style but always knowing what is doing.<br/><br/>Overall 9/10"

The film is daring in the opening scene before the title and continues forward with a great action packed introduction.<br/><br/>The wait was worth it. The film is darker than the previous films and lighter at the same time. It does a great job of throwing you an emotional fastball and then the next minute you get a lighter curve ball.

At times you can't help but wonder if what you are seeing is practical or special effect.<br/><br/>There are a few story elements that are not followed through with, such as the calling by the pirate brotherhood of a certain ""beasty"" which in the end really never seems to play out just right. But in the end, you don't really care.

","I might as well have watched Keira Knightley, Orlando Bloom, Johnny Depp and Jerry Bruckheimer throw 300,000 ten dollar bills in a flaming barrel.<br/><br/>This film is the most incomprehensible blither that I have ever seen produced by a major studio. For some reason that escapes me, the filmmakers seem to think that ramping complexity equates story, which isn't true. The plotting, which would have embarrassed me in a video game, seemed to have been written by a down-syndrome twelve year old hopped up on caffeine at two in the morning. It managed the somewhat rare feat of being not only stupid, but insanely complex: at one point, I think that Johnny Depp manages to double cross HIMSELF. There are so many alliances made and broken (in one seen, there is a QUADRUPLE cross; you can actually try to keep track if you wish, but you could also just bash your heads against a wall for all the reward you'll get). For some reason, the producers felt that making the film INCOMPREHENSIBLY complicated would make the film SMART, which simply isn't true.<br/><br/>But at least, I thought, I'd sit through it for the effects, but the action sequences are too slick, too staged, and too illogical to be fun. While the second had the kraken and the escape from the island, all of the action sequences in the third are uninspired and forced, in a Disney sort of way. And, like the rest of the film, they're unnecessarily complicated. Insult is added to injury in that you're forced to sit through a number of ""inspiring"" speeches beforehand, including that most essential and contemporary element of modern blockbusters: the ""they can't take our freedom!"" scene.<br/><br/>Unsubtle yet confusing, uninteresting yet bloated, this is the worst kind of big Hollywood drivel: trash that thinks it is something more, or at least tries to convince us of it. How insulting."
"ThomasMagnumPI","Null","5","12","25 May 2007"," Lame Movie = Dead Franchise
","Pirates, pirates, pirates... A very disappointing end to this epic trilogy. I was in love with this series after the first movie, with its comical, elaborate fight scenes, acrobats, plot and everything, but the 2nd movie, Dead man's Chest, was slow, and nothing really happened. It didn't make me shoot myself like ""Pirates of the Caribbean : At world's end."" First, the acting in this movie was horrible. The Asian pirate lord was a useless character and bad actor. Same with orlando bloom. Now he has a more unbelievably useless position of captain of the dutchman. I couldn't believe how stupid that was. Orlando Bloom ruins this series more than anyone else.<br/><br/>Kiera Knightly, she is a mediocre actress at best. She is amazingly attractive, but, she didn't even strip for me and other viewers. Plus, shes been a pirate for like a month and is now the most skilled combatant of them all? NO! That's not right. I'm not trying to sound sexist but it's stupid. She becomes king of pirates? Ugh..<br/><br/>The whole story about Calypso and love between her and Davy Jones was one of the many useless stories / confusing plot twists in Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End.<br/><br/>This movie was confusing, disappointing, lame and flat out bad! I did enjoy the parts with Barbossa and Jack Sparrow though. I did not enjoy the scenes where there was a crew of Jack Sparrows and he was talking to himself. It was a stupid, lame move, like only Disney would do.<br/><br/>After I have been told a lot by friends. I just realized that this movie attracts 11-17 year old girls, not actual movie fans."
"BroadswordCallinDannyBoy","5","4","9","29 May 2007"," An action packed mishmash
","The continuing adventures of Captain Jack and crew.<br/><br/>This time around the era of the pirate is coming to an end. There are strict laws in effect that grant no mercy to pirates or people who help them. Thus the pirates of the world try to gather together together and decide their fate, and of course get Captain Jack back.<br/><br/>By the end of the second movie, the word ""overkill"" was practically written across the screen. In this entry it is there for most of the movie. Desperately trying to top the previous two films, ""At World's End"" packs in relentless and overblown action sequences, filled with all sorts of special effects and pounding music in conjunction with the fact that it is trying to provide the viewer with a clever plot involving elusive allegiances and mythology.<br/><br/>The action scenes are just like before, only much more frenetic and constantly less believable. This is a fantasy film, but even the genre has defined limits between entertaining and ridiculous. This is just insanely overblown and ridiculous. The plot tries to be clever, but ends up playing like a daytime soap opera with allegiances substituting for relationships. The dialog is corny and has none of the wry humor that made the first ""Pirates"" so enjoyable. The mythology is not very clever and is just reincorporated elements from other mythologies that happen to suit the story - Calypso was the Ancient Greek Goddess of the sea, for one - but too bad that it is all so bland.<br/><br/>Clocking in at nearly 3 hours, the film could use some serious economy and pacing work to be enjoyable. Certain sequences are so long and end up leading nowhere until they are done and even then we are only provided with a short leap in the story. The worst offender of these being a dream/alternate reality sequence early on.<br/><br/>The end result of all this is an at times spectacular, at times confusing, at times entertaining, but always action packed mishmash adventure that screams for a better story. --- 5/10<br/><br/>Rated PG-13 for violence and intense action"
"Jsup009","4","4","9","26 May 2007"," Hopefully the last 'Pirates' movie
","'At Worlds End' is what happens when movie makers know they are going to make big $$$ on their film no matter what they do. In short, they made a plondering mess whose only bright spot is its occasional humor and not selling out to a traditional fairy tale ending. From the start, there's the ridiculous attempt at making a political statement in the opening scenes where the pirates and their allies are being hanged. See, they may be murderous, thieving, bloodthirsty people but they had their civil liberties taken away so now they're the good guys. This was the writers attempt to justify why exactly were supposed to NOT want the world to be rid of pirates, but it just came off as lame. Later in the film, Elizabeth attempts a 'William Wallace' like speech to rally the pirates to fight for their freedom which was equally if not more so lame. Then there's Barbossa, who was a fantastic villain in the first movie; now, he's not such a bad guy after all and in fact seems to become everyones pal. What a waste of a great character (he has the best line in the movie however, when Elizabeth and Will want to get married). The entire Calypso plot line was boring; it just seemed made up for this movie to give our heroes a convenient way to beat Davey Jones, though they try to sell it as if it had been mentioned before in the previous films. I didn't buy it, but I'll admit a 50 foot tall woman who turns into crabs does make me shudder.<br/><br/>The film is not without merit; there are some genuinely funny moments (the monkey pretty much steals them all)and the acting is adequate. Much has been made of Keith Richards cameo role as Jacks father, when I saw it you could hear people drawing their breathe when he was about to appear (its telegraphed the whole way) but it was an underwhelming moment at best. If you're like me and had forgotten just how ugly Keith Richards actually is, then you'll be immediately reminded. I enjoyed the big ending battle for the most part, though it does get rather unbelievable even for a movie. It was also unbelievable that Lord whathisname went down without firing a shot. I give it 4 stars, and I feel that's being charitable. Of course, the kids and the die-hard fans will love it, and that's who the movie is really for and they'll ensure it makes a gazillion dollars and gets big votes here on IMDb. However, anyone objectively viewing this film will know better. Lets hope they resist the urge to make another sequel."

Aside from the stunning visual effects (what movie doesn't have that) this movie is absolutely atrocious. There are few movies I dislike more than this. <br/><br/>POTC=Great POTC2=Okay POTC3=Pathetic<br/><br/>Having to write 10 lines for the review is probably what the writer's felt like when they were told to write a 3rd movie.

Can Will rescue his dad Bootstrap Bill from Davy Jones and consummate his relationship with Elizabeth? Will Jack lose the Black Pearl to Barbosa yet again? All this and more await you! <br/><br/>""Curse of the Black Pearl"" is still the best of these films, but this is still a more entertaining venture than ""Dead Man's Chest"", an able adventure marred by over-length and too many subplots and an attempt to ""epic"" that went against the series' winking at the audience style sense of humor.

","I felt the original Pirates of the Caribbean was the best in the series and after being mildly unimpressed with the second installment, I was actual impressed by the surprising consistency of the third Pirates movie.<br/><br/>The movie is Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp). Without Johnny this franchise wouldn't have any legs to stand on and in this movie, similar to the previous two, Depp carries the torch across the finish line. The movie is bigger and larger. It has a longer running time, there's more action, more plot and more battles.<br/><br/>The gang travels to Asia and then to the End of the World to rescue Jack Sparrow from the afterlife. There were some avant-garde and experimental scenes in the afterlife which was unlike a summer blockbuster to contain (Think of the scene in ""Being John Malkovich"" where every character is John Malkovich.)<br/><br/>I felt the screen writing was more witty and flowed more effortlessly than in the second installment. And even though the ending was not what I was expecting, I was certainly surprised with it, and with that it gained my respect.<br/><br/>the only thing I didn't enjoy was how it opened it up for a fourth movie. However despite its length and the superfluous monologues from Keira Knightley...did we really need to give her that many speeches, this is a good movie. Not as good as the original but the second best in the series.<br/><br/>7 out of 10, good summer blockbuster fun."

Mind, it is still Johnny Depp's show. Spectacular visuals compliment the good acting all around, but when Jack Sparrow is on the screen, you know who is powering the movie. And it just leaves enough unsaid and undone for us to expect Pirates 4.<br/><br/>A MUST watch.

","Now, when most people think ""Pirate"" they think high adventure and Romance. Yes, this pirate movie, the best of three, does have those, so breathe easy. BUT, it includes so much more. Subtle plot twists, intertwining character stories, and the like. In fact, this movie actually has more plot development and character interaction than it does action sequences, which don't disappoint. The movie takes a turn by adding in surrealism, using Jack Sparrow and his world-famous Jackanisms en masse to add another dimension and edge to the way the plot develops, and also are used to show another side of his nature as a character. The acting, particularly on the part of Bill Nighy as Davy Jones, is impeccable, and finally, the minor characters who everyone loves get their moments to shine."

I thought that Chow Yun Fat was under-used (even 'mis'used) in his role. However, once that Council Meeting of the Pirates got underway, I got the Pirates movie I was waiting very eagerly for!<br/><br/>The last 2/3's contained the swashbuckling action, drama, comedy and romance of the high level we have come to expect from this franchise. Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley look good together and do very well in their action scenes, as well as their ""wedding"" scene. There was no scene here that was as distinctive as the ""Fighting on the Rolling Wheel"" scene in Pirates 2, but there were several well-choreographed fight scenes here as well.<br/><br/>I was not too happy with the Calypso scenes, nor how that was resolved. They way it was built up, I was expecting a bigger revenge disaster, than the rain and whirlpool we got."

As a child pirates were exciting figures of romance and adventure, in this film we have people who look like pirates spouting inane expositional dialogue for nearly three hours. The jokes are overwrought and clumsy, continuously relying on the 'oh so hilarious' pause followed by one of the 'funny' characters piping up with a 'random' comment - the hilarity of it. The funniest moment of my movie-going experience was listening to all the expletives leaving people's mouths as they trudged out of the cinema, bored stupid.<br/><br/>It's sad because i really enjoy fantasy films when they're done properly.

","When I say best of the 3, I mean best of the trilogy AND best of this summer's 'amazing' trilogy finales. POTC 3 beats the competition into the ground with the heavy, damp floorboards of the Black Pearl. Try as I might I can't find a flaw with this film (except maybe the continuity in a few...hundred places). While some scenes like where Jack is stuck in the locker, can drive you mad, they drive you mad in a good way - kinda like a sugary brain freeze. Parts in the film may leave you thinking 'why did the writers do that!?' but i found that in the end those deaths (giveaway) were a necessary sacrifice for a good time.<br/><br/>Once again though your not going to get the same heart you got from 'The Curse' but it's not soulless. 'World's End' brings a whole new soul carved sheerly by the character's emotions ; the (very funny) jokes and the EPIC battle scenes.<br/><br/>All the loose ends are tied here and many ends you didn't know were untied are tied...up. Basically lots of bits you didn't know were important, are, so I suggest you watch the first 2 beforehand (if you have them) and see if you can guess any things that will be important.<br/><br/>Anyway to tie up the loose end that is this review, I'm gonna tell you to watch Pirates 3 because it will leave you with a merry, clawy-cutesy-sharp-edged-WOW-kitteny feeling.

","It was incredible! The best one out of all of them! I mean, ""COTBP"" was amazing, and ""DMC"" was alright but ""AWE"" was just downright awe-inspiring, breath-taking wow worthy! I saw it tonight, the 8:00 performance actually and I was on the edge of my seat the entire time! The only times I settled back were when I was scratching my head saying 'What the hell is going on here?' but other than that I was clutching my fiancée's hand like a mad-woman and surprised myself by crying; not once, but twice! I cried once when Governor Swann had his last conversation with Elizabeth and the second time was at the end, and I was sobbing. My entire body was racked with sobs and it was hard to breathe (I did breathe, but it took some effort). I was SO overcome by the emotional 'death' of Will Turner... so, those rumours way back when were sorta right. He 'died' but he became the captain of the 'Flying Dutchman' so he wasn't really dead at all! And yes it's tragic that he can only see Elizabeth once every 10 years for a day but he's right... it all depends on what you do with that day, and they made their day very memorable.... *cries* ...I'm getting all emotional thinking about it.... and if what I've read is true, because Elizabeth stayed faithful it is possible that Will can come back on land again- but we won't know for sure until the DVD or the 4th installment.<br/><br/>With the whole nonsense of 'Sparrowbeth' the whole 'love story' between Jack and Elizabeth is non-existent. Will thinks it is there, but Elizabeth basically says that her only reason for killing Jack (and kissing him) was to save all their lives (like I figured from the very end of movie 2). There is some question though because she is very glad to see him when they come upon him at worlds end and she indicates to Will that everything would be fine once Jack was found. Will, being the stupid git that he is thinks that its because she loves Jack- but its really about her guilt over forcing him to Davy Jones Locker in the first place.<br/><br/>As for the rest of the movie- it was one large chess match with Jack as the grand-master of it all. He puts all the pieces in line (like movie 1) and then, when he has his goal within his hands he has to do the right thing, and he does! The entirety of the movie brought the series full circle with little nuances here and there- like the two Englishmen guarding the boat in the first movie guarding Davy Jones' heart, Norrington's sword being the sword that was used to 'kill' Will and of course, Jack leaving the movie in a dingy, just like he came into it...<br/><br/>....as for the ending, well it was tragic (what with Will being the captain of the Flying Dutchman and all) but I found it romantically beautiful at the same time. Even though my tears. The love that Will and Elizabeth share is strong enough to endure though 10 years of separation. And with the door open for a fourth installment (what with Jack going looking for the fountain of youth, which is described as a grail of some sort) there is the possibility that Will and Elizabeth (and their son) can be together for all eternity. That in my mind would be the perfect ending to a perfect series....<br/><br/>*looks up at the post* Yeah, I know what ya'll thinking, I'm a sap... and a hopeless romantic, and I am totally in love with the whole pirates trilogy with number three being my most favourite. I say, any movie that can make me laugh, cry and laugh some more through the tears, and keep me on the edge of my seat the entire time is a totally perfectly well done movie.....<br/><br/>*sigh* ....and I want there to be a fourth installment SO badly! It can be called; Pirates of the Caribbean 4; Eternal Life or something like that....<br/><br/>So, in conclusion; Pirates 3; At World End was by far, the best of the trilogy and I raise my glass to all the wonderful men and women who worked on/acted in the movie and I hope that everyone else loved it as well...."

","WARNING: SPOILERS RIGHT AHEAD!<br/><br/>A Disney-movie starting with a mass hanging --- I never thought I'd live to see that! Quite a dramatic way to impress on the audience how evil that EITC is, it might turn out as a bit of a shock for younger viewers. Anyway, I don't mind. I've had my share of screeching and questioning kids during the first movie (PG-rated), I'd be glad if they'd been scared off by the second one<br/><br/>Actually, there's precious little that encourages my notorious nit-picking (I won't go at lengths on what already has been posted under the heading of goofs --- most of it sounds quite reasonable) and I have to disagree completely with all previous opinions that describe this lovely sum of a concept as too long, too bad or too boring. ""At World's End"" may be overzealous at times (in tradition to its predecessors), but nonetheless, Ted and Terry manage to knit a nice, colourful fabric made of lots of loose ends, various threads, rags and tattered stuff of all kinds. My deepest respect, I've never ever been good at needlework.<br/><br/>And the garment fits very nicely!<br/><br/>Its quite comfortable: Three hours have never felt so short before, in fact, it's skin tight. A loose-fitting 200-minutes-feature would have suited me even better The only people who consider this film as being too long either seem to have mistaken the movie for another brainless all-action-feature, neglected to go for a pee before, drank too much while watching or should better consult a physician of their choice. Over here the movie is being served including a comfortable break for the weak of bladder.<br/><br/>It feels good: Though it wouldn't have to be action-packed like that I don't really mind. Acting hardly falls short, but I must admit I'd like to have seen more of Sao Feng and his intriguing relationship with (Captain!) Jack Sparrow And though Norrington makes a heroic last stand I'd rather have preferred him to survive for good acting. Same goes for Beckett (really great in ""The Libertine"" for instance). I mean, it's still me suit, but the adornments come off so easily Yet it looks rather fine still For the hugest ornament remains. Johnny Depp is just incredible (there's the ""Arizona Dream""-chicken again! I love this kind of quotes), as usual, a pattern of slightly anarchistic design, fitting anyone with a thought of his own.<br/><br/>And I suppose the thin parts and holes are just there to serve as a kind of ventilation...<br/><br/>Keith Richards turns out to be as a somewhat less than stunning actor (I suppose nobody expected some kind of miracle), but he does not fail to deliver his message. The hilarious ""How's mum?""-scene is probably going to become one of the top-100-most-memorable-scenes in movie history Well, I'd vote for that!<br/><br/>And as for Will and Lizzy, I think that's the most graceful and suitable fate for repeated treachery Congratulations to Ted and Terry, that's storytelling at its best! I love your brains, boys!<br/><br/>To the point: Neither as light and surprising (well, that's no surprise) as the first part nor as gloomy or OTT as the second but rather a delightful mix in between, recommended to everyone who happened to like either one.<br/><br/>Is this the end? Probably not. My head likes it as it seems to be, but my heart wants more I guess, other people's heads and hearts work quite alike. There are still some stories to tell<br/><br/>For the lovers of speculations: Will Barbossa's crew still follow him after detecting the ""gaping hole"" in his plans? Yeah, give it a thought I'm quite sure most of you'd like to see Barbossa marooned on a deserted island, probably even to be rescued (or not) by Jack <br/><br/>SPOILERS AND SPECULATIONS OFF<br/><br/>Now to my dear fellow readers and writers:<br/><br/>To you who detested the movie: Well, I'd never pay a fiver just that I can say how badly spent it was, would I? Why did you go to see it if you had been biased right from the start? If you cherish ruining other people's days, don't post, please. Go kick a dog instead. Preferably a big, fangy one.<br/><br/>And you who detected plot-holes a mile wide: Would you please care to describe exactly what you mean? I think most of the pieces fall into place rather accurately. But probably you just missed to watch PotC II last year<br/><br/>And finally to all of you who detected sort of anti-globalization antics (EITC = WTO?) in this movie, I reluctantly agree (I'd rather not indulge in it for I have to live here during the G8 meeting!). Intentional or not, there is something<br/><br/>And it's not just good business, is it?<br/><br/>Hoist the Colours!<br/><br/>9/10 --- 20/10 for Johnny Depp. As before"

","Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End is a film that was made to be seen in a theater. Big sound big images, big action, and larger than life characters.<br/><br/>This film picks up where Dead Man's Chest left off, with the Crew of the Black Pearl looking to find Captain Jack Sparrow(Depp), and return him to the land of the living, from Davey Jones Locker. The story is convoluted, and a bit confusing. Some of the performances are wooden (Bloom), but this film is much more than just the sum of its parts. It features some of the most stunning visual effects I have ever seen. It blends comedy with action, and it succeeds in bringing to a close the events of all three films.<br/><br/>This movie is purely about entertainment, outside of perhaps costume and effects, it is not going to be a ""darling of the Academy"". Outside of Depp and Rush, few of the performances are that memorable, but the overall effectiveness of this movie lies in its ability to keep you transfixed on the screen even when you are not entirely sure what is going on. The film makers drew the story to a conclusion that left me satisfied despite the fact that it was not the ending I had hopped for, or expected, perhaps this added to the film for me in the end, as it is always nice to be surprised."

","""Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End"" Released: May 24, 2007 Viewed: May 28, 2007<br/><br/>*** Good <br/><br/>This is the first time I have seen any of the highly successful POC fantasy/adventure films.

","This movie was great! I went to see it with several of my friends and we all had a great time. Captain Jack had us laughing all through the ride and the effects were absolutely amazing. The supporting roles were all cast brilliantly and added flavor to the movie. The locations and set pieces were like real and were mind blowing. Yes, the plot was overloaded and a little hard to follow, but I still left the theater with a satisfied feeling. As for some people who said the movie was long, I thought it went by pretty quickly even though there were a few parts that dragged a little bit. The final battle in the whirlpool can be argued as the one of the best ever in cinema history, and the story does a nice job of closing the movie out, but seems to leave things open for another movie. All in all, it was a pleasure to watch this movie in theaters."
"jluis1984","6","3","6","28 May 2007"," A fitting finale...
","When in 2002 rumors began to be spread about a movie based on Disneyland's classic dark ride, ""Pirates of the Caribbean"", nobody expected that any good would come out of it. However, ""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl"" was released and against all odds became a success that surpassed all the expectations. The movie, a tale of fantasy, romance and swashbuckling adventures that chronicled the escapades of a group of 18th Century pirates, earned both critical and commercial praise due to its fresh take on the genre. Due to its success, two back-to-back sequels were announced, both with the same cast and crew of the first film. The first of those sequels was ""Dead Man's Chest"", a film that while certainly lacked a lot of the original's power, started a new and interesting story arc that has its grand finale in ""At World's End"".<br/><br/>""Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End"" continues where the second part ended: with Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) making an uneasy alliance with former foe Captain Hector Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) in order to find a way to bring Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) back from ""Davy Jones' Locker"" the supernatural purgatory for those indentured to Davy Jones (Bill Nighy). The urgency of their mission comes from the fact that Lord Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander) of the East India Trading Company, has begun to purge pirates from the sea, organizing massive executions in an attempt to control worldwide sea trade. To face Beckett, the nine pirate lords must make up the Brethren Court, but since Sparrow, pirate lord of the Caribbean, was unable to appoint a successor, our friends must bring him back before its too late.<br/><br/>Once again, the film was written by Ted Elliot and Terry Rossio, who continue the story arc that began in the previous film with an extremely detailed script that gives closure to many of the plots that were started by the previous two films. To do this, the writers employ a series of convoluted twists and turns that further explore the now complicated relationships between our heroes, who not only must survive Beckett's attacks, but also the consequences of their own choices and betrayals. Unlike the second film, this film is more focused on the characters than on the action scenes, in an obvious attempt to add more character development this time; however, this doesn't mean that the movie lacks in the action department, as there is plenty of it through the film. Of course, the movie keeps good doses of that special touch of humor that has given the franchise a lot of its charm.<br/><br/>As in the previous two installments, director Gore Verbinski takes the helm again and brings this adventure come to life in a very visually appealing way. With an extreme care for details and a great eye for visual compositions, Verbinski creates a sequel that manages to overcome the disappointment of the previous film, returns the story to its roots and concludes the series on a high note. Keeping a good pace despite the long runtime, Verbinski adequately handles the dialog based scenes and the action sequences in a well balanced way (with much better results than in Part 2) that even his extensive use of the remarkable special effects doesn't come off as over the top. It is clear in this film that while a mostly visual director, Verbinski knows a thing or two about film history, as at times he manages to capture the feeling of those classics about pirates with Errol Flynn or Charles Laughton in the main roles.<br/><br/>By now it is more than clear that Johnny Depp's character, Captain Jack Sparrow, is the driving force of the film. Once again Depp becomes the quirky yet charming pirate with great ease and talent, delivering a terrific comedic performance that still remains fun after all those years. Orlando Bloom isn't that lucky, as while he has improved as an actor, the writers have left his character in a third position after Keira Knightley, who in this chapter gets a lot of screen time and carries a considerable part of the film alone. This would be good if it wasn't for the fact that Knightley isn't as accomplished as an actress as those around her, as not only Depp manages to overshadow her, but the combined presences of Geoffrey Rush, Bill Nighy and Yun-Fat Chow prove to be too much a challenge for her. Among the cast Rush is a real joy to watch, as he steals every scene he is in.<br/><br/>Sadly, despite the many improvements that ""Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End"" has over its predecessor, it is also plagued by some of the flaws that brought down ""Dead Man's Chest"". It's main flaw is probably the enormous dependence the film has on the charm that the character of Jack Sparrow has over the audience. The writers know that Sparrow is a fan favorite, so they put a lot of the film over his shoulders, which results in many great scenes with him, but also in the belittling of the rest of the characters. The convoluted plot will definitely turn some off, but I think that the complex storyline added a lot of much needed character development to the film, specially as it allowed some characters a small chance to shine. Finally, I will only add that the script gets corny and silly at times, but not too much to be a real bother.<br/><br/>While not exactly a great artistic accomplishment, ""At World's End"" is a roller-coaster of fun that despite its long runtime never fails to be entertaining. It is unknown what is ahead for the successful ""Pirates"" franchise, but one thing is clear for me: the story arc that began in ""The Curse of the Black Pearl"" has a most satisfying finale in ""At World's End"". Fans of this series will be pleased. 8/10"

I've never left a cinema before the end of a film before, let alone before its even half way through.<br/><br/>The humour isn't as funny as the first and there is just no plot whatsoever.

","For those of you who loved Pirates 1 and 2, the third instalment will NOT disappoint.<br/><br/>I saw the film on the UK release night and thought it was fantastic from the moment it began to the moment it finished. The special effects, choreography, costume and music were, as with all the three films, stunning and make the film ever so believable.<br/><br/>I am so happy that the third instalment remained visually consistent with the first two, which is undeniably due to Gore Verbinski's astounding directorial skills, and also due to the crew and actors. Johnny Depp is as witty and clever as ever, while Kiera Knightly, Orlando Bloom, Bill Nighy and Geoffrey Rush support each other in a winning combination! Newcomer, Naomi Harris is a credit to Britains pool of new talent! I agree that the ending is a little less 'Disney' than expected, but can we really expect everything to be sweet and happy? The ending as it is, is fun and although it doesn't bring complete closure to the lives of all the characters, the short sequence after the end credits does allow the audience some sort of 'peace of mind'. So make sure you stay until the credits have ended for this little snippet! The film is astonishing, and worth waiting a year since 'Dead Mans Chest'. I assure anyone who reads this, it is worth the money to go see this film, they wont be disappointed!!"

","I read a few negative reviews of POTC: AWE before catching a POTC Marathon.A good refresher.At first viewing, I still thought POTC 3 was a bit confusing, slow in parts and too fast in others. But then, the ending did it for me and even more, that bittersweet post-credits ""10 years later"" bit. I went back and watched the movie all over again. And everything then made sense and tied up matters convincingly (But with still some openings for a POTC 4). It's worth several viewings because only then does it allow you to catch nuances and better understand what the director/producer are saying. AWE does grow on you. I am haven't recovered from what I think is a sad ending.Imagine just living in the hope of seeing one's beloved once every 10 years! At the most, it would be only 6-7 times in one's lifetime. One will grow old and die. What life does the forever undead sailing the seas have after that? What can he come back to for 1 day? The writers put in interesting touches ie the sword forged by Will given to Govn Swann in POTC 1 is the one that ends up with him (in him); the word ""Suspended"" at the hangings; the word ""Leverage"" used in all 3 movies. The music is stirring and memorable, weaving ""Hoist the Colours"" throughout.I wasn't a POTC fan. I just went to see the movies. But I am now, and will support the movies. So far, I've seen AWE 6 times. (The 1st 4 times on the same day). It's the fastest 168 mins for a film."

","I was so so hoping that this would be the finale to really recapture the fans after an average sequel but alas it was not. It echos the saying of the original is always the best in so many ways.<br/><br/>I am not going to jump on the bandwagon and say this film is awful as it was not but i felt the film had an appearance that it had been rushed. I saw more of Barbossa than Jack and everyone knows that Jack Sparrow makes the whole film come alive.<br/><br/>I am not going to contain any plot information but i felt the ending left a gap, the more entertaining characters we hardly used and I hardly saw Orlando Bloom in the film. The plus sides are there, the monkey was hilarious, some of the island views/battle scenes were amazing and i would watch the film again.<br/><br/>Its a film you have to watch if you are a fan of the series, if you are not you must watch the 1st two films then this one as it will get confusing.

"bobbyfletch85","2","3","6","26 May 2007"," Sunk without a trace!
","Where to start really... A lengthy tribute would contradict my score so I'll be as brief as I can.<br/><br/>POTC3 is an absolute wash out. It is a ridiculously plot heavy piece, with hours of build up to strands that are never paid off. The characters are horrendously developed, indeed Will Turner is totally redundant. Kiera Knightly produces a dreadful performance in a role that includes several vomit-inducing incidents desperately trying to protest against the 'mans' world. This includes her being named King of Pirates, having more guns than everyone else, giving a corny motivation speech worse than Morpheous in Matrix 2 and generally trying to look hard. She might as well as just got her bra out and burned it.<br/><br/>As for Depp, well... even his most hardcore fans will be sick to the sight of him by the end. His self-indulgent screen hogging and boring nonsense fail to entertain like he just about managed to in POTC1.<br/><br/>At least 45 minutes of this film could have been cut for being pointless plot that goes absolutely nowhere (see Chow yun fat and the whole calypso thing).<br/><br/>However, I'm sure the mindless twits who like this drivel will forgive the mind-numbingly unsatisfying story (nearly 3 hours!) and gloat about the CGI, which to be frank is exceptional. But if George Lucas has taught us anything, it's that CGI means bugger all without a strong narrative.<br/><br/>I'm amazed no one failed to see the issues with this film further up the ladder, so to take it to the cutting room and rescue it from being a complete let down. Even Keith Richards was an immense anti-climax - which I believe summed up the essence of the film. Plenty of stars but no quality.<br/><br/>The film suggests a fourth instalment but genuinely, I think they may struggle to finance it. People will be fed up with this pathetic end to the trilogy which should have ended after POTC1 - a swashbuckling enjoyable flick. Instead, they decided to weave a labyrinth of plot (to please critics who claimed the previous films were simple), a script filled with cliché rhetoric and endless scenes with little direction or drama. In the cast, the film has an embarrassment of riches but they're not worth their weight in dung let alone gold after their performances - be it the scripts fault or their own.<br/><br/>Take my advice and hoist anchor - this is fool's gold."

"johnnyboyz","4","3","6","25 May 2007"," A Disgrace not only to the genre of action/adventure but to film as a whole - time for the masses to actually watch some 'real' films.
","Despite not liking the first film and not even seeing the second, I thought I'd try and at least give the latest Pirates of the Caribbean film a chance; even if the odds were stacked against it. As it turned out  try as I might; it would've taken an effort that goes beyond the description of 'mammoth' for me to actually like this film  cinema viewing or no cinema viewing.<br/><br/>Pirates of the Caribbean 3 is an absolute mess; it's an abomination and an insult to film as a whole. It manages to give the term 'summer blockbuster' a bad name which is, in truth, a new filmic low. The film is loud, over the top, messy, far too 'twisty and turny' and drags on and on and on to the point where you just don't care any more  you literally stop caring as to what's going to happen and this is a shame as the visually spectacular final fight scene is wasted  you can't have a fantastic sandwich if the bread is great but the filling is two weeks out of date.<br/><br/>In Pirates of the Caribbean, (or Pirates 3 as it's also known) we are 'treated' to scenes in which the characters talk about absolutely nothing, people betray and backstab others before forgiving them and making up without so much as an eyebrow flinch and the actual structure of the film for the first two hours at least consists of: 1. Scenes involving Swann (Knightly) and Turner (Bloom) and their romance that seems like it will never happen given their missions in the film; 2. Jack Sparrow's (Depp) seemingly unreal foray into some sort of purgatory in which he acts like he's in a dream state and sees things that are psychically impossible. And, 3; the scenes chopping back to the un-dead sailors that are headed by Davy Jones (Nighy) and their uneasy truce with the British soldiers. First of all, two hours of this formula: '1,2,3; 1,2,3; 1,2,3' tests you  it really, really tests you. It tests your interest, your patience, you ability to even care and very quickly, I found myself completely detached to what was going on.<br/><br/>Second, if all those crabs that carried Sparrow's boat from the desert and into the sea were made to look like they were in his mind, how is it possible for the others stranded on the beach to see it happen? This is an example of Pirates 3 breaking reality and just using the impossible as an excuse to either fill up time, instigate action scenes or crack dumb jokes. Un-dead, fish-like sailors I can take but things like this make you laugh at the film.<br/><br/>This brings me onto the humour. No line of dialogue in this film made me laugh. Quite a few people around me in the cinema laughed but it really wasn't funny  I have to question whether it is me or them that has a problem. I like to think I have a sense of humour but this was really bottom of the barrel stuff. The only time I laughed was when a dwarf fires a musket, can't take the blowback and thus flies backwards. Some others laughed too, but what made me think afterwards was that we were all laughing at someone's disability and inability to do something  like laughing at a guy with really small arms trying to light a cigarette or something.<br/><br/>Other things I hated: Keith Richards' appearance which acted a blatant attempt at a pop-culture reference (I expect about 70% of people watching this film wont even know who he is), the fact the film plays out like a cartoon more than a film, the fact the film can't decide if it's going to include violence or cut away just as something happens, the way Calypso's subplot of being freed was even included (she's not the focus, we don't see enough of her to give a damn) or about the fact a wedding ceremony takes place at the most inconvenient of times.<br/><br/>If you like loud, overblown action sequences that have characters defy gravity  you'll absolutely love the end fight scene but I was just begging for it to end. One last thing: mid way through the film a character says to the other about Sparrow: 'Do you think he plans these things or makes it up as he goes along?' I was thinking the same thing about the screenwriter."

","I haven't seen the previous Pirates and I must say I was not convinced by this one. The visuals are great and stunning, so you're in for a good ride. Sadly this ride is too long for the story to hold up and there are too many characters running around. The first hour I got completely lost in the different bad and good guys and had real trouble focussing on the main story. All these different characters have a different history with one another, which is really difficult to get a feeling for without having seen the previous pictures.In the end, I didn't care who won or lost, I just wanted this movie to be over. As a spectacle it holds up pretty well, with stunning visuals and some good jokes. As a movie it's below par."

Ugly characters who you don't care about pontificate on matters that aren't real in ways that are entirely predictable to anyone who's seen more than a handful of Hollywood blockbusters. Scenes of dialogue drag on and on, occasionally interspersed with a brand of humour that was already overly familiar in the '50s. At least it's all quite good natured I suppose, with less of the mean streak that runs through many Hollywood products. The problem with this movie is that it is determined from the outset to be an EPIC in every way, like its predecessors. Hence everything is bloated, there's no subtlety, no nuances, no gentle wit, no human characters. Nothing matters in it, not even death. I am amazed the writers didn't die of boredom from plugging away at their unfathomable, choppy, leaden script that they were ordered to deliver. It is with weary inevitably that this by-numbers blockbuster will go on to make millions of pounds, perhaps even more than Spider-Man 3, a vastly superior, significantly individual and far fresher film. Pirates of the Caribbean isn't about movie making, it's about money making."

The acting was good, and you could tell they put a lot of work into the presentation. There was a lot of action, and the film was always moving. Even though all of that was good, they couldn't hide the fact that the story line was completely terrible and pointless. Johnny Depps comedic acting was the only thing holding this movie together. There were a few laughs, but the whole film was slow and boring. The film dragged on for what seemed like an eternity.

","This being the first Pirates movie I've seen as a whole, I have to say that my low expectations were smashed. I can only recall the the first 2 hours and 15 minutes or so being a bunch of pirates talking to each other, plotting, and cracking puns. <br/><br/>The last half hour or so of obligatory battling was interrupted by dry, cheesy humor and slapstick violence. I guess that's what people love about the Pirates movies, but I hated it. It didn't have any flow. I didn't take it seriously, or feel any kind of connection to any of the characters. The special effects were the only redeeming factor, as a lot of visuals were flat out stunning to the eye. <br/><br/>Elizabeth may be hot, but she just bounces around to any guy and starts making out, it seems like. She seems to be the obligatory girl, to throw in the obligatory love subplot.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen any Pirates movies, don't even bother starting here. It's flat out lame. You'll feel like walking out of the theater early if you have the same emotions run through you as I did."
"Flagrant-Baronessa","4","4","10","31 May 2007"," One of the most malignant cases of blockbuster sequilitis I've come across
","I suppose this is where I insert a few lines of witty pirate jargon and then proclaim this film the fast-paced, explosive, commercial masterpiece of Disney that we had all hoped for as an end to the Caribbean trilogy! I should also be pooping my pants over Johnny Depp's performance. For certain this is prime foddera fangasmfor Deppoholics all over the world and I'm happy the films have found their audience, but for the rest of us  how fun can this type of hubris-infested, over-the-top mess be?<br/><br/>The answer is  well, sporadically fun. As a strong suit the aesthetics are something else: a regal buffet of ships against dramatic landscapes, drenched in absolutely top CGI. There are some vaguely cool lines, and the opening to the film is actually pretty classy. Regrettably, the can of story lines-worms clumsily opened by Dead Man's Chest presents At World's End with a troublesome, chock-full legacy that is bursting at the seems with characters and ideas, all of which Gore Verbinski shuffles into story lines like a Las Vegas croupier. He is not always apt however, and often (read: all the time) five or more different story lines are operating in the same scene, which is simply disorienting.<br/><br/>The cumulative effect is that when four ships align to fight (The Pearl, the Flying Dutchman, The Armada, and Chow Yun Fat's vessel), you have no idea who is on them, why, where they are going, where their allegiances lay or what will happen. The latter is the only good unknown in this case. The bottom line is that the writers (and I use ""writers"" in the loosest sense possible, more like 4th grade sketchbook dribblers) are so overzealous with At World's End that in the end you are so desensitized to action- and story elements that nothing keeps your attention. So basically it's a lot like Dead Man's Chest except longer, bigger, and more chaotically organized  for 3 butt-numbing hours!<br/><br/>It saddens me, lastly, what a commercial cash cow Johnny Depp has become in POTC. Every frame is milked its worth of Sparrow ""goodies"" (I've never found him funny, but I understand most viewers do). Not only does he occupy an unrealistically hefty slot of screen time, but his hallucinations following banishment has spawned mini-Jacks running around, often 10-15 at a time, all cracking one-liners and chewing scenery. Part of Sparrow's charm was his unique persona and consequently ability to stand out in a crowd, and with a screen that is awash with his clones, this feature severely wanes.<br/><br/>4 / 10"
"MartianOctocretr5","7","3","7","5 June 2007"," Get some rum and popcorn and enjoy the voyage
","The Pirates are back to resolve plot lines that were deliberately left hanging in Dead Man's Chest. Some of the resolutions are better than others, and the film has rigorous action sequences making it a good ride, but sometimes the numerous sub plots can be overwhelming. For example, you'll need to keep a scorecard on how many dead characters have been resurrected from the beyond, as well as to keep track of the endless alliance realignments and double crosses.<br/><br/>Since sword duels and buried treasure motifs become redundant and routine, the dimensions of the story expand to include metaphysical creatures with their own agendas and sub plots. However, some are not utilized to their potential, such as Davy Jones's crew and the Kraken.<br/><br/>All the major characters of the previous two films return, and their entanglements drive the plot pretty well. However, few of them grow or change much in this movie; what you've already seen them do in the past is what you get this time around. The movie tries to do too much in places, leaving some of it loosely constructed. The final battle engagement throws a lot of stuff at you all at once, some of which will seem sublimely ridiculous, yet at the same time mixed with some violent imagery. Some clever sight gags are sprinkled throughout the movie and usually get the laughs.<br/><br/>Although nobody says, ""Luke, I am your father,"" the story opens a few new plot issues to explore should Captain Sparrow and the others return to once again plunder the Caribbean in any future movies. In the meantime, this one is good popcorn entertainment."

","The first ""Pirates"" movie was truly great. Fresh and original with smart dialog and an impressive cast. The third, and to a lesser extent the second, are merely parodies of the first, milking as much as possible from the success of the first in terms of box office bonanza. This third entry is a mishmash of plots and subplots. The characters, so well-defined and charismatic in the first, are weakly written caricatures of themselves. Obviously, hundreds of millions of dollars were spent on special effects, costumes, sets and talent. I am sure the script was not inexpensive. However, the dialog is wanting and the desire to inject twists and turns in the (many) plots makes it tiring, if not difficult to follow. The much-anticipated appearance of Keith Richards falls flat. I get the feeling that several people had ideas for scenes that were thrown together into one, final script. I truly could not wait for it to end. A major disappointment to me, but obviously a huge commercial success. Based on the box office success, there will be a fourth installment. Wait for the DVD. At least you can pause it once in a while and get up and stretch."

","I have to say right off the bat that this is the best of the Pirates trilogy. The first half hour is a little odd and unclear, but when Johnny Depp arrives on the big screen, he once again is the witty Captain Jack Sparrow. Johnny Depp once again lights up the show with his charm, but also with a more serious and unusual split personalities.<br/><br/>The rest of cast was outstanding! A new darker light is shined upon them, from despicable villains such as the heartless Davy Jones (Bill Nighy) to the overachieving and irritating Lord Becket (Tom Hollander). Orlando Bloom as Will Turner is no longer an ""all good boy"" like the previous films, but more deceptive and cunning, and Keira Knightley as the flamboyant Elizabeth Swann makes herself stand out from being a typical damsel in distress to a heroic pirate leader. The appearance of Keith Richards, Chow Yun-Fat, and many other faces were also grand.<br/><br/>The near three hour film flew by rather like a two hour film, with more intense action sequences, supported with some of the most unique and best CGI effects I have ever seen. Along with this, the film holds a good plot, revealing many secrets, a few twists, and ties many of the plot holes that the second film left off. But the very ending is left as a cliffhanger, leaving room for another pirate film.<br/><br/>And if you thought the second pirate film was not so ""sugarcoated"", well this one doesn't have much sugar to it. There is a substantial amount of good humor, but the film is darker with a more mysterious plot and powerful score by the ultimate Hans Zimmer. There are no complaints I can give this film.<br/><br/>This is the first 10/10 I have given this year! Don't wait! See it!"
"iKramerica-1","5","3","7","1 June 2007"," Which movie were you watching?
","I can't understand how people are giving this thing 9-10 stars. I liked the first, loved the second, and just didn't enjoy this one at all. It was well made, but not well written nor well acted. The only two good performances were Sparrow and Barbosa. Johnny Depp was still great, and his character was the only bright point in this film. Jeffrey Rush was great too, though his character was lame.<br/><br/>I saw it today, the theater didn't have a ton of people (maybe 20), and I saw three people leave. 1 left after about 30 minutes, then a couple left at about 1/2 way. I considered leaving many times. I was just so bored by it, that I felt my time could have been better spent elsewhere. But I stayed, since I wanted to see more of Jack Sparrow. But I guess Depp's contract limited his days out of days or something, because there were whole 30-40 minute stretches where he wasn't there. And those were BORING stretches!<br/><br/>Why? Because who cares about the characters? Who were we supposed to root for? It got so muddled by the middle, we had no rooting interest. Nothing new was introduced in this movie, either. For better or worse, the second movie added a lot of new ideas and characters. And it expanded on relationships. This one didn't, nor did it remind us of who the characters were. Having not seen any pirates film for 2 years, I forgot why I was supposed to like Elizabeth Swan other than she was hot. Because he character in this third movie sure wasn't sympathetic.<br/><br/>I should have known this movie was in trouble from the opening scene. A thinly veiled indictment of the patriot act, but of course exaggerated and historically inaccurate to the time. Oh, and hanging a 10 year old kid during this soapboxing? Cheap. No matter what your political views, what was that doing in this movie? <br/><br/>Then a lot of boring stuff happens, a lot of double crossing and false alliances a la Survivor and just as contrived, by the end, you are supposed to be rooting for all the pirates for some reason. Yep, ALL the pirates (except Davy Jones). <br/><br/>Pirates, in case people don't know, were blood thirsty thieves who killed and raped, and who actively chose their profession (unless they were shanghaied, but those were not put in fighting positions unless they ""converted""). It's okay to find a few who are ""comic"" or ""a different breed"" but we were supposed to root for ALL the criminals in this film because a renegade admiral was trying to outlaw piracy. oooo, what a bad man, trying to outlaw piracy, which was a scourge on honest people around the world. he must be stopped...<br/><br/>But even if you buy that the ""bad guy British"" were bad, this is only the leadership, right? The sailors on those ships being sliced in two and shot in the face? just conscripted (drafted) citizens from england following orders to fight bloodthirsty pirates!<br/><br/>Yes, this movie tries to say that we should root for ALL pirates against the British. The pirates represent FREEDOM all of a sudden (a theme mentioned directly more than once in the film). Give me a break.<br/><br/>And yet, during the whole film, we were not actually presented with any compelling reason to support the pirates. They were thugs, murderers and rapists before this movie starts and in this movie! We meet new pirates from Asia who are thugs and rapists and have women in bondage. But we are supposed to root for them in the end...<br/><br/>The first two movies had a few ""good"" pirates against a lot of BAD pirates and a couple of renegade military men. Fine, I can dig that.<br/><br/>But this time, no way. They changed the rules, and expected us to buy it.<br/><br/>Give us some real heroes worth rooting for next time. And there will be a next time, because the end of this film ends on a ""visual question mark"" just like before...<br/><br/>EDIT: funny how in one short year, my point can be proved so simply by real events. now that the world is confronted with the brazen acts of high seas pirates again on a grand scale, nobody could watch this film and not laugh at the premise that ALL pirates are the good guys, simply people wanting freedom, being oppressed by ""authority."" It was a false premise last summer, it's a false premise today."
"chimera-4","6","3","7","1 June 2007"," Two parts boring, One part good.
","The title says it all really. I felt the first two hours of Worlds End were actually pretty dull but then things pick up for the last hour and thats when I thought things started to get better. The movie itself has some neat ideas but it's also clear that the writers didn't really know how to wrap up some of the ideas introduced in Dead Man's Chest which is a real shame. For example when we first see Captain Jack he's in Davy Jones Locker (presumably he's delivered there by the Kraken) which is supposed to be some kind of hell but basically just looks like a big desert which conveniently has a big ship in the middle of it. This part felt really awkward and a bit contrived as do many parts in the movie. The directorial style feels different from the first two and I wonder if Gore Verbinskey didn't just let 2nd unit directors have a shot this time round.<br/><br/>There are only a few action set pieces, mainly the beginning and the end. The one at the start again felt contrived and was unnecessary and boring and only served to introduce us to Chow Yun Fats character who is basically just window dressing to the story and is mostly completely pointless. Characters don't feel right here either, they just don't feel like they did in the first 2 movies and in an effort to make the story a bit more exciting and unpredictable the characters are constantly shifting their allegiances for no good reason and sometimes with no good motivation either and that really got boring eventually.<br/><br/>The second major action piece is the naval battle at the end centred around a huge whirpool (you might have seen it in the trailers). This was pretty spectacular and exciting and was really well done.<br/><br/>Keith Richards is OK as Jacks Father with really cool costume and make-up, he makes for a really neat looking grizzled pirate although he took his role far too seriously and would have been better lightening up a bit.<br/><br/>FX in this movie are pretty much phenomenal across the board, you can really see where the money went with huge naval battles and inventive duels galore.<br/><br/>And then of course there's Johnny Depp as Jack Sparrow who is as good as ever despite his material not being that great in some places.<br/><br/>The movie in general is a lot darker than the first two and that seemed to have sucked some of the fun out of it for me although there are still some funny moments in the movie.<br/><br/>Overall Worlds End really isn't as good as 1 and 2 but despite its misgivings it is fairly fun in quite a few places and does wrap up well. It even leaves room for a Pirates 4 so you never know.<br/><br/>P.S. Since when could Davy Jones walk through walls? Another unessecary plot mechanic that insults the previously established mythology and serves no purpose whatsoever in terms of plot mechanics."
"jjmfilm","7","3","7","31 May 2007"," Not Great! But not Bad!
","Okay, I have to agree with most critics (SHUDDER AT THE THOUGHT) about the plot being too hard to follow. Okay, maybe not the plot but the ""Who's playing who and why?"". At times throughout the film my wife kept telling me, ""I don't get it"" in which I had to go into the company line ""They're pirates.""<br/><br/>The visuals were amazing and the action very well paced but as a finale it doesn't quite match The Return of The King as a finale of a trilogy but it is many times over better than The Matrix Revolutions.<br/><br/>The one thing I could have done without was the second MULITPLE JACK SPARROWS scene on the Flying Dutchman. The first time was funny because you knew he was going mad in Davey Jones locker but the one on the ship seemed to me that I could do without as well as the GOOD JACK/BAD JACK on his shoulders sequence.<br/><br/>So, go see the movie, it's good 3 hours of entertainment. Although it could have been 2 hours."
"funky_lass","8","3","7","31 May 2007"," The final scenes capture the old school feel of the first film finally!
","Like so many critics out there i feel that the writers/producers etc did make a ""mockery"" out of Captain Jack Sparrow. I feel that he was lacking the charm he had in the previous two, and went and destroyed his character in my opinion with his 'mini Jacks'. Sparrow is my favourite character but i was left cringing in my seat with embarrassment at the 'comedy' scene where the two mini jacks come out to talk to the real jack when he was sat on the ship looking at the chart, to emphasise my point the scene didn't even get any laughs if i recall correctly. Also lets not forget the embarrassment that was Tia Dalma, and how she rose to a thousand feet tall before 'exploding'. Shame really as the character had real potential. <br/><br/>But putting that to one side, i do believe that the film draws you in from the beginning all the way through to the end. Minus the plot line though, the film would have been a thousand times better if they had cut out all the Singapore and Pirates Lord scenes as they were somewhat confusing, thus meaning more screen time for the original pirate threesome which i felt was being lacked in. The special effects were stunning, absolutely stunning, also leaving me a little dizzy at times!! Amazing performances from the cast all round. I thought the final scene after the credits with Will and Elizabeth was good and a very well chosen place to put it, if a little emotional. It definitely made up for the 'boy band' ending. <br/><br/>Jack Sparrows ending was pure classic with him being without his precious Black Pearl, i presume after Barbossa intentionally left him behind. I feel that this recaptured his old character and of course the old charm of the first film which i thought was probably the highlight of the whole film. Writers please take note! Bigger is not always better and this was the case for this film!!!<br/><br/>There is a hint of a possible PotC 4 at the end, but i'd imagine it would exclude Will and Elizabeth as they're story line is pretty much done and dusted. Which is a shame really as all i ever wanted out of Dead Mans Chest and At Worlds End is to see Jack, Will, Elizabeth, Barbossa and the crew reunite (and of course betray each other), without all these extra characters which clutter the film. I do get a hint of my wish in this film though when right at the end they all attack Lord Beckett's ship. I think that's his name! <br/><br/>So overall despite the let downs of Sparrows character which is just one scene admittedly, and does redeem himself later on, i thought it was a very fitting finale and Pirates of the Caribbean does go out with a bang!"

After that,<br/><br/>I couldn't stop. I read, I devoured, I became a pirate.<br/><br/>THERAPIST: Then tell us when the crash came, Mark...<br/><br/>MARK: It was when I saw At World's End.<br/><br/>ALL (ad-lib agreement): Me, too. Arrrr, Aye, Lad, Me as well, etc.<br/><br/>THERAPIST: Please tell us your story, Mark...<br/><br/>MARK: The first movie blew me so completely away that I knew I would be disappointed by any others they could make. Number 2 made up for its' lack of focus by breaking new ground with special effects. Gore Verbinski is an evil genius, and I don't know of anyone who can come close in effects-related work. <br/><br/>However good the cast and crew of At World's End are, there's no more magic here. The vein has run out in this cave, boys; time to move on. Black Pearl was a huge hit mainly because it was so DIFFERENT. Capitalizing on more of the same ol' DIFFERENTNESS is a recipe for disaster, I don't care who you are. This is something Johnny Depp himself has always stuck to BEFORE, going effortlessly from one character to another in film after film. Here, he's stuck with caricaturing his own performance in Black Pearl, much the same way that Anthony Hopkins has done with Hannibal Lecter after Silence of the Lambs.<br/><br/>Walt Disney didn't believe in sequels, either, and his oft-used mantra of ""you can't top pigs with pigs"" should have been said by someone in at least one of the script meetings.<br/><br/>You've seen the movie by now. You know what the problem is. It looks like they shot a bunch of scenes, figuring they would fix any problems in ""Post"", and wrote a script later that tried to tie them all in together, in much the same way that the original Pirates of the Caribbean ride was designed: ""we've got this building, it's shaped like THIS, now we've got to fit this scene here, this scene here, etc."" The difference between these two is that, while Walt wouldn't let the ride open until it was perfect, this film apparently was rushed into production without a solid story...<br/><br/>CUT TO: Disney SUIT GUY with feet up on desk in office, on phone.<br/><br/>SUIT GUY: ""We're revamping Tom Sawyer's Island with Pirates!

Um, however, that script (or versions of it) was in the works for what? 10 years? I'm trying to remember from the special features on the Black Pearl DVD... At World's End comes off like a term paper written at 7:45 AM on the morning it's due.<br/><br/>Sorry, guys. I wanted to believe. I really did. I just can't. And you know why? Because I like using my imagination. Really. Just like you. Because of that, I don't need every single ounce of backstory you can cram in a story. I don't need to know what every character had for breakfast on Tuesday. I don't need to know every FREAKIN' thing about what made this character or that the way he or she is; it's not important to the main story, and you've thrown it in there just to aid the transitions from one scene to the next.<br/><br/>CUT TO: GEORGE LUCAS is sitting at his desk, playing with a JAR JAR DOLL.

A FUNNY pirate movie about a scary subject. Harry Potter, anyone? <br/><br/>My solution? Simple. Much as I love Capt. Sparrow and Cmmdr. Verbinsky, Black Pearl was the only movie they should have done together. The next in the series should have had a completely different cast & director. The one after that, another change. Better yet: Get Johnny D to play a completely different pirate rogue in EACH of them, something he'd probably have drooled at, if you'd have offered it to him that way. There's your added spark! <br/><br/>Hmmm...Brenda?

"Quinoa1984","6","3","7","30 May 2007"," a mixed bag of big clever epic tricks and plots convoluted
","At one point, after Captain Jack Sparrow has escaped from the ship of the Lord Beckett, one of the officers says about Sparrow ""Do you think he plans it all out, or just makes it up as he goes along?"" Much can be said about the bulk of (or maybe just all) of the third and possibly final installment of the Pirates of the Caribbean movies. The script, in actuality, wasn't finished before filming started, and it shows: the screenwriters, or Verbinski, or Bruckheimer or whomever it was, have here a picture where pretty much not one character of significant note doesn't have some sort of personal vendetta, or double-cross, or triple cross, or some kind of love interest that has to be existent only through massive circumstances of trouble and fate, or that they're just one-note argh pirates or corrupt British officers. At the same time, there are nuggets here that mark as being sublime and utterly riotously funny, and even mark as being some of the best scenes that the series has to offer. But there's so much to get through to get to the worthwhile bits that it's not worth it- not for the 11 bucks for a ticket anyway.<br/><br/>It will be a subjective thing of note on whether or not the movie will work based on the universe that the POTC movies rest in- which is when 'up is down', and the Pirates vs British dynamics. But it ends up being, for me anyway, having to find the scenes and moments that do work versus what doesn't, which are the weighty scenes of exposition (eg characters stand around explaining the plot, which maybe is part of the ironic twist from the filmmakers), set-up, re-set-up, and still MORE exposition during what should be the most intense sequences. Basically, we get introduced to Calypso- a much frightened myth of Pirate lore who once had a love, or maybe not totally a love per-say, and is locked away in someone's soul by Pirate mandate. There's also Captain Sao Feng (Chow Yun Fat, who actually doesn't show much here except for the excess grimacing and gestures proclaiming ""I'm a bad-ass Asian dude too good to stroke his beard), and his floggle of Singapore pirates. Then there's the whole committee of pirates. Then the dynamics of Barbosa vs Sparrow, Sparrow and Barbosa vs Davy Jones, Will Turner vs Davy Jones (to get to his father, who is 'part of the ship'). Then Elizabeth becomes a pirate captain and Calypso is released, and so on and so forth.<br/><br/>The idea of charting the course of action leading to war between the royal British fleet and the league of extraordinary pirates sounds interesting, but it doesn't come off that way. Even when the climax comes, there's still goofy and corny bits thrown in (and not of the good kind ala 'oh, a monkey shot out of a cannon, so rich'), including marriage during a big battle scene (not as bad as the monkey, but the kiss between Turner and Swann is a true Bruckheimer cringe moment). Now, this all being said, it isn't necessarily a completely worthless enterprise. Far from it, there is a chunk of the near three hour running time- say, 15 to 20 minutes- that are near perfect and actually unconventional without trying to go out of its way to mask its shallowness. Jack Sparrow, as played by the ever so versatile, crafty and wackily engaging Johnny Depp, is stuck in Davy Jones's locker when he first appears, and it's something that one might expect out of Jodorowsky as opposed to a huge summer blockbuster: multiple Sparrows going nutty, rocks turning into crabs, Sparrow trying to pull the ship, which starts to move on its own, all starting with a peanut. It's a sheer act of surrealistic bravura film-making, aside from Depp's comedic brilliance, and it's maybe my favorite single sequence from any of the Pirates movies (at least a contender with the best skeleton pirates from the first film). When Sparrow ends up seeing his fellow 'selves', at one point coming out of his ear, it's equally uproarious, if still a little shallow, and it leads up to the exceptional appearance of Keith Richards Sparrow's Pirate King father.<br/><br/>This, plus the usual allotment of visually eye-catching visual effects, albeit with not much new that wasn't seen character-wise in the second entry (and all the big energy in that department is saved for the big climax in the ocean, which goes on for almost half an hour more or less), do mark At Worlds End at containing the inspired craziness and exciting pleasures of the first film. But all the same, as it goes on and on, and on, you almost need a chart to count down who betrays who or who does what to the other; this would be all well and good if one could give a darn about the emotional stakes at hand, but it's a case of not a lot of 'there' being there, not assisted by (aside from Depp, Rush and sometimes Nighy) one-note performances and even wooden turns (Tom Hollander)."

Half way through I was bored stiff and waiting for it to finish.<br/><br/>There was no plot as such, like in the first and second movies. The storyline was a bit boring, drawn out and lacked substance. Considering it was so long anyway, this made it even more tiring.<br/><br/>The dialogue was poor - far too many cringe worthy and meaningless lines, and I found 80% of the ""jokes"" were so unfunny it was embarrassing.<br/><br/>Keira and Orlando's acting was a laughable offence.<br/><br/>After seeing and loving the other two movies, I came out the cinema gutted that the trilogy could end in such a rubbish way.

","This film, the third in the trilogy, is definitely the weakest. Now I was not a huge fan of it's predecessors, but part 3 is just such a mess that I was often left completely bewildered by the storyline. Characters come and go with no explanation for who they are or what their connection to other characters are... the whole storyline with the woman that has to be released or whatever made no sense and had no big payoff at the end since she basicaly just disappears! The sudden decision by Orlando Bloom that he needs to get married during the big fight seemed to be just to create some comic moments because there was no chemistry at all between him and the girl in the film.. they really seemed to dislike each other for much of the film... Really I could not even figure out why the pirate group didn't kill Bloom since he kept double crossing them repeatedly during the film, his motivations remained unclear the entire time and the ""ending"" didn't do anything to help with that.<br/><br/>The only thing at all good about this film were the effects, which of course were excellent.. so if you want to sit through a 2 1/2 hour film for the chance to exclaim ""wow... cool effects"" then go right ahead.. but after half an hour of that.. it just gets dull and repetitive...<br/><br/>I'm giving it a 4 out of 10... for the effects and sound design mostly... everything else is terrible."

The plot lept wildly about, like a well-dressed schizophrenic on amphetamines. The friend with whom I went to this picture kept nudging me and mouthing ""What's going on?"" as though I had any better an idea than he. He also brought along his young nephew, who spent half the movie covering his ears to protect them from the din, and the other half yawning.<br/><br/>The writers needed to provide the audience with some sort of clue as to where the locations were - like some print saying ""The Afterlife"", or ""Davey Jones' Locker"" - I mean, how in the (pardon me) is any reasonable person to know that the Sahara desert is the afterlife, and that if you want to get to the Afterlife yourself, you have to go over a waterfall near the polar cap?

","First of all, let me say that I love PotC and liked DMC, perhaps even more than CotBP. And all the mysteries of that movie were supposed to be solved in this one. Well, some were... unfortunately.<br/><br/>The best thing I can say about this movie as that anyone who doesn't love Barbossa after this one doesn't know a great character when they see one. Hats off, Mr. Rush, you rock - I'd sail with you anytime, Cap'n. Face it, he steals the show whenever he appears in this one. And Jack the monkey manages that too. Not that that is very hard.<br/><br/>As for the bad aspects, there are many to list. First of all, while the plots work individually, all together, you might get a little confused. Let's break it up to the characters, shall we? Beware, here be spoilers! <br/><br/>---The ""good"" guys--- <br/><br/>Having dealt with Barbossa, let's move straight to the man you all came to see, dear old Jack Sparrow. Pardon me, *Captain* Jack Sparrow. The worst thing about him are his long absences from the stage. Less Jack = less fun. Yes, mates, far less rum in this movie. Aside from that, the little fits of temporary insanity after being released from Davy Jones' locker tend to be slightly wacky, in the non-funny sense of the word. He seems slightly too passive to be the drunken sailor we loved in the previous two films. This Jack is far more sober, thus far less funny now. That alone was a major let-down.<br/><br/>Now, Luke Sky-... ah, I mean, Romeo... he he, sorry, Will Turner. What can we say about the not funny angst-ridden youth? Well, he tries to think like Jack, or so he says. He becomes distrustful of Elizabeth and, finally, turns into a baddie for a while. Not someone you want to have tea with, which was really the only scene in which I liked him. The end of his story is very, very cliché and not very realistic.<br/><br/>Princess Leia! Or was that (Pirate) Queen Elizabeth? The latter, I guess. Because Leia would certainly act differently, not go Disney and out of character in the end. Here you have one pirate-crazy rebel tomboy who becomes captain and then THE pirate boss and then.... throws it all away! W00t! Talk about Disney romance. Especially since the compensation for forsaking her dreams of freedom is seeing her hubby once a decade. Makes you wonder just what she has been doing all that time. Also makes you wonder where all that Han Solo - Princess Leia relationship between her and Jack went. In short, Lizzie's daft... unfortunately, not like Jack anymore.<br/><br/>Norrington is a very confused man. Very, VERY confused. He had NO idea what he was doing when he handed the heart to Beckett. NO IDEA, And thus, he must be PUNISHED!!! Because, really, there is absolutely no way to insert him into the story without killing him. Yes, ladies and gents, what could have been a good subplot should be sent into screenplay oblivion. End of story.<br/><br/>---Da Baddies--- Beckett - it's just business, Cutler. Nothing personal. We all knew you were a flat character from the beginning. We blame Disney, not you.<br/><br/>Davy Jones - Darth Vader, ahoy! Well, at least you got the girl in the end, eh, Squidhead? And attempted to attack our emotions, but failed... in general.<br/><br/>Sao Feng - No background, no major importance to the story... move along, nothing to see here.<br/><br/>-Summary- *le sigh* I was looking forward to this movie very much. It left me a bit disappointed. Sorry, Jack - you pretty much lied in the trailer, love. Pity, there. Not even you can save this sinking ship."

It is far too long, fails to hold your interest, fails to make any sense, fails to keep characters in character, and fails to have any sort of cohesiveness. It is not the worst movie I have ever seen, but it is near the bottom of the list.<br/><br/>The best moment came when my wife and I looked at each other about 2 hours in and wondered if it would ever be over. Just then Keira Knightley looked right at the camera and said, ""it's not over.""<br/><br/>Only two things help save this film: Hans Zimmer is a tremendous composer, and Keira Knightley is beautiful (and my wife thinks Orlando Bloom is hot).<br/><br/>Bottom line: Save yourself the money. Buy the soundtrack on CD, and if you must watch the movie, wait until your friend rents it on DVD."

","I loved the first one, had a lot of fun with the second (the water wheel scene is a classic), but I agree with those who said the third was too long. 'Twas so. There was enough material in it to make 2 movies. The plot was too confusing to follow with any real sense on a single viewing. It has taken me several viewings at home to properly follow a lot of the plot points, like who's on whose side, etc.<br/><br/>Spielberg did the right thing with the second and third Back to the Future movies: he split them into 2 movies so he could properly explore each chapter of the story. Verbinski should have done the same with this one. He should have just concentrated on a great adventure to rescue Jack from the Locker battling the kraken along the way. That would have left the way clear for a rip-roaring battle between the pirates and Beckett in the 4th movie.<br/><br/>There was much too little done in Davey Jones Locker. They walk onto the beach and Jack sails across the sand to them, end of rescue.<br/><br/>The audience got a raw deal when the kraken, everyone's favourite villain and source of tension in the second movie, was simply written out in the 3rd with not so much as a stick poked into its eye.<br/><br/>What was the purpose of the whole 'free Calypso' plot line? So, she turned into a giant pile of crabs to do what, indicate to us that Miss Harris would not be part of a 4th movie? I could have written a less expensive scene to explain that.<br/><br/>Ten years on and, having borne and raised a child, Elizabeth aged not a day? Is that a continuity problem? Was that scene supposed to come at the end of a 4th movie in which she finds the fountain of youth? How come the naval officers didn't take command of the ship during the final attack when Beckett froze? Even if he was paying them, he was a company man, not a naval officer."

","The third installment of the Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy is full of useless plot and too many twists. Unlike the first one, which had the audience guessing what Jack Sparrow was really doing, this installment had the audience guessing where every character had their allegiance. It was simply too much. The Calypso back story would have been more interesting had that plot not suddenly dropped after the whirlpool was created. There also seemed to be too many obvious questions that were left unanswered.<br/><br/>The only part of that movie that I liked was the battle scene itself. That was well done. Also, Johnny Depp when reprising his role as Jack Sparrow, did a very good job becoming the quirky captain again. They should have stopped making the movies after the first one."

","What I especially loved about the third installment of ""Pirates"" is how it managed to exceed my already high (after excellent previous parts) expectations.<br/><br/>Surprisingly there's absolutely no flaw (even a minor one) in this movie. Everything is in appropriate place, every phrase is a masterpiece and visualizations (especially Jack's broken into pieces personality) are a work of genius.<br/><br/>The opening scene is truly amazing and not only because of the song. It was an impressive depiction of how easily our civic rights and liberties can be revoked. No hatred, no anger - just monotonously recited one-liners and with each one of them it's a bit less in the world. Less freedom... less colors...<br/><br/>Still, even after all such almost painful insights, the trilogy never loses its merriment. There are many funny moments ""At World's End"". That enormous tome of ""pirates code"" with pompous Latin title on the cover. The ""wedding"" which is an excellent parody of awkward romantic scenes in so many movies.<br/><br/>Bottomline: Altogether it's perfect.

","I had been absolutely in love with the first two Pirates of the Caribbean movies, so I had very high expectations for this movie. It certainly met them. Not my favorite Pirates of the Caribbean movie, but I still loved it. All of the actors met the expectations I had set for them, even the new ones, and little kids. The special effects were absolutely amazing! There were so many fighting sequences, the action wouldn't stop. I didn't mind this though. All the characters improved and definitely matured. The plot line is a little confusing at first, but not really that hard. I am still trying to find out a few little things, but I can pretty much understand the whole movie. You would probably have needed to see the first and second Pirates of the Caribbean movies, but if you haven't you would probably still be able to understand it. I would definitely suggest this movie to anybody who likes action, fighting, and the other Pirates of the Caribbean movies."

","If you enjoyed ""Pirates Of The Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest"" and the shocking cliffhanger left you wanting to know how it would all end (i.e. would Jack Sparrow be rescued from Davy Jones' Locker, would Elizabeth & Will get married, would the East India Trading Company destroy the free-loving pirate way of life?), THEN THIS IS THE MOVIE FOR YOU!!! In spite of the stupid critics complaining that this film was too long, talky & complicated, I think that it was TERRIFIC & NEVER A DULL MOMENT in this swashbuckling, action-packed & epic final (or is it?) installment of the saga of betrayal, love, revenge, and of course, pirates. The special features are a pirate lover's dream. Only one minor complaint: Jerry Bruckheimer said that 20 minutes were cut from the film's original 3 hour length because of time constraints. Only two deleted scenes show up in the special features...and I'm talking about the 2-Disc Limited Edition. Where are the other missing scenes? The ""Pirates Of The Caribbean"" movies should have been rated PG, as they didn't contain graphic violence, offensive language or sexual content (it's Walt Disney Pictures; they don't do that). Rated PG for action/adventure violence."

","I was very satisfied with this movie and although POTC: COTBP will always remain my favorite (for sheer fun) this one is a very close second and works for me on a different level than COTBP.<br/><br/>Just the scenes with Geoffrey Rush & Johnny Depp made this movie worth seeing as far as I'm concerned. The two of them play their characters so well off of each other. If any more Pirates sequels are made I'll be very disappointed if Barbossa isn't back.<br/><br/>Unlike with COTBP, I find the final battle scenes still interesting after repeated viewings and though there are a few areas in the movie that I would have shortened, for me this movie went by very fast.<br/><br/>However, it really bemuses me that people had such a difficult time with this movie. Is it because people today are spoon fed everything? Is it because they no longer can use their own imaginations to fill in the blanks? Is it because some people have the attention span of a gnat? <br/><br/>I had no trouble understanding the movie the first time I watched it and I enjoyed it very much (unlike DMC which for me was only enjoyable in the last 40 mins.) The subsequent viewings of AWE have allowed me to enjoy many details and underlying currents. I like the fact that it doesn't have a pat Disney ending. I like the fact that it makes one discuss and think of possibilities.<br/><br/>""At World's End"" was never meant to be a movie like, say ""Transformers,"" so I guess people going into it expecting mindless special effects with no need to pay attention to dialogue and visual clues will never like this movie. It's their loss."

"kevintuma","2","2","4","23 October 2007"," At Wit's End
","My first thought, early into Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End, was simple enough: This is a pirate movie Uncle Walt would have hated. <br/><br/>Walt Disney would have never allowed this film to come out of his studios. The film begins with the hanging execution of a twelve-year old boy, and never grows much lighter in tone. It crawls through filthy brothels and opium dens and among the undead, foremost among them being Jack Sparrow--who was killed off needlessly in the preceding chapter as a cheap plot device.<br/><br/>The lack of sophistry in the writing is made up for by the thematic ""I see dead people"". Everything is darker, more ghostly, more black; more bleak. Missing is any earthly connection to piracy, swashbuckling, or even witty one liners. Jack Sparrow himself seems to have been enervated completely by his return from the dead and robbed of all charm, rakish spirit, and derring-do. <br/><br/>If there were ever a case for a movie being destroyed by easy availability of 3D digital effects, it can be made here. The film wallows in supernatural fantasy, and never stops. It isn't a movie about pirates at all--it's a movie about resurrection from the dead, sailing off the end of the world, giant sea goddesses who turn into crabs, cannon battles that take place in maelstroms, and other such nonsense. The silliest and most pointless gag occurs when the formerly late Mr. Sparrow leads his crew in turning a galleon upside down by rocking it (an absurdity in itself), and then the lot of them hold their breaths--for several minutes--while the cosmic bathtub sea the ship is floating in drains, proving cryptically that ""Down is Up"". After watching this, I could only wonder: What were the screenplay writers smoking..? <br/><br/>The film also depends upon blood sacrifice of protagonists and tugging on family heartstrings to engender goosebumps. Most of this is simple killing off of secondary characters--although the screenwriters can't resist using the most exhausted cliché in modern movie history: The hero's interaction with his long-lost father. It was an interesting twist twenty-six years ago in The Empire Strikes Back. It was a fun diversion eighteen years ago, in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. It has since become a bloody annoyance. At least the writers don't kill him off. (Although, I suppose, if they did, they would have simply brought him back from the dead..along with half the rest of the cast.)<br/><br/>This otherworldly sequel is as dreary, eerie, and bizarre as a Stephen King novel. Much bragging exists about how this Hollywood gold was mined from a mere theme park ride. Well, the ride is better conceived and more entertaining--and will be around long after 'At World's End' has been forgotten. <br/><br/>And by the way---Errol Flynn is still the King."
"grkangel1227","7","2","4","14 August 2007"," An Exciting Ending
","The third installment of the pirate's franchise, At World's End, was a pleasant surprise. It was an action packed often overly complex plot with more pirates, more double crossing, and more characters than before.<br/><br/>Die hard pirate fans will be able to follow the path of who's betraying who, who's trying to save who, and who has their own agenda with ease - but for those unfamiliar with the first two pirate movies this movie might just be confusing.<br/><br/>The long length of the film may not appeal to some but the movie's not filled with fluff or filler. New characters (including Captain Sao Feng) explore new territory and keep the plot interesting. However, the plot is so meshed and intertwined with multiple stories that these supplementary stories do not get their proper justice. Tia Dalma's relationship with Davy Jones is mildly explored but mostly glazed over. The East India Trading company serves no other purpose than to be a hindrance and antagonist to the survival of the main characters - pirates.<br/><br/>Will and Elizabeth smooth out the kinks in their relationship (for Elizabeth it's mainly the implicit attraction she has for Jack and for Will it's his distancing himself from Elizabeth in order to save his father from servitude to Davy Jones). If you haven't had enough of Jack Sparrow yet then the third film offers more strangely appealing and flamboyant behavior from an enticing character. Will's intentions stay relatively stagnant as he continues to find a way to save his father and be with Elizabeth while making some unwise decisions - including attempting to make a deal with Beckett. Elizabeth asserts herself more as a pirate than a lady (finally) attempting to obliterate the stereotypical damsel in distress role she had in the first pirates movie. (Jack even makes a joke in AWE about Will needing Jack's help in order to save a damsel in distress).<br/><br/>Barbossa is one of the few characters with a linear plot. He wants to bring Calypso back - period. His intentions are static but his performance is anything but. Barbossa is a welcome return to the cast of characters.<br/><br/>The final battle sequence was choreographed and designed brilliantly and will certainly entertain.<br/><br/>The ending was the best surprise of the movie. In a very un-Disney like ending everyone doesn't walk into the sunset happy and satisfiedone of the main characters even gets killed. But things don't end as sad as it may appear as Disney finds a middle ground and creates a semi-pleasant and hopefully ending for pirate's fans.<br/><br/>Overall audiences will get more time with characters they love and a good if at times excessive story with some eye-catching locations and action."

","EDIT: Upon second viewing, I found it even more enjoyable and determined my comments were a bit too harsh. I still stand by my criticisms, but most of them, especially the running time and pacing, didn't distract me nearly as much as the first time around.<br/><br/>ORIGINAL REVIEW: Somebody asked me for a one-word review of Pirates 3. The problem is, I can't really do that. Because if I absolutely had to, that word would be ""bloated."" But accurate as it is, it's way too negative. I liked the movie - I really did; and I think I'll like it even more upon a second viewing, when I can better digest and follow everything. There are some amazing sequences in it, and a lot of very creative ideas and writing - not to mention the perfect ensemble cast continues to put in remarkable performances.<br/><br/>But like so many sequels, including its predecessor Dead Man's Chest, the movie is a little full of itself. Whereas the first film was just a fun adventure flick which had no expectations, this one is far to aware of its epic status. Every scene is drawn out as if to say ""look at this amazing sequence we thought up"" and "" check out the awesome special effects!"" As a result, you have a great 2-hour movie, stretched out over 2 hours and 45 minutes. I don't mind long movies at all, as long as they need to be that long and are not just over-extending scenes unnecessarily.<br/><br/>I also think their efforts at making this an epic story have taken a lot of the heart out of the series. With each movie, more and more of the simple fun disappeared. Yes, there are comedic moments, but overall it's just lost a little something. I really wish they would just make sequels as stand-alone films, a la Indiana Jones, Die Hard, James Bond, etc, instead of trying to create these multi-film stories like Pirates and Matrix. I just think stand-alone stories feel fresher, more fun, and more enjoyable.<br/><br/>The only other flaw is actually just a case of taking a good idea too far. The filmmakers have talked about how in the world of pirates, allegiances are constantly in flux and in question, which leads to a lot of betrayal and suspicion. But here they have so many people changing sides so often and making and breaking deals left and right, to the point where it's just so confusing you stop even trying to follow it. Maybe that confusion is what they were going for, but it really got to be too much after a while.<br/><br/>So, yes, I do feel ""bloated"" is a good word to describe the film, but it's still an immensely enjoyable flick, and far better then 95% of the movies that wil come out this year."

","Pirates 3 has got to be one of the most boring sequels ever produced. If you thought Matrix Revolutions was bad... well then you clearly haven't watched Pirates 3.<br/><br/>The biggest flaw in this film is the time it takes our crew of pirate misfits to find Captain Jack Sparrow. Almost an hour goes by in the movie before we even see our beloved hero. What made me a huge fan of Pirates 1 was not only Johnny Depp, but Geoffrey Rush as Capt. Barbossa, here in Pirates 3 Geoffrey Rush is under used and when he is used he comes off as bland and boring, not the Barbossa from Pirates 1 which made us all fall in love with our swashbuckling hero's.<br/><br/>My other gripe with Pirates 3 was how blatantly Keira Knightley's sex appeal is used. I don't deny she is a very attractive woman, but do we have to highlight how hot she is in every single frame... honestly it becomes a distraction.<br/><br/>The only shining star of this entire turd is Bill Nighy as Davy Jones. Bill's acting really takes an otherwise dull character and makes him not only menacing, but stellar on every level imaginable, tis a shame he is under used in this film, and it is a DAMN shame people like Orlando Bloom get highlighted when they clearly have zero talent.<br/><br/>This is a waste of anyones time.

It wasn't more than half way into this movie that I began to squirm in my seat realizing if I sat through this I'll see everything but the kitchen sink. The movie goes everywhere in space and time, does everything, contains characters from every country, and in the end will leave you with little... because the formula here is simple: do it all! They are hoping that it will seem so exciting and full of action we''ll forgive them for forgetting to write a proper script! If a disjointed special effects extravaganza with little substance (and entertainment) is for you, then don't miss it.

","POTC saga is one that I have really grown to like, its just really a shame that I checked the saga out on the eve of the final film and what can I say I was not left disappointed at all. Picking up from where the story left of in Dead Man's Chest with the surprise ending we find our hardy crew being led to the end of the globe by Captin Barbossa (my enemy's enemy is my friend)to bring back our rather eccentric anti-hero Capt Jack Sapparow with the looming threat of Davy Jones and the East India company. We dive straight into the action and it is a non-stop roller coaster ride. While I felt that the first one was a little slow and the second one was little too long in places I was glad to say that this one had a steady pace and the film moved along rather nicely. The acting was top notch and I felt this movie belonged to Geoff Rush and Orlando Bloom and the special affects were again nothing short of fantastic especially the climatic battle at the end. There were a few questions left unanswered about the movie and I also felt that Chow Yun-Fat should been given a bigger part to play but he was good along with the other foreign pirates from around the globe. To conclude At world's end is a great way to finish of the POTC saga with thrills , spills and laughter (not as much as the first two movies but it is still there).

","The third and the final installment of the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" -trilogy came out to the theaters not so long ago and as I liked both of the previous movies I decided to go and see the third one as well, obviously. I'm not a hardcore fan, but I think the movies are one of the most entertaining movies ever made. ""Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End"" continues where the second part left us; Captain Barbossa, William Turner, Elizabeth Swann and the rest of the crew leave on a journey to get Jack Sparrow back from the land of the dead. Along the adventure they have to face villains like Davy Jones and Lord Cutler Becket. The story includes so much more, which really can't be explained shortly, as there is just so much twists and tweaks in the plot. I wouldn't even have to describe the plot more specifically as everyone has probably seen the movie already, so I just get the to review itself already..<br/><br/>The final part of the trilogy is pretty satisfying. I just don't like the way they've overdone the humour; They did it with the second part and now they've done it with the third part. The first movie, to me at least, was more like a serious movie and it had its humour, not being overdone or not playing a major role in the movie itself. The character of Jack Sparrow was hilarious in the way it was and that was it, they didn't overdo it. When the second part came out, they had pretty much overdone it all, there were punchlines and other humour just trickling all over the place and the character of Jack Sparrow didn't have that depth like it used to. It's like they dragged the movie down one level and to children it was a pleasant surprise but for us more mature viewers it was a disappointment, although the humour was actually funny, but I was just hoping for a more serious movie. The third part of the trilogy continues the same joking as the second movie did, although being funny it also leaves the whole depth of the story in a minor role, which is pretty disappointing after all. It sadly turns the movie to a hollywoodised sequel.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, the movie itself is great, but it's pretty much on the same level as the second part was, so I still think the first one is the best one of the trilogy. The things which make these movies so magnificent is the original characters and the story, not forgetting the spectacular visual effects. The character of Jack Sparrow, played superbly by Johnny Depp, is without a doubt one of the best characters ever written on paper and ever seen on screen. He is amiable, so sympathetic in a way and the audience favourite, the definite crowd pleaser. He is so original, being a hilarious swashbuckler who definitely knows his things, though being somewhat mentally unstable. To me the character is just so ideal and in all of these three movies Johnny Depp does his best role performance yet to date. Then there's William Turner, the golden boy played by Orlando Bloom. Elizabeth Swann, the beautiful girlfriend of Turner, played by Keira Knightley. Geoffrey Rush as the fierce Captain Barbossa, you can't really choose a better actor for the role, as he is just so perfect in it. The always enjoyable Bill Nighy as the evil Davy Jones is just top notch in the role. The whole cast is simply amazing and in the third movie we see such actors as Chow Yun-Fat, Stellan Skarsgård and also Keith Richards in supporting roles. The character of Keith Richards was hilarious, though he only had a few lines and didn't play any major role in the movie. What made it hilarious was that it actually was Keith Richards and when both me and my brother saw him the first time on the screen we both laughed, just because it was Keith Richards.<br/><br/>""Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End"" is, like already mentioned, visually spectacular. There were running all kinds of visual effects on the screen throughout the movie which made the movie a masterpiece in entertainment. Explosions, sword fights, rain and tornadoes, all this junk just flying all over the place, quality stuff indeed. The third movie is all in all what I expected, though some of the things being silly it's still that quality entertainment you want and it won't be a disappointment in the department to anyone. The story does get a bit messy, everyone is cheating everyone and there are so many twists that it's sometimes really hard to keep up with the plot. The movie is also a little bit too long, or at least for me it was. Especially when there wasn't any breaks in the theatre, you just had to sit there nearly 3 hours. Anyway, if you want to see entertainment then this is what you want to see, as you just won't be disappointed like mentioned earlier. This is a trilogy which is a must-have for every action fan there is, I'm probably going to buy the trilogy-DVD-box when it comes out. Who wouldn't like pirates, eh? Arrrrr matey!"
"rosepetals495","9","2","4","13 June 2007"," I Was Not Disappointed.
","I'm going to have to go back to my Pirates 2 review and change the star rating, because I think this one was much better! I honestly didn't know I was sitting in a theatre for 3 hours, because the movie was *that* intense! The beginning was magnificent. The camera direction was fantastic to make it that much more dramatic. I may have cringed through the entire first scene. <br/><br/>Elizabeth Swann seemed to get more boy-ish, and surprisingly worked great for her character. I heard a few spoilers if they were to make a 4th Pirates of the Caribbean, which made me question the character of Will Turner. Frankly, after the second movie, and the first really, his character isn't needed at all. But after viewing the most recent of the films, his character has taken on a greater part. <br/><br/>Though 3 hours is very long for any movie (yes, I am including Lord of the Rings... shut it), it all seemed kind of needed. Though, I'm not sure why they had to make Davy Jones & Calipso ex-lovers. I don't see why that was needed unless for pure Hollywood fluff. <br/><br/>This is a less romantic movie than the first two, which I surprisingly liked a lot. There was so much action it seemed to never stop, and the direction of the action worked so well together. Another part which made me gasp in recognition is when Jack is hallucinating and he sees many of himself. It took me until the time it happened in the jail cell for me to realize where I have seen it before, and with the same actor. Did anyone else think ""Secret Window"" when they saw this? I asked some of my friends, but they had no idea what I was talking about, maybe some of you do. Think about it. ;) <br/><br/>One thing I was a bit upset about, but got over very quickly, is the many visual effects. Our film industry has come so far, they can make, basically, an entire movie with visual effects. This upset me because the first one used very little effects compared to the third. The reason I got over this very quickly is because they did need it to make everything work out that they wanted to. <br/><br/>I know a lot of people love these fantastic Pirates movies, but to have a 4th one, and even having a 2nd and 3rd was pushing it, it may ruin it. Everyone is just anticipating the demise of this 'series' [?]. The fact of the matter is the script and the action do work. As Johnny Depp has said, he won't sign on for a 4th movie unless he likes the script and thinks it will work. So if they do decide to make another one of these action-filled, fun comedic movies, don't get frustrated. Take a chance on it, like you did this one. 9/10 stars."

","Because it was filmed back-to-back with Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest, fans were expecting something spectacular with the third and possibly final installment of the Disney franchise Pirates, entitled Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End, but the movie obliterates any expectations. With the previous two incredibly successful installments, Disney has found themselves with a surprise hit series in Pirates of the Caribbean. The second film is the second highest-opening movie of all time, right beside Spider-Man 3, and the first film, Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl, held surprisingly solid DVD sales. With the third installment, At World's End, Disney has made another perfect film with very few flaws that is, without a shadow of a doubt, the best film Disney has ever put out. For a sequel, At World's End actually has quite a story to tell, filled to the brim with bulky subplots and interesting characters. This installment manages to rise above the other big blockbuster sequels like Spider-Man 3 and Shrek the Third by utilizing a great cast, sensational acting, and an always-interesting plot. One may go so far as to say that there wasn't a single dull moment in the entirety of the film's 2 hour and 50 minute runtime. Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom, Keira Knightley, Geoffrey Rush, and Bill Nighy return once more for this final installment, joined by Chow Yun-Fat in a memorable role as the pirate Captain Sao Feng of Singapore. The third installment is once again directed by Gore Verbinski, who crafted the previous two installments into incredibly memorable blockbuster films with breathtaking cinematography. The story of Pirates of the Caribbean has always been the most important part of the series. Without the plot, the movies would be merely uninteresting and boring, especially considering their length. At World's End sees Elizabeth Swan, Will Turner, Captain Barbosa, and company on a journey to fetch back Jack Sparrow from Davy Jones' locker. Everything leads to a meeting of the Pirate Brethren at Shipwreck Cove, an epic battle concerning several ships, and the closure of many major plot lines. <br/><br/>Keira Knightley takes center stage in this installment, and she never ceases to amaze with her excellent acting. Johnny Depp also has lots of screen time, and he is fantastic as usual in his role as Jack Sparrow. Orlando Bloom takes on Will Turner with a somewhat darker perspective this time around, and it reflects the overall darker tone of At World's End. Chow Yun-Fat plays Captain Sao Feng with creepy sincerity, and he brings life to the character with his zany accent and attitude. <br/><br/>At World's End starts off on a serious note with the creepy but catchy song ""Hoist the Colours"", and it fits with the most insanely sinister installment yet. Some of the scenes in At World's End are extremely creepy, but, as always, the film has a great sense of humor, mostly displayed through Jack Sparrow and Captain Barbossa. So much is going on at one time in the movie that it is easy to get lost, and it may take several viewings of the film to truly understand everything. The length of the movie never seems too long for all that you get out of it, and the pacing is nearly flawless. The movie starts off a little bit slow, but once Jack Sparrow comes in, the movie really gets off its feet. There is also a crucial scene after the credits of the movie, and it is definitely worth sitting through. Also keeping with the other films, At World's End features breathtaking cinematography and a much darker tone than the others. <br/><br/>If you can only see one big blockbuster hit this summer, see Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End; it's full of action, frightening situations, well-written characters, and more story than anyone can imagine. It is certainly the best among the three big 'May' movies, Shrek the Third and Spider-Man 3. Unlike the other two films, At World's End was not disappointing on any level; it delivered in every category, and then some. The great acting and the new characters also contribute to making this the best installment yet, and the greatest big blockbuster movie of the entire year, and many years past. A+"

","Hello everyone i have recently watched this movie POTC-At the world's end.The movie is good to watch and interesting i think 2.45 hr movie is too long to watch, i think editing could have been done in a much better way. <br/><br/>OK fine Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow was great and i have gone for this movie to watch his acting only. Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightly were nice to watch. Barbossa who was almost eliminated in the POTC - 2 came back with a strong acting. But i could not understand why did the role of Chow Yun-Fat was wasted in the movie. I felt he was needless in the movie for such a small role.<br/><br/>Overall the movie was very nice with some great direction and the special effects were awesome. The climax of the movie was the best part to watch.<br/><br/>Watch it enjoy it."

","Absolutely excellent, never see such a thrilling movie like this one. The chemistry between Keira and Orlando is so strong, i was starting to believe they were actually going out in real life. And as ever, Johnny Depp's character Jack Sparrow is as funny as ever. One of the most greatest characters ever invented by any one has got too be Jack Sparrow. His character is funny, likable, serious, interesting, weird definitely and also very sexy. Will Turner's character is also very strong, serious, romantic and incredibly sexy. Orlando Bloom does fantastic acting and I give him huge amounts of credit for it. My only wish is that I could meet him, Johnny Depp and Keira Knightley. Moving on to Keira, she did absolutely stunning work, she was interesting to watch, funny, serious and incredibly romantic with Will. Her marriage to him in the film and the epilogue were and still are the most romantic scenes that truly touched my heart."
"David_Frames","5","2","4","30 May 2007"," Dead in the water
","Mark Kermode memorably described Dead Man's Chest  the bloated and ever so slightly creaky sequel to the 2003 Johnny Depp jokefest as the 'death of Western civilisation'. That kind of criticism is ridiculous of course, the second Pirates movie was far worse than that, but assuming he judged the scale of the artistic degeneracy correctly, At World's End is just that  the end of the friggin' world.<br/><br/>It's fair to say that the original film was far better than an adaptation of a theme park ride had any right to be, though the script for Alton Tower's ghost train is rumoured to be incredible  apparently Robert Towne's greatest since Chinatown. Its pantomime humour and breezy swashbuckling plot felt like a fresh wind blowing through a room of soul crushing sequels. Johnny Depp hammed it up and somehow captured the admiration of the entire world; the world showcasing its egregious taste in the process. An Oscar nomination followed, that's right an Oscar nomination for Christ's sake, which thankfully didn't translate to a win but nevertheless seemed, like the box office, out of all proportion to the quality of the film that had been made. It was not too bad, overlong and an intermittently exciting affair. Orlando Bland and Kiera Knightley provided the good looks and teeth but characterisation was a plush bounty that remained hidden and on the evidence that made it into cinemas, safe from seeking filmmakers.<br/><br/>Disney couldn't quite believe how much it had made, which made two of us and sticking to the business model now well established in light of Back to the Future and the Matrix, two sequels were green lit to be made back to back to maximise the potential box office and allow two visits to the well while the series was still popular.<br/><br/>So, inevitably the tonic to those summer sequels of many a year ago is now responsible for summer sequels of its own. Talk about irony sitting on your face without invitation and jostling from side to side.<br/><br/>The problem with making two sequels back to back is that the temptation, so far irresistible to the 'creatives' at the helm, is to make one long film and split it in two. This way you give the audience an incentive to return for the second sequel, effectively locking them into it. It's a bad move, principally because the second film is inevitably open ended and the third, lacking a self-contained plot, begins abruptly and relies on the audience's foreknowledge of characters and incident to work. Artistically you may think it would be better to make two self-contained movies with their own resolved story lines  perhaps the merest hint of a joining plot thread deftly inserted to act as that cliffhanger. Well, wouldn't you? <br/><br/>But Disney didn't do that and so at World's end begins where the old film left off with all manor of plot threads bleeding in from the previous movie. The finished film just sort of meanders along, joining up the characters, then splitting them up, then uniting them again while contrivance buggers incident follows setpiece and repeats en route to the show stopping conclusion. It's so long that when the certificate came up I'm pretty sure there were real pirates still on the high seas and that the cinema I was sitting in was just the lunatic daydream of an old seadog, albeit a seadog with an extraordinary scientific imagination.<br/><br/>Initially it seems as if the middle tenet of a pirate's life  rum, sodomy and the lash, is missing from the series all together but as the third part went on you realised it was there alright, just symbolically afflicting the audience. Did Verbinski have his script and film editor killed? On this evidence someone should be looking into it. A DVD of this would surely be enough to send Gore to the gallows.<br/><br/>One area that should be praised however, is ILM's special effects which are simply superb and occasionally, and somewhat impressively in this era of CGI saturated boredom, genuinely exciting to look at. The film's climax, which comes sometime during the movie's 15th hour, is a triumph of computer animation and pyrotechnic excess. The sheer all consuming nature of it and the pace at which every digitally stuffed frame is cut together, is the right side of breathtaking and yes, a ship cannoned to destruction in slow motion as it's captain walks down her stairs may be pure Bruckheimer balls-out action porn but that wood shattering goodness is stunning to look at. It goes on for a long long time certainly, in fact I dropped my popcorn during the third act because of the onset of acute arthritis, but in the absence of wit, economic plotting or a real story it's by far the best reason to see this groaning behemoth drag itself over 168 waterlogged minutes.<br/><br/>Ironically unlikely to be affected too much by online piracy  it made a shocking $401M around the stupid world over it's first weekend  the third Pirate's film stretches one pantomime turn across three movies, one of them okay, and in doing so shows that deprivation of quality in all other departments, bar those effects people of course, is no barrier to success on an earth shattering scale. It may not be a good advertisement for cinema but many, Michael Bay for one, will have slept better once they'd seen the film and taken in the figures, while others like old school blockbuster veterans Spielberg and Zemeckis will wonder why they ever bothered in the first place. The storytelling values of 40's and 70's Hollywood are as much under threat as Depp's pirates but unlike Sparrow and crew, it's no laughing matter."
"caesarsiamese","2","2","4","30 May 2007"," The Verbinski Bruckheimer Glut Fest
","When a movie is filmed it's standard to shoot a ton of footage they don't need. Present all that footage to a team of editors. They snag all the good stuff for the story and leave the rest on the cutting room floor.<br/><br/>Or, in the case of the Bruckheimer / Verbinski team, it'll produce a 3 hour ego driven glut fest.<br/><br/>I freely admit - I LOVE the characters in Pirates of the Caribbean. I'd sit down to dinner with any one of them and have a good time. So it was very comfortable to see them all again over the weekend. But sometimes people are just people. You hang out and not much happens. It's just fun. Sometimes you have adventures, but mostly it's just hanging out. That's what World's End is like - nice to be with them if you had nothing else better to do.<br/><br/>Technically speaking it feels like every take was forced into the film at some point. An editor with a strong will could have made sense out of this tidal wave of material, but instead they just piled on the crap hoping that some of it would appeal to someone at some point.<br/><br/>If, for example, they just focused on Tia Dalma - GREAT story!! I would have loved to see more of how she got involved with all this. Did we actually need the East Indian Trading Company story line in addition to hers? The inclusion of Norrington and Gov. Swann in addition to that? The Singapore story line in addition to those? (and what a waste of a world class actor!) Barbossa's return would have been fascinating on its own - yet in the middle of everything else the genuine and powerful relationship between Jack and Barbossa receives only a passing glance. Are you kidding? <br/><br/>More isn't more in a film like this. Rush and Depp both should have been brought down from the rafters. And what on EARTH happened to Orlando Bloom? He has grown into a compelling actor, as evident in every one of his scenes (watch him drink tea with Beckett if you think I'm kidding). Unfortunately, he's barely in the film! No, this is Keira Knightley's film start to finish. And while she's a lovely actress she can't carry it.<br/><br/>Oh, and one more complaint. I only understood - MAYBE - one phrase in six. Every character in this film has an accent so strong it should get its own credit. No two are alike, and most are absolute gibberish - from Barbossa on down. And that breaks my heart - especially in Barbossa's case. The man is known for his verbal skills (""I'm disinclined to acquiesce to your request."") so making him and every other soul sound as though they're chewing marbles didn't help.<br/><br/>Like Phantom Menace this movie has more to do with trade negotiation and politics than action and adventure. There's pitiful little swash or buckle to compensate for our 3 hours spent. The climactic maelstrom at the end was like everything else - there simply for the sake of being there. A few really impressive shots came out of it, but I was left thinking ""why are they even there? Is there a point to this?"" <br/><br/>When the""Director's Cut"" of this bloated tick comes out we should demand less,not more. Less politics, navel gazing, soul searching, character multiples and hopeless justifications. More rock crabs (damn those were cool). More strong Elizabeth and less shrill Elizabeth. MORE WILL. LESS hyperspaz Jack. MORE ""I've survived this long because I'm crazy like a fox"" Jack. MORE understandable dialog. Less meaningless maelstrom. More beautiful black ships cresting ivory sand dunes (hey, it's in the trailers - that's not a spoiler!) More content. Less filler.<br/><br/>Just freakin' sad. The end, when Will's fate is finally revealed, was darn near worth the whole thing. Almost. Simple, clean and beautiful. If they could get that right how could they screw up the rest so badly? At the end of the day I feel like I'm still waiting to see Pirate's 3. Nothing with that much potential, so highly anticipated, could have turned out so flat out awful."

","This film was an awesome beginning to the summer of '07. I saw it at the 3 AM showing. Fun preview show, and sweet. editing. Some amazing stunts, unpredictable. Only Spielberg could have done better. Depp was funny as usual in his role. His ensemble was fun and cinematic.<br/><br/>As most trilogies end up with two thumbs down, this trilogy was as fantastical as an original. While some were left confused after the sequel, PoTC-AWE left me whole just like the original ""Star Wars"", if you waited until the end.<br/><br/>Make sure you sit until the end of this film, there is an important bonus ending in this one."

","I thought this film was the best out of the series. Captain Jack Sparrow (Jonny Depp) was as funny as ever. The acting skills of both Kiera Knightley and Orlando Bloom showed great improvement, They were good before mind you. I really enjoyed the fight scenes and battles that commenced were mind blowing. The plot i found was not confusing and followed well from dead mans chest. Overall this was a classic film the costumes, special effects, and acting were superb. I advise all fans of the series to watch this film, and even those who have not seen the first two. The best pirate films of our time and they should remain the best through out film history."
"paul_66","7","2","4","28 May 2007"," If you haven't seen this movie, you're missing out. count on that!
","This movie lives up to the third title of the trilogy!<br/><br/>Before I went into the theaters, I had come up with solutions to possibilities the third one could have come out with and then when I finally saw the movie, it wasn't the same as I would have made it, but still wasn't a bad movie at all. Like I was expecting Davy Jones' locker to be under water or something in a dark, under-the-water feel, but instead it was like beneath the earth with a sky and sun, etc. Was kind of confusing on that part, but passable! The part where they had to rock the ship was worth it! Those who think this was a bad film are simply blind and don't know how to pay attention to a movie and let it be good when it deserves to be. And if it's too long for you, watch King Kong, would you? Same with Dead Man's Chest...it don't have as much flaws as some people say it does when you accept the movie for what it delivers and what it is about. Each of the three film had different tastes, which is something that I wouldn't have done if I was making the film and other people seam to have problems accepting it, as it seams, but I accepted it and they all came together as a enjoyable trilogy. After I watched the third, I watched the first and second one and loved them even better because of the third, which summed everything up for me. It's just awesome. Once you watch all three films, it comes together as a masterpiece of a trilogy and it's just fun to watch. GREAT entertainment! Just be sure you watch it with some acceptation and not be too critical, cause that will leave you not enjoying the film very well.<br/><br/>What I liked about the third is that it's dark, gritty and fairly violent. But you got to accept that as for being this big war between the EITC and the Pirate lords, etc. And at the end of the battle was victory and success. As when it first begun it was almost like: ""holy crap! how are they going to make it?"". The outcome is basically flawless! Oh, and Keith Richards' Pirate as Jack's father was my favorite! I wish there were more of him! Like in a R rated Pirate movie...lol.<br/><br/>Please do yourself a favor and make sure you've seen the first and second and watch the third! I really have to watch the third again myself, since I had gotten a seat very close to the screen and I had this massive headache which bothered me during the movie, so I couldn't keep up with it as much as I could have. But this is a movie/trilogy NOT to be missed! <br/><br/>8/10<br/><br/>Oh, and make sure you stay till the end of the credits! Don't worry it's no more than 5 minutes of credits, I believe, and it is worth it if you care about Keira and Bloom's characters (which Bloom is getting somewhat better with his believability, btw). I saw too many people get up and leave at the end of the film and probably had no clue of the last scene after the credits...lol."
"chatham-d91","2","2","4","27 May 2007"," What do you expect from a movie based on a theme park ride?
","Hey people, let's keep this in perspective. This isn't a film adaptation of some great work of fiction or even a comic book hero. Remember, this movie and its two predecessors are based on a Disney theme park ride. This is why I enjoyed the first movie immensely. I got a lot more out of it than I was expecting; however, I lost interest by the second movie and only went to the third movie because my 13 year old wanted to see it. At least Spiderman, although based on a comic book character, picked up on and enhanced an existing story-line and developed characters. I couldn't help but keep thinking, all through the tangled plot and impressive special effects of POTC3, that this carnival ride had gone too far. Hopefully, we've seen the last of POTC."
"sexypanda1992","6","2","4","25 May 2007"," Real good except of 1 thing...
","i give this movie a 6 out of 10 because of the fact that Will and Elizabeth do NOT get their happy ending! Will becomes Capitan of the Flying Duchmen and saves his father but in return has 2 give up his new bride and can only c her for 1 DAY every 10 Years and he has 2 b gone b4 sunset!!! that Really killed the movie for me cos i wanted them 2 have their happy ending and get 2 be together but no they don't get that so I think there should b a 4th movie so Will and Elizabeth can have their happy ending and b together properly!!! and there is talk if there is a 4th movie that Keira Knightly does not want 2 play Elizabeth Swann which I think really sucks, but they all probably need a rest for awhile. So if there is a 4th movie I hope that all the cast can b in it 4 1 last time and i hope every1 gets their happy ending!"
"Doylenf","7","2","4","25 May 2007"," There's much to enjoy if you can follow the twisted plot...the visuals are stunning...
","For sheer magnificence of the sets, costumes, action scenes thrown together with vigor and a good bit of humor, PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: AT WORLD'S END is best enjoyed by not paying too much attention to the intricate plot. It seems that everyone has a personal history or agenda that's the exact opposite of the other, so at times the confusion is mind-numbing if you pay too much attention to the plot line.<br/><br/>But it's sheer fun as a summer blockbuster with the further exploits of Jack Sparrow, played to the hilt by JOHNNY DEPP with a devilish gleam in his eye-linered eyes. And the rest of the cast is perfect, all of them fully a part of the scheme of things by now and knowing exactly what their function is--or so it seems. KEIRA KNIGHTLEY is more beautiful than ever as the feisty heroine Elizabeth Swann and is given much more to do. ORLANDO BLOOM is back as Will Turner with significantly less to do but he looks good doing it.<br/><br/>And you can't find better character acting than that provided by CHOW YUN FAT as Captain Sao Feng, brilliant in the Singapore scenes, STELLAN SKARSGARD as Bill Turner, KEVIN R. McNALLY as Gibbs--and most particularly BILL NIGHY as Davey Jones, hidden facially by gigantic tentacles that are just one of the many CGI ingredients. Still, behind all that make-up, he does a fantastic job.<br/><br/>I enjoyed it twice as much as the second installment although it is quite a bit lengthier. But there's so much to see, so much action and so many strikingly beautiful visual scenes to gaze at that it's hard to take it all in at one sitting.<br/><br/>If you're in the mood for a tale with plenty of swashbuckling adventures told with quirky originality, this is it. And once again, JOHNNY DEPP gets all of the humor and eccentricities out of Jack Sparrow that he possibly can. He's terrific.<br/><br/>Summing up: Cap it all up with Hans Zimmer's glorious score and you have a real good summer blockbuster."
"timashoe","3","2","4","25 May 2007"," Not worth it
","The first Pirates of the Carribbean was wonderfully created, with a new twist that no one expected, and a hilarious Johnny Depp that defied any traditional acting. The plot was well-rounded and ended up a typical Disney happily ever after. No sequels needed.<br/><br/>The second Pirates opened a whole can of worms, wove together a confusing plot and left too many unanswered questions, which I only hoped would be answered in the third one.<br/><br/>At World's End had a few exciting parts (the battle scene at the end) mainly and some good wit from Mr. Depp, but sadly continued in the example of Dead Man's Chest and changed much of the first movie's semi-normal sets (with the exception of the skeleton crew) to strange, mythic, grotesque and otherworldly plot-lines. It DIDN'T answer the massive assortment of questions that had arisen from Dead Man's Chest (though it did take a stab at a few story lines), and even more story lines were threaded into the third one, making a movie that seemed too choppy - where everything was explained as quickly as possible and moved on to save time.<br/><br/>I was very disappointed that Jack Davenport's Norrington was pushed aside with a brief segment of acting, and of course a kiss for Keira, in favor of Mr. Beckett, who was far less interesting.<br/><br/>And personally, I detested the ending for poor Mr. Turner. But that's simply because I quite enjoyed the Curse of the Black Pearl's happily-ever-after ending. I have the first movie in my movie library, but I won't waste my money on the second or third."
"Flololo","1","2","4","25 May 2007"," Dry on rum, but full of complicated plot points.
","I am a HUGE fan of Pirates of the Carribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl and I admit like most I was quite disappointed with the second film, Dead Man's Chest- but I was still there at 10 PM on May 24th for the three hour premier of the third installment. Too bad.<br/><br/>What went wrong with this film (with no spoilers):<br/><br/>1. Overlapping of secret deals and negotiations (too much)<br/><br/>2. Mostly stock character based- majority of characters aren't really developed. Or those who were developed were strongly out of original character. Some characters that could have greatly contributed to the story and seemed interesting weren't used at all. At least everyone in the first installment was interesting.<br/><br/>3. Same jokes and dialog-somewhat funny, but gets pretty boring. Sorry Captain Sparrow (and you were my favorite!) <br/><br/>4. Unexplained pasts, decisions and characters- an example we have no idea WHO Lord Beckett IS, everyone in the film already knew all about who he was, however nothing about his character or what his relation is to the other characters is ever explained- definitely a huge raw back. I also found that those who met their demise was completely unnecessary, and just seemed to make this film even worse.<br/><br/>5. While the second film could have had about 1 hour cut because of unnecessary footage (despite the fact that it was interesting it added nothing to the story), this film was very long and the creators tried to cram as much as they possibly could, which I found to be in vain. <br/><br/>6. HEAVY use in special effects. The first installment was simple, the only CG was distant shots of ships (and those that were blown up) and the skeleton pirates. But almost every scene had some sort of CG addition.<br/><br/>BUT! There were some good aspects of this film as well:<br/><br/>1. Twist in plot and the clip AFTER the credits. I applaud the creators for being fearless from this aspect. <br/><br/>2. Chow Yun Fat and several other talented actors were added to the cast (but again I'd go back to #2 above of why this wasn't a great film). <br/><br/>3. That's all.<br/><br/>For those who are IMDb: Would I say that you should see it in theaters? Maybe, because there is a lot of action and those types of films are best on the big screen and after all, most people will have seen it by the time you can rent it-BUT! If you have a friend with a large TV or a projector- rent this film instead.<br/><br/>But my personal opinion, and recommendation for people who like REAL films: I really detest this film and unless you absolutely HAVE to know what happens, just have your finger on the fast forward button."

This movie does what sequels are suppose to do and be bigger than the last two and give an ending to the characters journey. The only problem my friends and I had was the lack of a plot. After we came out talking about the film we realize that they left a lot of holes in the plot. Characters mysteriously dying of screen, plot devices forgot about and do not forget the many betrayal in this movie. Everyone at one point betrays each other to the point where you do not know whose on whose side. So in summation this movie is great for the entire family, but don't think about it too much afterwords, because if you do it will not be that good of a picture you originally thought it was."

","I've seen ""At World's End"" on the Croatian premiere last night and liked it. However, it does suffer from ""too much of everything cramped into three hours"" syndrome and it's hard to digest all at one sitting. Definitely less dark and more twisted (multiple Jack hallucinations) than the ""Dead Man's Chest"".<br/><br/>It does seem to suffer from some major plot holes  or not?<br/><br/>*** MEGA SPOILERS START *** From the fact of how Elizabeth became a captain and a Pirate Lord, one would conclude that it's done by appointment from the previous Pirate Lord you serve under. If this is so, how and when did Barbosa become one? In the ""Curse of the Black Perl"" we learn that he was serving under Jack and mutinied against him, stole his ship and thus became a captain, and fallen to the curse shortly after that. But, according to Calypso, he was already a Pirate Lord when he died  which is why she resurrected him in the first place. How is it that one Pirate Lord is serving under another? It may well be that Barbosa was a captain and a Pirate Lord before he came to serve under Jack and did so under false pretenses to steal his ship and treasure, but would Jack (as a Pirate Lord himself) have not recognized him?<br/><br/>Also, what exactly and in which order happened between Davy Jones and Calypso? Who first betrayed whom? He fell in love with her while she was still ""unbound"" and cut out his own heart. She took pity and gave him the task of ferrying souls to the other side. When she failed to show up after 10 years he grew bitter and betrayed her to the pirate council  or not? *** MEGA SPOILERS END ***<br/><br/>""At World's End"" has lots of funny moments, especially with competing captains (e.g. whose looking glass is bigger), and yes the special effects are amazing.<br/><br/>Definitely a ""must see"" and if you are a fan like me  more than once."
"ethanrunt","10","2","4","24 May 2007"," Finally the trilogy is completed, and more Depp and Nighy than possible!
","Last year i suffered a fate i felt was worse than death, POTC2, and it was only recently i realised it was due to a lack of re-watching of the first, not being in the right frame of mind, and kids, stinking rotten kids.<br/><br/>This time, i watched the 1st 2 back2back days before, kept that frame of mind and got me, for the first time since Hot Fuzz, excited to see a movie.<br/><br/>But did the shenanigans of Depp, Knightly, Bloom, Rush, Crook and McNally give me enough reason to enjoy the trip to what has been called an overlong diatribe fest, too violent, too complex and too little like the first one?<br/><br/>no the critics are just hate filled against this series, pure and simple. Zodiac was far more complex and violent, but did that get a hard time? no chance.<br/><br/>No, the critics are about as lenient on this film as Have I Got News For You with a guest presenter in the news that week.<br/><br/>It seems that the reviews have rallied against the film, which is a shame as i feel much different to these:<br/><br/>For one the 'confusing' aspect is as confusing as a ball on the ground with instructions laid out next to it which go through the method of kicking it step by step over 50 sections, each with pictures. They tell you half of it and let you understand the rest for yourself, they do the same in indie films and the critics call it ambiguous, but if they leave it all on a plate, the critics will say it's force feeding you, so they can shut up.<br/><br/>Too violent? Bah, the nastiest moment in the trilogy remains the eyeball pecking out at the start of 2, with Crook's fork fortune a close second, i hate eye injuries. When they said too violent forgive me for thinking it'd be 300 on the sea.<br/><br/>The cast are weak? I'm sorry if you find the fact that they have settled into the characters so perfectly that everything they do in real life is more like these characters, but they are far from weak.<br/><br/>Depp saves it? I admit, yet again Depp is fantastic and hilarious, and lots of other words, one for each time he appears on screen thrice, or even 10 times at once, but it's 'saved' by the script, the effects, the direction, the plot and the characters mincing together for lots of fun.<br/><br/>What was wrong with this movie oh dear Ethan our lord and saviour? Some moments were a tad too slow, the endings were almost outnumbering a certain trilogy to do with rings, and it wasn't a porno, i didn't see that final one, but i'm sure the money shot isn't occurring 50 times within 10 minutes, no one is that, Er, i shan't think of a word there.<br/><br/>It's a sad day when a fantastic blockbuster like Pirates is hated as much as a Shrek film, but i guess some peoples tastes don't respect the work of a fine film such as this.<br/><br/>And at least the film gets the graphics bearing better than number 2, and with the 100 odd digital artists in the credits it's no surprise, and i predict it'll go down well at the Oscars next year once again, and much more deserving too, with the crew of the Flying Dutchman looking much better.<br/><br/>The score is as jauntily fun and epic at the same time, with some nice new music amidst the old classics, 'He's a Pirate' over the start of the end credits adds to the epic-ness, and Sparrow's music keeps getting lighter as the film gets darker.<br/><br/>The film looks beautiful, the Carribbean is amazing in itself, but fix the white sands and blue water with the quality of camera-work, a scene with Lord Becket fighting the pearl with him walking as chaos ensues, is a true marvel, and i presume got the shutter speed technique and improved it from Saving Private Ryan and Gladiator, you know when the blood goes everywhere in slow mo and looks amazing, that thing <br/><br/>Nighy's presence once again helps add a cool effect to the air, as does a sadly brief section once again with Jonathon Pryce, he's too good for the small amount of work he does in these films, and Jack Davenport, which his role was expanded slightly from 1 and 2.<br/><br/>OK, there's no big comic action sequence in this one, no water wheel, cannibal island, and the film is a lot more darker, but credit to Mackenzie Crook, Kevin McNally and Lee Arenburg for keeping the film light and having great chemistry with themselves and others, and also to Jack the monkey and Cotton's Parrot, great scenes involving them, shame we didn't get to see if they wanted the heart, and if they wished to double cross everyone and steal the Pearl.<br/><br/>It's a long, but ultimately fun, funny, fresh and interesting approach to the saga, and as sure as it's the most forgettable one, and the scene after the credits isn't funny, rather just a plot point in itself, i'd argue it has some of the great action moments, some of the best comic moments, and some of the highest main character body counts in an ongoing series, even if they keep coming back to life anyway. 10/10"

","If you were like me, a bit disappointed with Spiderman 3, you wouldn't be disappointed again. Pirates 3 was amazing - amazing CG, amazing complicated story that got me confused for a while, and amazing adventures. It's a classic Disney adventure film that will probably stun you the way Indiana Jones did. Just... wow.. The fights were long at times, but the camera work is so busy, makes you see something new in every other shot. There's action everywhere, and i mean EVERYwhere.. on the ship, off the ship, in the sea, in the air..<br/><br/>Johnny Depp is gooooooooooooood.. i like him in this movie.. (i know lots of ppl would like him in any movie, but here, i like him best..) Chow yun-fat came out earlier than expected.. right at the start of the film (and left early, for that matter), the octopus guy.. Davy Jones.. man, i still don't get how they do his tentacles.. Orlando Bloom... he looks better with white hair (LOTR) haha.. well.. he looked better at the end of the movie where he wore a bandanna.. haha.. and Keira is too skinny and boyish.. hmph..<br/><br/>The story plots is intertwined in such a complete mess, and yet i can't find any plot holes (or maybe i was too busy watching all the action i didn't have time to think of any).. it's not like any of those easier to watch adventure films like tomb raider, with only one storyline.. it goes back and forth, without the need of flashbacks! Amazing editing.. i wouldn't know how to edit the whole thing if i was given all that footage.. Just... really worth the price! even if they add HK$15 to the tickets!!!

","Filmed simultaneously with ""The Chest of Death"", this third film closes the arc of the story started in ""The Curse of the Black Pearl"" and became the highest grossing film of the year of its release, dragging millions to movie theaters worldwide. This third part is usually remembered as the weakest of the initial three films in the franchise, something that is even unfair, considering the way The Chest of Death was finished. That said, it is undeniable that this final chapter has numerous defects, one of them being the prolonged duration, a characteristic inherited from its predecessors. Yes, there are missed opportunities and poorly taken advantage of, but that does not mean that this is not a worthy closure for this first part of the adventures of Jack Sparrow and his troupe.<br/><br/>In ""At the End of the World,"" Lord Cuttler Beckett (Tom Hollander), of the East India Company, takes command of the ghost ship Flying Dutchman. The ship, now under the command of Admiral James Norrington (Jack Davenport), has the mission to roam the seven seas in search of pirates and kill them without mercy. In order to arrest Beckett, Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) and Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) need to reunite the Nine Lords of the Brotherhood Court. However, one of the Lords is missing, Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp). The trio leaves for Singapore, intending to get the map that will lead them to the end of the world, which will allow Jack to be rescued. However, to get the map they will need to face a Chinese pirate, Captain Sao Feng (Chow Yun-Fat).<br/><br/>This is a work that invariably needs to be watched right after O Baú da Morte. Many of the events that take place here continue those we saw in the predecessor and the script by Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio is not at all concerned with reminding us of what had happened, except, of course, of Sparrow's death. The whole dynamic involving Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander) or even Davy Jones will sound extremely confusing to those who do not remember the previous feature film, and as a result, it is safe to say that this third installment of the franchise does not hold up at all by itself.<br/><br/>The highlight, obviously, goes to the final battle, which is something complex and fun, with countless actions being carried out by the most diverse characters. Gore Verbinski really shines in the direction, hitting the scope of this duel between the Black Pearl and the Flying Dutchman, with Stephen Rivkin's montage making everything extremely dynamic, while we jump from pirate to pirate, everyone fighting for something specific, be it Barbossa trying to keep Pearl in an advantageous position, or Jack dueling against Davy at the top of the mast. Even an impromptu wedding we have a chance to see. It is an impressive sequence, which does not sound as drawn as the climax of the previous two. Despite this, the script simply ignores all the pirate lords, who only watch the entire combat, as well as the British East India Company fleet, something that makes no sense. The worst thing is that it ends up making almost all interaction in the pirates' stronghold unnecessary, since the alliance signed there does not bring any results, besides giving Elizabeth ""powers"". The same goes for Calypso, although some tips about it were given in The Chest of Death.<br/><br/>As we discussed above, this third part ends up wasting many of the cards at its disposal, not doing justice to the two fleets that face each other in this final battle. There are countless points to be tied, so many subplots developing at the same time, an enormous amount of characters with little enough time on the scene to awaken empathy in the viewer. Almost three hours long, the script goes around so many times that we are asking ourselves: ""But what are they really doing? What do they want? Where are they going? What are they looking for? Who needs to be saved?"" There are so many exaggerations that we are anesthetized, amortized, and we don't even pay attention, inert with the twists and turns, just when the opposite should be happening.
Here, Captain Jack Sparrow has a good time, but ends up sharing the screen with countless characters that fill the screen. Geoffrey Rush, the scary Captain Barbossa, became a mere supporting character, almost without purpose - all the uproar caused by his appearance at the end of the second film vanishes in the air. The same is true of Bill Nighy's terrible Davy Jones, who had caused so much fear and disgust previously, but which now resembles a tormented puppet. But really bad are the two great additions to the cast: Chow Yun-Fat (The Tiger and the Dragon, 2000), as vaunted as the most dangerous pirate in the east, dies before the middle of the film, while the long-awaited and commented participation by rocker Keith Richards (member of the band Rolling Stones), as Sparrow's father, besides being insignificant, it takes more than two hours to happen. With Tom Hollander gaining more prominence in this film, the graphic narrative takes new directions. Jones leaves the antagonism a little aside and is replaced by Beckett. Hollander delivers a good villain, of those that we feel hatred just by hearing his name, but it falls short of the prominence that Bill Nighy gives the captain of the Flying Dutchman.<br/><br/>On the technical side, there is no doubt about the spectacular work. Dariusz Wolski's photography remains one of the points that make this series a success. As dark as the scene is and with a lot of rain, we can see the richness of details that the production team managed to put in the scenarios that comprised the two ships. Not to mention that, throughout the film, we have numerous scenes of destruction of vessels and locations made without the help of CGI, such as Singapore and the island where the Pirate Brotherhood Court meeting takes place. The soundtrack is again splendid, once again featuring compositions by the genius Hans Zimmer. Tracks like ""The Brethren Court"", ""Calypso"", ""What Shall We Die for"" and ""One Day"" enrich the story of the plot and make it even more epic.<br/><br/>Some of the characteristics of pirate films were lost, but it made up for the new characters, the action scenes with masterfully choreographed fights and the creation of new scenarios and conflicts. The problem is that everything was left to be solved in a third part. And it is a lot. A lot of things. As if the complicated plot weren't enough, with the appearance of new characters, the humor was lost. And it is precisely this obligation to tie up all the stories and close the cycle that ends up being too big a load for the old Caribbean ships. With a darker plot, and that consequently has less funny situations, time never seems to run. The long explanations of the inexplicable tie not only the heads of first-time sailors, not to mention the countless twists and betrayals so meaningless that in the end all that remains for the viewer is to let the story go and look at the horizon, waiting for the final battle that is approaching and the end that never comes - there is a 2h48 projection until that hidden scene after the credits.<br/><br/>With a very closed ending, ""Pirates of the Caribbean: At the End of the World"" fulfills, very well, the duty of giving all characters their respective happy endings and leads some others to find their cruel destinies. Without a doubt, this is the most epic Pirates of the Caribbean film. However, the film sins in rhythm, with inappropriate timing and showing an empty profusion of meaningless special effects, as if they were there just to justify the $ 300 million spent on the budget. Despite all the problems, it is a film made with absolute care and that provides several striking scenes. It is a guaranteed fun that is worth embarking on."

","At nearly three hours long, 'Pirates Of The Caribbean: At World's End (2007)' is baggy. It's also rather messy. There are so many backstabs and underhanded deals that it's actually confusing at times: who's double-crossing who while protecting someone else? The thing also suffers from a bit of a villain problem; it severely neuters Davy Jones, taking his presence from threatening to almost comedic, and attempts to replace him with the smarmy Beckett and his East India Company, who make compelling side villains but can't hold a candle to their more memorable pirate counterparts. After the first hour, which is spent mopping up the mess left by the sequel-bait ending of 'Pirates Of The Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest (2006)', the film starts to pick up the pace and move towards its genuinely thrilling finale with increasing vigour. Indeed, it feels distinct from its predecessor despite the fact it was filmed back-to-back with it as, for all intents and purposes, a 'part two'. It has its own, increasingly 'epic' aesthetic and it's really rather visually impressive. The VFX team clearly made good use of the time between this film and the last, as the CGI has improved greatly. The aforementioned finale is amazing, with sea-weary ships entwining over a maelstrom as pirates lock swords on their masts. This leads into a satisfying ending that ties up all the trilogy's arcs rather well, while still leaving things 'open' for potential sequels. Overall, the movie has its issues but its climax is fantastic and, even at its worst, it's always entertaining. It isn't the best of the series but it isn't the worst, either. It's a solid, swashbuckling adventure. 7/10"

","On par with Dead Man's Chest, not as good as the first part three still offers a very wild ride. The main problem, I have never had a harder time trying to keep up with so many double crosses and under the table deals as I did in this movie. Everyone had a hidden motive it seemed even Will Turner who in the last movie was just a trusting dupe. I can not believe no one seems to have the problems with this story as they did with Spidey 3 which I found very easy to follow. Add to that the fact that Captain Jack Sparrow, the sole character who made this series is not in it much and you have the disappointment of part two all over again. Granted it was not a huge disappointment, it was a good movie and it was great seeing Geoffrey Rusch back as Barbossa so it did get points for that. The story, this is going to be the hard part, however, I am keeping it as simple as possible. The gang is going in search for Jack, all with differing reasons. Jack is banished to Davey Jones locker and is going a bit crazy. There is a rescue and now there is a pirate meeting to attend, something about a song, a vengeful sea spirit named Calypso and various other obstacles leading to what I have to say is one heck of an action packed conclusion that is packed with great special effects. So there you have it, sure it could use a trimming of the run time as it goes on a while, but it still manages to entertain. I would have liked to see a simpler story though with a bit more comedy as there are some chuckle scenes, just nothing all that super funny like in the first. It was also surprising to see the villain from the last movie Davey Jones play basically a very small role till the very end during the uber action scene. Characters seemingly not all that important in the last film are now somewhat the focal point and you see Keith Richards in a small role as well. So as you can see there is a bit much going on and if there were a sequel to be made I say no Will or Elizabeth, bring back Barbossa, and have Jack Sparrow in it more and keep the plot more lighthearted and simple."

","Continuing my plan to watch every Johnny Depp movie in order, I come to Pirates Of The Carribean: At Worlds End.<br/><br/>This one has even more plot holes than the second movie. Sometimes they're minor quibbles that can be forgiven. But sometimes they're too glaringly obvious to ignore.<br/><br/>When it comes to the final hour, the movie delivers. Unfortunately, that doesn't account for the other 108 minutes of this bloated and uneven movie. It's far too long and needlessly complex!! The majority of the movie is dull, slow-moving and uninvolving. The main quality of the first movie was that it was fun. There is little fun to be had in the first 90 minutes of this movie. <br/><br/>Too many deals and too much double crossing. It's like the film makers forgot what made the first one so much fun. The Kieth Richards cameo is lame. Tia Dalma/ Calypso was absolutely pointless. All she did was create an abyss and make it rain for a while. So much time was devoted to this character and that was it. As was Norington. He was pointless in the second movie, and now they try and give him some redemption!! Nah just pointless. Is Mr.Gibbs sole purpose in these movies just to explain things to the viewers?? <br/><br/>The final hour is almost enough to make you forget how much of a labor it is to sit through the first two-thirds - almost!! It doesn't blend the humor as well, the jokes are lazy and Captain Jack Sparrow finds his screen time limited. A late entrance and too many side-stories take the focus from the best thing in the movies. He is not in the opening half hour. When Mackenzie Crook says ""There must be a good reason for our suffering"" I feel like he is speaking for the audience. Sadly when he turns up, it is Johnny Depp acting like he was still in Fear & Loathing in Las Vegas.the next ten minutes is a waste of time as 20 Jack Sparrows run amock. The irony is not lost when Jack says ""We have lost time. Valuable time. Time we cannot get back!!"" or maybe it was lost on the filmmakers after all. <br/><br/>Kiera Knightley continues to evolve from damsel in distress to full-fledged pirate. Sadly, her chemistry with Depp is absent this time around. Orlando Bloom has a bit more to do this time around. Finally, Will Turner has becomes something a little more interesting than a one-dimensional hero. Sadly their wedding is pathetic and The less said about Elizabeth's freedom speach the better!! Considering it is a Disney movie there is a lot of adult humour about Elizabeth. She is asked to remove her clothes, she has a weapon in a seriously private place (Good luck in the bedroom Will Turner) there is a joke about one of the pirates looking up her shirt, that she is wearing as a dress!! Sao Fenn forcibly kisses her. Seriously where the hell did she have that last gun hidden?? <br/><br/>POTC: At Worlds End grossed $309 million at the domestic box office, to end 2007 as the 4th highest grossing movie of the year."
"philipposx-12290","7","0","0","26 January 2018"," Takes a little bit until the epic conclusion
","Back in 2003 The Curse of The Black Pearl was one of the best movies ever made, just brilliant and captivating Pirate Action (10/10) and the follow-up three yeas later still was a blast but suffered from having no real ending (8/10) and 2007's third movie gave that ending.
I would say that it is the ""worst"" in the series, although it is still good. The major complaint are the complete boring minutes in the first and second act. Sadly, nothing happens until Captain Jack is back from the World's End.
Here is the problem that the series just couldn't avoid. PotC is a franchise that lives because Johnny Depp brings such light and charisma into Jack Sparrow.
That does not mean that the other actors like Orlando Bloom, Keira Knightley and Geoffrey Bush aren't great, because in fact, they are, but the movie just drags when there's no Sparrow.
When we then kick into second gear, about on the 100 minute mark, it is Pirates of the Caribbean at it's finest. Epic battles, a wonderful score, strong performances and iconic one-liners. 
The ending sequences are gripping and mesmerizing, just as the consequence. 
Had it not been for the boring first minutes, PoTC III would just be on the level of the previous ones: 7/10"

","Let me get one thing out of the way right now. I have not seen this film since possible when it was first released over eight years ago. So this review might not be that good and will probably be very heavily revised if I ever see this film again. But I will do my best from memory. The film starts off with the group trying to save Johnny Deep's character from Davy Jone's Locker Room and they do so. The name Davy Jone's Locker Room reminds me very much of Spongebob Squarepants. Also during the movie Orlando Blooms character and the main female get married but that happened very late in the film. One scene that sticks out to me and that might be a reason I only saw it once was the kid getting killed at the start. Again, I can't remember this too well so the review may be very off but I remember the movie being okay. Not that great but nowhere near the level of the first two films. That was the worst part of it to me."

","Pirates of the Caribbean: At Worlds End the third installment of the Pirates franchise was really excellent. I felt it wrapped up everything from the previous installments and it was a good story.<br/><br/>At Worlds End takes place only a few months after Dead Man's chest which story wise is not very long at all. Lord Beckett of the East India Trading Company (The worst and wimpiest villain in all the franchise) has command of Davy Jones heart thanks to former Commodore Norrington, Beckett now controls Jones which in turn gives him power over the seas and over the pirate community which he despises. Meanwhile, Will and Elizabeth with the newly brought back to life Captain Hector Barbossa venture to Davy Jones Locker to bring back Captain Jack Sparrow, who has gone a little mad due to his time in the Locker, a desert like barren place with odd and mysterious things happening. They need Jack because along with Barbossa he is one of the nine pirate lords that can summon the brethren court who can stop Lord Beckett (That wimpy man) and his rampage.<br/><br/>World's End was exciting and it felt like an exploration/action story to me. I like the bizarre things in the film, like Davy Jones Locker, how Jack is a little mad in it, and I especially loved the fight at the end with the big whirlpool and the storm. What really shocked me is the negative reviews this pirates received, it was not bad at all, movie reviewers these days can't seem to see a good story when they see one. I loved how Will takes over Davy Jones place as soul carrier of the sea. I liked how Jack and Will's friendship is shown through Jack making Will the new Soul carrier. And I loved the post credits scene where ten years later it shows Will and Elizabeth's son, Henry. Who plays a big part in the fifth installment of Pirates. The only downside to Pirates 3 was Lord Beckett, I hated that villain. Worst pirates villain in the series. <br/><br/>Pirates of the Caribbean: At Worlds End was fun and very piraty which I loved. It feels in a lot of gaps for future installments. <br/><br/>Long Live the Pirate Life <br/><br/>10/10 for At Worlds End"

"jaredpahl","8","0","0","3 June 2017"," Excessive to An Extreme, At World's End Is A Grand Pirate Epic Marred By Some Serious Narrative Glut
","The third and final installment of Gore Verbinski's Pirates of the Caribbean Trilogy, At World's End is a massive sea-faring spectacle. If Dead Man's Chest started the franchise on a slightly darker path, At World's End leaves no doubt that this is a completely different animal than the first Pirates adventure. Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End is a sweeping finale stuffed to bursting with superfluous characters and dozens of interweaving subplots, but it is also packed with energy and humor. Gore Verbinski's massive send off to the trilogy is overblown for sure, but it is satisfying enough in the big categories (action, characters, humor, visuals) to make it a worthy climax to the series.<br/><br/>The story of At World's End revolves around no less than the Lord Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander) and the East India Trading Company's plan to eradicate all pirates from the face of the earth with the help of Davy Jones and the crew of the Flying Dutchman. The scope of the story is massive. Unlike the first two movies, Pirates 3 is better described as a war movie than a pirate adventure. Alliances between the East India Trading Company and the Pirate Brethren are in a constant state of flux during this two hour forty-five minute behemoth of a movie. Along the way, Jack Sparrow must be rescued from Davy Jones' Locker, the pirates must unite against the encroaching modern world, and all the characters have to find resolution in their arcs. The story is incredibly ambitious, but its density is so overbearing for the most part that that ambition too often goes misplaced. The primary character stuff is not bad. The problems with the story stem from the fact that there is simply too much exposition, too many MacGuffins, and too much screen time given to needless subplots for the story to really shine. It's not that the script is lazy, it's not. Writers Terry Rossio and Ted Elliot put effort into connecting the dozens of side stories in a natural way. If you do your research and take notes, you can follow the plot, but at some point, the shifting alliances and expositionary curses become overkill. There's a great story in here about the celebration of old-fashioned romance in the face of a cynical modern world, but the extra baggage weighs these themes down dramatically.<br/><br/>Still, with Verbinski and company back, the film once again drips with invigorating zeal. The cast continues to buy into the spirit of the franchise. They're all having fun, and Orlando Bloom, Kiera Knightly, and even Bill Nighy get to do some real acting in their respective love stories. There are no revolutionary performances here, but the sum of all the parts of the cast makes for an earnest likability to the movie as a whole. By this film, Depp's Captain Jack loses a lot of the unpredictable charisma that he brought to the role in the first two movies. His role is mainly comedic in At World's End, that by itself does not make Depp's performance any worse. Depp is a great comedic presence. He's genuinely funny, and if he doesn't get as much of the serious moments as he might have, it really didn't bother me.<br/><br/>At the risk of sounding redundant, the look of this trilogy capper is yet again captivating in its overflow of imagination. Most of the creature designs are carried over from Dead Man's Chest, but the new additions here, including the steamy Singapore sets and Chinese junks, are rich in detail and personality. John Knoll and his team at ILM continue to dazzle with their special effects as well. The action scenes are imagined at a scale so much greater than the swashbuckling swordfights and battles from Curse of the Black Pearl and Dead Man's Chest, and ILM does a superb job bringing them to life. The final conflict, a gigantic battle between the entire cast of characters procured throughout the trilogy in the middle of a biblical whirlpool in the pounding rain, is the perfect stage for the climax of the trilogy. It is a rousing action scene because of Verbinski's complete control over its complexity. Every character has a role in the battle, and there are even character resolutions that happen as the action is happening! Even with an ungainly amount of stuff going on in the scene, Verbinski gives it a fantastic orientation. You can tell what's going on and you can actually follow the battle. The scene is transporting. It puts you there, in the rain, with the characters. By the time it's over, you feel like you need some dry clothes and a nap. <br/><br/>Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End is a balls-to-the-wall extravaganza. The Verbinski Trilogy gets bigger with every installment and At World's End represents the series' absolute zenith of ""bigness"". That is both harmful and helpful to the movie as a whole. The story is completely over-inflated with exposition that drags on forever and an unnecessarily shaky set of alliances (would it be so bad to know who the good guys are and who the bad guys are from the start?). There are flaws in this movie that would doom a hundred similar films. It's Gore Verbinski's direction and his relentless aura of fun that keeps this ship afloat. At World's End has gotten better with subsequent viewing for me. I'd wager it's because every time I see the film, more of the story comes into focus. The first time I saw this movie I was completely lost and unable to connect to the film's big moments. By now, those moments hit harder than ever. Who knows, in a few years I may be singing this movie's praises even more.<br/><br/>77/100"

","The third and final chapter of the initial trilogy, At World's End begins not long after the cliffhanger ending of Dead Man's Chest. Lord Cutler Beckett now has command of both Davy Jones and The Flying Dutchman, and is using them as his weapons to exterminate piracy from the high seas once and for all. Meanwhile, Will, Elizabeth, the resurrected Barbossa and the rest of the Black Pearl crew are in search of a way into Davy Jones' Locker, where Jack Sparrow currently is after being swallowed whole by The Kraken. Their journey has them cross paths with the vengeful Captain Sao Feng (Chow Yun-Fat) before they can pull Jack out of purgatory. But once Jack is back, he finds that it's not for the purposes he would've hoped. Will just wants Jack's ship so that he can use it to rescue his father from the clutches of Davy Jones, Elizabeth is looking to own up for the double-handed way she betrayed Jack, and Barbossa is only interested in returning Jack to the land of the living because it means that the legendary Brethren Court of Pirates can convene to formulate a plan of action; both Jack and Barbossa are Pirate Lords. However, it seems neither side can avoid the war that is brewing on the horizon as all the alliances between these characters grow shakier by the minute.<br/><br/>Okay, so that's the most basic plot description of this movie I can write. If I were to go into any more detail, then we'd be here all day. The plot of this film is A LOT more complex than you'd expect in a pirate action-adventure movie, but that's what I love about it. Yes, you read right: love. So, let's get into this story, shall we?<br/><br/>As I pointed out with Dead Man's Chest, the more intricate plotting winds up making the movie all the more interesting. There is so much going on here, that this movie doesn't merely ask for your attention, it DEMANDS it. And when talking about a big-budget, effects- driven blockbuster, that is something I both admire and respect a great deal. To answer the question that's probably on everyone's mind right now: no, I didn't find it confusing at all. It's an extremely easy movie to follow, really, and I appreciate how it doesn't feel the need to spoonfeed the audience every single, miniature detail. Plus, it has so much plot going on, that for a nearly 3-hour movie, At World's End rarely (if ever) feels like it's wasting time. Not only that, but the story moves along at a very nice pace and the movie never feels overlong.<br/><br/>Though, I admit, your overall investment in this movie is determinate on how much you're invested in the characters and everything they're doing. Well, suffice it to say I love these characters, and find myself involved in every aspect of this movie every time I watch it. I care about Will and Elizabeth's troubled romance, I care about Will's burgeoning desire to free his father from Davy Jones, I care about the Pirate Council desperately fighting to maintain their way of life, and ultimately, I care about the fates of all the characters. Ted Elliot and Terry Rossio's script gives nearly everyone something to do in the story, so nobody ever feels wasted, but more importantly, the script creates very interesting dynamics between all of them.<br/><br/>Those dynamics are another part of what makes this movie so cool. Basically, everyone here is behaving exactly like what they are: pirates. And that's something that feels so natural, given the high stakes of the story. Survival is the predominant idea on every character's mind, and it's an idea that would make anyone in situations like these do what they have to in order to achieve it. Even if it involves unflattering betrayals (again, they're pirates; betrayal is as easy as breathing for them). This is most evident with Jack and Will, whose evolution in this movie I also love. So, call me crazy all you want, but I love this script. I also think it sports some great dialogue, as well as an effective opening scene.<br/><br/>Getting back to the high stakes for a moment, this brings me to another point: just how BIG and EPIC this movie is. With a budget of $300 million, there's seldom a moment where you can't see the money on the screen. And that big, epic feeling is something I get wrapped up in all the time. At World's End has some fantastic set pieces and action sequences, but they're not there just for the hell of it; they're there because they're born organically out of the story. That, and they're a load of fun. I mean, just look at the sheer energy of that fantastic maelstrom climax. Not just in terms of action, but story as well, this movie is just huge, and I'm sure no other movie in the franchise will ever top this in that regard. Also, Hans Zimmer's score for this film is equally epic and amazing.<br/><br/>Overall, I find Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End to be the most misunderstood and under-appreciated blockbuster of the last couple of years. People always complain how these Hollywood blockbusters are ignoring the stories less and less, and yet when a movie like this comes along that actually creates an interesting one, they just write it off anyway."

"kdavies-69347","6","0","0","2 March 2016"," A Comparative Look at the Pirates Series - Part 3: At World's End
","As we arrive into the third film in the series, things have taken a much stranger turn. Ever more so than the final movie. It is certainly a dispatch from the previous films, where the theme becomes slightly abstract, and plot devices tend to muddle the overall story. The world is changing, and in it, there is no more room for piracy. Under rule of the King of England, the Caribbean islands have begun executing all known pirates, associates of pirates, and even surprisingly... the children of pirates. We enter the film at the gallows and witness hanging after hanging in a strongly dark montage of death. This certainly sets the tone for the remainder of the film. William, Elizabeth align themselves with Captain Hector Barbossa on a mission to find Jack who was 'lost at sea'. It's unknown how much time has passed since we last saw him, but it could be inferred that it is not too long after his meeting with the Kraken (a giant sea squid under the control of Davy Jones). Everyone has lost some part of their hopes, or has betrayed each other at this point and even Davy Jones is under the control of the East India Trading Company. <br/><br/>This is perhaps the only movie where I really criticize the direction in the whole pirates film series. It is such a departure from the previous film, that perhaps it's even stranger than the following movie 'On Stranger Tides'. I thought that although there has always been a sense of the mystic in the Pirates movies, this one get's really abstract and convoluted. I understand that perhaps Gore Verbinsky, was trying to wrap up the original trilogy in this entry, but the writing and characterization really gets lost along the way. Johnny Depp changed the most, not physically mind you, but he really portrays Jack as an insane man. I'm not entirely sure why he's so nuts in this one, I but I think it takes away from the charm that is Captain Jack Sparrow. Other characters have become somewhat dulled, especially Orlando Bloom ask Will. He doesn't seem that interested in what's going on around him, even as he interacts with different people throughout the film, he and Keira Knightly seemed a little lackluster. Bill Nighy remains my favourite character in the series, and really excels as a somewhat deterred yet still delightfully aggressive Davy Jones. <br/><br/>The real shame is the plot, as there are a couple of really big plot holes, especially when it comes to the use of Calypso. I thought that there was a reason she was there in the final battle, and that the pirates had a trump card up their sleeve, but she really didn't serve much of a purpose. In the end she was almost a non-event. If she was always this powerful, why didn't they just use her from the start? Perhaps that simpler idea is what they wanted to avoid, to push the plot along for almost 3 hours, which makes this movie the longest entry in the series. <br/><br/>Overall it's not a bad ending to the original trilogy of films, but definitely the most perplexing and complicated of the series. <br/><br/>6/10"

","Pirates Three opens up with a much darker atmosphere by hanging men, women, and children. Yes this film with in the first five minutes kills women and children. The color correction is murky, green, and dreary. A fantastic, emotional, heart drenching opening shot on par with Shindlers list. Then the story goes down hill soon after. With a million plot lines, confusing dialogue, plot holes, characters triple crossing each other it is as if the Director had a bad case of ADD when filming this. Granted the cinematography is great, and the special effects a superb, but the story is just so atrocious its mind bending. Absolutely nothing makes sense in this story. The film is also way to long, you would think with this ADD direction and writing we would be entertained... But no. It's just a bunch of beautifully shot scenes of nonsense. If it wasn't for the exceptionally well camera work and visual effects department this movie would have gotten a solid one from me."
"GeorgeRoots","5","0","0","21 August 2014"," This Third Outing Isn't Sea Worthy, Arghh!
","Both ""Dead Man's Chest"" (2006), and ""At World's End"" were both shot back to back. With the final outing costing $300 million, you'd expect with a budget that large they were going to go out with a bang and they truly do (Or so we thought). A truly good looking film at least, but it's nothing different than the second one and nothing really engaged me anymore in this series (Though the trailers and marketing were pretty fantastic).<br/><br/>Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley), a resurrected Hector Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) and the remaining crew of the Black Pearl, plan to rescue Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) from Davy Jones' Locker. From there on, all pirates are beckoned to prepare and fight the East India Trading Company and Davy Jones (Bill Nighy), who plans to extinguish piracy forever.<br/><br/>Chow Yun-fat makes his first appearance in the series, one of my favourite Honk Kong actors and his addition was absolutely pointless. Imagine my disappointment in a franchise that is particularly built on eccentric performers, and they under use him when he generally did pretty well with the material on screen.<br/><br/>Apart from that, nothing new is brought into the film. I seriously couldn't care anymore about the characters, the scenarios, bad writing etc. As time went by the movies became visual rollercoasters, but to be fair that's really the only direction they could take them in. Yes, I could want more from it, and most of the finale entries in trilogies nowadays can be a lot worse. It did pretty well in finishing what it started, but it was one of the first times I remember coming out the theatre and all of us feeling underwhelmed.<br/><br/>Final Verdict: Worth checking out if you're curious to see the finale, but nothing really special either. 5/10. It was good while it lasted, until they made a fourth one."

"C22Man","3","0","0","8 February 2014"," I wanted to like it, but the film falls off the map
","There are certain films that you really want to like because of anticipation and expectation, but the overall delivery leaves you feeling very disappointed. The third film in the Pirates of the Caribbean saga is one of those films for me. I think they tried too hard to change something that wasn't broken by trying to make the film into a colossal epic instead of letting it be an enjoyable swashbuckler.<br/><br/>The story follows on from the last film as Will, Elizabeth and Barbossa sail to the edge of the world in order to save Jack Sparrow from Davy Jones' locker. But the sinister Cutler Beckett has control of Jones' heart and with it he aims to control the seas as well as put an end to piracy. This leads to the nine pirate lords, Jack included, having to use the mysterious Calypso to make a stand against Beckett and Jones which leads to a lot of inner conflicts. That is just the outline of the plot, so as you can tell that is a lot going on and that is the stories biggest fault. Far too much is going on here. The story becomes needlessly complex to the point where you can't follow it and therefore you no longer care about what is going to happen. Plus the horribly bloated running time does nothing in the way of creating a more coherent narrative.<br/><br/>As noted the main problem with the film is that it is excessive in every area and it is clear that the writers have forgotten what made the other two movies so entertaining. The film just feels really bloated, it is almost three hours long and boy does it feel it. Instead of using this time to develop the story, it just adds more into the already too complex mix and keeps on bringing more conflict that adds nothing to the film. By the middle of the film it is almost impossible to know how the characters are feeling or what they're motivations are.<br/><br/>Even the characters are not as good as before. Johnny Depp is still amusing and enjoyable as Jack Sparrow, putting plenty of energy into the role and delivering some really funny lines. The problem is that there is a little too much Jack here. At times it is like the writers only really cared about Jack and therefore there are lots of scenes concentrating on him doing nothing in particular, such as when he is the locker. As I've said before Keira Knightly and Orlando Bloom do nothing for me, sure they look the part but their acting is bland and not engaging enough. Geoffrey Rush makes a welcome return as the surly Barbossa and he gets a few good moments. Tom Hollander is still nicely slimy as Beckett and Bill Nighy carries on forming Jones into a complex character. Sadly Chow Yun-fat and Jack Davenport are wasted by being giving almost nothing to do, whilst the crew don't have as many comic moments to shine as they have before.<br/><br/>The films attempts at changing tone also fall flat on its face. I mean the first two films had dark elements but they still had lots of fun and felt somewhat grounded, but At World's End tries to go way too dark or strange at times and it just feels misplaced. Being the film with a child being hung doesn't fit into this world at all. It just feels like the film is trying to copy of others by becoming this serious epic. As said it is too 'out there' for its own good sometimes. When there are multiple Jack's running around in the locker, all the stuff with crabs moving ships and a sea version of Jack licking a brain, what on earth is this? It's clear that the film is trying way too hard to be taken seriously, forgetting that the fun tone make the previous features.<br/><br/>The jokes when used are tired too. There's only so many jokes that you can build around Rum before they become stale. The 'tension' is back between Jack and Elizabeth, the problem being that it has been done to death and is about as amusing as standing on a plug. The dialogue is no longer witty and well-paced, I can't really recall any funny lines presented here. Going back, the characters motivations are all over the place. Jack just seems to be here for the ride, Elizabeth is jumping between a dozen men and Will just wants to stab everyone in the back, there is no lead here that we can really get behind. The two most likable people were the villains from the first film, which kind of says it all.<br/><br/>Was there anything good here? Well yes. The visuals are stunning at times, the locker especially looks amazing and the seas are as wonderfully vast as ever. But given this is the most expensive movie ever that is a given. Plus when the film stops its muddled plot, the action is fantastic. It has everything, great swordfights, intense sea battles and the climax itself looks incredible as well as having some really good action set-pieces. But these pieces cannot save the mess created, only make you wish the other parts were as good.<br/><br/>So At World's End really comes across as a massive let-down. The story is so muddled that it is virtually impossible to follow and there are so many turns that by the end of the film I couldn't have cared less over what was going on. The film is certainly wasted potential, instead of concluding in true enjoyable style we are left with a muddled mess of a film, where even its positives are massively clouded by all the problems it has."

","I'm glad I'm not the only one who found this 3rd entry both slightly confusing (plot wise) and I also felt that at close to 3 hours long it was also far too drawn out.<br/><br/>What made the first 2 films good was that they were both fun and the plots were both straight forward. Now I've got nothing against complex plots, but the main problem with this film was that there were far too many characters that were introduced. Also the way that the characters constantly flitted from crew to crew and the numerous times that they all seemed to double cross each other made it very difficult at times to follow what was going on.<br/><br/>As mentioned above, there were many scenes that were far too drawn out (Sparrow with all the crabs on the island springs to mind as one example). The battle scene towards the end also went on a bit long (although at least these sequences were exciting). Sparrow's hallucinations where he sees multiple Jack Sparrows was funny and refreshing at first, but these hallucinations were shown far too often and became less and less funny on each viewing.<br/><br/>This isn't a bad film and I was pleased that we saw the return of Captain Barbossa as I think he's an awesome character and both him and Sparrow played off well against each other. Once again , Rush and Depp were both excellent in their respective roles. There was also plenty of humour once again (some of it admittedly was recycled from the first 2 films, but there were other parts of the film that brought new laughs along the way). The visuals were also fantastic (arguably better than the visuals in the first 2 films) If you were a fan of the first 2 films then you'll enjoy this entry in the franchise. Even though the plot is more complex in this film, there is still just as much humour to make this an enjoyable watch (you'll be laughing and scratching your head at the same time). I only wish that the writers had stuck to their roots and kept things simple. If it ain't broke, don't fix it....."

The series we all loved and hoped for greatness turns out to be the worst? Yes, yes indeed. I knew Disney wouldn't let the streak of good films last too long... The trilogy's third installment shows how something that could have been great, failed to meet expectations. First off, I'm not calling this a horrible film; it's far from it. It still has its moments where it could've shined as a great film. But from the over-complex, silly plot to the excessive flaws I had thought otherwise. The film started off great, with so many things to foreshadow that this'll be amazing. But by the middle, your asking yourself why they decided to over-complicate everything? Why they didn't notice that everything got a little too over the top? I wished they had killed of Jack Sparrow. Although being the best character and NOT WANTING him to die, the whole 'afterlife' sequence began to get stupid. Whereas all of these things point out the flaws, we proceed to what made this film great. And that's everything other than that. Han Zimmer's is a genius, the battle scene was epic, and the trilogy proved to be Disney's best. Whereas not really wanting to hate the film, and whereas avoiding to love it; I've come to mixed conclusions. This could be the best but could also be the worst. Despite the flaws, I'm hungry for more Pirates! And although the new film isn't directed by Gore, we become even more hungry hoping for it to be amazing. This film gets no stars. Not for being so bad and not for being so good. The film is confusing to rate. At World's End is amazing and bad at the same time. Confused? Great. 5/10."

","""At World's End"" or ""At Wit's End,"" whatever you want to call it, the third installment in Disney's theme-park-ride-turned-mega-movie-franchise has lost steam thanks to the poor choice to make two sequels narratively dependent on one another. ""At World's End"" benefits from being the destination and not the bridge that was ""Dead Man's Chest,"" but both films have too many sub-plots and arcs connecting them. The flavor and fun of the characters and acting simply cannot keep up with how quickly the story expands the ""Pirates"" world.<br/><br/>It takes a good half an hour to understand at all what's going on if you're not familiar with the events of ""Dead Man's Chest."" Jack Sparrow (Depp) is ""dead,"" stuck in Davy Jones' Locker lest he and his beloved Black Pearl be retrieved by friends Will Turner (Bloom), Elizabeth Swann (Knightley) and Captain Barbossa (Rush), who makes a triumphant return back from the dead himself. The film's first main sequence takes place in Singapore with Swann and Barbossa trying to enlist the help of Sao Feng (Chow Yun-Fat) to man a crew to find Jack.<br/><br/>But that's not even the half of it. Lord Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander) has made a pact with Davy Jones (Bill Nighy) and crew of The Flying Dutchman to track down Sparrow and eradicate all pirates period. Will also has his own plans, to get the Pearl for himself so he can free his father, Bootstraps Bill Turner (Stellan Skarsgaard) from the Dutchman.<br/><br/>I'm skipping a few sub-plots, but you should get the gist of it by now: too much going on, too many scenes of dialogue involving one character making a deal with another only to break it later in the film. It's almost impossible to catch up, but you can just as easily focus on the caricatures and determine for yourself who's mean and who's likable. All the cast members add something unique, although the relationship between Will and Elizabeth grows weaker seeing as their characters have become so run-of-the-mill. Will's darker side intrigues a bit throughout, but bottom line is that Jack Sparrow doesn't get enough of a spotlight. He's merely one on a list of a dozen characters who get special attention. Whereas the original film had two clear sides, this film has four or five.<br/><br/>Sure, the teasing of the greater pirate world out there excites one's imagination a bit. When the pirate brethren come together for their meeting in Shipwreck Cove, we see pirates from all over the world and all the fun the costume and make up departments got to have. The extensive lore that writers Ted Elliot and Terry Rossio developed begins to take more shape and you start to think that a prequel showing the early pirate years would be a cool thing to see. Then you realize they're talking too much again and they should just fight if that's what they say they're going to do.<br/><br/>Upping the stakes in a sequel to bring the world that has been created and embraced by a global audience to such a large scale does seem exciting, but boiled down, ""At World's End"" could be called a gigantic mess as much as it could be labeled an expansive epic. There's plenty of adventure to be had and some fun, memorable scenes, but these sequels don't take you on a journey in the emotional sense like the first one did. <br/><br/>In terms of characters, that's what keeps the quality of these films higher than average. Captain Jack Sparrow is one of those once-in-blue-moon heroes that simply never gets old. Depp continues to be terrific, even though he's subservient to the plot here. Barbossa was a welcome return because Rush handles him so perfectly. Even Nighy, behind all the make up and CGI tentacles, turns Davy Jones into a character we'd like to really know more about.<br/><br/>It all really comes down to the mistake of creating back-to-back films with a common thread and feeling this need to flesh out all elements of the film and all characters with sub-plots and back stories and such. It's blender filmmaking. Gore Verbinski probably had a lot of fun with ""At World's End,"" but it turns out to be a super-sized macro version of the original concept rather than another skillfully crafted story set in the same universe.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Visit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com"
"mnpollio","6","0","0","28 December 2010"," Scattershot story elevated by Depp
","It is hard to understand what producers/writers were thinking with some of the developments in the latest entry in this series. Although the story does not seem as ""busy"" as the last film, the action is still all over the map and truly hit or miss. The charm and fun of the original is nearly missing this time around. Characters are dispatched with nary a thought - including some underage characters - that casts a pall over the entire production. It takes a good while for the heroes - now led by the revived Barbossa - to travel to the netherworld to rescue Captain Jack Sparrow from ""hell"" and return to challenge nemesis Davy Jones (an unrecognizable Bill Nighy in impressive squid make-up) and snide government stooge Tom Hollander for a final battle. Despite showing up late, Depp carries the film relentlessly forwards by still making Captain Jack a character that one simply MUST watch. Geoffrey Rush's return as Barbossa is more than welcome and provides a nice counterbalance to Depp. Supporting cast members are not served nearly as well as in the previous films with Jonathan Pryce, Jack Davenport, Naomie Harris, etc., getting particular short shrift. Keira Knighley's role gets magnified to outrageous proportions with each successive film - she has fairly usurped much of what could have been Orlando Bloom's role. It isn't that she is bad, but that Elizabeth Swann never seems to have the ""heart"" that Will Turner brought as a central character. If Knightley is overused, then conversely Bloom should sue - because his role has become so inconsequential and ill-conceived. The film really loses something by shifting so much focus away from him. Bloom is sorely misused here. The final moments can complimentary be described as chaotic - definitely for fans of sound and fury over content and charm. While it is great to imagine that the antagonistic relationship between Sparrow and Barbossa will continue, virtually no one will be pleased with how writers have chosen to conclude the fate of Will Turner or his relationship with Elizabeth Swann. And what is with these film's penchant for having characters uncharacteristically betray each other at the drop of a hat? It does nothing but distance them from the audience."

","Jack Sparrow's old crew, searching for their missing Captain, travel to Singapore to find a secret passage to World's End. Meanwhile, the East India Trading Company is plotting a fiendish scheme to rid the world of pirates forever. Will our heroes find Jack, and keep the seas free for honourable cut-throats and mercenaries ?<br/><br/>The third Pirates Of The Caribbean movie is perhaps a bit stodgy compared to the other two, but is still rollicking good fun. It picks up where Dead Man's Chest left off, as our heroes rescue Jack from the doldrums of Davy Jones Locker, but then meanders into a complicated series of double-crosses as the Pirate Brethren unite to fight the combined forces of the British Armada and The Flying Dutchman. It starts well, introducing a new player, Singapore buccaneer Sao Feng, and sails through some amazing ice vistas to find Jack gone mad (more than usual) with isolation and seeing visions of himself. It gets a bit bogged down in the middle with confusing moments (Pryce's death is never seen but his afterlife is) and an over-reliance on Elizabeth's character, but then perks up for a fantastic rain-soaked battle royal finale complete with Jack and Davy Jones fighting atop a mast in the grand Peter Pan style. As before, Verbinski's direction, Rich Heinrichs' eye-popping production design and the visual effects by John Knoll and Roger Guyett are all fantastic, with almost every scene a visual treat to savour. The cast still all seem to be having a fine time (it was shot back to back with its predecessor), with Depp as nutty as ever (""Res ispa loquitur tabula in naufragio !""), Knightley and Bloom trying to be heroic, Rush relishing his return, a scar-faced Chow enlivening the first half, and Nighy and Stellan Skarsgård both getting to play one scene without their hideous makeup. There's also an unmissable cameo by Rolling Stones legend Keith Richards as Captain Teague, the Keeper of the Pirate Code (and Jack's Dad). All in all it's great stuff, but it does go on a bit too long, with a few too many story threads, not quite enough of Jack falling over, and not as much of a sense of fun as the previous two movies. That said though, any film with a scene where someone says, ""Nobody move - I've dropped me brain."", cannot be missed."

","The first Pirates of the Caribbean film, The Curse of the Black Pearl, was a great bit of fun. It was a pirate film, pretty rare at that time, and it had a bit of everything enjoyable in it: romance, humor, great characters (except, oddly enough, for the two romantic leads), and a few chills. It was a fun watch, and deservedly a huge hit.<br/><br/>The second film, Dead Man's Chest, was still pretty cool. The Davy Jones subplot brought a lot more story to the film, which weighed it down a bit, but overall it was still a fun watch. The humor was certainly still there, and Johnny Depp continued to shine as Jack Sparrow. Plus, there were some very memorable scenes and visuals, like the fishy crew of the Flying Dutchman.<br/><br/>This review, though, is about the third film, At World's End. The third film in a trilogy has the major task of bringing closure to the story lines that have been introduced throughout the series while still leaving open the possibility for another film in case the filmmakers decide to go for a quadrilogy. Sadly, it is my belief that At World's End did not do this in a satisfactory way.<br/><br/>It may have been due to the fact that I hadn't seen Dead Man's Chest in a couple years and kind of lost the story. It may have been because I was watching it on TV, where it was frequently interrupted by commercials and possibly edited down for time. However, to me, it seemed that At World's End was kind of a messy film. By this point, there was soooo much story that the whole endeavor seemed to have been weighed down with the effort of dealing with so many plot lines. To me, it seemed that this was a failed attempt to bring an epic scope to the Pirates of the Caribbean series. Instead of feeling grand, it just got really muddled.<br/><br/>This is mostly due to the many dealings with the politics of the pirate world. Trades and alliances and power struggles...this was touched on in the first film, but it never got in the way of the main story. Here, it felt like these elements of the story took up too much time, and they definitely dragged the film down.<br/><br/>Even with those elements aside, we still had so much to juggle: Davy Jones/the Flying Dutchman; Bootstrap Bill and Will; Elizabeth's ascension through the ranks of piracy; Calypso's release; the various anti-pirate Englishmen whose names I now fail to remember...I'm all for complex, rich films, but by the end of this one, my brain hurt pretty badly. These elements were all thrown at us hard and fast, which made the film pretty messy in the end.<br/><br/>On the positive side, the special effects were still wonderful. Also, there were some pretty cool fight scenes, which helped to keep the film from completely becoming bogged down in itself. By the same token, the wedding of Will and Elizabeth was pretty cool, though, according to the final scene, it appears that their married life won't quite be what they were expecting...<br/><br/>On the whole, though, this convoluted film was the weakest of the entire Pirates series. And, help us all, they're making a fourth one...I think I'm all pirated out now."

","This movie was absolutely dreadful. I, like many others, thought that the series should have ended with The Curse of the Black Pearl. However, since Dead Man's Chest was made, everyone was looking forward to a great conclusion. Unfortunately, it seems that everyone who dies can be easily brought back to life; all that has to be done is use magic, or perhaps sail to the end of the world.<br/><br/>First of all, I think every scene without either Lord Cutler Beckett or James Norrington was garbage. Jack was old, I never liked Will Turner, and Elizabeth was getting old. Singapore was utterly pointless, as was Sao Feng. Death seemed pointless, because, Barbossa was brought back to life, Jack Sparrow was brought back to life, and to my overwhelming horror and disgust, Will Turner was brought back to life.<br/><br/>One character that didn't get ""old"" was the tragic hero James Norrington. A man who sacrificed everything for the woman he loved; the woman who scorned him, and ultimately caused his death. Commodore Norrington had everything, until he decided to be merciful and let Sparrow escape at the end of Curse of the Black Pearl. He did redeem himself by joining another of the most interesting characters ever written; Cutler Beckett. A man who worked ceaselessly to weed out the lawless, barbaric pirates.<br/><br/>Remember, these pirates rape, pillage, kidnap, steal, and murder. Lord Beckett was doing the people of the Caribbean a favor by hanging all of that scum. I personally view the ""protagonists"" of the trilogy as enemies. James Norrington did the right thing by joining Beckett. However, he was once again manipulated by Elizabeth Swann, and killed shortly afterward by one of my least favorite characters; Will Turner's father.<br/><br/>The reason I wish for this movie to have never been made is because it was much too complicated, and they killed off 3 characters who were important to the story, and cast them aside like old playthings. James Norrington, the Kraken, and Governor Swann. Since so many characters were brought back from the dead, I would expect Norrington to have also.<br/><br/>The only things I like about this film are Cutler Beckett moments, James Norrington's death (because of Zimmer's beautiful score) and Beckett's death (also because of the score). That is ironic, since those two are my favorite characters, and, needless to say, the most interesting.<br/><br/>The last thing I have to say about this dreadful, recycled movie, is that funniest, most ironic thing happens to Will Turner; he gets stabbed and killed by Norrington's sword. So, through Davy Jones, Norrington gets his revenge. But, alas, like I said, it was short lived, as was the movie."
"classicalsteve","6","0","0","2 November 2009"," Entertaining but collapses under its own weight: too many plots, sub-plots, characters, and over-long action sequences make it rather incomprehensible
","This final installment of the ""Pirates of the Caribean"" film series suffers from the same ailment as the last ""Ocean's 13"" movie: too many sub-plots, too many characters, too many ships, and too many long action sequences. During the entire film, I kept getting confused regarding which ship I was in, which character was dealing with which problem, and how Captain Jack Sparrow fits into the whole bloody thing. The first film was at least relatively tight in terms of its focus on Davy Jones and his ship of un-dead in the ""Black Pearl"". However, these later installments added so many ingredients into the stew that it was hard to figure out what the main course was.<br/><br/>The film begins with a bunch of poor sods being systematically executed by the baddie of the film, Lord Cutler Beckett. OK, fair enough. This story will be how these people are somehow avenged by the pirates, although I wasn't exactly clear who these people were or why they were being executed. (Maybe I'd forgotten from the second movie?) But then the film moves to Singapore. Apparently, Bootstrap Bill wants to solicit the help of an Asian pirate head-honcho played by Yun Fat-Chow who has some extra-special navigating maps. Out of nowhere, Orlando Bloom appears, apparently a prisoner of Fat-Chow. How did he get there? I guess I forgot what happened to him in the second movie. As the negotiations for the maps and Bloom are heating up, a bunch of European red coats appear out of nowhere and start shooting everything in sight, apparently at the orders of Lord Cutler Beckett. Exactly how they got there, why they were, there and what they were trying to accomplish eludes me, except we are supposed to know that riflemen with wigs in red coats are the baddies and do Lord Cutler Beckett's bidding.<br/><br/>The film then becomes an almost-incoherent collage of interconnected episodes. Certainly, I didn't know where the film was going but I was equally unclear as to the goals/objectives of the characters at many times. Davy Jones and his band of un-dead crew are still sailing around the world but I wasn't sure how they now fit into everything. They were now on the ship ""The Flying Dutchman"". (In sea lore, the Flying Dutchman is not a ship, it's a person, a ghost trying to redeem himself who is condemned to wander on the high seas.) The good guys were now on the Black Pearl. They end up in Davy Jones' locker, literally the place for the dead who died at sea, to save Jack Sparrow. Then there's the character of Tia Dalma, aka Calypso, who gave Jack Sparrow the compass that will point toward anything that a person desires. I guess I had forgotten what Calypso wants out of all this. Maybe I should have taken notes during the second movie. And then we also allude to Orlando Bloom's father, Turner, who is a member of Davy Jones' crew of the un-dead. Now, how does this fit into everything? <br/><br/>Finally, the crew arrives at the Pirate's Cove where they meet the council of pirates. Again, I wasn't sure what the objective was, but somehow it works out that the pirates agree to fight against Lord Beckett. So now, added to the mix are pirates from every corner of the earth: France, India, China, you name it. If there were some Eskimo pirates, I wouldn't be surprised. At some point, Lord Beckett is out on the high seas with an armada of ships. Why he was going out wasn't exactly clear to me except I guess to fight the pirates. And why is it in his best interest to fight the pirates personally? So the movie has a baddie? <br/><br/>And of course, Captain Jack Sparrow is a part of everything but what that everything is is still a little blurry. Certainly, Sparrow is the most enjoyable character, and Johnny Depp plays him incredibly well, but I was unclear how Sparrow now fits into the story which really centers on Bloom and his love interest Elizabeth Swann, which are getting a little bit side-tracked by all the other stuff. Sparrow seems more about comic relief than an integral part of the conflict. But no question, his scenes are the best, particularly when he is by himself in Davy Jones' locker.<br/><br/>Still, there are enough enjoyable scenes to make the experience fun entertainment but there was so much going on I couldn't make out the point of the film. And the action sequences only lasted about an hour each. I may have to go back and watch some of the second movie to remind myself of some of the things I was supposed to know coming into the third. Is it really worth all that trouble? Still the best story about pirates is Robert Louis Stevenson's ""Treasure Island"" which took place at only three places: a tavern, a ship and an island. Limiting the scope actually reinforces the adage that less is often more. One pirate ship is quite scary. One hundred of them are kind of ridiculous."

","I admit up front, ""Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End"" isn't my kind of thing. Had it not been of the presence of Johnny Depp, I would never have seen it.<br/><br/>Having said that, it's a rousing adventure with lots of action, special effects, and Depp. After Elizabeth, Will, and Captain Barbossa rescue Captain Jack Sparrow from the the land of the dead, they must face Davy Jones and Lord Cutler Beckett. Beckett, now with control of Jones' heart, forms an alliance with Jones so that he can take over the seas and destroy the Pirates. Jack, Will, Elizabeth, Tia Dalma, and crew summon the Pirate Lords from around the world. They want to release the goddess Calypso, Davy Jones's lover, from the trap they put her in; to do that, they have to combine the 9 sovereigns that will set her free so that she can help them fight. <br/><br/>Depp and the rest of the cast are terrific - Geoffrey Rush, Orlando Bloom, Keira Knightley, Jonathan Pryce, etc. Keith Richards, Depp's inspiration for his characterization of Jack Sparrow, makes a brief appearance as Jack's father - he apparently was so drunk he needed to be propped up.<br/><br/>Though this is a fabulous-looking movie, I doubt without the Depp characterization of Jack Sparrow that there would have been subsequent Pirates films. He is outrageous and fabulous with brilliant comic timing."
"whatever_123","6","0","0","3 October 2009"," Still a huge fan of Pirates, despite this display of weirdness
","This movie starts out with a huge line of pirates waiting to be hanged by the British for no other reason than just being pirates. The camera focuses on a little boy pirate with a coin in his hands. As he's brought up to the gallows, he starts singing. Then all the pirates start singing. Then the British are like ""What the..."" Then the movie switches to Elizabeth in a canoe on a river in who-knows-where singing that same song. Then she and Barbossa, who was brought back to life, start talking to this guy. Finally you find out they're in Singapore, but you don't really know why. Then there's a really fun cool action sequence that makes you forget your confusion.<br/><br/>Much later, the screen goes black and you hear voices, gunshots, and yelling pirates. Then the screen goes white, and you see a nose. The nose is sniffing around for a while and then comes to a peanut. Right about now you actually think you had gone into the wrong movie, until you see that it was Jack Sparrow's nose. Then there's a long scene of multiple Jack Sparrows for some reason, then they all fade, when you realize the real Jack was just hallucinating. Then it shows his ship, which is in the middle of absolutely nowhere, then a bunch of rocks appear that turn into crabs. WHAT???? <br/><br/>The part that made me most upset, in this movie was the dying romance between Will and Elizabeth. Why did they fall apart? There was no reason for it.<br/><br/>The most confusing part of the plot was the whole thing about Calypso, the sea goddess, who turned out to be that Jamaican lady who's name I never really got. At this part, all the pirates want to release her from her ""human bonds"". So they do that, and she grows to gargantuan size. They all bow to her, then she starts yelling. Only, it sounds more like King Kong bellowing in Japanese than a person yelling. Then, she explodes into a million little crabs. WHAT???? <br/><br/>Of course, Jack still provided funny moments, and the action was amazing. Don't listen to those losers who say the action scene at the end was too long, because it was really cool and exciting and I was actually sorry it was over.<br/><br/>I hated what happened to Will at the end. NOT COOL, Disney!!!! I won't give away what happened, but just know it's not fair.<br/><br/>I still can't wait for the fourth movie (and yes, they are making a fourth) and I still like this movie, but I HOPE AND PRAY they will not make as many mistakes as they did in this movie. This movie is good, but it's not amazing. I still like it, but I am still confused.<br/><br/>Disney, come on. Get some writers who know how to write and directors who know what a truly incredible movie is."

","The biggest problem with this movie is that there's just too much of everything. Too many characters, too many subplots, too many twists in the main plot, too many Jack Sparrows, too many old jokes, it's overly long etc etc. You'd think that after watching a 3 hour film you'd be able to recall the names of all the main characters, but no. They have like 50 people in speaking roles and hundreds of others just standing there doing nothing useful. You'd have to watch this film at least five times before understanding what the heck is going on.<br/><br/>There was something good too.

","Pirates of the Caribbean has be a very successful franchise, making Disney millions from the films, computer games, the theme park ride and other related projects. After the success of Curse of the Black Pearl Disney were quick to commission 2 sequels to be shot back-to-back, similar to what happened with the Matrix, and like to the Matrix and many of films from the summer of threequels, the third instalment fails.<br/><br/>At World's End starts Lord Beckett (Tom Hollander) has taken control of the Caribbean, suspended the rights of the people and killed on mass people who were linked to piracy, including children in a dark opening scene. Lord Beckett had control of Davy Jones'(Bill Nighy) heart and thereby had control of the Flying Dutchman. Beckett uses Jones to hunt down as many pirates as their can. Elizabeth (Keira Knightley), Will (Orlando Bloom) and Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) seek assistance from Sao Feng (Chow Yun-Fat), a Chinese Pirate from Singapore. They need him because they need to free Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) from the Davy Jones' locker, seeing he died in the last film. Barbossa is also calling the Brethren Court of pirates, which include himself, Sao Feng and Jack Sparrow and have to discuss their last stand against the East India Company. The adventure takes out heroes to the Artic, the Caribbean, Singapore (despite the fact Singapore was no more then a fishing village until the British took over in 1819) and Davy Jones' Locker which is basically land of the dead. And seeing that they are all pirates everyone double crosses everyone else, with Will making deals with the East India Company, the East India Company makes deal with Sao Fung and Jack, etc... Subplots are also involved with this film, with Davy Jones' and Calypso's (Naomie Harris) love and heartbreak for each other, Jones' and Beckett's rivalry, Will need to marry Elizabeth and save his father and Jack wanting to kill Davy Jones so he could take over the Flying Dutchman.<br/><br/>The plot is incompehenable, over-cooked and over-long. It makes no real scene and the whole point of a film like this is it should be fairly simple and just be fun. There is too much fat to the story that isn't needed.Pirates of the Caribbean is meant to be family film but with a running time of needly 3 hours, it is way too long. When I went to the cinema to see it their was even an intermission which hasn't happened since the days of great epics like Ben-Hur, Spactacus, Lawerence of Arabia and Barry Lyndon. With films the first and most important thing is a strong screenplay, a strong story. Without that it doesn't matter if the best director and best actors are involved. When At World's End started without a finished script which is a warning sign. Even if a film had re-writes whilst it was filming, the basics of the story should be there. The film was a mess. The film also has some dark scenes, like the hanging scene and a violence death. I have nothing against dark theme in films but it needs to be done right. First most of the film is too light-hearted and suffers from the same problem that I had with Robin Hood Prince of Thieves which was the filmmakers didn't know which way to go. Secondly is Pirates is meant to be family film and needs to do dark themes just right. Dead Man's Chest was criticised for being racist towards native tribes in the Caribbean. However, I thought the film was very racist towards Chinese and Indians, especially the Chinese, with male characters looking like drawings from the late 19th Century of the 'yellow peril'. There had horrible teeth, tattoos, thin goatees and long claw like nails. The film had to be cut by ten minutes in China because of this and personally I don't blame them. The Indian pirates were also portrayed in a stereotypical way, but their role was minor.<br/><br/>At World's End also makes out that pirates were really freedom and even in a way pseudo-Marxists, fighting for their freedom against the evil multi-national of the East India Company. This from Disney which is a massive multi-national with business interests in films, TV, toys, theme parks and so many other things and Jerry Bruikheimer who is a Republican supporter.<br/><br/>Now to the acting. Johnny Depp was good, he enjoys the role of Jack Sparrow and allows him to let his hair down. Geoffrey Rush was over-acting and he seem to be enjoying himself and I don't blame him. Chow Yun-Fat obviously did the film for the paid-cheque and the chance to be in a Hollywood film, not because he thought the material was good. He was not in the film for very long anyway. Naomie Harris offered a weird performance but at its good to see her trying to break into Hollywood. Bill Nighy was very good and is the best performance in the film. I personally thought that Tom Hollander lacked the menace to be the villain and Bill Nighy should have retaited the role within the film. Finally Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom were too wooden and unbelievable. Keira becomes the leader of the pirates but would you honestly believe that with her Braveheart style speech. But at least Keira is easy on the eye.<br/><br/>The Special Effects and action are well done, the computer graphics people will not struggle to find work and action is Gore Verbinski and Jerry Bruckheimer do best. That part of the film was entertaining, especially the final battle scene.<br/><br/>The music by Hans Zimmer was brilliant and his score is a trademark of the film. Zimmer is one of the best music men in the business.<br/><br/>This film isn't worth knocking yourself out for. A fourth film is one the way and Gore Verbinski has announced that he wouldn't be directing, so I would except too much."

","It's a shame to see that a franchise with the potential of ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" has fallen so low. ""The Curse of the Black Pearl"" was a breath of fresh air, at least in what comes to blockbusters. Yes, it had the big special effects, the two lovers and all the clichés this kind of film offers, but it brought the pirates and the good old-fashioned adventure flicks. Although the second film was already a bit of a disappointment, it still had some of the spirit of the first and, at least it had its funny and entertaining moments and the end left some eager for more. But then came ""At World's End""... Let's face it, Johnny Depp's performance as Jack Sparrow played a huge part on the films' success and he doesn't appear until about we're 30 minutes into the film. I don't mean to diminish the other actors' work, but during that time we see some of the worst moments of the three films. When Jack Sparrow finally appears, he makes his worst entry ever. The multiple Jacks don't make up for his absence at all and are just plain silly and boring, not funny in any way. Then, the film continues to get worse. Starting with the storyline. There's too much to be revealed and too many characters which makes for too many camera swifts and very confusing scenes. Some of the acting is unbearable, and most of these unbearable moments come from Orlando Bloom. He was never good in any of his previous films, but, on this one particularly, I just wanted somebody to kill Will Turer. He's by far the worst actor of ""Pirates"" and got a well deserved nomination for the Razzies. Unfortunately he's not alone. One of the things that made me hate the film, was the wasted talent. Bill Nighy is a great actor, but gave a very poor performance here, as well as Geoffrey Rush (which was surprising since he was great in the first) and Keira Knightley. But not everything is bad on this third film. Visually, it astonishing. The make-up is very impressive, specially Davy Jones and his crew. The special effects make some very epic scenes. Keith Richards was also a very pleasant surprise. Nevertheless, ""At Worl's End"" made enough money to let us guess that there will be more Pirates in the future, which shouldn't happen. I would hate to see them ruining it more than they already did."

The most beloved character, Jack Sparrow did not show up until the end of the first hour into the movie, and the scene of his first appearance was the best, the funniest, and sadly, the only scene in the movie that I liked. It showed Jack Sparrow trapped on the sea of sand in Davy Jones' Locker as the captain and the multiple members of the crew. The scene brought to memory the famous sequence from Being John Malcovich and it was the highest point of the movie. After that, Jack was moved to the periphery of the plot which was so incoherent that the film creators actually came up with the list of FAQ that baffled moviegoers had about the total mess of the final installment in the pirate trilogy. The list was included with the DVD. The original idea to make a movie based on the popular Walt Disney theme park ride proved to be great for two first movies that are funny and entertaining. The idea to create a philosophical-metaphysical-mythological epilogue to the series in the traditions of Lord of the Rings turned to be disastrous. The movie failed flat in all directions. I was either bored or laughed at the scenes that were not meant to be unintentionally funny. Even appearance of Keith Richards, Johnny Depp's inspiration for the role of Jack Sparrow, as Jack's father did not help much. First two films were exiting, had stunning special effects and awesome achievements in make up. The films breeze freely and move along with great pace. I liked the second movie very much because the way its creators prepared us for the third film was very clever. The final chapter, sadly, was ambitious ponderous mess."

","Then this was it. I enjoyed the first film in this series, and found it quite refreshing. It gave an excellent insight into the pirating world and the performances were excellent. The second one was when it all started to go downhill, and I didn't bother to see the third one until some of my friends rented it on DVD.<br/><br/>Firstly, I felt that the film seemed to be completely crammed with pointless story lines..what was with the goddess? For a good hour or so I was sat, wondering what was going to be made of the whole goddess thing, and I was so disappointed when she exploded into crabs. How much did it cost in visual effects? Because it wasn't worth it and it didn't make much sense to me. Even Jack Sparrow was becoming slightly repetitive, it was as if the writers thought ""hmmm, people like Jack, so lets recycle the last two film's of Jack!""<br/><br/>As the film continued I just felt bored and uninterested, but I did have a nice night in with my friends, so yeah.<br/><br/>I have given this film 3/10 because the acting wasn't too bad, the visual effects were good and i didn't have an awful night..so yes.

","The first ""Pirates"" was an excellent movie. A near-perfect adventure film. The second was a bit heavy on special effects, but still enjoyable and memorable. Along comes ""At World's End"" and it seems things have gone downhill rapidly. Here are the reasons to avoid this film:<br/><br/>OVERUSE OF SPECIAL EFFECTS: Too many scenes say, ""Hey, look what we can do with computers!"", rather than focusing on compelling action and characters. At times it feels more like a sci-fi movie than a pirate adventure.<br/><br/>PLOT: Way too convoluted and repetitive. There are far too many scenes of characters creating overly-complicated deals with each other, only to pull a classic double-cross 15 minutes later. This happens roughly, oh, I'd say, about 1 billion times in this film. They're all pirates and can't be trusted. I got the point the first time.<br/><br/>A BOATLOAD OF CHARACTERS: The film tries to keep all the characters from the first two installments, while adding a bunch of new characters. At some point, there are just too many people running around on screen.<br/><br/>AN OVERLY-LONG RUN TIME: The first two movies were not short films by any means, but still seemed to fly by. This one is the longest of the bunch and bogs down in many areas. Instead of clever adventure sequences we get tedious, endless dialogue that doesn't really satisfy the audience.<br/><br/>If you're a fan of the first two films, it's hard to avoid the desire to see this one. Just be ready for a big disappointment compared to its predecessors. The end of this movie (rather obviously) sets up a fourth installment in the series. Here's hoping they get back on track with that one, although I'm not terribly interested in seeing any more of the ""Pirates"" series. With ""At World's End"" the series has overstayed its welcome."
"Velociraptor256","6","0","0","13 October 2008"," Weakest of the trilogy - I'm hoping we don't get a fourth one
","I enjoyed ""Curse of the Black Pearl"". ""Dead Man's Chest"", I felt was OK. But rather than learning from its predecessor's flaws, this film expands on them, and ends up being decidedly average.<br/><br/>I agree with other reviewers who say that the plot is far too complicated. Everything's fine until the second act of the film, and then it all goes off in different directions, with too many side stories crammed in (some of which didn't really need to be there), and becomes extremely hard to follow if you're not paying attention. ""Who's working for who?"" ""Who's betraying who?"" ""What arrangement have those characters got again?"" ""How did he end up on that ship?"" The other problem with betrayals occurring left, right and centre is that it gets a little hard to sympathise with any of the characters, even Will and Elizabeth  even though they're supposed to be the romantic leads, they don't display much affection for each other for most of the film.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp's performance as Jack Sparrow hasn't changed, but somehow he's not as much fun as he was in the last two films  maybe he's just best in smaller doses. It's nice to see Geoffrey Rush return as Barbossa, as well as a cameo by Keith Richards, but nobody else in the cast gives a performance that's worth mentioning.<br/><br/>For all its faults, I don't hate At World's End. While you may be confused by the story, you shouldn't be bored at least. The fun, not-so-serious atmosphere that was present in the first film has diminished somewhat, but comes through in some scenes. And the final battle scene is high quality, almost making up for the flaws that preceded it.<br/><br/>At World's End is not a bad film, but with some editing and better writing, it could have been a lot better. I won't be happy if they do make a fourth film: based on how the quality has degenerated through this trilogy, three is enough."

She went from understandably spunky to plain annoying. Unnatural and senseless shift of action to the Far East. Amateurishly post-modern staging of an after-life (or near-death) experience.

Anyone who sat through The Return of the King can't either, because the pace is nowhere near as slow and there's none of that nonsense with the bits where you think it's ended and then it hasn't. Jack Sparrow is still quintessentially Johnny Depp's role, and although he looks a little creaky here, he still tries to give it his all. Knightley is good as feisty support, and Keith Richards makes his cameo as Sparrow's dad but Bloom is still terminally wooden and there's not much more to the cast than that.<br/><br/>It's a stylish, slick, polished effort with a lot of flair put into it.

","Not up to the first or even the second movie in the series, PIRATES AT WORLD'S END has Jack Sparrow's crew searching for their lost captain. You may recall Captain Jack was swallowed by a giant beast at the end of the second movie. He exists in a sort of Limbo at the beginning of this film. Eventually, all are reunited, and it's time to fight both Davy Jones and his ghostly crew as well as the British navy. Loads of CGI, with a computer rendering of Captain Jack standing in for the real thing in many of the action sequences. Of course, the kids won't mind, having been conditioned to this cartooniness by SPIDER-MAN flicks. Johnny Depp is funny as the seemingly endlessly inebriated Captain Jack, but the humor wears a bit thin this third time around. The ending may disappoint the adults. But again, the kiddies probably won't mind. Let's hope this is the end of the series."
"doctorsmoothlove","4","0","0","15 May 2008"," Excessive and unnecessary.
","For whatever reason, none of the big blockbuster films of 2007 was particularly memorable. Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End, unfortunately, affirms that thesis. The film is a big budgeted mess with only the acting ability of Johnny Depp, Keira Knightley, Orlando Bloom, and Geoffrey Rush to save it. While not a complete waste of time, the third entrant in the series takes the central problem of the second film (the lack of a coherent plot), and expands it. I waited a long time for this DVD to become available at my University library, and I do not think the wait was worth it. After watching it, I felt as if I had watched a whitewashed,americanized anime after having watched its original counterpart. <br/><br/>I don't think that I will reiterate the entire plot, as the film is well-known by now. I will mention the myriad problems I saw with it. It begins at the pirate stronghold of Singapore where Barbossa and Swann are meeting with Captain Sao Feng. My first question is why the film failed to provide reason for the journey before the crew arrived? It creates unnecessary speculation. The next curious plot-related question I have is why Jack's rescue from the land of the dead was so underwhelming. Apparently, returning from the dead is as easy as capsizing, picking up the deceased, and returning the way one came. The characters appear to be completing a mundane chore, but most films usually portray the descent into the world of the undead as exceedingly difficult. Ironically, Disney accurately did this in their animated flick Hercules. Pirates' world of the dead is presented lazily as well. Nothing distinguishes it from any other portion of the open ocean. The Kraken, is ironically, much more meaningful deceased than it is alive. It's death is symbolic of the end of piracy which is a central topic in the film. After Jack is rescued, the crew returns and Tia Dalma (also known as Calypso) regains her natural form. She represents the largest plot-related problem in the film: the incorporation of an unnecessary character into the story. I believe that her double identity as Calypso may have been an effort to characterize Davy Jones but it doesn't. Their love scene consists of one sequence which does nothing to resolve the end of their previous relationship. Also, it is revealed that Davy Jones is supposed to ferry the dead in the their world. How then is he able to escape? The guidelines which Will reads would indicate that one needs a ship in order to escape. Also, Tia Dalma's identity as Calypso is never resolved. She is freed but nothing happens as a result of it. I wonder why Tia Dalma was included. Her character adds nothing to the series. She is not adequately developed to serve as Davy Jones' love interest, nor does her character have conclusion. The film even fails to adhere to its own rules when Will is freed from the curse of the Flying Dutchman due to ""good behavior"" instead of someone taking his place (an end-of-the-film easter egg scene).<br/><br/>Despite all of the problems the film's plot presents, there are some noteworthy moments in it. Jack's hallucinations are amusing, and show the diversity of his personality. Will and Elizabeth's relationship remains strained, and her devotion to him is apparent. I thought she actually had lost feelings for him at the end of the second film. Their marriage is the most humorous sequence in the entire film series. All of the participants during the marriage sequence act in character but Geoffrey Rush steals the scene. The film continues its trademark ""swashbuckling action"" as did the previous two, but the laughs are too thinly spread among scene-after-scene of dry dialog or mindless action. This film tries to do too much with its three-hour runtime. The plot could have been reduced tremendously, perhaps into a mini-series. I did appreciate the film's attempt to allude to the real-life Pirate unions. It's best to assume that the last two portions of this series do not exist. The first Pirates film is the only one to present a believable story without excessive supernatural elements. It isn't over-the-top and does not defy verisimilitude enough to offend. The last two films, however, ignore any type of logic to the point absurdity. <br/><br/>Unless one is a fan of the series or a fan boy/fan girl of one of the actors, there is no reason to watch this film. However, given its popularity, most will see it sometime. Whle watching it, feel free to nap between the occasional humorous dialog. The film is more much enjoyable when watched this way, and it will not feel like sitting through a poor anime. While costuming and the other visual effects are mesmerizing, the film fails to adequately develop its characters and appeal at an intimate, personable level."

","This 3rd effort for the Pirates entertaining series falls somewhat short of both its predecessors. What it has going for it is a great middle third - including conjuring of the afterlife, kooky precepts and great dreamlike hallucinations with Jack Sparrow (reprised by Johnny Depp). Also the costumes, and make-up are once again top notch. (Spoilers) Likewise the Calypso Goddess effects scenes are also considerably good and Davy Jones (created in the 2nd movie in the series). However, the plot really drags along at far too pedestrian pace. The scenes become monotonous, sea-battle after sea-battle,...pirate-dialog after pirate dialog. (spoiler) Double-triple crosses etc. Even MORE characters to keep track of (think Spider-Man 3). By the time the final sea-battle comes along, though as spectacular as it looks, my attention span was kaput. Of course there's the requisite loose-ends for YET ANOTHER sequel. Supposing this were the last installment, it has it's merits surely, and some good attractive scenes. But Some serious paring is in needed here - starting with cutting down dialog or smaller subplots. Recommended as part of the series at best."
"TheUnseenMovieLover","6","0","0","12 April 2008"," A Memorable End To An Entertaining Trilogy
","I was slightly apprehensive upon going to watch At World's End. After Curse of the Black Pearl, Dead Man's Chest was slightly disappointing due to its bloated story and the lack of heart which presided throughout the first film. Also, the negative reviews for this instalment were starting to take their toll on me. As I walked into the cinema, I was fearing the worst.<br/><br/>Luckily, this movie proved to be effectively entertaining. It may be the worst film of the series, but it is still a good piece of entertainment which provides some enjoyable fun, if nothing ground-breaking or complex. However, I did miss the frenzied enjoyment of the first two Pirates.<br/><br/>The cast have grown into their parts and are absolutely terrific to watch. The standout is once again Johnny Depp, whose incredible skills as an actor never cease to amaze. Jack Sparrow has lost none of his swagger, and Depp still shows deep affection for his role, performing exceptionally well in his fearless quest to entertain and give the audience a good time, and consistently succeeding. All of his character traits are fantastic, and his dialogue is spot-on in its delivery. That he has less screen time in this instalment is one of the film's flaws, since Jack Sparrow is most likely to be what made this series the explosive phenomenon which it has become. Less screen time for the character is likely to upset his fans. Another flaw is that there are a large number of double crosses between the characters in this movie, and that it is sometimes difficult to follow the motivations of the characters. <br/><br/>As for the other actors, they all acquit themselves admirably. Many of the actors also go beyond the call of duty to deliver performances with effective depth. Right at the top of the list is Bill Nighy, who gives a performance of such passion and complexity as Davy Jones that it is impossible to view the character as a mere visual effect. Also, Keira Knightley gives a performance which is full of emotion, whilst also having fun with her role. For those who are also looking for gleefully fun performances, Geoffrey Rush doesn't disappoint as Barbossa, sparring with Depp in spectacularly entertaining fashion and also holding his own with precise humour and disarming charm. The only big disappointment in the acting department is Tom Hollander, whose snide Cutler Beckett is an inadequate nemesis for the wily likes of Jack Sparrow. <br/><br/>The visual effects are exceptional. None of the visual effects are glaringly obvious during the proceedings, and there is a large abundance of terrific moments where the film's visuals are of stunning quality, with the final battle particularly jaw-dropping and spectacular. This sequence is also an incredible piece of action, combining humour, energy, danger and a surprising conclusion to form a flawless piece of action-adventure spectacle. Another example of the movie's tremendous visual effects is the character of Davy Jones, who is one of the most incredible visual effect-driven characters ever created. Also, Bill Nighy and the director Gore Verbinski capture the essence and emotions of the character so magnificently that it is almost impossible to view Jones as anything other than a living, breathing person whilst watching him on the screen.<br/><br/>The production design is also brilliant, with sets such as the Singapore lair of pirate lord Sao Feng (a brilliant Chow Yun-Fat) terrific in their detail and design. As well as this, the costume design and character make-up are also tremendously impressive.<br/><br/>Gore Verbinski directs the film with style and flair, although some may feel that he has taken it a step too far where the storyline is concerned. To a degree, he has, but this is only because of what he has to conclude following on from Dead Man's Chest. That film made it compulsory for World's End to be as long as it is. However, Verbinski uses more then just visual effects to hold the viewer's attentions, crafting exciting action sequences, moments of grand imagination (the sequence in Davy Jones' Locker is like something out of the mind of Tim Burton), chuckle-some humour and some engaging emotional conflicts. His direction also ensures that the film is sufficiently tense, dangerous, dark and dynamic. He is aided by a witty and mostly clever script, which is full of energetic dialogue, entertaining slapstick and interesting, colourful characters.<br/><br/>That being said, there are many parts of the film which tend to drag (the time between rescuing Jack and the pirates meeting at Shipwreck Cove has a lot of unnecessary material). Whilst there are some good moments in this part of the film, it never manages to grip the audience like it should. Still, the fantastic final third of the movie more than makes up for the long wait, concluding the trilogy in fine style and even leaving some doors open for future instalments. <br/><br/>Overall, At World's End is a good ending to a trilogy which, despite having its fair share of flaws, is still tremendously entertaining and fun to watch. For fans of comedy, action and grand adventure, this is a accomplished piece of entertainment. Plus, it never hurts to add Johnny Depp to the equation. either."

","I found the movie a bit long, at well over 2 hours, but upon reflection I don't know how it could have been shortened much. It tells several stories in sequence so, if you aren't tired and sleepy, goes by rather briskly.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp is of course back as Captain Jack Sparrow, and he and his crew, once he gets a ship, must sail to the edge of the world. Who knew? We had been convinced that the world is a sphere! <br/><br/>Geoffrey Rush in my mind steals the whole movie as the entertaining Captain Barbossa. Orlando Bloom is back as Will Turner, and Keira Knightley gets her chance to be a ship captain as Elizabeth Swann.<br/><br/>The best makeup job is on Bill Nighy, excellent as Davy Jones. Being dead, and in charge of Davy Jones' Locker, his face has taken on the appearance of a small Octopus, with tentacles of various sizes sticking out here and there.<br/><br/>The last 30 to 40 minutes is spectacular, with ships chasing each other about a giant whirlpool in the sea, and firing off canons.<br/><br/>SPOILERS. In a funny scene, Will decides to propose to Elizabeth, during a big sword fight aboard the ships. They manage to get the captain to marry then as they are fighting. But Will is destined to die and spend his 10 years in the deep, his heart locked in the trunk, and Elizabeth will have to wait for him."
"Chrivhec","7","0","0","24 June 2007"," A superb movie, but a disappointment at the same time.
","I've seen this movie a couple of weeks ago. The reason why I haven't written a comment on it until now, is because I wanted to give it some time and think about it. I had mixed feelings after seeing the movie, and now I've had enough time to take some conclusions and to write a proper review. <br/><br/>First of all I want to say that overall, At World's End is a highly entertaining movie. There's a lot of action, humor and some big surprises. The Pirates Of The Caribbean trilogy is without a doubt one of the best trilogies ever made, and in my opinion, it's more interesting and fascinating than the Lord Of The Rings trilogy, for instance. The Curse Of The Black Pearl is the best of the three. Then there's Dead Man's Chest, which comes very close to the first movie. And although they wanted to make it bigger and better, At World's End is the least of the three. It's bigger, but not better. And that's because of 3 important flaws.<br/><br/>In my opinion, the biggest and most important flaw of all is that the role of Jack Sparrow in At World's End has gotten smaller. We don't get to see him as often as in the previous 2 movies, and when we do, we don't always see the same Sparrow as before. Of course it's normal that we don't see him in the beginning of the movie, because they had to sail to Davy Jones' locker first, where witty Jack was captured. In fact, that part (from the beginning of the movie to the moment they arrive at the locker) is my favorite part of the movie, and it was absolutely brilliant. Barbossa's return is very impressively filmed, and the way he and the rest of the crew of the Black Pearl have to get the secret charts and sail to the locker blew me away. Very impressive film-making. And although I had my doubts when I heard he was cast, Chow Yun-Fat did a very good job playing captain Sao Feng. I was pleasantly surprised. Anyway, the point is that Jack doesn't have the lead anymore, and it's actually more about Elizabeth. It's her who is chosen as the Pirate King, and it's her who has to persuade the others into fighting Davy Jones and Lord Beckett at the end. Of course Johnny Depp plays his role as brilliantly as always, but when we get to see Jack, he isn't presented as the 'mean', charming and leading pirate anymore. Although sometimes, particularly at the end of the movie, when the final battle took place, we saw him fighting, shooting and swinging again, and then I saw the Jack from the first 2 movies. But it's not the same, not by a long shot.<br/><br/>Maybe the filmmakers had to choose between a series of characters and figures, or maybe it might have been more difficult to shoot, but I think the death of the Kraken was a bad idea. I was looking forward to see the Kraken again after Dead Man's Chest, because I thought it was very impressive, but I was disappointed when Beckett said Davy Jones had to kill his pet. I'm sure the writers could have found a way to bring the Kraken back into the third film, but maybe it was too difficult to film. Although I'm sure there could have been a lot of incredible and spectacular fights if the Kraken was still alive. Image it was, and Davy Jones called it at the final battle, with the whirlpool and everything Wow!<br/><br/>And finally, the third biggest flaw is that too many stories had to be told, which makes the movie a little too complicated than it should be. But this is not a big deal actually. Personally I had no trouble understanding everything, but I can imagine some people had.<br/><br/>So all in all, At World's End is an unforgettable movie from the beginning to the end. But if you compare it to the previous 2, it's the least of the three. I enjoyed watching this film and I'm happy I did. I just hope, if there is going to be a fourth movie, although it's definitely not necessary, Jack will have the lead again."

","After a year of anticipation, I finally got to see the final chapter of the Pirates trilogy. As a die-hard fan of the series, I had high expectations, and this one definitely met them. I thought it was visually stunning and had a storyline far superior to Dead Man's Chest. Although At World's End didn't have much new to add, it did have the hefty task of wrapping up all the loose ends (and there were quite a few) that Dead Man's Chest produced. It did this wonderfully. The graphics and visuals, as usual, were stunning. One element of the movie that I really liked was the writers' technique of dividing the audience's sympathies. There wasn't one villain that I could intensely hate in one scene but then feel very sorry for in the next. One thing I didn't like was Keith Richards's cameo. It was so publicized and highly anticipated, but in the end he was given so little to do and some people in my audience didn't know that the man was Jack's father. The writers were definitely brave in writing a bittersweet ending that is definitely not happy or Hollywood-perfect. I also liked that they brought back Geoffrey Rush as Captain Barbossa. He added great comedic presence. All in all, this is my second-favorite of the trilogy and I loved it."

","Pirates of the Caribbean, At World's End is a great ending for a great series. The beginning in Singapore is not only good action but great comedy, and Jack Sparrow's hallucinations in Davy Jones's locker are nothing short of genius. As wonderful a character as he is, Jack was starting to get a bit stale after two movies of being just the same, which is why his character development was welcomed. <br/><br/>The only criticism I have has to do with the nothing-happening moments that were quite frequent especially in the middle; the story wasn't going on, and the characters merely talked and joked around. However, with such awesome characters and setting, any minute of Pirates is better than a minute without Pirates. <br/><br/>Of the actors especially Orlando Bloom deserves a special mention; he brought his character forward in huge leaps, and his emotions were true and convincing; Will is a real hero with a heart (no pun intended), and the audience feels it.<br/><br/>Keira Knightley gave her best performance as well, and her character was given welcome development; instead of being kick-ass all the time, she had to suffer and mature.<br/><br/>The end battle was absolutely breathtaking and alone worth seeing this movie. The ending was very surprising, something I hadn't quite been able to guess in a Disney movie. It was bittersweet and touching, but we got a ray of hope with the scene after the credits.<br/><br/>This movie was a worthy ending to one of the best movie series ever, even with a slightly complex plot that required a sharp eye and good knowledge of the previous movies."

Literally you they could have trimmed at least 20 or 30 minutes out of the film and it would have been a much tighter and better paced film. And the script ain't as epic as the length tries to make the watcher believe.<br/><br/>Now that that's been said, let me say, that here be an entertaining piece of piratey celluloid.

I felt it should have ended much earlier than it did, but no... they had to lay the basis for the next possible film, like that wasn't already done.<br/><br/>So in short, it's a good film, perhaps a bit too long, but in the end very satisfying experience."

I thought there was an unwritten rule that you are supposed to say what has happened in previous episodes if it is important to know them to understand the action in the present movie. This utter contempt for the viewer who may want to catch up withe episodes.But why bother? Whatever the story might have been seems to be totally incoherent and relying on a massive suspension of disbelief. I can go up to a point in suspension of disbelief but a multiplicity of Johnny Depp's come now are we all five year olds. Pirates coming back from the dead, when did that genre gravitate from swashbuckling and chivalry to zombies and the netherworld. Which brings me to my last comments; what a giant waste of talent. The creation of children's movies (for adults with child level stupor ) now means that serious actors end up playing foolish unbelievable yarns. That's sad. I've seen Depp in good movies like the Libertine and Chocolat. Is he really that hard up for money that he has to play stuff that requires all the skills of an actor in a ""grand guignol"" sort of play. This movie is prototypical of the state of the industry, a ton of money spent to create a bad children's movie. Harry Potter, Shrek, spider Man, Superman, Batman 28 Weeks Later, Cars. If we like that kind of entertainment, it's no wonder we are fast asleep as a nation in fantasy when a war of aggression is perpetrated by our leaders."

","Frankly, this movie isn't worth an in-depth review. It's twice as long as it needs to be, it's consumed by overly loud and unnecessary special effects, there are far too many characters, none of which are adequately delineated, and the plot is puerile and childish at best.<br/><br/>Jerry Bruckenheimer should be strung up by the ankles and stabbed to death with push pins for unleashing this three hours long bit of trash upon the world.<br/><br/>Oh...and Keira? You need to add about thirty pounds to your frame, young lady. You are painfully emaciated and in your current physical condition horribly unattractive."

","In the recent past there were few films that disappointed as much. The three hours it took until I was released from the drivel were less enjoyable than a visit at the dentist to have a tooth extracted. <br/><br/>Given it's good predecessors I can't fathom what drove the writer, director and editing people to produce an incomprehensible, twisted and long winding but in some main plot lines open ended film. <br/><br/>The visual effects may be stunning but are in the end blasting everything away that might have passed as enjoyable plot line. At times I was missing a laughing track, at least then I would have known which was intended as humour and what was a vain attempt at keeping you occupied.<br/><br/>That will be one film trilogy which will not be complete in our DVD collection."

","I went to the movie, with real high expectations. I hoped they would continue with all the great things they started - the fun, the action, the story, - and all that, without over-doing it. Unfortunately they failed.<br/><br/>The beginning of the movie is funny. Probably too funny, as if it was put in the movie forced. After the first over-done funny part, the movie is fun to watch. Maybe at some parts a bit messy, but overall fun. Until the beginning of the big fight between the Black Pearl and the Flying Dutchman I was content about the movie - but then lighting strikes. In the middle of the huge fight, Will Turner marries his love. It totally ruined the scene, and gave me a very bad aftertaste of the movie. I thought Disney had learned from other trilogies, but it seems they knew that the movie would sell itself, even though it was way overdone.<br/><br/>The movie doesn't stink, but was far from what I expected/hoped, therefore 6/10 stars.."

Not much else though.<br/><br/>I feel for the idiot responsible for putting the opening scene together: A 'Family Film' beginning with rows of people being executed & bodies slung in one mass pile, one of which is a child. The misjudgement of that decision, only forgotten due to the bigger cock-up, namely that the child had a 21st century brace in his teeth!<br/><br/>On the plusses, it was still better than the second one, though hardly an achievement, and we were the ONLY 2 of 500 in the cinema, who saw that Elizabeth and Will had a child and who he was, which seemed a bit odd for bigger fans of the film than me to be so desperate to get out and miss the last two minutes & the whole conclusion."

","This movie delivers, regardless of one or two spots where you want to lean over to your fellow movie-goer and ask ""what?"". The storyline is creative and original if you pay attention to it, and it is filled with splendid details of foreshadowing and other things.<br/><br/>The action scenes are done flawlessly, while still containing the originality and humor that the last two movies incorporated.<br/><br/>However, that's not what one me over. It was the deep, symbolic nature of what goes on in the movie that makes this better than the other two films. The scenes where Will and Elizabeth are married during the ongoing war between pirates and sea monsters is touching, and is absolutely emotionally charged when Will hands over the box in which his heart is kept, telling Elizabeth to keep it safe for him.<br/><br/>Amazing Story, Amazing Characters, Memorable Scenes.

The Epic ship battle scene that was a man of war getting broadsided by 2 pirate ships and the ""Captain"" not doing anything about it ??

","It is really interesting how people can have so radically different perceptions about something. People in general consider this film to be really good, but for me it was a sort of torture to watch. To start with, it was difficult to understand. Too many characters and too much senseless dialogue. The movie just keeps hoping from one plot line to the other (and there are like 20)without ever landing something meaningful or interesting. And then you add the cheap and silly surrealism they used. The only reason why i went to see this film was johnny depp (i'm a big fan) I said, well if depp is in the film it might not be that bad. But not even the amazing talent of this actor could save the film. I have to admit he made quite a creation of Jack sparrow, but anyways it is a cartoonish silly character at the end. I rarely want to leave the theater before the movie ends, but in this one i was eager to do so. Anyways I didn't leave because my friend and i just started to make fun and laugh about how ridiculous and bad the film was. (visual effects are not everything)..."
"gutterstar","3","2","5","4 July 2007"," Didn't anybody tell you? Piracy is over.
","The latest Pirates of the Caribbean film had one of the highest box-office opening weekends of all time. It had a record 4,362 US theatre openings and has now taken over $700million worldwide. With the number of people going to see At World's End, you'd be forgiven for thinking the world actually was coming to an end, and we'd decided the only people we could trust were mega film stars. But this POTC is neither a fitting end to human history or to a popular franchise.<br/><br/>With all the logic of the Flat Earth Society comes a series of plots that attempt to intertwine like cords of a rope, but aren't nearly as well put together as the ones we will see pirates flying about on towards the films climax. Johnny Depp returns as Captain Jack Sparrow, whose unstable and seemingly drunken daft antics are compounded after he spends some time in Davey Jones' Locker, with multiple versions of himself and lots of crabs. The character is a bright spot in the film, though with so many returning and new characters he barely makes it through as protagonist. Chow Yun-Fat, Geoffrey Rush and others deliver great performances, but anyone hoping for an escape from Elizabeth Swann and Will Turner's brain-punchingly annoying romance will have no such luck. The various stories are complicated, but not clever, and the overall sense of pointlessness leads the film to fall back on the pretty people. Yet even this fails to make comprehensive sense and is laden with ham-fisted clichés. You can watch previous installment Dead Man's Chest  from which this conjoins heavily  immediately before viewing, and still not make head or tail of it. It's not surprising to learn that shooting began when the script wasn't finished.<br/><br/>As always, Orlando Bloom acts with the personality of a ships plank. Whether he is on the brink of being killed or conversing epically with the love of his life, he comes across as the character who can't quite believe he is lucky enough to be in such a cool situation, who must gruff his voice and squint his eyes. Acting can be seen a mile off, they say, but in the case of this well-scrubbed pirate, you'll wish your eyes were a mile away.<br/><br/>Keira Knightley doesn't fare much better. The series has tried to build her princess character into a tough deck-swabber, but it fails spectacularly to convince. When she makes a pre-battle speech to her comrades, you cringe for everyone in the room and in the scene. As in Domino, it's impossible to believe Knightley can kick anyone's arse, rotting zombie swashbucklers or not. And she never washes the floor once before becoming Queen of the Seas. Typical.<br/><br/>The jokes are poor (monkeys, rum) and between scenes just so we can take a break from trying to understand what's going on, if we haven't given up already. With the brainlessness that comes from knowing you've got a Disneyfied hit on your hands the script tosses in references of everything from The Little Mermaid to The Godfather (the latter via a line from Tom Hollanders bad guy character Lord Beckett, butchered in the way only a business pirate could do  The East India Company being the first big monopoly trying to be hip).<br/><br/>The very long final action scene, although as illogical as the rest, is certainly impressive - but it's not worth sitting through the rest for it. Indecisive as always, the film doesn't know how to end, leaving just enough opening for a possible third sequel to scrape through pathetically, covered in seaweed and lacking imagination. Pieces of Eight? They should cut their losses and stop at three.<br/><br/>3/10"

It tends to get better at the end when the Flying Dutchman and the Black Pearl bomb the Endeavor and the finale where Jack cuts out the map for the fountain of youth.<br/><br/>But what the hell is the deal with Calypso? They keep building it up for half the movie, and then it just turns into hundreds of crabs. WTF? Like I said, it has it moments, but I'm glad I got in for free.

","The final film in the very popular 'Pirates of the Caribbean' trilogy, 'At World's End' heralds the return of everybody's favourite drunken swashbuckling pirate, Jack Sparrow. With most of the saga's previous participants returning to conclude the story, director Gore Verbinski also tosses a few interesting new characters into the mix. Complete with many awesome action sequences, some comedy and a bit of romance, fans of the previous films will not being going home disappointed.<br/><br/>'At World's End' takes off where 'Dead Man's Chest' left off, with Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) banished to Davy Jones' Locker, the final resting-place of sailors lost at sea. When Captain Hector Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) is resurrected from death by the mystical Tia Dalma (Naomie Harris), Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swan (Keira Knightley) join with them to rescue Jack. Meanwhile, the fearsome Davy Jones (Bill Nighy), captain of The Flying Dutchman, has formed an unstable alliance with the villainous Lord Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander), with the aim of destroying every remaining pirate in the Caribbean. Among the newer characters introduced into the franchise are Captain Sao Feng (played with charisma by famous Hong Kong actor, Chow Yun-Fat) and Captain Teague, Jack's father (played by Keith Richards). Though the latter is merely a brief cameo or two, Teague's appearances are certainly funny and entertaining, especially since Depp reportedly based his Oscar-nominated portrayal of Jack Sparrow on the veteran guitarist and songwriter.<br/><br/>Curiously, the final product of 'At World's End' is something of a mixed bag, with both good and bad characteristics. Johnny Depp is brilliant as always, delivering another entertaining and memorable performance as the drunken, reckless and talented pirate captain. Believe it or not, I think that his character was slightly underused. I would have much enjoyed for more of the action to have focused on Jack, since I find Elizabeth and Will to be quite uninteresting characters. Geoffrey Rush demonstrates that his extraordinary talent was what 'Dead Man's Chest' was noticeably lacking, delivering an enthusiastic performance as Barbossa. The CGI visual effects are often cleverly and effectively used, though a bit overdone at times, especially during the climactic maelstrom battle. I did, however, particularly enjoy Jack and Davy Jones' sword-fight atop the ship's mast, however unrealistic it was. Hans Zimmer's inspirational score is also worthy of a mention.<br/><br/>Now let us move on to the parts of the film that I wasn't quite so enthusiastic about. First of all, Naomie Harris' character, Tia Dalma (later revealed to be Calypso, the goddess of the sea) is most certainly the most annoying cinematic character I've ever had the displeasure of watching  and that includes Jar Jar Binks. I had been relieved that her appearance in 'Dead Man's Chest' was rather small, and so was horror-struck to discover that she plays a substantial, pivotal role in this one. Her irritating, grating voice made me wince every single time she opened her mouth. I don't think this has anything to do with the actress' talents in themselves (she was quite tolerable in 'Miami Vice' and '28 Days Later'), but perhaps merely with the way she has decided to portray her character. To cut my rant short, I was just glad when the film got rid of her.<br/><br/>As in the previous films, Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley were adequate without being anything notable. Knightley's would-be inspirational speech at the film's climax was not terribly effective, with the actress really lacking the screen presence to make a strong impression, though you can admire the effort. The film itself is long, much too long. Lots of action is sometimes a good thing, but the overly-extended battle sequence just went on for too long to maintain the audience's attention throughout. However - being a viewer who has enjoyed the 'Pirates of the Caribbean' trilogy without believing it to be anything particularly special  perhaps it's not my place to wish for the films to be shorter. After all, I'm certain that there are countless die-hard fans who were yearning for 'At World's End' to continue for hours and hours more."
"jdh2511","2","2","5","28 June 2007"," One of the worst movies of the 21st Century...
","When I first viewed Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End in theatres, I cannot deny I thought it was a thrilling cinematic production; never in my life had I been so wrong. Make no mistake; the third installment of Pirates was one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life. The second time I viewed this movie was on a computer that subsequently compromised the full scope of the CGI, which meant that the plot line was my entertainment, or lack thereof, rather then the magnificent blue screen effects. This was when I realized that this movie not only lacked a coherent and cohesive plot line, but also consisted of three hours of the corniest and the most inferior acting I had ever seen. Not only would Oprah make a better pirate then Orlando Bloom, but she would certainly be more convincing and entertaining. The only part of the entire film that was somewhat satisfying was when Davy Jones shanked Will Turner, which mercifully grants the audience a few seconds without Orlando, and his abysmal attempt at acting. If you enjoy bad acting, inconclusive plots and embarrassing speeches given by Elizabeth Swan, I bet you would still hate this film, because it is that terrbs.<br/><br/>The film had just began to reach its climax when Collipso turned into a screaming 20 foot Neanderthal just before she transformed into 80 million crabs which jumped into the ocean to show the pirates just ""how cruel she can be."" At this point I was expecting Collipso, this vaguely described superpower, to create a massive hurricane with epic lighting bolts striking down on Orlando, but instead she transforms into crabs which somehow creates a whirlpool, which then becomes nothing more then an inconvenience for the Black Pearl and Flying Dutchman. All the hype surrounding Collipso was basically like if the United States dropped the A-Bomb on Hiroshima without it exploding, but instead landing in a nearby rice paddy. Will Turner takes over the Flying Dutchman and regroups with the Black Pearl, and they proceed to engage Lord Beckett, who gives his epic ""It's just good business,"" line before his ship explodes. By the way, the scene with Barbosa marrying Swan and Turner amidst the ""epic"" final battle was cinematic genocide.<br/><br/>I could continue to point out every lame scene, every corny line, and every flaw, but it would be much easier to copy and past the films' script. If you thought this film was entertaining, then I recommend IMDb's bottom 100 list. Any movie that has Orlando Bloom in a leading role (Besides Lord of The Rings, where Legolas was still the lamest of the fellowship) cannot possibly be considered a quality film.<br/><br/>Do not be fooled by the CGI effects and the popular cast, Pirates of the Caribbean: At Worlds End, is nothing more then three hours of Hollywood butchering a potentially successful trilogy in order to steal those Hamilton's from your wallets and purses.<br/><br/>This movie receives a 0/10, but the hottness of Keira Knightley compels me to award 2 very sympathetic and merciful points out of 10."

","Having decided to see 2007's biggest hit, we skipped the multiplex and headed for greater Washington DC's finest single screen theater, the UPTOWN. With its huge curved screen and superior stereo, this is the place where World Premiers are held and the best place to enjoy an over-sized epic movie.<br/><br/>With low expectations set by the limp and lame Pirates 2 - Dead Man's Chest, we found Pirates 3 to be amazing and imaginative, keeping the viewer's interest from start to finish. However, there is absolutely no coherent plot, no character development, nothing but action and stunning scenes. Like almost all Jerry Bruckheimer films, you watch it and toss it away like a fast food wrapper. The filmmakers change the rules every few seconds: One minute a character is dead, the next he isn't; therefore suspense is eradicated. Any fair-minded person would rate this picture from 1 through 7. The large number of 10 ratings might be studio feed, as there is no way to prevent dishonest input and studios have been buying good reviews from newspapers for decades.<br/><br/>This picture played some of the finest remaining single-screen houses in America: Washington's Uptown, Baltimore's Senator, New York's Zergfeld, Akron's Highland, LA's El Capitan.

Bloom and Depp were the stand out performers, but without Rush's character it wouldn't be as great. This movie had action, romance, and had pirates. Children will love it, and parents will enjoy it.

"agmoldham","3","2","5","20 June 2007"," The definition of what's wrong with the ""Blockbuster"" movie
","Most of my reviews contain pithy little comments about the plot, whether the movie is good or bad, and who the movie might suit. Pirates of the Caribbean 3 has inspired my creative juices though, so i think a longer review is justified. For those people that prefer the pithy reviews ...<br/><br/>Pirates of the Caribbean is your average blockbuster with plenty of bangs and very little in the way of good acting or story telling. As with the second POTC there is very little in the way of plot with the film being a series of set pieces. Most people that are looking for eye candy will be entertained by the movie since it contains Messrs Depp, Bloom & Knightly. There's plenty of action as well for those adrenalin junkies that enjoy plenty of explosions and fighting.<br/><br/>Pirates of the Caribbean 3 is a classic example of what is wrong with Blockbuster movies.<br/><br/>The acting in the movie is appalling. However good looking Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightly are they cannot act and have less presence than Marlon Brando's wig. It's probably a bit unfair to compare any actors with Brando, but I'm sure if you plucked a couple of good looking people from the Mall they'd be better actors than Bloom and Knightly. I've actually given the film an extra point because it was rather entertaining to see just how poor they were! Having said that the rest of the cast can't be excused either and the performances of Rush and Depp are probably worse than Bloom and Knightly, since they can act in the first place! <br/><br/>One of the fundamentals of film making is that you should be moved in some way by the characters. This is certainly not the case with POTC 3 though and as the trials and tribulations unfold you are completely detached and couldn't care less who bites the bullet and who survives. I would be absolutely staggered if anyone showed any emotional reaction to the film whatsoever.<br/><br/>Bearing in mind the previous comments the director must take his share of the blame. Verbinski is clearly more interested in the cgi than the fundamentals of the film. I suspect if you put aside the last couple of scenes you could rearrange the previous 30 or 40 scenes in any order and it wouldn't make much difference to the finished product. It feels like each actor has been allocated scenes based on their order in the cast. I'm sure most people will be aware of the friction on the set of the Magnificent Seven and this has a similar feel to it. Johnny Depp obviously wasn't content to appear once, so appeared several times and you can't help thinking that he might have had something to do with that himself.<br/><br/>The film is too long and the editor should have cut an hour from the running time, but maybe the 168 minutes gives the film some gravitas. Apart from the acting inabilities of Knightly and Bloom some of the effects are quite good. That's one thing you are normally sure of with blockbusters though ... a few good effects.<br/><br/>The thing that most annoys me about blockbusters ... I (and many others) go and see them! You feel like you are missing out if you don't go to see it, so even though you know it's going to be average you still shell out your hard earned cash! Sucker!!! <br/><br/>For those people thinking of going to see POTC 3 at the movies ... wait to watch it on TV!"
"RobinCook70","1","2","5","19 June 2007"," Not Another Gay Blade
","I didn't much care for the second Pirates movie and this third one cinched it further for me. I didn't really understand the second movie all that well and definitely was lost in this third one. The impression I was left with after viewing this movie aside from exhaustion of waiting for it to end was that this had to have been a spoof movie ... one example is a showdown on the beach minus Clint Eastwood and the Good, the Bad and the Ugly music. The other impression was fraught with most every pirate in the movie was gay, including Jack Sparrow. I got very weary of watching Johnny Depp prance around like a fruit, which am glad I was spared most of this gayness in the second movie, but it had enough to wear me down.<br/><br/>To me, the 2nd and 3rd movies should have been put into one movie, but with all the visual padding they sold it down the pipe to the public. I really feel badly for parents taking their kids to see this since it won't make much sense to them, but kids like visuals so I suppose it will fly. However, due to how very, very, very long the movie is, I doubt young kids will sit comfortably in the theaters.<br/><br/>At least George Hamilton did a great classic in The Gay Blade with a good script, but Pirates 3 definitely is an arduous one-time viewing, heavily touted movie and not another Gay Blade."
"moimoichan6","7","2","5","17 June 2007"," Pirates : The Worst End ?
","The only one and true achievement of the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" movies is the building of this amoral, egocentric, fearful, sexually ambiguous, alcoholic and inconstant character : the Captain Jack Sparrow, greatly embodied by the last mute comical genius : Johnny Depp. When he's in the movie, this blockbuster becomes out of control, a sort of rich continuation of Roman Polanski's ""Pirates"" . The problem is that he alone couldn't make the whole movie, for such a Walt Disney epic needs a ""real"" hero : that's why we also have to bare the brave Will Turner and the beauty Elisabeth Swann that spoil a great part of the movie in order to bring back some morale and virtue into it. I have to say that it really bothered me in the second part, with all those unnecessary sub plots and this stupid story between Turner and his molusqued father. But, whereas I've heard the worst about the World End, I have to admit I was quite satisfied with the movie, at the condition to think at something else during at least one hour on the three the movie has to offer.<br/><br/>First of all, Sparrow has an equal in this movie, lost in the second episode : the captain Barbosa, and all the scenes between Depp and Geoffrey Rush are hilarious. I don't know witch one of them is the meaner and carelessness character, but it's really fun to see such anti-heroes in a family feature. Plus, the movie is full of funny little details or sentences, that kept my attention awake during the all movie and make me spend a pleasant evening (Sparrow asking to his dad ""How's Mum ?"" or a poor pirate playing with his frozen toes for instance). Well, then, there's also big action scenes, stupid and countless sub plots, but the all thing stays pretty fun 'till the end, and even manage to give a enjoyable conclusion to the adventures of the Captain Jack Sparrow."

And we'll see it again.<br/><br/>OK, it's not as fresh as ""Pearl,"" but the genre of pirates was dead before that film. The actors and their dialogue revived it wonderfully.<br/><br/>The cast is terrific, each a wonderful actor in his /her own right. As an ensemble, each is complemented. <br/><br/>What I didn't like: Too much with the special effects! Stop already, Mr Bruckheimer. Many explosions does not a great film make. <br/><br/>Not enough smart-alecks. Jack's always got the best one-liners (of course), but this movie, he's got them all. Ted & Terry, what happened to that wonderful irreverence, we miss it. <br/><br/>The bit with Tia Dalma /Calypso morphing into the 50-Ft Tall Woman. Naomie Harris deserved better than that.<br/><br/>What I did like: Johnny Depp's Cap't Jack --how can you not? I've been a Depp fan since ""Scissorhands"" and he just gets better and better. Jack's a rogue, he's selfish, he's charming, he's been a skeleton and been swallowed by a fish. But he still cringes when he hears his father's voice.... Yeah, and he keeps losing his ship. <br/><br/>Mercer's unmerciful death. So it's not nice, but he had it coming. <br/><br/>Will. Much nastier sort of Will than before. Although he was by no means the ""bland"" fellow I keep reading about (who was it made the first kill in the first movie?), this time Will's all grown up. When Jones stabbed him, it was a great scene. Awful thing but a great scene. <br/><br/>Ragetti's eye!<br/><br/>Lighten up, it's a pirate movie.

","I just went to a matinÃ©e, and I was blown away. This movie is the very definition of big-time Summer blockbuster fun, just as POTC 2 was. The pacing is excellent, the effects, sets, and costumes are spectacular, and the acting is good to very good. I just did not see the point of the opening scene, which is quite grim, compared to just about everything else in the movie.<br/><br/>It was great to see Keith Richards finally make his appearance. I am of an age where I know very well who he is, and I thought he did a good job in his role. Of course, Johnny Depp was brilliant once again. I have been a fan of his for 15+ years, and it is gratifying to me to see him receive all of these accolades. The rest of the cast was fine, and I am a big Stellan Skarsgard fan, so it is always fun to see him.<br/><br/>I felt that the early part of the film was quite daring in its imagery. The scenes of Capt. Jack in the featureless landscape were truly intriguing, and not something one sees in the usual popcorn movie. I loved the crabs, the 'Up is Down' scene, all of it. The transformation scenes later on were excellent, and the vortex was pretty darn cool. <br/><br/>I was so busy enjoying the visuals and the sheer exuberance of the set-pieces, I did not even care that, most of the time, I had no idea what was going on, plot-wise. These POTC movies are just huge pinatas of movie fun, and I could not ask for more from a Summer franchise flick."

","I was pretty disappointed with the movie. The script was all over the place and very little was explained. It was pretty strange. First of all, the introduction in Singapore held no value whatsoever. I have a strong feeling it was simply to put Chow Yung Phat in the movie. Naturally, he was great, but the first 30 minutes is pretty useless. They also never fully explain the opening sequence about the song and pieces of 8. Why is a child singing the song? What song is it - why exactly is it being sung? <br/><br/>But I was writing to say that there will likely be a 4th - something about the Fountain of Youth, in which Will Turner can become mortal again so that he and Elizabeth Swann can actually be together. I have no actual proof of this, but it is rather the opinion of a film maker I know."

","A disappointing third act to a rapidly tiring franchise. No resolutions to several plot lines. Mediocre villains, and rather inane motives for the heroes. WAY too much Orlando Bloom and Kiera Knightly, which adds even more to this bloated mess. The comic relief is out of place, the action is mind numbing, and the writing wavers from terrible to dreadful, with not a lot in between that. <br/><br/>Plenty of people say they like it, but I have no idea why. Usually I can understand why something is considered good, even if I don't think so myself, but in this case, its just bad, with nothing to redeem it.<br/><br/>Its a mediocre film.

"drea-pv","10","2","5","31 May 2007"," A+ two thumbs up five stars
","This movie is now one of my most favorite movies of all time. Screw Rotten Tomatoes and ""too many characters and complicated plot"" blah blah bull. If you can't follow the plot, go back to school. While I found Pirates 2 less than satisfactory, this is one of the best 3rd movies I've ever seen. It really pulls on your heart strings and makes you think about the movie long after it's over. While not everything about the movie is perfect, what movie is perfect anyway? There are some corny bits, but nothing you can't shrug off (not like Spiderman landing in front of the American flag in the 3rd; now that was just too much). The soundtrack is absolutely amazing (I went and bought it the day after I watched it). While the movie alone was great, the music was the cherry. Dramatic, majestic orchestrated pieces balanced with playful pieces for other scenes. The comedy in the 2nd movie felt forced, but in this one, it was more reminiscent of the first, which was more natural, smart, and even subtle at times. Nothing too laugh out loud funny (sorry, if that was what you were looking for). While some segments of the story and characters are left superficial and up to the audience's speculation, others are much more complex and really pull on those heart strings. This movie is much more dramatic than the first two, so if you're prone, you might even want to keep a tissue nearby. The special effects are outstanding. When the camera pans out and you can see landscapes and backgrounds, the scenes are absolutely breathtaking. It really helps to see it in the movie theater because of scenes like those (plus the music). Overall, this movie gets an A+ from me. All aspects of the movie come together beautifully: plot, characters, music, setting/scenery. Like I said, of course there are things that aren't perfect about it and could be done better. I can even think of how to do some of those things better (everyone can). The movie leaves you with a bittersweet feeling, but if it were any different, it wouldn't be as good."

","This movie was fine... I love Johnny Depp, Keira Knightley and addition of Keith Richards made the movie even funnier. There was an interesting plot and everything, but the problem of these sequels is that the whole crew is trying to make the movie bigger in every way. And that's almost never good. Huge battles between Good and Bad, big ships fighting against each other, in fact, everyone against the other ones. That makes the movie just megalomaniac. <br/><br/>And then phrases like:'Oh, pirates, today, you're fighting for your freedom' are weird. On the other hand I have to admit, I always laughed at Davy Jones when he asked each dying person:'Do you fear death???.' That was great. <br/><br/>I've said that the plot was good, but it was too full also. It was almost hard to concentrate on each fact. I don't blame Gore Verbinski for making the end not ""too sweet"". <br/><br/>I think Johnny Depp kept the movie in the line of the first 2 movies. I consider the character of Jack Sparrow the best of all. Nevertheless, The Curse Of The Black Pearl remains for me as the best one..."

He is saved by Will, Liz, Barbossa, and other characters form the previous movies when he is locked in Davey Jone's locker. After being rescued, he strives to earn immortality by stabbing the heart of Davey Jones, and becoming the captain of the Flying Dutchman forever.<br/><br/>Elizabeth Swan, having grief over killing Jack, is coming further away from Will at the beginning of the movie.

She send everyone to fight in one battle.<br/><br/>Will Turner, is eager to set his father free, not knowing he will be taken away from Elizabeth. Throughout the movie, he makes plans with Cutler Beckett, stabs backs, and wins Elizbaeth back.<br/><br/>In the last scene with the huge battle, Barbossa releases Calypso from her human form ,Tia Dahlma, and she creates a massive whirlpool. The flying Dutchman, and the black pearl are fighting, while jack and Davey Jones are having a fight of their own. Jack manages to get the key, and finds the chest, but Davey Jones manages to stab will in the heart with jack holding Davey Jones' heart in his hand. at this moment, you can see how much Jack cares for will and Elizabeth by the look on his face. While bootstrap is climbing on Davey Jones, jack helps will stab Davey Jones' heart in order to live.<br/><br/>will and Elizabeth spend one day together on an island before he has to stay on his ship for 10 more years. while, jack and Barbossa head for the fountain of youth to gain immortality.<br/><br/>at the very end, they show Elizabeth and will's son, and will is back. his curse is lifted because he stayed loyal to his curse, and to Elizabeth.<br/><br/>i have this a 10 out of 10, because i feel the effects were good, acting was brilliant, and I think the story outline is magnificent."

","I was so excited to see this film. I loved the first Pirates, adored the second, and was anticipating a grand finale. Instead I left the theater feeling as though someone had cut MY heart out. The special effects were amazing, but the jokes seemed forced, set up, and sometimes not funny, though I did like the return of the two soldiers from the first movie. Granted I did laugh out loud, but as the film went on, I knew something was missing. Gibbs, one of my favorite characters, has only a cameo. Even Pintel and Raghetti were serious. This film felt as though it was written around the special effects (and as the last three Star Wars movies prove, that is not a good idea) and quickly banged together. I was disappointed. There are holes and unanswered questions in the plot that are brought up and never touched on again. For example: How is Jacks' dad immortal and his son not? But what killed me was the end! What did Will do to deserve that fate? Why not Jack or Barbossa (that would have been fitting) or even Norrington? Here was this great love story that had a stupid and tragic ending. Also, the scene with Will and Elizabeth getting married while killing people was a bit much. And don't get me started on the whole ending with Jack and the Black Pearl. I doubt I want to see this one again. I do not think my heart can take it."

","The only thing which really seems to slow Disney's PotC juggernaut is the love story. Swann and Turner just look too made-up and clean for all this grime, brine and sea life, which is such a stretch it seems to detract at times. I guess the love-interest must be there for mom's and dad's who are dragged into the cinema by the kids.<br/><br/>I've admired the versatile Bill Nighy's work in other films and he continues (with Geoffrey Rush) to be among the strongest actors, who project some menace and give the film some real meat, which is needed to balance so much silliness. These are supposed to be Pirates after all. I'm certain contemporary pirates consider this all high comedy as they board ships, take hostages, etc. Somewhere in the myth Disney has woven, we are probably forgetting what pirates were really about.<br/><br/>The tale is largely entertaining and a pretty good pace and thankfully no repeat of the tumbling through the jungle bits from PotC II.<br/><br/>Spoiler Warning! At the end, why the fleet turns away is completely a mystery. No character appears to challenge why they shouldn't be finishing off these scourges of the seven seas, they all just bugger off! Why? Oh, and wasn't that an Errol Flynn pose near the end by the new captain of the Flying Dutchman?"

","What a terrible waste this film is.<br/><br/>I approached this film with caution, knowing full well what to expect: mindless action, cheap dialogue and characters thinner than Keira Knightley. These are the trademarks of Jerry Bruckheimer movies. Sometimes it works: ""The Rock"", ""Top Gun"". Other times it doesn't: ""Bad Company"", THIS.<br/><br/>I should've known. After all, the second film took all the charm and wit and just balls-to-the-wall fun of the first film and flung it out of the window, in favour of a convoluted and overlong plot stuffed with needless tangents and frankly boring characters. Except for Davy Jones.<br/><br/>And there's the kicker.<br/><br/>Jones, who clearly outshone any other character except for Captain Jack was menacing in the second film. This one gives him all the venom of a neutered house cat with three legs. Seriously, you'd ant to mercy kill him out of pity after seeing this film---as a matter of fact his ultimate demise was very much pitiful. This film bored me with its extravagant use of expositionary scene that just chugged along at a leisurely pace. It was as if they all knew the money would roll in, so why bother with something exciting and fresh and new, when it can b big. just, BIG. Like really FAT.<br/><br/>What a disappointment. Every half hour or so a glimmer of shiny intelligence burned through the gluttonous mess that is POTC3. But too much dark and dreary story lines bogged it down. Half-asses acting from all but the two leads Rush and Depp reminded us all how childish things were. And the effects only served to rip us OUT of the scenery, not suck us in with all its might as I'm sure was the intention.<br/><br/>Poor Chow Yun Fat. Underused, and when he truly begins to show his acting chops, is then revealed to be a bullying potential rapist, and then killed unmercifully by happenstance. Oh, but not before he gives Knightley the McGuffin, which somehow redeems him in her eyes not two seconds later.<br/><br/>Disney film. Near-rapist. Lots of blood.

Jack Sparrow's character is no longer funny and merely gets irritating. There are many jokes which no-one in the cinema laughed at, and the writers completely failed at replicating the humor previously seen in the trilogy.<br/><br/>The plot has gone to ridiculous and pathetic fantasy whereas the previous movies had a halfway decent basis in normality it now becomes a boring fairytale.<br/><br/>In the last hour things liven up a bit and there is some good action, suspense, tension and drama. Then you sit through ten minutes of credits to see the most pointless 10yrs later you have ever seen.<br/><br/>If you don't see this movie your not missing much but if you must see it i recommend getting someone to fill you in and coming in halfway through.

"kevin_crighton","5","2","5","27 May 2007"," At World's End? More like when will it end.. (plot details mentioned)
","This movie suffers in the same way that the recent Spider-man 3 suffered. First it is far too long. The second is that it trys to cover all the plot threads left over from Dead Man's Chest. But because of this, it has to cram in too much dialogue explaining whose doing what to whom (there are so many crosses, double-crosses, triple crosses going on you won't keep up) and tries to cover up any plot holes with burst of action. However the result of this, is that the film is boring at times.<br/><br/>The plot is so convoluted, that I won't even try and explain it. Suffice it to say it involves rescuing Jack Sparrow from Davy Jones Locker, rescuing Will Turner's father from the Flying Dutchman, and dealing with the company trying to wipe out all pirates.<br/><br/>There are many things wrong with this movie. As stated it's too convoluted in plot, the scenes at time make no sense, as if the writers are making it up as they go from scene to scene. But the main fault, sadly lies with the director Gore Verbinski.<br/><br/>First, someone needed to reign in Johhny Depp's performance. He's so over the top, I doubt he's landed yet. The first appearance he makes in this movie, we see more than one Captain Jack and it's a scene that's just silly. The other main problem comes from an important plot thread.. the romance between Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley. Sadly both actors simply fail to convince as the lovers. The scenes they have together show no romance or spark that was there in the first movie. This could be down to the writers, but I feel stronger direction was needed.<br/><br/>As for the rest of the cast, Skellan Skarsgard and Chow Yun-Fat are wasted. Geoffery Rush at least has some fun, as does Bill Nighy. However Nighy's performance is hampered by the love sub-plot revealed here his character had in the past with Naomie Harris's Tia/Calypso character. It reveals the past of Davy Jones, but at the same time, weakens the character.<br/><br/>Speaking of which... consider this : Davy Jones, evil henchman of Lord Beckett (who wants to wipe out the Pirates). Bad guy turning good... Barbossa. Weedy hero, Will Turner, tough female character Elizabeth Swann. Wise cracking charmer Jack Sparrow. Am I the only one to see connections to a certain 6-movie space saga? Should this be called Pirates 3 : Return Of The Sparrow? Just a thought...<br/><br/>There are some good things in this movie. The CGI and special effects are impressive (and they should be if this movie cost a reputed $200m!). Also the action sequences are well shot and handled.<br/><br/>However for a movie of this budget and scale I feel there is no real effort going on. Like The Matrix series, I feel the makers were so surprised at the success of the original Priates movie (which was fun and funny), and decided the way to go was to make another 2 movies. And like the Matrix sequels, it suffers from the fact that both didn't need sequels.<br/><br/>If the do decide to make a 4th movie, and then ending does leave the possibility open, I hope they give the writers time to come up with a good plot and script BEFORE filming starts.<br/><br/>Otherwise it'll be more of the same... and that would be a bad thing, no matter how much money it makes."

","Before I say anything else, everyone here is very likable, even those people who seem to have walked in from central casting as props or decoration. The main players are back, each competing with each other for time and attention, probably a bit more selfish, this time out. Johnny Depp plays or appears confused as to how much money he seems to be making in this ""sequel"". There are some very impressive special effects, way too many of them this time out, and though I would like to enjoy each and everyone of them, I think I would probably not want to sit through this very lengthy and not very exciting film.<br/><br/>First of all, the resolution of the cliffhanger is dealt with shabbily, as we see our friends on their way to Jack's rescue. Unfortunately, along the way, with a get a bit of existentialism, double talk, and plenty of confusing story lines that become more and more tangled along the way, as those never ending conversations are interrupted over and over by some semi exciting special effects.<br/><br/>Once in a while, there is hint of what made the first film so enjoyable, as Deep's Jack is back with a flash of his personality. Fleshing out the other characters appear to have been problematic for the ""writers"" of this entry as they give each character a chance to explore part of their personalities we have never seen before. There is no subtlety here, no opportunity to show how good of an actor anyone can be. Knightley suddenly changes into a ""leader"", Bloom shows his dark side, Rush, well, continues to mystify us, and the other characters continue to be window dressing.<br/><br/>Moral of the story: More money means more revelations, more time, more noise, more of almost everything, except a good story.

It wasn't even all that funny. I almost fell asleep, I was about to and then Will asked Elizabeth to marry him and that interested me more. There were so many loose ends that need to be explained. One thing I particularly liked about the movie was Elizabeth's role in the entire thing. She is an extremely strong and independent woman, who doesn't take and crap from any of the men on bored the ship. If she wasn't there I don't think they would have made it that far. Overall I'd give it a 3/5 stars. I would not recommend spending movie ticket prices, wait till it comes out on DVD"
"ckelly1219","5","3","11","26 May 2007"," Disney ruins a potentially good film.
","I found this film extremely disappointing. It was all special effects and no story line. While some viewers may be impressed enough with the non stop action and sword fights, I hold onto the hope that there are still people like me who go to see a movie for a story. The ending of the movie seemed to be a failed attempt to make a week story line good. (Spoiler coming): Instead of the ending with Elizabeth and Will being together forever, there was a twist that Will is now immortal and Elizabeth is doomed to grow old and die. Well, at least until the fourth installment of the movie, where they will find the Fountain of Youth.<br/><br/>With all the money put into this movie and knowing it would be their best selling film of the year, Disney should have put a bit more cash into the story. The best actors and the best special effects are mediocre without a story."

","I've just watched ""At World's End"" and I was very disappointed with this final film..The ""Curse of the Black Pearl"" was awesome, even ""Dead Man's Chest"" despite what most people say,was very good. These two films had something new to say, both in plot and in special effects..But ""At World's End""? Even the action scenes were not so many in this third movie and I don't think there is a scene that will be memorable in this film. My expectations were great for a finale that would ""rock"", however, this film had nothing great in it..I'm a big fan of Jack Sparrow, but there was something missing ""At World's End"".

","I posted this comment in one of the msg boards but it was more of a mini review. Here it goes.<br/><br/>SPOILERS, BIG SPOILERS AHEAD.<br/><br/>I just got out of watching pirates and i think they should have never made the 2 sequels. Number one was amazing and Hollywood went ahead and did what it does best, MILK the franchise.<br/><br/>i had a lot of problems with this movie. I agree with a lot of comments on this board about how the movie lacked a lot of logic and had big plot holes. If you play the game and beat it i think the ending in the game is far better that this movie. Capt. Norington was not killed by will turners dad but by the guy with the scarred face (his assistant i think) which makes more sense since norrington helps Elizabeth and her crew escape, there is no will and Elizabeth romance session on the beach (he just promises he will ba back for her), Will turner doesn't get stabbed by davy jones, but jack sparrow passes the heart on to him before Davy was about to kill him so he stabbed it (it was much more effective i thought), and lastly i hated how they left Jack Sparow on the dock. In the game they actually have another mutiny like in the first movie and dump him in a little raft which would have been a lot funnier.<br/><br/>The whole Calipso thing was wasted, Chow yin was wasted, i hated the fact that the two ships were firing at each other in the storm but in fact the ships are both are at such an angle (facing towards the hole) so the cannon balls would never connect and would just hit the water, after Will turner and jack sparrow sink the last ship you see all the other pirates ( the main 8 pirates) yelling and celebrating, what was there purpose, they didn't do *beep* but watch. They didn't do anything but put out the 9 pieces that helped bring calipso out of her body which in turn didn't do anything to the plot.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the humor was downgraded big time. The movie has lost the charm the first one had and focused on action. I loved the first one because of Capt Jack sparrow and i want to watch the pirates movies because of Capt Jack sparrow. He made the first movie so special and different. The biggest surprise and delight was definitely Barbosa. I think this movie was all bout him and he was phenomenal. I really enjoyed his role. If it weren't for him i would totally despise this movie.<br/><br/>I hope they actually make another pirates but i think they should go back to the beginning and do a prequel. With only jack sparrow and barbosa and the likes and just focus on what made the first one so damn good. Great story with great humor and a lot of heart. This movie was a big let down unfortunately. I will give it another shot on DVD when it comes out we'll see if i think differently of it then, i doubt it though.<br/><br/>All in all i was very let down by this movie and was expecting so much better. Go in with lower expectations and you might enjoy it. It doesn't do justice to the first pirates movie which was excellent.<br/><br/>5 out of 10"
"shanayneigh","2","3","11","24 May 2007"," Kill your darlings
","Well, now I've seen the third installment in the Pirates franchise. I'm not very impressed. The things that felt fresh in the first movie now just feel tedious.<br/><br/>For example, captain Jacks queer-positive antics which gave the first movie some spark now are a bit dull. You can fell how they are trying to cash in on his style by cramming as much of it in the two sequels as possible, and you feel a bit fed up with it after a while and wish they'd just get on with the story. The introduction to Jack in the third movie (surely it can't be a spoiler that he returns in this one?) is a scene that just goes on and on. It may have been five minutes long, but it felt like it dragged on for half an hour. The whole scene feels constructed to give the audience as much of wacky Jacks crazy antics as possible. I say alright already. And this come from someone who loves Johnny Depp as an actor.<br/><br/>The first hour of the film is tedious, and it's already now dragging its heels (sadly, it doesn't get much better). Why oh why does it have to be three hours long! Verbinski just has got to learn how to kill his darlings. Yes, battles are fun and special effects are cool, but if it goes on for too long it just gets plain boring (especially the final battle).<br/><br/>Unfortunately I can't remember where I read it, but I think it was Bloom (I may be wrong) who said that there was some confusion while shooting the movie because of the ever changing script. Rather, I'd say that the crew made it up as they went along. The story is messy and the dialogue as poorly written (I never did get the ""Aaargh, matey"" captain from the Simpsons out of my head).<br/><br/>I quite liked Orlando Bloom in Kingdom of Heaven (not the crapfest I expected it to be) and Keira Knightley, well she's Keira Knightley, what can I say (be still my heart!). But the couple has zero chemistry on screen. You really don't get what she sees in Blooms character (or is it just me that's jealous?).<br/><br/>The special effects are OK, which I think is a result from how quickly you grow accustomed to things. I remember seeing the first installment and was insanely impressed by the special effects, especially the scene in the cave where Depp and Rush are fighting, where they run in and out of the moonlight. Still one of the best special effects sequences I've seen. In the second movie the thing that made me raise my eyebrows was the crew of the Flying Dutchman, and especially Bill Nighy's character. But this time around most things were met by a big yawn and a wish that they'd move on with the story instead.<br/><br/>Spend your money on David Fincher's Zodiac instead. Yes, it's a totally different genre, and yes it's slow. But it's still the best movie to be released this summer (so far)."

","Film smart, and me to spit on the some people, maybe, defects in a plot, I shall repeat, film smart!<br/><br/>Playing all of favourite hero Jhonny Depp is still magnificent. Places even it is unduly magnificent. Nigtley is beautiful and courageous. Orlando Bloom also is beautiful and not less brave. Veils looks good. Dzheffri Rush looks good doubly. Volume Chollander is aristocratical, cold and prudent. Bill Naji still finds in himself forces to play, not paying attention to the octopus sticked to the person. Actors are faultless. All of them are absolute on the places. A gigantomania  very dangerous piece. It is more, more dearly and more longly  does not mean better. Too many subject lines. It is too much characters. It is too much events. Too many magnificent stages. Too many impressing effects. Even for a picture going almost three hours. The third « Pirates of the Caribbean » have turned out gripping show: The present kaleidoscope with grandiose slaughter in the ending in which two greatest courts in history  « the Black pearl » and « the Flying Dutch », at last, will have a chance to find out who from them is greater. Over the screen dominate dark tone  grey and black. The storm is in the sea. It is raining. Treachery becomes norm in mutual relations. Many stages in a context of the trilogy look unexpectedly severe. Now here quite seriously kill people, including some heroes, grown fond to the spectator by the previous parts. But do not worry, the traditional piracy humour anywhere has not got to, maybe, became only hardly to more cynical. The ending at a picture too ambiguous, at least, absolute happy-end here also does not smell, but the history has turned out very beautiful. The main thing, that it leaves many opportunities for creation of continuation. So there are bases to believe, that we do not say goodbye to Jack.<br/><br/>« Pirates of the Caribbean : at World's end is a film which needs to be looked. Imagine, that you are on board the ship, and the captain very much calls in a bell  there, behind horizon, on your ship begins approach the most picturesque, bewitching and unforgettable tsunami. Unless you refuse to look at it? The tsunami is this picture."

","Taking aside very good special effects, the movie was a true disappointment. As always this type of movie doesn't even try to follow an intelligible screenplay. They make sure to satisfy the 12-25 male fans with their penchant for action, gore and stupid jokes, and completely forget that girls and women make more than half of the audience. Poor Keira Knightly, whose performance has been much maligned both by professional critics and common fans,actually play the only character that shows some brains and some development. And really, her acting wasn't any worse than Orlando Bloom's and the rest of a very poor supporting cast. She deserved better lines and she deserved a happy ending. But no, happy endings are not cool any more as this summer has proved. The writers and producers make sure that in the end she showed some skin (again for the benefit of the 12-25 male fans)and get to kiss the boyfriend (for the benefit of Orlando's teenage fans), but after that, shipped him off to the Land of the Dead only to be reunited with her every 10 years for a single night of sex. He would be immortal and she will age and die. Whoever came up with that stupid ending should be writing for Wrestlemania. As for Jack, played beautifully by Johnny Depp, his verbal pyrotechnics that made his character famous in the first movie, simply did not work this time. I found myself trying too hard to laugh at Jack's stale jokes, more out of loyalty for Johnny Depp than because they were funny at all. And really 10 Jacks was way too much. As for Orlando, I have to be honest. He is just another pretty face. He should take some acting lessons. Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End will find itself in the company of other cinematic disappointments like the Episodes (1,2,3, and 6) of Star Wars. Strong female characters ended up like disposable Barbie dolls (remember Princess Padme and Leia). But worst of all the producers desire for merchandising their product ruined the whole point of the story."

","* There be spoilers below*<br/><br/>I LOVED Curse of the Black Pearl. I liked DMC, although I wasn't too keen on the fact that, unlike CotBP, it wasn't a stand alone movie. And now, having waited all those months to finally have everything wrapped up... what happened???? This ending was most unsatisfactory, and overall the film was the least entertaining, amusing and gripping of all three.<br/><br/>Firstly, after all that, Will and Elizabeth aren't even together! In fact they're further apart than they've ever been, when I was under the impression that one of the plot's constants was them getting together! How disappointing and unfair to the characters and the paying public! <br/><br/>Secondly, there was absolutely nothing new. Much of the humour was reliant on previous films (poppet/the wooden eye/parlay/no rum/sea turtles etc). There were no new effects - Davy Jones wasn't as repulsive as before because we'd already seen it. And really there were no new characters - Chow Yun Fat was barely in it, and as for Keith Richards? What did he actually do in those 2 minutes that was essential to the story?<br/><br/>And now for the myriad little niggles:<br/><br/><ul><li>Why make such a fuss of the pirate lords when they did absolutely nothing? </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>What was the purpose of Calypso/the witch (Like we didn't see that coming a mile away)? She turned into crabs. Wow.

Why on earth would Davy Jones be intimidated by him? </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>I honestly lost track of who was backstabbing or allying with whom. Why make it so convoluted to the point that any plot line disappeared? </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>What was the point of the hangings at the beginning?? </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Jack becomes less and less likable - he's selfish, shallow and cowardly.

","At World's End should have been called: We Don't Know What We Are Doing -Part 2.<br/><br/>Nothing about this film worked. The plot was nonsense, the acting overdone, and the exposition everywhere. It was a train wreck from beginning to end except that train wrecks generally occur because of one or two problems. A better analogy for this disaster of a film would be that it was akin to the black plague. The disease was everywhere, infecting all, ...no one was safe.<br/><br/>The whole movie seemed vomited forth from the deep recesses of some terrible marketing place specializing in spawning singularly crap. Of course, this is what most people had the good sense to predict. Still, there is something about me that likes pirate movies and I had just watched Treasure Island at the Alley the day before.<br/><br/>As with the other two films, the opening was filled with intrigue. Dozens and dozens of people walk single file on their way to the gallows. A chorus rises and every damned soul sings a song calling for justice.<br/><br/>At this point I thought, ""maybe."" But no. no, no, no. The plot oozed forth, slowly, sluggishly, like so much venom and bile from the Kraken ...who at least had the good sense to die off screen.<br/><br/>I would take time to describe my disgust with every single scene random and confused, clever but not smart, visually interesting but bereft of purpose, defaulting and settling for disgusting, etc. However, that would suggest I cared enough about the universe of Pirates to try and make sense of the story they offered.<br/><br/>All I'll reveal is that the climax of the movie occurs amid a maelstrom created by Calypso, the goddess of the sea and the betrayed lover of Captain Davy Jones. The East Indian Trading Company is there, Davy Jones is there, ah who cares. Perhaps it was intended, but I rooted for the maelstrom -the perfect metaphor for the plot, the development, and the frenzied, out of focus action, etc. I wanted every character dead, really dead, not brought back to life dead.<br/><br/>...I wanted Calypso to pull a lever and flush the entire pirate universe down the proverbial commode.<br/><br/>It wasn't funny, inspiring, good, fun, enjoyable, or entertaining on any level. I hated every single second this story stole from me because I liked the initial concept so much. The directors and producers and actors and story hackers should all take a lesson from the Kraken."

","When I reviewed PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: DEAD MAN’S CHEST (2006), I had complained that the producers forsook plot for sheer bombast. They seem to have made up for this by swamping us this time around with a variety of plot threads, none of which is remotely interesting, but the result is an inflated running-time of almost 3 hours! <br/><br/>The multiple clashes, double-crosses, schemes, incarcerations – to say nothing of the myriad factions (and monsters) involved – necessitate an excessive amount of exposition, which I could feel made the audience I saw it with quite restless! Besides, its incongruous smattering of intellectual elements – multiple Johnny Depps, Stellan Skarskard’s repeated greeting – must have gone over the heads of most of its intended audience!! Still, I think that the lengthy surrealist sequence which belatedly introduces the Jack Sparrow character here is a very surprising highlight for a blockbuster film in this day and age.<br/><br/>Even so, Depp and Orlando Bloom merely sleepwalk through their roles – but the film does make better use of Keira Knightley this time around. There‘s also the welcome (if hammy) return of Geoffrey Rush, while Chow-Yun-Fat’s Asian pirate gang adds a nice exotic touch (if little else). The repellent special effects aren’t as prominent as in the previous entry – but the black witch’s role (whose dialogue is largely unintelligible) is regrettably elevated to a major supporting one! The best moment is probably the 360-degree turn the ship makes, and the original wedding ceremony its most inventive bit. Overall, the film results in being more enjoyable than DEAD MAN’S CHEST – but the formula is clearly over-baked and, therefore, unpalatable in the long run…"
"rosian","4","2","6","3 June 2007"," Totally substandard Part 3 to Pirates
","Parents of younger children should be aware there is a very unpleasant first scene, especially relating to a young boy, that might cause some distress. And there's one particularly sordid sex ""joke"" later in the movie that Disney should be ashamed of.<br/><br/>Black Pearl was always going to be a hard movie to follow as was so amazingly unexpected superlative fun, full of surprises. World's End is a HUGE disappointment. Full of visual delights and great music again, but the storyline is incomprehensible - someone behind me remarked during the interval exactly what I was thinking - ""What is going on?"" It's even worse if you can't remember or didn't understand everything in Pirates 2 which is also confused at times but nothing like as much as this one. There is also an immense amount of background noise in Pirates 3 with sea sounds and fighting and music all of which is tremendously atmospheric and I love it but it does at times drown out what some actors are saying.<br/><br/>It's hard at times to tell who's supposed to be the star of this movie. It's absolutely ages before wonderful Jack Sparrow appears on screen. His whole part in this movie is so mediocre I felt really angry at the waste of this great star's talents and especially as Jack is the centrepiece of Pirates. I expected him to be on screen nearly all the time. Instead it seems Keira Knightley has become the star as she's continually shoved at us in spite of being completely out of her depth, as a raucous masculinised harridan bellowing and bawling when she's inexplicably made the Pirate Leader. It was bad enough that she was taken away from the partnership with Orlando Bloom and pitched against Johnny Depp in Dead Man's Chest forcing Depp to have to underact persistently in a number of extremely boring and silly scenes with her. In this movie it's far worse as she not only has to act against Depp but also against several other experienced and very strong actors - notably Geoffrey Rush but also Chow Yun Fat (much under-used, regrettably), and also mysterious and superlative Calypso who would have been an excellent foil to Depp but instead is placed as Davy Jones's lover. Knightley just isn't experienced enough nor suited to be more than Will's feisty girl-friend in this story. <br/><br/>I suppose this elevation of Knightley to top star or equal top star is intended to demonstrate equal rights for women or an increased earning power since a great deal of studio publicity put out about her in recent times. <br/><br/>As for Will, his lovely character in Pirates 1 and acceptable part in Pirates 2 have now become a mediocrity frantically searching for his dead father who's on the Dutchman ship, in order to save him; and confusingly seeming to switch from side to side. But most of the time Will is either missing from the screen or given little to do when visible. There's an attempt eventually to raise his profile in killing him off so he can become the Dutchman's legendary captain but brave decent Will isn't remotely suited to this tragic fate - compare with the marvellous performance by James Mason in an old movie years ago. Bloom does his best with his parting from Elizabeth whose harridanship has calmed down a bit at last. I heard a child in the audience anguishedly exclaim no, no, when Will is killed and I echoed that. <br/><br/>Jack, however, goes back to basics in the last scene  a brilliant reminder of the start of Black Pearl. But it's only a cameo. How much better this movie would be if Jack had become captain of the Dutchman and sailed the seas forever as he wants to do. Instead he deliberately allows Will to die and be forced into that role after an infuriatingly bad scene.<br/><br/>Geoffrey Rush is absolutely marvellous and has a far better part than Depp - this time they aren't equals as Depp has so little worthwhile script. Again I couldn't abide Bill Nighy's Davy Jones octopus facemask, it's horrid, and I couldn't remember why he was crawling to the British villain. Wonderful to see Keith Richard as Jack's father but why for only a few minutes on screen? Heroic Norrington (Jack Davenport) who was so splendid as Elizabeth's other suitor in Pirates 1 and 2 is completely wasted in Pirates 3 other than in an heroic death. There's a nice cameo for Jonathan Pryce as Elizabeth's dead father.<br/><br/>By the way, when the sea battle started, the East India Company ships must have numbered in the dozens or even hundreds, filling the skyline. Then the EIC flagship has a fight with the 2 main pirate ships and all the EIC ships must have made off because they don't join the fight and next thing we know, the 2 pirate ships have won and there's no sign of any other EIC ships. <br/><br/>It seems there's a post-credits scene. But of course we didn't see it and I wonder if anyone in our cinema did as I expect the credits lasted as credits usually do these days for about 10 mins. I do hate it when film makers set out to trick us like this, presumably in order to force us to see the movie again or buy the DVD to find out what we missed. But a kind person in the blogs has given us the detail - thanks for that."
"cosmic_quest","5","2","6","31 May 2007"," Fair but, please, let the franchise rest now
","After the rather dismal 'Dead Man's Chest', I was worried that we'd get more of the same in this film to the point where I actually wavered on whether I should see it or not. However, thankfully, 'Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End' reclaimed some of the sparkle on the franchise that the second film lost. This film sees Will, Elizabeth and Barbossa strive to rescue Jack from the world of death itself as Cutler Beckett plots to rid the seas of all pirates.<br/><br/>In terms of the characters, I felt as if there wasn't enough interaction between Will, Jack and Elizabeth as each went in their own direction and the film suffered as a result since these are meant to be the main characters. It was the minor characters who had more of a presence, especially in the comedy scenes. The crew of the Pearl were fleshed out more to a degree that they were actually more interesting than the three leads. Duos Mackenzie Crook and Lee Arenberg, in the role of the Black Pearl's not-too-bright crew members, and Angus Barnett and Giles New, as representing the daft section of the British Navy as Mullrog and Murtogg, were all hilarious in scenes that were probably the best of the film. Jack Davenport's Norrington brought some sense of drama to the film and it's a shame he wasn't used more. Also, under-used was Keith Richards, who played Jack's father. It felt as if he was brought in just for the sake of 'look who's play Jack's dad' and the role seemed to serve little purpose.<br/><br/>The special effects were top-notch, especially when it came to the battle scenes and the Flying Dutchman crew, however, gone were the days when films could coast on dazzling CGI. Plot is what counts. This time around, there was less tedious, over-long scenes designed to amuse small children in the audience (a la 'Dead Man's Chest') but there were many things that could have been improved on. The storyline was rather clunky and choppy as it tried to build up to the final battle between the pirates and the English. It felt as if the scriptwriter just wanted to have a juicy battle but there was little thought put into how to get to that point in a logical manner. The plot wasn't helped by the fact there was no character development for the three leads, who were all reduced to bit parts, thus leaving the film struggling to link to the first two of the trilogy.<br/><br/>If you were disappointed with 'Dead Man's Chest', it is worth seeing this film to see all was not lost but don't expect anything of the excellence of the first film. It's good as a means of spending an afternoon but it won't bowl over many people over fourteen. And certainly, it will left me hoping this was the end and there would be no fourth film. It's time Hollywood learns that it can't just rely on special effects and actors' good looks to sell films to intelligent cinema-goers."

","As expected, this third installment of ""Pirate"" is the sort of movie that is vastly entertaining while you are watching it, but immediately forgettable once the end credit starts to roll. In a sense, this one is modeled out of the same mould as its two predecessors  too long but with a redeeming last 45 minutes. I particularly enjoy the excitement of the finale. Had I been equipped with the experience of a frantic high attained from drug usage, I would probably be able to better describe the feeling from watching it. Anyhow, this is about two ships locked in a titanic combat, whirling round and round the vortex of a hedious sink hole in the roaring ocean. Right in the middle of it, among numerous other things, you have a wedding going on.<br/><br/>The plots have been enriched. In addition to the continuing quests (Will Turner trying to save his father, Davy Jones trying to save his heart and everybody trying to save Jack Sparrow) we now have the conference of the 9 pirate chiefs to decide whether they should release terrifying sea goddess Calypso from the bond they put her in ten years ago. There is of course treachery piled upon treachery, with double-, triple- and multiple- crossing anywhere you turn. But none of these matter. You're just in for one hell of a big roller-coaster ride.<br/><br/>Hong Kong audience will be happy to see that despite the banal stereotyped Fu Manchu packaging, Chow Yun-fat has a rather sympathetic role, even when that is pirate chief Captain Sao Feng. He certainly has his fair share of mischief but as mentioned above, everybody is betraying everybody else. He comes out almost a hero, of sorts.<br/><br/>In addition to the video and audio pleasures, the fantastic cast is another attraction. While Chow is the new addition, the whole gang from the previous installments is here. Of the top three billings, it comes as a mild surprise that Johnny Depp hasn't got more screen time - a wise strategy though, as this is really an ensemble movie. Orlando Bloom and Heira Knightley do their usual hero and heroine thing, as Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann. Geoffrey Rush who appeared for only two minutes in Pirate 2 as the resurrected Barbossa gets some compensation this time, in a much heavier role that places him and Depp into a sort of odd-couple duo. With most of his face covered in tentacles, Bill Nighy is amazingly effective acting mainly with his mouth to communicate some rather complex emotions of Davy Jones.<br/><br/>The rest of the delightful and impressive cast include: <br/><br/>Ultimate bad guy Lord Cutler Beckett is Tom Hollander who was such a funny Mr Collins in ""Pride and Prejudice"" (2005) <br/><br/>Witch Tia Dalma is Naomie Harris who was so impressive as Selena in ""28 days later"" (2002) and also appeared recently in ""Miami vice""(2006) <br/><br/>Appearing briefly as the dead Governor Swann (Elizabeth's father) in limbo is veteran Jonathan Pryce, whom some might be best remember as Juan Peron in ""Evita"" (1996)or Gabe in De-lovely (2004), or any of his other fine works.<br/><br/>Will's father ""Bootstrap"" Bill Turner is Stellan Skarsgard, Cerdic in ""King Arthur"" (2004) or Father Merrin in ""Prelude to the Exorcist"" (2005), whichever you prefer.<br/><br/>And there are lots more."

Then let's move on to why it sucks.<br/><br/>First: Massive portions of both this film and its predecessor (Dead Man's Chest) were completely ludicrous and seemed to have been invented as the writers went along. Insane sequences come out of seemingly nowhere and magically solve whatever current boring problem the heroes (who we hardly care about by this point) are trying to solve.<br/><br/>Example: Every part of the crew's attempt to bring Jack Sparrow back from his untimely fate in Davy Jones' Locker. I don't have any problem with magic in movies, but when it has no rules and seemingly no logic or any mechanism of restriction (other than what the writers want it to do for them), how can I be expected to come anywhere close to suspending my disbelief? Other examples of this complete disregard for plausibility within the writers' story include: Davy Jones' seemingly endless and unexplained powers. The out-of-nowhere revelation about the stabbing of his heart (which should have been set up in the previous movie). The unnecessary and unexplained plot device of Sparrow's find-what-you-want-most compass. Sao Feng's magical maps, also completely unexplained. Barbarosa's almost completely dismissed reappearance.<br/><br/>Other holes in logic appear throughout the story, but I won't spend the time displaying them all. You get the point.<br/><br/>The second major problem is the complete lack of concern for the characters. There is entirely too much backstabbing in this film. Not only is it confusing (how many times did you wonder who was trying to accomplish what and for what reason? Be honest.) It completely undermines their relationships and frankly makes them very unlikeable. They all seem willing to betray each other at the drop of a hat; Yes, they're pirates, but in the first movie they were pirates with honor and friendship. Now all they seem to care about is their own selfish desires. So even when I understood what they were trying to accomplish with their endless betrayals (which was only occasionally), I didn't really care because they were all such friendless bastards that I had no desire to watch them pop through another implausible misadventure.<br/><br/>Oh yeah, and what was with that whole East India Trading Company storyline? Did anyone else find it pointless and its conclusion entirely unsatisfying and unbelievable? Finally, I'd like to make a note to all movie screenwriters and directors who might read this review: Just because you can show something with computer graphics and make it look incredibly realistic, that doesn't mean it could actually happen or that you can make me believe that it could actually happen. Show a little restraint, please. We don't need to see Jack Sparrow swinging around on ropes with crazy abandon for fifteen minutes in a row. Even Tarzan never accomplished the kind of crazy swinging acrobatics Jack did in this sequence. I miss the days when technology forced you to show a little restraint in what you make appear on the screen; it made things so much less... Ludicrous.<br/><br/>After all of this criticism, I'd like to point out there there were a few things I liked about the movie. Though it showed up at inappropriate moments at times, the wit and slapstick humor did make me laugh. The beginning and ending were actually fairly decent, if you ignore the crazy special effect-driven insanity I just mentioned. Some of the core ideas would have been good if they had been executed much better.<br/><br/>Of course, executing them well would have required rewriting both this and the previous film into a single, simplified, tidied up story. Which is what the filmmakers should have done. This current obsession with trilogies is ridiculous, and is constantly sabotaging what could have otherwise been great pairs of movies.<br/><br/>Let me wrap this lengthy review up by stating frankly that I wish I had never wasted three hours on this movie. It was boring, confusing, and the few tiny bright spots couldn't come close to making up for the near-complete lack of planning on the part of the writers. Three stars in generous, but what the hell. I like Johnny Depp."

"davidleach2000-1","6","2","6","29 May 2007"," Chat, chat, chat, Action, double cross. Repeat for 2 hours.
","I wanted to like this film. I REALLY wanted to like this film. I went along to the opening day's very first performance, to avoid the all the whooping, shouting and talking associated with an evening performance. I'd enjoyed the first two films. The first more so than the second and had been eager to see the third instalment.<br/><br/>Well, it looked good. It was well acted, the art direction and special effects were - as you would expect - excellent and I enjoyed the first hour. But by the second hour I was bored. Bored, bored, bored, bored, bored. I looked at my watch. I fidgeted. I went to the loo. I lost interest in the characters and found each tedious plot twist more annoying than the last.<br/><br/>There was simply far too much of everything in this film. Too much plot, too many characters - all with their own agendas, too many double crosses and betrayals, too many loose ends and too much chat. Chat, chat chat. Endless chat, over written chat. In the first hour this was quite enjoyable but come the second, I just wanted someone to shout -""Will you just stop waffling, and get to the point!""<br/><br/>And, while I'm compiling a list of things, too many CLOSE UP's of yellow eyed people (why did nearly every character have to have yellow contact lens?)<br/><br/>The music was over blown all the time and the all-out comedy moments became very irritating. But my main beef was the running time! 2 hours 47 minutes! Why did it have to be so long? It was flabby and could easily have done with a 30 minute trim.<br/><br/>That's not to say there weren't moments I loved. Jack's first appearance was excellent the portrayal of a man unhinged by loneliness was funny and touching as was the fantasy elements with the sea of crabs. Keira Knightly's and Johhny Depp's performance was first class but the true star was Geoffry Rush, his Captain Barbosa was the true star of the film.<br/><br/>I felt horribly cheated by the final confrontation, we were lead to believe it was going to be an epic sea battle, akin to the space battle of Return of the Jedi, between the 'Company' fleet and the massed ranks of the pirates. In the end it came down to 2 ships and a whirl pool. Spectacular for sure but oddly uninspiring, 'Oh, what a lovely bit of CG'. As the camera twirled around the two ships for the umpteenth time and CG animated Davy Jones and Jack Sparrow clashed swords.<br/><br/>What happened to the two opposing fleets? Why didn't they engage each other? And why did the Tom Hollander's character Lord Cutler Beckett just give up without a fight? Admitadely his death was superb - one of the film's high lights, but I wanted him to put up a fight or at least get involved, he deserved a fight to the death for all the wickedness he brought. But no, just a big budget rehash of an old All Saints video.<br/><br/>I couldn't wait for this to end and rushed out just as the end credits began. Normally I'd stay and read them out of respect to the crew but not this time. 2 hours 47 minutes of my time was more than enough. Besides, I had a bus to catch.<br/><br/>Modern films and this franchise in particular have, IMHO, almost zero repeat factor. Watch them at the cinema then never again. I had tried to watch #2 again - I'd not seen it since it was first released at the cinema and I got quickly bored by it and fell asleep. The first film I own on DVD and have only seen once. Classic films have the ability to reward you each time you watch them, sadly not the case with this series, watch them once then discard. Remember them as a fond memory."

","This is the first movie I've actually gone to a theater to see in months and I'm sorry I wasted my money! The sea scenes visual effects were awesome, but Singapore? Too murky, too tangled, too much everything to impress. The plot has gone AWOL, the humor is stale, there are too many new characters, some characters get ""killed"" for no apparent reason, and the main characters have lost their strength and interest--they should have left Sparrow in Davey Jones' locker and Barbosa dead and let Will and Elizabeth get on with their lives! Maybe I'm dense but the hints were vague and didn't necessarily lead to the results, some of the action led to dead ends--no pun intended--and the dialogue didn't move what little story there was along. The ending was unexpected and didn't wrap the story up. I was left with more questions than answers."
"DICK STEEL","9","2","6","24 May 2007"," A Nutshell Review: At World's End
","First things first, you must stay until the end of credits for a scene which truly ends the movie proper, in a bittersweet manner, full of love and fulfilled promises, especially after you've experienced the double, triple, quadruple crossings in Pirates 2 which carried over onto this final chapter.<br/><br/>I can't help but compare this trilogy to that of the Wachowski Brother's Matrix movies, only in the way the two sequels are presented in structure. Like Reloaded, Pirates Dead Man's Chest introduced new depth into the established mythos of the standalone original, which made some folks wonder why as they got confused with new characters, new motivations, and plenty of mumbo jumbo. Making things worse, it ended with a cliffhanger of supposed death (you don't really think they'd kill him off do you?) leading directly into the events of the concluding part three.<br/><br/>Like Revolutions, Pirates At World's End wastes no time and dives right into the rescue mission to save the (audience's) beloved Jack Sparrow (come to think of it, the original Star Wars trilogy is like that too, but I digress), who is stuck in a similar limbo where nothing works. And there are plenty of scenes in this movie which played on Depp's character popularity, which made you wonder just what the point is, if not just to elicit some cheap laughs which sometimes don't work.<br/><br/>And with the much touted, expensive sets of Singapore, you wonder what's the point too. During Pirates Dead Man's Chest, there was a teaser of sorts about Singapore being a locale in the Pirates mythos, after being mentioned a number of times in the franchise thus far. And the hype continued with news about the sets, and the casting coup of Chow Yun-Fat as a pirate from Singapore. OK, some historical liberties were taken, but when presented, it really was much ado about nothing. You get to see sets (artificially done of course), not locales, and much of it is at night, so ""Singapore"" was relegated to what can be deemed like a bad backlot set with poor lighting. Lasting 20 minutes, and given you can't see much, made you yearn for the pirates to hit the high seas, pronto!<br/><br/>As much as Singapore the locale was wasted, Chow was wasted too, having being the last minute merovingian-like character added to the concluding trilogy whose value is only a map, some men, and a junk. But the lucky bastard got to snog Keira Knightley and I'm jealous. Anyway the shady wheelings and dealings continue, between characters, and with the switching of allegiances which you'll come close to losing, almost. It's like a movie version of Survivor, and the best way to survive this is to think through and focus, while you're watching, the individual character motivation and their objective, which brings on some working of the noodle fun.<br/><br/>Where we last left our jolly crew, Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) is gone, and the relationship between Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) is on the rocks because the latter was caught snogging Sparrow by the former, Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) is brought back to life, while Davy Jones (Bill Nighy) is collaborating with the East India Company, much against his wishes, assisting them in making all pirates see the end of days. Holding the key to save Jack is Chow's Captain Sao Feng of Singapore, as new alliances, betrayals and businesses are formed.<br/><br/>Fans of either Bloom or Depp will find their idols absent for significant portions during the movie's first half especially, while the spotlight is set on Knightley, and the introduction of new elements in the Pirate's lore, law and the theme of love. In particular, this movie contrasts quite clearly the love between Turner and Swann, and that of Davy Jones and his, though there are cringeworthy moments in the former's, especially during the climatic battle hinted at in the trailers. Fatherly love too was touched upon briefly for all our 3 main characters, with the highlight on Keith Richard's short appearance as Sparrow senior, which clearly felt like it's added and created just for him.<br/><br/>The action bits were great, and though there are adequate fight scenes in between the calm scheming of the high seas, nothing beats the climatic fight at the end where everything comes together and issues get resolved with violence. There are times though that you wonder just how much damage the ships like the Black Pearl and The Flying Dutchman can sustain, with so much splinters and chunks of wood flying, before they sink. And like all climatic fights in ending trilogy chapters, At World's End fell back to formulaic rousing of the troops scene with cheesy dialogue, but perhaps for the better, forgotten about all the others in spite of the scale prepared. The CGI was undeniably effective in making the battle work, with fights on a number of fronts properly done to keep the adrenaline high.<br/><br/>Pirates 3 is an intertwined sequel which I think you'll either love or hate depending on how you reacted to Pirates 2. For me, I'm swashbuckling towards liking it. It's not without flaws, but definitely one of the better two-part movies around - I guess the scriptwriters must had racked their brains with so much going on in so little time, and pulling it off actually. A satisfying conclusion."

","First of all, let me say I'm not a big fan of the Pirates movies. Don't get me wrong, I do love these films, but the all seem to miss a certain edge that would make the movies so much better. Maybe it's the Disney factor. I was pleasantly surprised though, since this movie is probably a hundred times better than the previous one. This might have something to do with Barbossa's return to the story (I really missed Geoffrey Rush in part 2, he's the most piraty pirate of all) but mostly, the makers really made an effort this time not to bore us and they succeeded. Everything looks beautiful, detailed and hauntingly disgusting. The overall atmosphere is strong, gloomy and dark, which is in itself an improvement to the previous films. The final battle scene is exciting, beautifully choreographed, and way overdone (frankly, I don't think it is possible in any world for a ship to stay afloat in a maelstrom for 45 minutes), which is exactly what I expected, so it was very satisfying. Johnny Depp's performance as Jack Sparrow makes my flower tingle. Depp always surprises me with his slapstick ability, and honestly, he's one of the very few actors who can make me laugh just by running. In my opinion, the most brilliant scene of the movie is Jack's first appearance, stuck in the afterlife, haunted by a dozen copies of himself. Orlando Bloom's character Will annoyed me from the very moment I first laid eyes on him in the first movie. I almost shed a tear of joy when I thought he had died. I don't know whether it's the character itself or Bloom's portrayal (let's be fair, he's not a great film actor and should go back to the theatre) which is so aggravating, but it's a serious downer. Keira Knightly is skinny in both physical appearance and somewhat in acting, though she surpassed her performance in both the first and second film. The reason why this movie is not a 10 or a 9, and hardly deserves the 8 I gave it, is the storyline and the script. The plot is complicated and follows so many different stories that the film sometimes seems disjointed, and makes you almost lose the overview. The script is a bit unoriginal and uninspired, there were hardly any strong jokes or witty commentaries, and the emotional speeches (especially Elizabeth's before the big battle) seemed generic. The final scene seems to suggest another Pirates movie, but seriously, that would just be too much. I violently enjoyed this wild ride through the tales of the seven seas (and now I know I want to be a pirate when I grow up) but the story is told, and it's time to obsess over another trilogy."

","The opening sequence to these films are the most important aspect of setting the mood for the film. The first two had extremely memorable opening sequences, but At World's End had the best of the whole series. While watching it, the only thing that was going through my mind was ""how did Disney get away with a gallows opening sequence? How did Disney somehow get this dark?"" The opening sequence for this film is truly haunting. It's rare to find an opening sequence that is as well done as this one, with the only sequence that seems to rival it being the introduction for Watchmen. This is one of the greatest opening sequences for film, hidden in many people's least favorite Pirates of the Caribbean film. At World's End is similar to the epics of old. With grand sets and a massive ensemble, this film truly had a lot to tackle. With the introduction of so many new characters, there was a fear that this film was going to be like the previous film, where the focus was aimed toward one character, not the main characters of the film. Luckily, the film seemed to get ahold of this and keep the focus on the main characters, while still creating some amazing new characters. As said, this film seems to be more similar to epics instead of the modern adventure film. There was so much that the film needed to get through without seeming rushed, which the film was able to beautifully get through. The thing to note the most about this film is the sets, The sets are absolutely gorgeous. The best set out of the entire film was in Shipwreck Cove, which also happened to be the best scene in the film. While the epic climax of the film was heavily done through CGI, the rest of the film still kept a realistic image throughout. This installment into the series felt the longest to watch, especially because of the long exposition. It took a considerable length of time to actually get the film going, establishing what was happening and where the film was going to go. It wasn't necessarily hard to watch, since all of these films are extremely entertaining, they just took more time to get things going, compared to the other films. The length of the film used to seem like a hurdle to get over, but upon this watch, it actually went by extremely quickly. It's more entertaining than the second film, with some of the best shots within the series. With new villains, better death scenes (Cutler Beckett's death scene is honestly one of the most memorable scenes of all time), and an epic scope, At World's End seemed to be the perfect ending to a series. It left questions that many wanted to be answered, which many found out would not be answered with the next film in the series, but still maintained a solid ending that made it easy to not make any more sequels. But, seeing as how profitable these films were, it's not a surprise that they continued to make more films. Still At World's End still is one of the best films in the series thus far."

Along with Depp comes more familiar faces! Geoffrey Rush returns as the once bad but now good Captain Barbarossa. His performance alone carries the movie. He chews the scenery in every minute he's on screen. Kevin Mcnally also returns as the titular Gibbs, Jacks loyal and smart first mate. Also returning are Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightly, who both give strong well appreciated performances. Their characters are more built up emotionally and morally in the film. Along with the good guys, familiar villains pop up too. Cutler Beckett is back and politically menacing as ever played by Tom Hollander. And of course the ever talented and amazing Bill Nighy is back as that evil tentacled cat, Davy Jones. Along with Jones return came his crew of fish faces looking better and wetter then before, (Strictly in a CGI way of course). <br/><br/>now from a production stand point, this seems to be the largest. The budget looks humongous in comparison to the previous installment. The costuming alone deserves an academy award, well a nomination at least. Now comes the CGI, witch also seems to be where the budget was buried. Well, thank god, the digital effects are extraordinary and unbelievable. Jones and his crew and fantastic.<br/><br/>Now, from an acting stand point, the film is the most ambitious and extraordinary. Like i spoke of before, Geoffrey Rush alone carries the movie. Every scene he is in is utterly enjoyable. Everyone in the film seems to be having a good time and not just doing it for the paycheck. <br/><br/>The ending is superb and leaves much up to the imagination (which makes you want to see the next one) and that's OK.<br/><br/>my overall review is simple, much like the movie,here it is: Pirates of the Caribbean: at World's End is an excellent fun and enjoyable send off into later pirate films! The acting is spot on, the sets and costumes are astounding, and the central story really has a heart.

","Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End (POTC3) is a fantasy movie version of the Disneyland theme park ride, with added elements from Star Wars and The Muppets. POTC3's special effects might keep your eyes fixated on the screen, but what you see will make no sense. The movie features a squid-faced alien, a square-rigger being carried on the backs of thousands of crabs, talking skulls, ships falling off the end of the world—literally, and more. Dream sequence or no, the whole movie reeks of fantasy nonsense.<br/><br/>None of the POTC movies to date have much to do with reality, or with actual 17th century pirates.

","At World's End is easily my favourite of the original POTC trilogy - and that's saying something, because i LOVED Curse of the Black Pearl. Yes, there's an awful lot of interwoven plot points that are easy to get tangled up in, but every time you watch it becomes clearer, and you pick up on things you never noticed the last time.<br/><br/>I loved that they kept the moral ambiguity on nearly everyone - especially the Pirates - because although it's obvious who the ultimate bad guy is (Beckett), it's not immediately obvious who is allied with who at what point against them. Every character, with the exception of Beckett and his ilk, seems to have something that questions whether they are good, evil or just caught up in it all. Take Jones for example, exposing his vulnerability really softened his character and you almost feel sympathy for a heartbroken man. Almost - until you remind yourself what he has become. Also Will's slightly sneaky streak makes you wonder if he's actually the same likable blacksmith from COTBP.<br/><br/>What I would change...in a slight contradiction to that entire paragraph, I'd absolutely remove some of the ambiguity from the ending surrounding Mr and Mrs Turner. I get that Will was always going to end up as Captain of the Dutchman, Tia Dalma said as much in Dead Man's Chest, but they really ought to have included the scene that clarifies whether or not he is free after ten years (because Elizabeth remained faithful and he did his duty), or bound for eternity. I guess the ambiguity has afforded them more options in bringing Will Turner back in for Dead Men Tell No Tales, but to me it seems an awfully bleak ending any way you slice it (intentional Sparrow quote, sorry not sorry). It's all well and good having ambiguous characters, but not entire film endings, especially ones that were meant to be the final installment of a trilogy.<br/><br/>Other notable point, this movie has perhaps my favourite score for a live action film ever, courtesy of Hans Zimmer. I'd say overall best movie score, but Zimmer was also responsible for The Lion King and therefore I absolutely cannot choose! It is rare (honest) that a particular movie scene moves me to tears every time I watch it, but Will and Elizabeth's One Day does it, as does Mufasa's death.<br/><br/>To sum up, this film may confuse the crap out of you at times, but stick with it and look for little details."

","I actually enjoyed the original 'Pirates of the Caribbean', with its hilarious account of Captain Jack Sparrow, the world's worst pirate. For sure, there was an element of fantasy in the story, but only in the sense that in the world of the film, all the old sea-farers' tales were actually true. But Hollywood loves a sequel (or three) and so we come to this monstrosity, a film characterised by preposterous metaphysics, an un-followable plot, bewildering computerised animation and unendurable length. It's a sign of the film's self-indulgence that Sparrow, its best character, doesn't even appear in the first half-hour; while every supposedly moving moment could have been cut and pasted from any other blockbuster. It seems that Hollywood must kill the things it loves; usually through an overcooking process that takes away whatever made an original film good and replaces it with pointless, generic bombast.

""Pirates 3"" has the extra cost that ""Waterworld"" did not of the requisite CGI now standard on all films not labeled ""indie."" The CGI animators create a mass of mock crabs that carry a galleon across a desert, a ship that floats on either side of the ocean's surface and one presumes the tentacled beard of Davy Jones (unless that was all puppetry). Expensive spectacles all to be sure yet Davy Jones' appearance reminds one strongly of the much more convincing aliens in the South African film ""District 9"" a movie that cost reportedly 1/10th the price. ""Pirates 3"" likely contained more than 10 times the amount of special effects but this amounts to overuse of the technology resulting in the ""Transformers""-type visual confusion and difficulty following the action. The excessive CGI is manifest of an overreaching director's vision, again much like Costner's ""Waterworld."" To put it bluntly the film is too damned long clocking in at 3 hours if you count the advertisements and previews most theaters now tack on at the beginning of the screening. Long running times do not represent an inherent evil - certainly broad sweeping biopics such as ""The Aviator"" or films that need to acclimate the audience to a very alien world such as ""Avatar"" require more than the requisite 88 minutes. The third in a series of films based on one of Disneyworld's least interesting amusement park rides maybe doesn't have the grand narrative arc to hold the audience's attention quite that long. Beyond being too much to follow and too much to sit through there is too little interesting dialog, clever repartee and compelling relationships. Depp and Rush clearly compete for attention, Orlando Bloom as overstayed his welcome and more interaction between Depp and Keith Richards is not forthcoming likely because of Richards' limited acting ability (Mick Jagger he is not). In short, rent ""Waterworld"" instead - at least you can follow the story."

"riboncek","Null","1","2","26 September 2011"," Absolutely terrible
","After some time of consideration, I finally decided to rent the Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy and have a nice, quiet movie marathon with my girl. It started out great, Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl was hilarious with a decent plot and so was Dead Man's Chest. However, when we got to the third part, it was just.... awful.<br/><br/>First off, the jokes in At World's End were apparently not written by the same people who made the first two movies. Or the company changed its policy of drinking booze at work. They were old and terrible, and rarely a thing made me laugh. Marriage on the boat in the middle of a supposedly epic battle? Oh gimme a break...<br/><br/>Secondly, the plot was as dumb as the jokes. Barbossa somehow managed to cheat death (again) and they went to rescue Jack. Okay, cool. But the Kraken? The godlike creature which sunk more than a dozen of ships in Dead Man's Chest, is now shown for about 2 minutes total in the entire movie? Dead??! What the hell guys! The blasted thing killed Jack, it was a creature to fear of.... and here it is, lying on the beach... dead. Way to go. Not to mention the huge number of actors and the whole ""pieces of eight"" mumbo jumbo. Seriously, you could have done it better. Way better.<br/><br/>Thirdly, and the most annoying thing in the entire movie -- Keira Knightley. Whoever said she would be best playing a captain and king of the pirates, should be fired immediately. Whenever she spoke, I got goose bumps at her facial expressions. Whenever she yelled, I wanted to tear off my ears as to prevent my head from exploding of loud frequencies. That girl doesn't shout... she SCREAMS! She screams so bloody loud and at such an annoying pitch, it's just.... OH MY GOD!!! And when she gave that ""inspirational"" speech before the final battle between the British and the pirates, we just skipped the whole part because it was already enough seeing that snobbish, spoiled and loud mouth of a face for the past 60 minutes. I'm really really REALLY glad you didn't include her in On Stranger's Tides. At least Penelope Cruz's voice is not as screechy as Keira's.<br/><br/>I'd recommend you guys watch the first, second and fourth parts of the movie. Definitely avoid this one because you will only go to bed with a large headache at the amateurism it has to offer."

However the confusing plot meanders along for nearly 3 hours and what little interest I had in these characters all but evaporated in that time. The first Pirates was an unexpected joy, but there is none of that on offer here.<br/><br/>Hans Zimmer's score is by the numbers as if he's being paid to rehash Gladiator over and again and most of the cast sleep through what is tired effort.<br/><br/>No more please (2 sequels confirmed)."

","Some things from your childhood you cherish. Pop Rocks, Monopoly (until your dad crafts a crooked deal and you end up with the utility companies and he's got 4 monopolies), and bad haircuts. I also used to love the ""choose your own adventure"" books. You know, you get to see if Joe Hardy gets hit on the head with a baseball bat or a frying pan, and if Frank finds him tied up or in a bag. It gave you power over your entertainment.<br/><br/>Now imagine reading one of those books where not only was someone choosing your adventure for you, but when they came to a scenario they didn't like, they'd change it - you've got Pirates 3. Joe gets hit over the head with a dead fish and Frank finds him at World's End.<br/><br/>I'll start with some good things. Johnny Depp's acting job was far superior in this flick than it was in the last two movies. Unfortunately the funniest parts had nothing to do with the story and were complete deviations. The costuming was very good, as usual. Kudos to Justin Geer for rocking it as a pirate (gotta give the local love). By far, the best part of the movie was the trailer for Transformers. Booya! Gonna be awesome. (Note: I wrote this when I saw POTC in theaters - boy was I wrong)<br/><br/>That was brief, like my sense of enjoyment while being held hostage for nearly 3 hours as I was beat over the head with stupid plot, overall poor acting, and terrible CGI and sound design. ""But nobody cares about sound design, Fat Man."" Right they don't. They should. Being forgiving of an industry whose sole purpose is to create entertaining films is only harming you. You critique an independent film to death (which you should), but don't care about an industry that is supposed to be the highest level of professionalism around, but can't put enough detail into CGI to make it reasonably realistic.

","A quaint and satisfying ending to a most successful trilogy since the matrix. Pirates of the Caribbean has ushered in a new era of action with new characters, and new plots. At World's end, was quite fabulous to say the least, seeing the old friends of Sparrow, Barbosa, and the new added feature of Keith Richards who plays Sparrow's father was ingenious. The race, to finally put an end to Davy Jones, but to do that, the Bretheren Accord must free Calypso. A goddess of the sea who in her own mind keeps those floating to destinations across the ocean, or... Sink them if they do not obey the rules. The brethren agrees to release Calypso from her earthly bonds as a human, but in return, Barbosa seeks safe passage for his endeavours. Will turner is still on his mission to free his father, and Miss Swan has earned a Captains status among a Chinese Cutter who was led by Sao Feng (Chow Yun Fat). Through his demise, he had given the status to her as an apology. But Beckett, wants his prize, and to do that he must eliminate the entire Bretheren by force of the Majesty's Royal Naval Fleet. Yet in a twisted turn of fate, Will is killed during a fierce battle at sea with Davy Jones and Beckett who is in league with Jones. yet as with all things, Sparrow rescues him by stabbing the heart, albeit by use of Will's dead hand on the knife. Now Jones is lost, Will is the new captain of the Dutchmen, and Beckett... well he's in Turners locker. All in all a great and wonderful trilogy. New battles, and new friends of the Bretheren. This shows true camaraderie in its pure form. No hesitation, no wants or needs, just brute fighting for which the pirates of the old know only too well. An excellent action film for all to watch."

","This was a great movie end to one of my favoritest movies series-es of all time! It was an interesting plot and the acting has improved as the as the actors get more into their roles. My problems with this:<br/><br/>1. Too long. This movie was very drawn out. I know all the pirates movies are long, but this is just weird. <br/><br/>2. Jack Sparrow. I didn't like the scenes of his Davy Jones Locker ""visit"", they were just the weirdest. They weren't funny either. What I hate most is that I expected him to have his final moment of heroism in repent for all those betrayals, but no. Witch brings me to my third and final point:<br/><br/>3. THE ENDING!! I have to be frank, the biggest mistake yet. I couldn't believe it, it was just soo Un-Disney. Jack SHOULD have sacrificed himself for Will. That was just sad to see that Will will only see Elizabeth once in 10 years, after the going through all that trouble to save her? She will just wither away and die, like every mortal. Shame.

"TheLittleSongbird","6","1","2","27 August 2009"," Not so bad, but overall it is a rather disappointing second sequel.
","I will say I absolutely loved Curse of the Black Pearl, it's one of my all-time favourite movies. Dead Mens Chest was enjoyable and lively, if overlong. At World's End is certainly not a terrible film, far from it, I just found it rather disappointing that's all, plot-wise being the least remarkable of the three films. I will say there is a lot to recommend it, namely the art direction, and the special effects weren't too bad either. The cinematography was impressive, there is some lovely period detail and I thought there were some very well staged battle sequences. The music by Hans Zimmer, one of my favourite film composers, was outstanding, very rousing and dramatic. And the performances weren't so bad either- Jack Sparrow is still the lovable rogue we have come to know and love, and Johnny Depp played him marvellously. A very talented actor, Geoffrey Rush, sinks his teeth into the part of Captain Barbosa, I particularly loved the line, ""I'm a bit busy at the moment."" And Bill Nighy was delightfully villainous as Davy Jones. However, the film does have flaws that prevents it from being the rollicking film it had the potential of being. The plot did take a while to get going, and sometimes became unfocused and convoluted, like Elizabeth and Will declaring their wedding vows in the middle of a big fight. Also there are a lot of characters, and one or two of them served no real purpose to the plot, and a lot was crammed into the long running time, so at the end of the day, it felt a bit bloated. The script was full of existing jokes, not necessarily a bad thing, but overall it lacked freshness, and the humour and fun, that made me love the first film so much. Overall, it is certain performances, fantastic music and some well-staged battles that salvage an otherwise bloated and disappointing second sequel. 6/10 Bethany Cox"
"LagerLagerLagerShouting","4","1","2","2 May 2008"," Squid Thing And The Attack Of The Mutant Molluscs
","Really disappointing. The trilogy has been going downhill and this concluding part was by far the worst of the bunch. Although beautifully photographed at times with great locations and excellent special effects, the whole thing was so overblown and ridiculous with stupid sub-plots and over-developed and completely unnecessary character incentives to add to the mix. For me, the problem with all three films is instead of a basic human melodrama, with believable protagonists, antagonists and no doubt Depp's Sparrow as the anti-hero we have a muddled mess of characters, most of whom have supernatural elements. Couldn't they just makes the villains of the piece, evil yes but believable too, instead of a squid-thing and his army of molluscs. In this sense the film strives too hard to be a fantasy when it could have been, more simply but more effectively, a much more plausible mythical, historical action movie with pantomime characters we can all relate too. What makes these films even worse, if that is possible, is the sheer awfulness of the two young leads. How Keira Knightly became a success in Hollywood at a young age is beyond me, I've seen better acting on a football pitch and as for Orlando Bloom, well he is more wooden than The Flying Dutchman! Just to top it all off can someone please tell me what that Calypso thing was about...!? Ray Harryhausen mythical 60's monster movie this is not and even then pretty much all of them are more convincing than this.<br/><br/>4/10"

","I loved the first film of this trilogy, was kind of interested in the second, and just did not like the third. I watched the movie closely and most of the time, I did not know what on earth was going on. There were too many story lines slanting in different directions, and each was not explained properly. If you missed five minutes of the film, you were completely lost for the rest of it. Granted, the effects were outstanding and the acting was brilliant, even if Kiera Knightley's constant fake pout and ridiculous word pronunciation made me want to hit things. The problem was there were too many effects, too many fight scenes in which I had no idea what the fight was even for. It was action for the sake of action, with no time to pause and catch your breath. Fight scene went into action scene, over and over again, with minimal explanation. Too much reliance on effects, too much action and not enough reflection on what the heck was actually going on. There were so many all dramatic scenes, in which it was not even clear what the characters were being dramatic about. Really, really, can't stand this movie."

","I am a big fan of the first two movies but the third is just a mess. The characters have been neutered, except for Elizabeth and the plot never really seems to know where it's going or even what it's doing in the present. Instead of high adventure we get a story that plays out like the actors all got together and wrote it by committee. The movie does have it's high points, most of which revolve around Jack Sparrow but unfortunately, Depp is lost in the maelstrom of the plot. The ending is silly and in my mind, Lord Beckett's behavior is contrary to his nature. If they do make a fourth film, hopefully they keep Jack and Barbosa and drop most of the rest."

"spk07","10","1","2","26 January 2008"," Delightful ""End""
","I never imagined that the ""Pirates"" series could enthrall me the way it does now after ""The Curse of the Black Pearl."" I admit it; I am one of the few who was not crazy about it. But after seeing ""Dead Man's Chest"", I grew intrigued by the mixture of high-seas action, mysticism and goof-ball comedy that this series provides. ""At World's End"" is a simultaneously hilarious and thrilling conclusion. The many plots which sometimes perplexed me also captivated me. My favorite one involves Davy Jones and his fall from grace from being the biggest bad-ass of the Ocean to a lackey and how it ties to a long ago romantic rejection. But Captain Jack Sparrow is also a masterful mixture of romantic hero and comic relief and I love not knowing what he is going to say or do next. He is the anchors that allows the film to be shamelessly silly without embarrassing the audience. It is also satisfying to see pretty much every character getting a decent wrap-up to their stories and that the filmmakers take the time to do this and not care about trying the audience's patience; those 169 minutes flew right by. The romantic pathos of Will and Elizabeth was so beautiful and epic in a wildly unexpected way. The waterfall and maelstrom sequences are exhilarating and the comic chemistry between Sparrow and Barbossa is pure magic as is the way Gore Verbinski makes the humor appealing to adults and kids as well. While the violence may frighten the wee ones, I like to think of this as a fairy tale adventure and some fairy tales are always a bit frightening. This is one of the best endings of a trilogy because it manages (for the most part) to do so many things at once and do it well."

"blackburnj-1","5","1","2","17 January 2008"," It's too long, too complicated ... too bad.
","The third film in this mega-franchise has been called many things (my favourite being ""At Wit's End""). As the third film finishes (assuming, and it is a big assumption, that this is the end in a trilogy) the trio of films feels very much like ""The Matrix Trilogy"": it started with promise but cashed-in in a disappointing manner that ruins the fine start.<br/><br/>Now, this is not as bad as has been made out. The plot (or rather plots) is a complete mess, but there is still fun to be had. Johnny Depp is still thoroughly entertaining, as is Geoffrey Rush. Gore Verbinski also directs the film, at times, with a great deal of ambition and a bit of visual style. It is a truly cinematic film with many sequences that push boundaries and that are clearly made for the big screen. If you can follow the basic plot there is enough to get you by.<br/><br/>However, the film is far too long and, though many actors try hard, you are bored and ultimately don't care what the outcome of the climax is. Also, individual characters get lost in the mêlée of this film (there isn't even enough of Johnny Depp) and so many people cross each other that you haven't really got a clue what anybody is doing. Orlando Bloom is complete tripe and I remain bemused at how he is a major film star, whilst Keira Knightley, that's Oscar nominated Keira Knightley, isn't much better, even though she's shown that she can be good. Furthermore, it's a geeky complaint but, Hans Zimmer's music is crap. It's so crap, you notice it, which is a real measure of how bad it is.<br/><br/>Anyway, the film as a whole is pretty rubbish, but there are worse films out there and it isn't all dreadful. It is also questionable as to whether this film can really be seen as family entertainment. There is a lot of death; it's too complicated and too dark, though teenagers will love it. There are things to enjoy but I would, on the whole, advise against."

"pyrocitor","9","1","2","31 December 2007"," ""Take what you can - give nothing back""
","If a sequel is a dangerous thing in terms of deteriorating storytelling quality, then a third installment is even more perilous, with an even greater risk of destroying characterization and tainting the memory of previously strong installments. Thankfully, such a potential conflict was tastefully avoided for the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise. In a year fraught with third parts, At World's End, the culminating part of the pirates trilogy makes its mark as one of the few final installments to live up to the vivacity and spirit of its predecessors while still distinctly different enough to for the most part not feel overly familiar or formulaic.<br/><br/>As consequence of attempting to do something different enough with the series to keep things interesting but still stay true to the hard won Pirates spirit, At World's End comes across as a hodgepodge of lofty faux-mythology and a slightly darker but still spirited adventure romp. As such, the film's convoluted plot is admittably difficult to follow, but one has to give director Gore Verbinski credit for not dumbing down or rushing his film. Instead, Verbinski takes his time, producing a sprawling epic of an adventure film, with a distinctly different feel than the other two Pirates films, while retaining their charming sense of fun throughout enough to make it easy to forget the occasionally over complicated and lofty plot. Similarly, the film benefits enormously from its astonishing presentation: the stunning costumes, sets and props, as well as some of the most spectacular and elaborate visual effects ever boasted on film (the final showdown sequence is a jaw-dropper) as well as Hans Zimmer's rousing, dramatic score make for such an enormously powerful exterior it is easy to overlook the occasionally confusing storyline and sit immersed in one of the most flooring adventure epics in recent memory. <br/><br/>The film is reminiscent of the days of classic Hollywood epics, when a film could drift and dabble about for a bit without being chastised by audiences with shortened attention spans, (Peter Jackson's King Kong remake also fell prey to similar complaints) and no scene is distinctly without purpose. Sure the Singapore sequence and surreal, Kafka-esq hallucination sequence in Davy Jones' locker (one of the most bizarre and memorable depictions of the afterlife, and its inclusion into a mainstream blockbuster is a daring and laudable choice) may not be entirely necessary in terms of furthering the plot, but they sure are tremendously fun, enough so to justify their presence. What does slow the film down are the often overkill and unnecessary inside jokes and references to the first two films - comic double-act Ragetti and Pintel are given far too much screen time to crack the same, increasingly unfunny jokes over and over, and did those two bumbling soldiers from the first film really need to be brought back? The exclusion of such moments could easily trim a good 10 minutes off the lengthy running time, a blessing indeed. However, to the film's credit, such complaints are few, and the extensive story is tied up neatly with surprisingly few plot holes and lapses in continuity for a trilogy which ambitiously covered so much storytelling ground. <br/><br/>Despite the film being the third outing for the stellar cast, instead of simply coasting along, they all attack their roles with the same charisma and conviction as the prior two outings. Johnny Depp is just as eccentric, endearing and endlessly charismatic as the now iconic Captain Jack Sparrow, breathing genuine life into the character instead of lapsing into a parody of himself. Orlando Bloom is given more of a chance to expand his undeniably unlimited dramatic range, as his charming Will Turner drifts more into deception and betrayal. Keira Knightley retains her trademark spunky energy yet classical poise as the now seafaring Elizabeth, carrying one of the sole female roles with charisma aplenty. The scene stealing Geoffrey Rush, as a reincarnated Captain Barbossa shows just as much relish in energetically chomping the scenery as ever, as does the enormously talented Bill Nighy, once again outshining the astonishing CGI covering him in tentacles and breathing genuine menace and haunting sadness into his tremendously memorable Davy Jones. <br/><br/>Chow Yun-Fat is entertainingly menacing, if sometimes incomprehensible as feared Singapore pirate Sao Feng, and the suitably icy Tom Hollander, Stellan Skarsgård as Will's undead father and the tremendously watchable Naomi Harris as the mysterious Tia Dalma (whose character resolution leaves something to be desired) all reprise their roles to tremendous effect. Instead of simply cutting out the characters of Jonathan Pryce as Elizabeth's harried father and Jack Davenport as the flawed but noble James Norrington, they are each given one last moment to shine - a classy storytelling touch. And the much hyped Keith Richards (Depp's inspiration for the Jack Sparrow character) cameo is carried out in a far more straightforward and effective fashion than one would anticipate, without the comedic glee of the moment being tampered with. <br/><br/>While the film may not quite match up to the uniform excellence of the first, it drifts so tantalizingly close that one is inclined to wish that Verbinski and his creative crew could have ironed out the very few unnecessary bits or lapses in credibility and emerge with a more streamlined adventure escapade. As it is, At World's End still makes its mark as astonishingly strong for a third installment. The film whips along at such a breakneck pace that the lengthy running time elapses in seemingly no time, so immersed are the audience within the unparalleled spectacle of one of the most ambitious and enormously entertaining adventure epics in years - a fitting close to a trilogy which initially boasted the same effect. <br/><br/>-8.5/10"

The character itself is a delight that brightens the entire series but even he couldn't save this clunk of a threequel.<br/><br/>The problem with the Pirates series as it continued is they just kept piling on more ridiculous confusing Pirate lore and making it painfully difficult to follow who was screwing over who for what. I can't remember one characters motivation from this film overall because none of it really seemed to matter anyway the movie makers were just using them for excuses to use special effects.<br/><br/>Also all the hype around the Elizabeth character was just over the top and stupid this movie and they really ruined the essence of the character as a whole by making her ridiculously desirable and exceptionally awesome. I just watched Pirates one last night and you can't barely even believe the same woman who ends on the cliff kissing Will is the same woman in this movie.<br/><br/>Jack is mostly used for comedic relief but Johnny Depp still works it like no other in this clunker. If anything was salvaged in this poor installment he did the salvaging even though there is one cringe worthy moment for Sparrow too.<br/><br/>What a shame. This trilogy could have been the Star Wars for this generation in a way on a smaller scale. Instead all this movie reaffirmed was what I thought at the end of Pirates of the Caribbean 2 Dead Man's Chest...they should have just left it at one movie."

","I think the writers of this movie should be brought up in front of the Grand Jury, really. It stuns me that a think tank of industry professionals can come up with this sort of crap. They just had to write a solid and simple plot line, keep the movie to under two hours, then let the great cast and special effects have some fun. To screw it up as badly as this, well that really must have taken some effort. How can you walk in to the production phase of a hundred million dollar movie with that script in your back pocket? With that amount of money on the table why doesn't somebody say ""i'm sorry but that script just isn't good enough, in fact its awful, do it again."" It happens in business every day with budgets a thousand times smaller than this. Then during production why doesn't somebody say to Yun-fat chow ""I respect that you are an amazing actor and have been the backbone of the HongKong film industry for over 20 years but right now we can't understand a bloody word you're saying"". Really how can you shoot a movie on this scale and not point out to one of your actors than his entire dialogue is incomprehensible. The final thing is that this film really saddens me. I grew up with StarWars and Indiana Jones, this could have been up there, could have been a contender, what a bloody waste of a beautiful thing."

","A lot of people really hated this movie, but not me. I think it's a competent way to round out the trilogy. But make no mistake, this isn't back to the standard of the first one.<br/><br/>There are some individual sequences that shine (as usual you've probably seen glimpses of them in the trailer) but too often it relies on repeating an earlier joke, with or without a twist.<br/><br/>If you're not that anxious to know what happens next you can safely wait to see this on network TV one Christmas. Otherwise, borrow the DVD. If you already own the other two on DVD you'll already know whether you're the type of person who needs to own this one too, or if you can go without (Hint: If you have the whole Matrix trilogy, you'll probably need this too)."

Nothing is used as it should be used, and the film's many potentials are never explored. For example the Chinese pirates, never becomes interesting and instead quickly ends up just as side characters, and the final battle is fought in just five minutes. Besides this, lot of the dialogue from the first films, are reused, and generally At World's End never becomes an independent film, but more a mix of the previous ones.<br/><br/>I can't say enough how disappointed I am with the last chapter of Pirates.

","From the outset of the 'Pirates' franchise, it was obvious that the Walt Disney Company was traveling down a well known path. Not only was the film based on one of Disney's most beloved attractions, it told a reasonably old fashioned Swashbuckle picture. Of course, special effects and insurmountable amounts of eye shadow were thrown in as flavor.<br/><br/>The second was high entertainment with more effects and more eye shadow, yet it had lost some of it's wacky charm. The third has returned to form with flying colors. Never has Jack Sparrow been more comically reliable. Orlando Bloom's Will Turner has become a much more believable character. <br/><br/>Dead Man's Chest (the second film) left us hanging, on the edge of our seats, craving more. At World's end delivers more and then some. The film details the search to bring Capt. Jack Sparrow (the incomparable Johnny Depp)back from the land of the dead. This requires the assistance of wiley Capt. Barabossa (Geoffery Rush). The film leads to the climactic battle of the Pirate Lords (including Chow Yun Fat as Sao Feng) against the Eas India Trading Company led by malevolent Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander) who know controls the Flying Dutchman by way of Davy Jones'(Bill Nighy) heart.<br/><br/>Follow me? Well, it is irrelevant anyways. The plot of the three films just seems to be some far fetched fantasy to hang sea battles and sword fights on. There is nothing wrong with that. There is so much double crossing and even triple crossing in this film that it could be mistaken for a Pulp rag of the 1950's, were it not for the ships and pirates. <br/><br/>The proceedings are, as always, heightened by the glorious talents of Depp and Rush, who play so well together that one wonders what would come of a different film starring both actors where they had the same sort of relationship.<br/><br/>At World's End is 168 minutes of non stop visual splendor, not once did I check the clock in boredom. That's something I couldn't say about Dead Man's Chest, which is 18 minutes shorter.<br/><br/>However, I think the biggest and most deserved praise I could give this film is that it most certainly makes the popcorn taste better."

"Michael Kenmore","7","1","2","9 June 2007"," Some amazingly innovative story arcs; third movie better than wretched excess of the first sequel
","May contain minor spoilers. I mark the spoiler with *** so you avoid spoiling the experience later.<br/><br/>I contemplated skipping Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End because the second movie of the franchise left a bitter taste in my mouth. It's been almost a year since I last saw that movie in the theatre with the cliffhanger conclusion.<br/><br/>The Pirates of the Caribbean franchise is fascinating for its sometimes innovative story arcs, spectacular production & costume design and top-notch special effects.<br/><br/>Three things that may mar the enjoyability factor of the latter two in the trilogy are<br/><br/>1) bloated in overdirecting and overwritten. See the second movie - it goes on and on like a non-stop amusement ride that leave some viewers exhausted and bored. The third movie comes close with some convoluted subplots that may not make sense.<br/><br/>2) overacting with annoying results. Johnny Deep was great in the first movie but grinded his character quirks into rough chalk in the last two movies. Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley offer nothing of substance but basically cardboard characters. Fine acting as usual by the supporting cast including Rush Geoffrey and Bill Nighy. Oh, and the particular comedic sidekick duo get really, really old that make me yawn whenever the scenes go to them to deliver jokes.<br/><br/>3) nauseating level of realistic (fantasy) violence. I'm surprised the third movie barely eked out with a passable PG-13 rating. The third movie is considerably more violent than the two. Certainly not for small children.<br/><br/>I kid you not I slept through the meandering middle of the second Pirate movie. That's a terribly dull movie. Third movie almost had a drowsy effect on me but thankfully I stay awoke during the ""slow"" character development scenes and got past it to watch the spectacular scenes.<br/><br/>However, what made the third movie work on some level is semi-predictable but innovative story arcs and twists that make for an exciting movie-going experience. ***SPOILER*** The space-travel, pirate ship flip and character trade sequences are wonderfully inventive that reminds me of earlier Final Fantasy video games. These scenes, while bizarre, are riveting.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, At World's End movie length stretch to nearly three hours with some ludicrous and energy-deflating subplots that don't make sense, not to mention plot holes that may confuse the viewers about the disappearing minor characters explained in brief expositionary dialogues. Maybe the director and editors had to excise some footage for being extraneous that would add more to the length of the movie.<br/><br/>The first movie is still a lot better because it was a fresh concept and Johnny Depp embodied Jack Sparrow with amusing conviction that earned him a Best Actor nomination. The last two movies -- I hope there won't be the fourth pirate movie, that would be dumb -- border on utter bloatedness with too many plots, too many characters and too many yawn-inducing jokes. What saved the third movie is the inventive storytelling that make for a semi-enjoyable movie night.<br/><br/>Keira and Orlando does nothing to add to the characters -- more of the same as the previous two. It's kind of boring to watch them deliver dialogues with bare facial expressions and body language, although I admit Keira looks fine in this movie. But a woman with orange tan skin would be out of place in the setting that makes it implausible, despite the concept being fantasy.<br/><br/>The appearance by Keith Richards is a pleasant surprise but it's a bare cameo. Keith doesn't act much when he recites the scripted dialogues, obviously because acting is a difficult art to master.<br/><br/>Overall, an almost good movie that's better than the horrible first sequel. The Matrix had the similar problem with the terrible, bloated middle and made the bang with the final third whereas the Pirates trilogy is just matinée popcorn entertainment.<br/><br/>*** out of 4"

"JosephLee411","Null","1","2","1 June 2007"," Doesn't reach greatness of the original, or the blandness of it's sequel
","Pirates of the Caribbean 3: At World's End(2007)<br/><br/>Starring: Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow Keira Knightly as Elizabeth Swann Orlando Bloom as Will Turner Geoffery Rush as Barbossa Chow Yun Fat as Sao Feng<br/><br/>I sat down ready to finally watch some Pirates after being left on a cliffhanger for a year(which really wasn't a cliffhanger because they gave away what happens in the trailers). I really enjoyed the first Pirates movie. The second movie fell a little flat with me, but I still enjoyed it. Would this new one go the way of the second, the first, or just be terrible? I was ready to find out.<br/><br/>First thing that should be mentioned is the length and tons of plot lines that are throughout this movie. The trilogy really needed an epic finish and that's what happened here. Everything is resolved, all the alliances are finally in place for good, and everything that needs to go down does. This movie is very good at taking all of the things the first and second movies set up, and not only playing off of them but giving them some resolution. <br/><br/>I do have some small complaints. First of all, new characters are introduced and then don't have much screen time. Long time characters are killed off(I won't say which ones) after not much screen time themselves. There just wasn't time to explain anything, as they had to keep the movie going, even though it was close to three hours. Some of the dragging parts could have been taken out to develop more, or at least don't introduce the new characters in the first place.<br/><br/>My biggest complaint would be that Jack Sparrow is just there now. He was the life of Curse of the Black Pearl, and he started to wear thin in Dead Man's Chest but not quite. It just seems like they could have left him dead and the movie wouldn't have been any different. He doesn't add anything. It's not Johnny Depp's fault, it's the screenwriters. They took an interesting character and made him comic relief. <br/><br/>But he's really the only one of the main characters that isn't developed more. At first I hated what that did with Will Turner(Orlando Bloom) in that he really cares only about himself in this movie, but then I realized he finally made the transformation into a full-fledged pirate. Keira Knightly shines here, as her character has transformed from naive to cunning. Even some of the minor characters like Tia Dalma or Davy Jones get more development. Which, going back to my initial complaint, means everyone but Sparrow has something to do.<br/><br/>There's wasn't any need for character development or plot exposition, because we know all these characters already so we're ready for a movie that's mostly action-packed. And when the action happens, it's great. A cannon battle while swirling around a maelstrom, lots of sword fights, explosions, and of course Jack Sparrow vs Davy Jones on the top of the ship in a storm. It's all well done and works together. Plus it still has the humor and bizarre scenes that these movies are known for. The special effects help this out a lot and bring these battles to life.<br/><br/>Overall, Pirates 3 is something that needed the plot and length, which is something most were complaining about. Those elements actually help, and make this movie epic. While it's not without it's faults, At World's End is still a fun romp at the movies that everyone who liked the first two are sure to enjoy.<br/><br/>Rating: ***1/2 of *****"
"evanston_dad","8","1","2","29 May 2007"," YO, HO, HO and a Mixed Bag of Fun
","Midway through the third installment of Walt Disney's deliriously popular pirate franchise, a character says of Capt. Jack Sparrow (played by Johnnny Depp in what now has to qualify as one of the weirdest characterizations in screen history), ""Is he making this up as he goes along?"" Shiver me timbers, mateys, but one has to ask director Gore Verbinski and his team of wranglers, er, writers, the same question of the entire series.<br/><br/>I did not fall in love like so many others with the first film in the trilogy, ""The Curse of the Black Pearl,"" but I saw its appeal. It was far too long and sloppy, criticisms that have been leveled at parts two and three but which apply to the first movie as well. I can't even really remember the plot. It has something to do with Sparrow's beloved ship, the Black Pearl, being stolen from him by the rival pirate captain Barbossa (the marvelous Geoffrey Rush, bringing some obligatory British class to the proceedings) and his army of undead, and Sparrow's efforts, along with that most boring pair of screen lovers, Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom, to get it back. Depending on your perspective, that plot summary either wraps it up or barely scratches the surface, because ""Pirates"" is stuffed with more subplots than it can handle. Never has so much plot been shoe-horned into a movie (or trilogy of movies) and so much of it not mattered a bit. It turns out that Sparrow is actually undead himself, and some sort of curse need be broken if he is to regain his mortality. Well, it's not ruining anything to tell you that the curse is indeed broken, and loose ends are wrapped up while everything's left conveniently open for a sequel.<br/><br/>That sequel, ""Dead Man's Chest,"" takes everything that is charming about the first episode and pushes it past the limits of the audience's endurance. What a gormless mess the second part is, all furious action and racing around with absolutely no attempt made at coherence. A tremendous amount of plot exposition occurs in this installment. Indeed, the whole film is really set up for part three, yet at the same time is paced as if the entire movie is one long climax. Our consolation is that Bill Nighy makes his first appearance as Davy Jones (no, not the Monkey), looking like a serving of very angry calamari, and taking up the classy British slack that Rush left behind at the end of Part I. ""Dead Man's Chest"" makes no sense whatsoever, and it's not really even very fun. Even in a mindless action movie, one likes to have a vague idea of what all the fuss is about.<br/><br/>So it pleases me to report that the third and (maybe?) final entry, ""At World's End,"" gets more right than not, and provides a tremendous amount of fun. It doesn't even feel overly long, despite its run time of nearly three hours. The ""Pirates"" movies' saving grace is the cast the filmmakers have assembled, and there are moments in this film, when the cast is all together at the same time, that rival ""Star Wars"" for sheer screen chemistry. Rush returns, so we get to enjoy both him and Nighy, and of course Johnny Depp is back, and returns to the inspired performance (and surpasses the downright nuttiness) that made the first installment so memorable. Chow-Yun Fat is this episode's most significant addition, but let's not dwell on him or the embarrassing Asian stereotype he hauls along behind him. There's a huge amount of jokey humour in this segment, perhaps the most in the series, which helps it succeed in becoming what one sensed it wanted to become all along -- a sort of Indiana Jones set on water. My prayers that the pre-pubescent Orlando Bloom would be killed off looked as if they might have a chance of being answered for a brief moment, until the writers cruelly resurrected him as a swarthy pirate captain and give him a dramatic entrance that gave me the biggest (if most unintentional) belly laugh of them all. Why is it that despite his swishing and mincing, Depp still gives the impression that he could kick Bloom's ass?<br/><br/>The ""Pirates"" trilogy will not go down as classics of the genre, but they'll be remembered for wedging themselves firmly in the consciousness of movie-going America. <br/><br/>Grade: ""Curse of the Black Pearl"": B ""Dead Man's Chest"": C- ""At World's End"": A-"

While the first will ALWAYS be my favorite of the three, this third installment is a VERY close second! I've seen it twice already, and definitely intend to see as many times as I can afford before it comes out on DVD! It's funny, action-packed and over-all entertaining.

","With the second film leaving us on a climax, and with loads of unique characters, and after seeing the trailer for this, I had high expectations for this film and wasn't disappointed. ""At World's End"" is an awesome finale to the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" trilogy.<br/><br/>The film fulfils all of the genre criteria just like the other two films, it has much action that keeps you glued to the screen and much adventure an mystery, as well as being able to bring in comedy through all of this action. I really liked the way the film could bring in comedy in such fast moving action sequences.<br/><br/>Another great feature about this film is the special effects. In many violent scenes the film links to the idea of mystery with its pathetic fallacy of using harsh weather conditions. The special effects of the weather in one of the main action sequences is amazing. The way it links to the sea and the violence makes you want more and more. A great job has been done with the effects for this film. In my opinion, it wouldn't have surprised me if anyone who had plenty of food whilst watching ended up being 'sea sick', the effects were that good.<br/><br/>One of the other great features of the film are the range of unique characters. In the last film we had a set up of really great powerful characters but in my opinion 3 stood out the most: Jack Sparrow, Barbosa and Davy Jones, each have their own characteristics including accents and when ever they appear on the screen you know your in for something great.<br/><br/>What I would recommend to any people going to see this is make sure you have done your homework. This film tries to put many stories into it, making it such a long running time. This film requires much concentration, if you lose focus for any part of the film it can become confusing there is so much put into it. However, if you keep focused on the events happening in the film you are in for one exciting finale."

His performance is alone the reason why anyone should watch POTC 3.<br/><br/>I still felt too much of the story was on Elizabeth Turner, but Johnny Depp still manages to outshine all. Davy Jones/Bill Nightly is tremendous a long with Tom Hollander and Geoffrey Rush.<br/><br/>The last fight has to be one of the best ever, neither short nor dull. This movie completed a brilliant trilogy, and no one can really condemn this movie as it was pure awesome. A lot of action, with a mix of comedy and love.

","If this was the last movie of the last movie trilogy in the world, I would want to watch this...well, this or Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. But that is for the same reasons. Great Characters! This movie manages to take the fun of the first film and mix it with darkness which adds up to be one bittersweet masterpiece. Johnny Depp plays everyone's favorite captain, Jack Sparrow, in this possibly final, film in the trilogy and like the other two films, he holds the weight of this 3 hour film on his back. But unlike the last film, Jack doesn't have to hold it all by himself. A ton of characters come in and give their A GAME ALL THE WAY. Barbossa comes back from the grave and really feels like first film magic again. The rivalry between Jack and Barbossa is nothing short of beautiful. Davy Jones comes back but doesn't just boss people around. No, he gets angry in this one. And not just ""oh my hearts gone, I'm gonna shout and wriggle my tentacles"" angry...""I'm seriously ticked off, my tentacles are wriggling, my brow is furrowing, and i am going to kick... your... ASS"" angry. THATS RIGHT FOLKS. We finally get to see what i've wanted to see ever since i found out Bill Nighy would be playing Davy Jones...Davy Jones has a real sword fight against Jack Sparrow. And about that sword fight. Take Princess Bride, take a pinch of Zorro with a dash of Star Wars 1 and 3, pour in the fun of the first film with the size of the second, and then add amazing CGI with twists, turns, and humor, and you only get the tip of the final showdown. Once again, Jack is back with more fun. 24 times more fun in fact because we see more than one Jack. The direction is great, and off the wall, and not at all what you'd expect. Now i know that there are a lot of reviewers out there who say it's complex and all but HONESTLY, i watched it, and the only way you can really get confused AT ALL, is if you fell asleep for half of it and didn't watch 1 or 2. I saw it with my 6 year old cousin and he got everything. EVERY MOTIVATION AND EVERY BETRAYAL (and there are a lot of them). its not that hard! One of the best parts about this film in a sea of good parts is that there is possibilities for sequels and spin-offs but you'll see later. The only bad parts about this film is that it takes a little while to get going. But unlike the second film which took equally long to get going, this film does not slow down. And though it is big like the second film, it doesn't seem overly and unnecessarily big. Also, while Kiera finally holds her own without screaming like an idiot or being too much of a man like she was in the second film, her opposite, Will proves once and for all that he is a ""hair actor."" He has nothing to his name but a good head of hair. Maybe that worked in Lord of the Rings but it doesn't do squat here. Over all, this is a great film that I enjoy. Also, keep an eye out for Kieth Richards as Jacks dad. He kinda looks like Captain Hook and if Academy Awards for best makeup should go to any film it should be this one for making Kieth Richards not look like death. And though i tried to go the entire review without saying any pirate jargon, i cant help myself. MAN YOUR MISSEN MASS OR WALK THE PLANK YE WILL SAYS I. GRAB YOUR DUBLOONS, GET SOME POPCORN, AND SIT YOUR BOOTY DOWN TO WATCH 3 HOURS OF CINEMATIC BEAUTY THAT WILL SHIVER YE TIMBERS (it sure did mine)."

","This film is the greatest film i've seen in a long long time. It has everything.<br/><br/>The humor is right on que.

Every action scene is well thought out, and is different, and unique.<br/><br/>The storm fight scene at the end is the most epic thing i've experienced. The entire mood is just perfect.

"abtidusdraken","9","1","2","26 May 2007"," Pirates can't get any better
","In the first Pirates of the Caribbean, I felt like ""it's a really cool movie"" but I felt it wasn't the best Pirate movie ever. Then I saw ""Dead Man's Chest"" and I was equally impressed by it. I actually liked mostly the settings that they filmed, hiding any sort of acting clique that might be revealed by actors. And what does Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End have? Best Depp performance, excellent cinematography, great music, great plot, and mostly: a return of humor that just wasn't there in the second movie. More Pirates than ever too. Although this is probably the darkest of all three, I feel like maybe a giant waterfall or a whirlpool didn't feel really cool in the trailers. Well, if you see it on screen, and with some talented ideas to make even a ""de ja vu"" seem awesome, that's what you're going to be surprised to see when you see this movie. I would really disagree wtih many reviewers that Jack's appearance in the movie is late. They said mainly ""1hr, 45 minutes"". That is definitely wrong. Plus, the ""scenes of insanity"" were actually the places where most of the humor was hidden. Having Jack crazier than ever is something that a sane person cannot resist but laugh. Only the too serious people wouldn't understand how unbelievably funny the insane things that Jack does are throughout the movie. It would be also wrong to say that there's a lot of ""we've seen that before"". There definitely isn't. In terms of humor. The producers pushed more and more humor into the story, and there's jokes for everyone; even historians that might find it funny how well the quarrels were made between the Singaporean Pirates and the Caribbean Pirates. Special effects were great too, and I thought that Davy Jones is just awesome. Mainly during the final battle. Remember when King Kong's battle with the V-Rex's was praised so well because of a ""cinematic wonder""? Well here you have cinematic wonder number two: the battle between all of the Davy Jones's crew. Another great thing is, that although in the first and second movies you had sort of an idea of ""who was on who's side"" (even though the two movies tried to make you confused"", in this one, you really don't. And that's the best part. I mean, who would ever think that will would end up as he did in the end? Who would think that Jack and Elizabeth were actually not so involved as you might think? Who might think that Calypso would make an appearance in the history? I generally didn't think Pirates of the Caribbean 3 would be much worth from the trailers. But I was really surprised how funny things can get, and how the long length can be enjoyed. Most people complained about Jack not being there for the first 30 minutes of the film and an opening sequence in Singapore. Well, that isn't entirely bad, because you might as well get to see something more than just the sea. My only complaints about this movie are three things. First, I think that the new pirate played by Cho-yun Fat is pretty much useless. Therefore, making the beginning sort of senseless (but that does not mean entirely useless since it's a cool beginning with a few laughs!). I think Chow-Yun Fat just didn't leave such an impression on me as Davy Jones had. About 2 years ago when I first heard about World's End, I remember in an interview that Chow Yun Fat would be described as a much worse Pirate than Davy Jones had ever been. Unfortunately Davy Jones still remains the crowned villain of the series. The second nit-pick is just that I was so drawn into the movie that I was sort of disturbed with a very emo speech of Elizabeth before the final battle. And it was just lame. It was better for her not to make any speech because when the Pirates were just staring at her talking no sense, I was just feeling like the director should have been banged on the head and forced to remember ""I'm not making a Hollywood movie!"" Another very small thing is that I was agreeing with some reviewers that some characters return for nearly no reason. I mean, the admiral is just pointless in the movie (especially one of the last moments you see him and Elizabeth together). Jack's father was just plain awesome.<br/><br/>Overall, I think it was really pleasing. There isn't anything that you can probably go to right now, so if you already saw Spider-Man 3, go check out Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End for great entertainment."
"tajna_rabota","9","1","2","26 May 2007"," That was 3 hours? - Time flies when you are having fun!
","After the disappointments that were Spiderman 3 and Shrek 3, I went into Pirates 3 with really low expectations. I was very pleasantly surprised to see how much fun it was, and really kept to the standard set by the previous two films. It wasn't introspective or thought-provoking, but that is not what these movies are intended to be, anyways. Captain Sparrow is one of the funnest (and funniest) movie heroes to come around in recent memory, and Kiera Knightly's character is not some typical female sidekick, there just to be eye candy. Knightly is stunning to be sure, but her character, Elizabeth Swan, is a true heroine in every sense of the word.<br/><br/>This movie was fast-paced and didn't take itself too seriously, making it the perfect popcorn movie. It didn't get bogged down in too much ridiculous duologue or long-winded explanations. When the movie finished, I couldn't believe that nearly 3 hours had passed.<br/><br/>I would recommend anyone go and see this and have 3 hours of unbridled fun this summer. One warning, though: if you haven't seen the first two movies, do that first before you see this one, or else I fear this movie will make little sense to you. That said, it will still be fun to watch, regardless of your Pirates ""virginity""."
"Sandcooler","4","1","2","26 May 2007"," All of Hollywood's wrongs and even some new
","The worst feeling I had while watching this was that I predicted a joke, they did the joke, and the entire audience was nearly pissing themselves laughing. For the rest well, something explodes, there's stuff coming out of it that explodes, and then it falls apart in things that explode. And I thought Hollywood was out of ideas, while they're even out of the basic elements of ideas. The scene is which we see thirty Jack Sparrows talking to each other is well-made but dull as vanilla anyway. I'll skip through more than two hours of characters trying to build some kind of story (something with a treasure chest and other things made up by giving someone a blindfold and a dictionary) and just go to the final fight, which is pretty good actually. I had no idea who was who, but at least it looked cool. Couldn't hold a candle to the first one."

","I tend to go with a movie's overall experience and not focus on the smaller details. The feeling I get at the end of the movie is what counts! This one left me completely satisfied and humming the POTC tune for some hours! DMC was a disappointment probably because the first one created such high expectations! My suggestion is don;t get too involved in the sub-plots as they can cause confusion! The big picture fits in! Depp is phenomenal with great one liners and facial expressions! Rush's presence definitely enhances the movie's aura! The movie has charm, wit, better soundtrack, great action and overall, blockbuster to boot! WATCH IT!"

","This was a great movie led by an excellent cast don't get me wrong at all, in fact I really enjoyed watching this movie due to the battle scenes (which were emersely intense) and the love story between keira and Orlando. Also, the premiere of Richards was awesome. But the only thing that kinda got me about this movie, was there was a little too much going on and one time. I mean when you think you've figured out what you've been trying to figure out, there is another problem. Haha so I mean throughout the movie I was sitting there trying to figure out what happens, but then again in the end I did start to catch on so I guess it wasn't that bad as far as confusion goes, but I mean for a long time you are just there blank in the mind on what's going on. But the movie overall in the acting concept FANTASTIC ALL ON PARTS. As far as the action goes FANTASTIC. Drama? FANTASTIC. Romance? FANTASTIC."

Keira Knightley and Johhny Depp also had great work done and made this movie a pirates movie. There is just the right amount of all good things in here.

"Horsesfire","9","1","2","25 May 2007"," Unexpected
","When I decided to go to the midnight movie I was expecting too much. I knew no matter what I would like it because they would have to work VERY hard to screw up it up so I would dislike it. However it was unexpected in everyway for me. <br/><br/>The very beginning I thought was a dream sequence but it was really happening and it was weird. The following scenes and story development made me wonder what was truly going on. The scenes in Singapore were amazing and I loved Chow Yun-Fat's character-thats one pirate you do not want to mess with. Each character got their two cents in which I liked. When one character carries the whole thing its get boring. When Jack is losing is mind in the locker Johnny Depp does so well portraying the multiple aspects of his personality. Just watching his expression I saw that there are vulnerable parts of Jack Sparrow and I want to know what they are! Maybe before they do a pirates sequel they should do a prequel so we can learn why Jack does that...thing (you know what I'm talking about.) I especially liked how we got to see Jack sincerely struggling with his morals at the end. I'm not going to say what happens but it was amazing acting on all parts. The conflict between Elizabeth and Will was actually filled with tension. Everyone's lies catch up and insecurities build up. I actually believed they were in love this time around. Will's desire to fulfill his promise and also be with Elizabeth is honest and Elizabeth's need to ease her conscience is touching. I really liked the development of her character. SHe was a pirate and not the noble naive girl we have seen in past films. As for everything else. It was amazing. The scenes well designed and explosive (literally). The end. Unlike anything Disney has done (or should be doing-no more fluffy endings!). My heart hurt a little when I left. I would have cried if only I wasn't in a theatre packed with action movie fans. Where the Dead Man's Chest left us confused and wanting more, At World's End is so much more. Bravo. Well done. I personally give it ten, but in consideration for other audience members who may have been looking for something else I will also give it a 9. It was well worth the wait and 3AM drive."
"BeeEmDubya","3","1","2","25 May 2007"," Too outrageous to be taken seriously (spoilers)
","I went into this movie with way too high of expectations. I thought I would see an exciting movie with some good laughs and thrills. What I got was corny one-liners and the most outrageous scenes since Spiderman 3. Speaking of which, Pirates of the Caribbean: at World's End joins Spiderman 3 as movies with the worst fight-scene dialog ever...basically whenever the good guys talk to each other, one is guaranteed to say ""I'm a little busy at the moment."" Furthermore, I was unaware that you could launch a monkey from a cannon, but apparently POTC: AWE proved me wrong.<br/><br/>It was one outrageous scene after another and it starts when a million rock-crabs carry the Black Pearl on their backs. Jack Sparrow thinks it will be fun to carry on conversations with ten other Jack Sparrows...apparently Jack found some drugs in the land of the dead. Then William and Elizabeth decide to get married DURING the ""epic"" final battle. Then William dies and everyone sad, but don't worry, Will becomes the 4th character in the series to be brought back to life through some loop-hole in the plot. Boot-strap spends several minutes trying to kill his son, then right when it matters most he comes to his senses and tries to help him. Jack fights Davey Jones on the cylindrical sail-beam, which apparently was not slippery in the pouring rain. Then Elizabeth and Jack escape the sinking Fish-man ship by a flying parachute that is waiting for them. The evil British captain of the endeavor is enswarmed by millions of pieces of flying wood and explosions while he calmly descends a flight of stairs unscathed and decides NOT to fire back. Then the thousands of extra ships decide they can't beat two already severely-battered Black Pearl and Fish-man ship and they all turn around.<br/><br/>2007 will forever be remembered as the year that killed the trilogy. First Spiderman 3 proved that you don't need creative dialog or original stories to earn millions of dollars. Then Shrek 3 demonstrated the most blatant attempt in cinema history to market a plot less piece of rubbish; i wonder how much McDonalds is paying them for their glasses promotion. Now Pirates of the Caribbean: at World's End shows how it can trump them all with pointless lines and outrageous scenes just to sell tickets. Bourne Ultimatum will mark the 4th major Trequel to be released this year, and hopefully it won't suck like these major atrocities."

It sucked you in right from the beginning and held you to the very end(make sure wait through the screen credits). The(real)photography was beautiful with stunning locations. The CG was some of the best I've seen. This film is often bright and pleasing to the eye unlike many others. Special effects?? awesome! The sets / ships were proof of the attention to detail of the art and construction departments. The story and the way it was acted out just couldn't have been better. It was exciting, maybe a little scary for the little ones and often times very funny. I can't imagine the amount of research involved putting this all together."
"monkeygonebananas24","10","1","2","25 May 2007"," An Awesome End to An Awesome Trilogy
","Alright, many kids at my school are passing around that this movie is lame, but I'd like to set the record straight: Basically, if you're a die-hard POTC fan like I am, this movie takes the cake as being the best one out of the three. This movie explains a lot of content in the last two movies, and it does a good job of doing so, for example, how Davy Jones got really gross-like, and who Tia Dalma really is...<br/><br/>If you're a special effects worshiper, you will ADORE this movie. The main fight scene takes place in a whirlpool while in a rainstorm, and the effects are stunning.<br/><br/>Jack Sparrow, surprise surprise, provides the vast majority of the comedy in this movie, but you cannot complain. The scene where he is in Davy Jones' locker is the funniest scene in the whole movie, and some people were laughing so hard they were in tears.<br/><br/>On the other hand, some of the scenes move quickly, and you may not catch them if you're not paying attention... :) But, overall, this movie is hands down one of the best movies I have ever seen. <br/><br/>Don't be surprised that this Disney movie is not all fluffy kittens, sunshine and happy rainbows at the end like they usually are, in fact, Jack Sparrow is downright offensive in some of his last lines! Hey, he's a pirate, you can't expect much from him! <br/><br/>There is definitely room for a fourth, but Jerry Bruckheimer says no more will be coming unless a miracle happens. Johnny Depp is totally willing to do as many as they can crank out.<br/><br/>For the blooper hunters, there's a few obvious ones, and they're quite funny to catch. And for the quote hunters, they one again grace upon the subject of rum. :)<br/><br/>FYI, to all ladies who are wondering, Orlando Bloom is really hot in this one!"
"dunedain16","9","1","2","25 May 2007"," Well worth the matinée price.
","Director Jerry Bruckheimer really outdid himself in this third installment of the trilogy. The story is complex but entertaining, the visual effects are state-of-the-art, and the acting is...good. There's a bit of a sense that the actors are trying to get through with this and not pouring themselves into it heart and soul. The fight sequences also aren't quite as elaborate (except for one near the end, the context of which is very complicated) as in the first two movies, but you'll still be riveted to your seat. It's a little hard to keep up with some things, but overall I think you'll be very satisfied.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp's Jack Sparrow is a little different in this movie. He's a touch more serious, and not as given to making playful eunuch jokes. I'm not sure I miss this, but the middle-schoolers probably will. Keira Knightley's character Elizabeth is more battle-hardened, but still carries some emotional baggage about having sacrificed Jack to the Kraken. It's something like Domino meets Pride & Prejudice. Orlando Bloom's Bill Turner actually plays second fiddle to Jack and Barbosa (I guess that makes him third fiddle), and speaking of Barbosa, Geoffrey Rush is possibly the most genuine actor on the set.<br/><br/>I was struck by just how unique this trilogy really is. The dialog, the action sequences, the plot twists, the cinematography, the character development...it all adds up to a set of films unlike any other. I would say that it's worth the matinée price at any theater, but some people might not be willing to go to the later, more expensive showings. But I would.<br/><br/>Oh yeah, and watch for Keith Richards."
"FurBallsUnite","Null","1","2","25 May 2007"," *HUGE* fan of the first, but this was just atrocious
","OK, I'm a pirate nerd, and I'll admit it. The first movie is still one of my all-time favorites. It had everything -- suspense, romance, action, fantasy, comedy, special effects, great characters, hot actors and actresses, etc. I jumped on the pirate bandwagon instantly and still love the first as much as I did back in the day. The second one was OK. It had too many subplots, but it was still kind of enjoyable. The third? Terrible. Atrocious. A monstrosity. I kid you not, it was that bad. I was so excited to see it that I stayed up all night and fought intense pirate-garbed traffic to see it at midnight on Thursday. Words can not express how disappointed I was in this movie and how disgusted I was after seeing it. I had to take a shower to cleanse myself of this filth.<br/><br/>There were just too many subplots that honestly made no sense whatsoever. The second one had a lot, but at least the rest of the movie was slightly enjoyable. Now I've watched deep movies like ""The Departed"" or ""Crash"" with no problem, but this one was impossible to follow. I am not an idiot, but this movie gave me an enormous headache. This guy's bad, no, he isn't, he is, no, he pretended, he pretended to pretend, she found out, they're mad, he's good, maybe, they'll make up, maybe, no, bomb falls, what? Maybe he is, I guess not, yes, no. She loves him, no wait, he loves her, no wait, this happened and made it crazy, never mind, OK, yes, no, maybe........ HUH?! Turns out that everyone else I've talked to about this movie was also confused. It had no coherence, much less a point. Stuff came out of nowhere and random things popped up that made no sense. Seriously.<br/><br/>The only redeeming qualities about this movie were the Johnny Depp comedy scenes and the fact that Kiera gets a bigger part than just sitting there and screaming. That's it.<br/><br/>From one pirate fan to another (perhaps), only see this movie if you're a die-hard fan, and I mean a DIE-HARD FAN. If you're only a semi-fan, wait for the DVD. It really is not worth going to the theater unless you'll die if you don't see this movie. Personally, I saw it because I wanted to see it before some idiot had the chance to spoil anything for me."
"Onthethreshold","9","1","2","25 May 2007"," Absolutely fantastic and beyond expectation
","This 3rd installment of the POTC trilogy is by far the BEST in my view. Each character in this movie really gets some serious screen time but more importantly the plot comes together in ways you'd never expect. Critics that pointed out that key characters each had their own plots and treachery weren't kidding. The movie seriously ends on a note you'd never quite expect and that is the genius of this particular installment. I think honestly my favorite character in this now is Lord Beckett, ruthless as he is, Tom Hollander did an excellent job filling out the role of a villain beyond his part in POTC 2. Almost comfortable that he is playing the part.<br/><br/>This I will purchase when it comes out on DVD."

There are almost no bad words to say about this movie other than the ""where'd the rum go"" joke is dead, and should be laid to rest, but that is no big deal. All the actors are perfect in their parts, and even actors otherwise viewed as ""not deep"" added depth to the characters. There is a lot in the story line, though, so remember to pay attention and avoid bathroom breaks, there aren't really any lulls that would be a good time. They yet again do an amazing job at putting a perfect amount of violence in the movie, making most gore implied and not shown, but showing important parts that need to be shown.

It keeps you on edge and the various twists and turns make it the best of the trilogy for me! The return of Barbossa and Davey Jones make it even more exciting, with one evil character, turn to a 'goodie'. The relationship between Elizabeth and Will blooms, and Jack is back, as witty as ever.

Also, I loved the first Pirates movie, it was witty, unique, and interesting.<br/><br/>But now to the hard stuff. The script in this movie was a mess, there were worthless characters at every turn, and bit characters that became main characters in the blink of an eye. There was even comic relief for the comic relief in this movie, almost at the level of such classics as Airplane, or 2001 a Space Travesty.<br/><br/>Second, the use of computer graphics was mind blowing. I don't even know why they spent money on a pirate ship or actors in the first place. They could have saved money and just used the CG characters that were in the majority of the fights for the whole movie.<br/><br/>I don't want to spoil anything, so I'll be as tight lipped as possible with this one. The ending while and interesting idea at a moving and romantic one, I felt was ruined by all the previous ridiculousness.<br/><br/>But hey, I'm no expert. It's just my opinion. I just hate seeing good movies ruined by poor sequels, or prequels. Such as the Mummy, Matrix, the Original Star Wars Trilogy, and the Fellowship of the Ring, I know they couldn't have just stopped after the first, but I wish the second two could have been a lot better."

"I_Am_The_Taylrus","9","1","2","26 May 2007"," Holy Smokes! (SPOILERS)
","SPOILERS<br/><br/>Holy smokes is a compliment, by the way. This film was definitely one of the most anticipated films for me this year, apart from the Simpsons Movie. Trust me, this has lived up to its hype. This film is incredible, and when I mean incredible, I mean that the CGI, wow, where do I start? The CGI in this film is, well, there are no real words to describe the CGI. I am going to try, though. Incredible, amazing, magnificent, wonderful, surreal, and just plain great. This film, though, still has flaws. Like all the Pirates of the Caribbean films this one has one major flaw, the plot. The plot is not as bad as the second one, but it is still hard to learn. There are too many twists and turns, and some side plots seemed that they were just thrown in.<br/><br/>I also enjoyed the music of this film, too. There were a lot of good songs. Speaking of songs, the beginning of this film is very dark. I mean, twenty people were hanged in one minute, including a child. The reason why that made me think of a song is because the child starts singing Hoist the Colours.<br/><br/>Here is the plot. The end of piracy is near, and the East India Trading Company lead by Cutler Beckett and the Flying Dutchman, controlled by Davy Jones, rule the sea. When that is happening Elizabeth Swann, Will Turner, Barbossa, Tia Dalma, and the crew of the Black Pearl go to Singapore to steal Navigational Charts from pirate lord Sao Feng and his crew on the Empress to rescue Jack Sparrow from Davy Jones' Locker. They succeed. They rescue Jack. They discover that Beckett has the heart of Davy Jones, and they have to meet the pirate lords at the Brethen Court. Then Sao Feng and the Empress captures Elizabeth, thinking that she is the goddess Calypos, who was Davy Jones's love. Calypos is actually Tia Dalma. Sao Feng is then killed. Before he dies he says that Elizabeth is the captain of the Empress. Elizabeth and the crew of the Empress then are held prisoner by the Flying Dutchman. They escape. Meanwhile, they make it to the Court. The pirate lords vote who to be King of the Court. Elizabeth wins. She says that they have to fight the Davy Jones and Beckett. They prepare to fight, but they are outnumbered by ships. Calypos then makes a huge maelstrom when she bursts into crabs. In the battle, Will and Elizabeth become man and wife and Will is stabbed by Jones. He then stabs Jones's heart, killing him. Will becomes the new captain of the Flying Dutchman because of that. Everyone blows Beckett up, and the pirates win. The only problem is that Will has to be at sea only to return to land every 10 years. In the meantime, Jack tries to find the Foutain of Youth in a dingy and everyone parts their separate ways.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a very good finale to such an excellent franchise. I am kind of sad the the Kraken died though! She was easily the coolest character and they show her corpse. It was sad. This film is also really long, but there is a scene at the end that you can watch after the credits. Some scenes are really well done too, such as Beckett walking down the steps of his ship while everything is exploding behind him in slow motion, before he too is blown up. There are also a lot of characters that are killed off that are important. Norrington, for example. Some scenes were also funny, too, like all of the POTC films. For example, Jack's hallucinations are hysterical, especially the coral-like one who lost his brain. Anyway, this is an action-packed finale that made me hoping for more films to come.<br/><br/>9/10 <br/><br/>Recommended Films: Pirates of the Caribbean 1 and 2."
"SqueekyGurl","8","1","2","25 May 2007"," Over-excessive in plot, but dry in character depth
","""Pirates of the Caribbean 3: At World's End"" is a difficult movie to review. A good end to the popular trilogy in the sense that every loose end from the first two films is tied up, but strangely leaves you hungry for more by suggestively setting itself up for yet another sequel.<br/><br/>The most exciting part of the movie was that we get to see all our favorite characters interacting with each other in the same film, but the most unsettling part of the film is that there are so many sub-plots and somewhat unrelated situations occurring at the same time that it is difficult for the viewer to keep track of everything. Not to mention two peripheral characters who have been with the trilogy since the first film are killed before the first half is done.<br/><br/>I mostly was unsatisfied that what seemed to be the suggested sequel at the end of ""Dead Man's Chest"" (Pirates 2) was not the primary focus of ""At World's End"" at all. The suggested sequel of finding Jack was rushed, and was complete in the first 30 minutes into the film. But the most difficult aspect of the film was the strange urge to get up when you were forced to sit through the lack of thrilling action that doesn't actually reveal itself until the end in one huge burst.<br/><br/>Over All, I give ""POTC: At Word's End"" an 8 out of 10.<br/><br/>It is suggested that the first two films are watched before this one, otherwise you'd have trouble understanding a good portion of the film."
"ileana-patrolea","9","1","2","25 May 2007"," A world's end... or is it?
","I will start off by saying that I haven't laughed so much in a cinema theater since... never, really! Johnny Depp's sense of humor is out of this world.<br/><br/>Next, let me say they wanted to have it all in this movie: breath-taking action, adventure, romance, supernatural, flying monkeys and politics. They also brought together all the characters that appeared throughout the first two movies and them some! Fortunately, they pulled it off thanks to the funny parts that really connected all these different topics and characters.<br/><br/>The ending surprised me, in a good way that is. I was really expecting a very cheesy 'they lived happily ever after', but it was not quite like that. Yes, it tied up all the annoying loose ends from ""Dead Man's Chest"". But I believe it left a few open doors for a forth movie. Let's hope it's not the end of the Caribbean world :)<br/><br/>All in all it was a very entertaining 2 and a half hours. I recommend it to anyone that is up for a hearty laugh."
"rytis","Null","1","2","25 May 2007"," The movie was great
","First of all, stay after the credits, there's one more scene at the end. 80% of the theater cleared out and missed it.<br/><br/>The movie is much better than the second installment, and all the new characters added charm. But it certainly is darker film than the first two. Starting off a movie with mass hangings (including children) certainly was uplifting.<br/><br/>I'm still disappointed in that the East India Trading Company doesn't seem as great a threat as it's supposed to be though you get the impression pirates and their friends are dying due to their actions. It's almost as if the British are made out to be some long lost version of the third Reich carrying out an anti-pirate holocaust.<br/><br/>All the odd twists and turns and back stabbing doesn't quite convince you it's all necessary to the movie, adding almost too much cerebral thinking, but the action scenes and the pirates do save the movie from becoming too dark.<br/><br/>Jack Sparrow's multiple personalities of his hallucinations certainly were a cool addition, and Keith Richards did add a special moment to the film when he introduced the Pirates Codex (written version) and what a deep voice he has.<br/><br/>It's a long movie, but it kept my attention. Orlando Bloom still disappointed me, and Keira Knightly was just passable. But Jack Sparrow and his Pirate universe was what this movie is really all about, and they were great! Arrr!"
"Stagerequired84","9","1","2","25 May 2007"," Very well done
","In reading some reviews, I was shocked to hear things like ""it wasn't full of surprises like the first movie""...To me, the movie was incredible. It probably won't be for everyone because not everyone enjoys a movie that goes beyond being simple and to the point. I for one, truly enjoyed the turns and twists that take place throughout the movie.<br/><br/>The way the movie was shot, you got to see more of characters you only got brief laughs with earlier on. I think that actually was my favorite part. And perhaps one of the major improvements from number 2, was the comedic moments breaking up moments that would be otherwise boring to people who were not fans of Pirates.<br/><br/>All in all, the cast does an amazing job, and the ending is really beautiful. Pirates fans must see, but I believe if you had at least a good idea of the second movie, you'll really enjoy this film. By far one of the better ends to a trilogy in the past ten years for me."
"sackjigler","8","1","2","25 May 2007"," Excellent
","Don't listen to anyone on this film prior to seeing it if you can. All I read about before going into this was how confusing it was, how long it was, and how slow it was. There is nothing confusing about this plot and this movie if you just pay attention. Their are double crosses abound and twists and turns aplenty, and they are all just part of the fun.<br/><br/>The film starts out with a clear and vivid explanation of why the pirates must fight. Every known pirate; man, woman, and child, are being hung for the acts. The only way to live as a pirate would be to fight back. As explained in the first two films, pirates are not trustworthy people, therefore double crosses and backstabs are bound to come up, and boy do they ever. You can't trust anyone, even those who you wouldn't suspect.<br/><br/>In my opinion the first hour is so much fun that it doesn't even feel drawn out or long. The second hour drags a tad, but not bad. The third hour, (yes, it's 3 hours long) is so remarkable it feels like it's ten minutes long. An amazing special effects sequence of two ships in a whirlpool that will leave you breathless.<br/><br/>Overall I thought the movie was wonderful and was left open for plenty more sequels. All previous loose ends were tied up but now more have been created. The fates of these peoples lives were very surprising and you are wanting to know after this one, what will happen next.<br/><br/>If you enjoyed the first two, you will enjoy this the same. I highly recommend seeing it. And there is plenty of humor in this one, a welcome return if you ask me. Enjoy."
"tmargoni","3","1","2","25 May 2007"," Don't trust any positive reviews
","Trust me, the positive reviews of this movie are the result of viewers who loved the first two films so much that simply seeing Jack on screen again was going to draw positive reviews. Don't buy it. <br/><br/>The visuals--makeup, costume, lighting, special effects, etc.--are fantastic. But it doesn't really matter when a film is so poorly written, poorly directed, and the actors are left to execute a horrible script. Johnny Depp needs to stop doing these films before they ruin his legacy as a great actor; I know, I know, he makes millions and millions of dollars from this film. <br/><br/>The witty, snappy lines delivered in the first ""Pirates"" movie are long gone, replaced by lame one-liners and bop-you-on-the-head, guys-looking-up-a-skirt humor that a few 4th graders might like. And we know, by now, that it's entirely possible to write a funny movie that both adults and children can appreciate. (See most Pixar films.) This misses on both target groups. <br/><br/>I can't even justify spending much time on this review. But I must point out how the film is 2.5 hours long, and should have been edited down to about an hour and a half. Extremely long scenes of dialogue, seemingly pointless exchanges between enemies for 15 minutes before going into battle, and tedious moments of forced romance will put serious moviegoers to sleep. <br/><br/>See this movie when it comes on DVD, if you must see it at all. And if you still insist on going to the theater, take a good nap before you go, and load up on caffeine halfway through the film. Don't worry, you won't need or want anyone to fill you in on what you missed when you stepped out."
"BlackCat725","8","1","2","25 May 2007"," Too long? Who cares!
","Yes, it's long (but really, it's only 2.5 hours long the CREDITS are an extra 15 minutes!) yes, it's overblown and yes, it's kinda confusing, but personally, I didn't care. I thought it wrapped all the loose ends up quite nicely (but created a couple more dangling ones) and I loved watching every explosion. I actually felt bad about some of the characters that died and it confirmed my plot suspicions from POTC2. For me, there wasn't quite enough Capt. Jack, but I can never get enough Capt. Jack.<br/><br/>My biggest complaint wasn't with the movie itself but the theater I saw it at, the sound quality was AWFUL and I missed quite a bit of dialog.<br/><br/>But all in all, a must see for Pirates fans!!"
"doodygray","8","1","2","25 May 2007"," Fine end to an excellent trilogy
","I was a bit apprehensive about this film. I enjoyed the first instalment hugely, but the second had lost a bit of the dry humour that I loved about the first. But in this film, it's back. It's definitely better than than 'Dead Man's Chest' and, in my opinion, at least on a par with the original. Of course, a lot of the humour comes from Depp, but he didn't carry this film in the same way that he did in the second. I'm not a big fan of Keira Knightley's or Orlando Bloom's acting, but Geoffrey Rush and Bill Nighy more than compensated for their failings. There's a nice turn from Keith Richards as well.<br/><br/>It takes a while to get going, and after about 45 minutes or so I had my reservations, but it picks up from there, and when it does get going, it doesn't stop. It features one of the best fight scenes I've seen, again with some of the humour that is characteristic of the trilogy. If I'm going to be really picky, I would say that the plot becomes a bit convoluted at times, but that's being very harsh.<br/><br/>One of the things that's not mentioned enough about the film is the amazing soundtrack. It really wouldn't be quite the same with the famous dun-DUH-duh-duh-duh-duhnun etc etc. Full marks to the sound team for that! All in all, a film that's well worth going to see. Even if you haven't seen the first two, this one's still worth a look."
"nsacoldsun","10","1","2","25 May 2007"," Hands Down Best Movie of the YEAR!
","I was kinda skeptical at first about the length of this movie but after sitting through this movie 3 times thus far I can honestly say this movie never loses your attention or draws on. There have been other length movies that have that ability to be long and just draw the audience on into a dull somber mood while Pirates does exactly the opposite. It will draw you deeper and deeper into the stories plot until one final explosive ending that has you on the edge of your seat. Plus the bit at the end of the credits was a very nice touch to end the series...Maybe. Johnny Depp has dropped hints that he would be up for doing another one which is entirely possible with the way the movie did end. So hopefully the producers of this movie are pleased with the gross intake, which is easily probably going to set box office records, enough to make a fourth."

","This movie is definitely worth to watch. If you like a roller-coaster of fantastic action scenes, here and there some humor, and if you do not mind some unrealistic situations, its even a must to see.<br/><br/>Big, bigger, biggest, thats how I feel the last movie in the Pirates of the Caribean trilogy can be best described. But biggest doesn't mean best. The main feeling that stays with me is a simple economic principle. The more money you spend, the more you should expect. Being one of the most expensive movies ever, it is also normal that all scenes are so special, and no effort was saved to use animations.<br/><br/>The makers have tried to combine a lot of plot lines, but this does not really add value. The plot itself is traditional, and the acting itself is average. But at the end, would you expect something else? 168 minutes is this roller-coaster long. It could have done with 120. But imagine yourself going to a fun-park, you see this big big roller-coaster, of which you precise know what to expect (you have done so many before), would you still go on it? Off course! And thats what this movie is about. A big, expensive roller-coaster, which is difficult to resist.<br/><br/>Because of the simple plot, definitely no 10/10, but because of the huge fun sitting on this roller-coaster, I give it an 8/10"
"bangban_tribudiman","8","1","2","25 May 2007"," Darker than the others
","Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End clocks in at 2hrs 48 minutes much longer than the first and marginally longer than the second, but the time flies bye. We start where we left off, with Jack stuck in Davey Jones locker and Elizabeth, Will, Barbosa and the others setting off to find him and rescue him.<br/><br/>The film moves through stunning visual locations which are made better by using a vast amount of brilliantly constructed CGI which really makes the film feel more real to the eye. However there is very little screen time for the impressive Cracken from Dead Man's Chest.<br/><br/>Kieth Richards plays Jacks dad superbly with brilliant supporting roles from Stellan Staarsgaard, Bill Nighy, Geoffrey Rush and Tom Hollander as the villainous leader of the East India Company. Johnny Depp continues to amaze with his portrayal of Jack Sparrow. All the favourites from the first two return which gives the film an added bright tone.<br/><br/>However the subject matter and cinematography make the film much darker than one and two. Some material could easily be classed in the 15 category rather than the mere 12A rating it received. As the film plays on the characters emotions a lot more than the previous instalments.<br/><br/>Come the end, it does leave it's self open for Pirates 4 however unlikely it will be. A fitting end to an amazing trilogy one not to be missed by any Pirates fan.<br/><br/>8/10"
"FirePheonix8107","10","1","2","25 May 2007"," Don't Listen to Critics
","Though this movie is indeed complex, if you look to actively watch the multiple plot lines you will have no issue with this movie. The varied plots and turns provide a wonderful three hour ride. Further, the screenwriters for this movie were wonderful in their abilities to create a dark, heavy scene and follow it up with a lighthearted joke or throwback reference to earlier movies of this franchise. We cannot of course forget the stunning visuals that were painted throughout the movie. From a seamless starry sky reflected on the water to the totally awe inspiring final battles, this movie provided elements on so many fronts that you cannot help but enjoy it. So enjoy At World's End for all of these things. and if nothing else because it is ushering in a new era of cinema for Disney, wherein jolly stories can be made with adult issues and connotations."

","So, some people are saying this movie is horrible - most are saying this movie is great. I can't really understand what film the people who hated this movie were watching, because it couldn't have been the pirates I saw.<br/><br/>The third film was brilliant! You see, I am a huge fan of the first pirates. I saw it 24 times in the theater, no joke. And then I saw the second one. I must admit, I was extremely disappointed. All dead mans chest seemed to do was repeat the jokes from the first movie, and boringly set up a third installment. But when I saw the third film, I was in no way let down, in fact I was surprised by its originality, character development and ability to keep my interest.<br/><br/>People say that AWE lacks action until the end...and I agree that it had many less action sequences than I and many others expected..however, there were so many other things going on in the movie, that too much action would have spoiled the film. The plot was complicated...but not so complicated that it could not be followed. Because there was so much going on, the movie (yes even dialogue scenes) never got boring. Another feature of this film was that new characters were introduced, and old ones were developed and brought into new light (espcially Elizabeth Swann..Keira Knightly carried out a phenomenal performance). The jokes were actually extremely original (unlike in dead mans chest) and the visual effects were again stunning.<br/><br/>This movie surprised me because it is so unlike the first or second pirates. It still carries on the first two films attitude and good qualities, but it brings so much more depth, talent, plot and even gore than the first two.<br/><br/>Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End is not a three-quel to be missed. Shrek and Spiderman can wait until DVD...but this is a movie that is worth your buck."

This movie is perhaps the better of the trilogy, FULL of surprises, with a great end and excellent action and fun scenes.<br/><br/>A great lesson about love, honor, courage, merged with very fun sequences, and awesome battles.

"Baldrick44","10","1","2","25 May 2007"," A great conclusion
","POTC 3: At World's End focuses on the conundrum of Jack Sparrow ( Johnny Depp ) who now finds himself in Davy Jones' Locker. On the way to save him are Will Turner ( Orlando Bloom ), Elizabeth Swann ( Keira Knightley ) and Captain Barbossa ( Geoffery Rush ); all of whom are racing against time to ally with Sparrow, as well as the other pirates lords such as Sao Feng ( Chao Yun-Fat ) in order to combat the growing menace of Cutler Beckett ( Tom Hollander ) and Davy Jones ( Bill Nighy ).<br/><br/>Like the first two this one has its share of laughs and spills, but there is also some great dialogue between some of the leads. Depp is great as Sparrow and looks like he could do another 3 movies, while Knightley and Bloom have their moments in the sun. But it is Bill Nighy and Geoffery Rush that really drive this movie forward; with Nighy playing Jones as a great man who lost his way; adding depth to his character and Rush having a fantastic time as the villain turned anti-hero Barbossa. The chemistry that these two manage to generate with Depp and with Chao Yun-Fat ( in the case of Rush ) is great. And of course, finally, the supporting cast of pirates who have been through the movies, led by Kevin McNally as Gibbs are once again wonderful.<br/><br/>POTC3 closed out the series very well. Many people will be annoyed by the constant twists and turns, but hey, they're pirates! It's half the fun!"

Like most people, I felt that the second installment fell short of the standards set from the first. I have to admit that after reading critics' comments beforehand, I was a bit concerned about how AWE might measure up to the other two. I could not have been more pleased with the outcome, though there were a few scenes I thought were unnecessary. Minus the ""tiny Jack"" scenes and the constant double-crossing and confusing dialogue at times, the movie was the most visually stunning of the three. Battle scenes and fight scenes were amazing, costumes decadent, and characters unfailingly witty and likable.

Even though it has A lot more exposition (some of it incoherent), it's a footnote to the near flawless cgi, fair amount of violence (Go Disney!) and pretty darn good acting. The cast stepped up, the crew stepped up, the budget stepped up, the whole thing stepped up! The only thing in limbo in this movie is Will. He had means and opportunity to beef up his character. But he simpered on arrival. The plot though confusing did what it was supposed to do.

The eye candy just melts perfectly into the story.<br/><br/>The story part of the film felt smooth. Shrek III seemed clunky to me compared to the first two. Not so with this. A review I read yesterday on CNN or something said Pirates is all over the place, and it is. But it's a big ocean and these characters get around.

"MyBrokenFantasy","9","1","2","25 May 2007"," The Best Film Wedding In History
","Incredible film! Unlike many others, I was not disappointed in Dead Man's Chest, and I found it equally amusing as the first one, but obviously less unique and new - which was an element only the first movie in any series will ever have. I did not find the plot confusing in this last update to the pirate trilogy and the characters had new depth which was intriguing and well thought out. I actually ended up feeling sorry for Davy Jones and Barbossa entertained me perhaps more than Jack Sparrow himself!<br/><br/>The writing below contains big spoilers, just thought I'd mention :)<br/><br/>The reason this film got a 9 and not a 10 was simply because I did not like the very end, and certain aspects were tacky and over done. Tia Dalma being Calipso was well done, however, when she turned into the Goddess briefly... it didn't work. It looked tacky and as though nobody really knew how to make a Goddess and so stole an idea of a giant from a children's book. Also, when Jack was going insane in the Lock, I understood the many Jacks around him, who he was interacting with in his head. His insanity and the weirdness made sense int he Lock, but as soon as they got back into 'real life' (for lack of a better term) and the many Jacks kept popping up in his hair and the walls and talking to him... it was over done, like a desperate attempt to add comedy where comedy was not needed. Also, as Jack was now scared of death, he seemed less... Jack-like? His hatred for William Turner and his fear of dying seemed to mature him, which I suppose was the point, but he seemed more cruel than I would have hoped.<br/><br/>Other than these small sections that needed editing (the many Jacks and the giant Calipso) I was very impressed. It had comedy moments, and a terrific rivalry continuously between Jack and Barbosa. Another excellent performance from Will's father, and the relationship between Will and Elizabeth reached new levels of depth and became complicated again - but in a good way.<br/><br/>The film did not have a typical Disney ending, and seemed extremely incomplete, to be honest. Whilst the Black Pearl could end up with Barbosa, Jack going off in a dingy... I did not like it. It seemed a hugely anti-climatic ending for such a spectacular trilogy. It honestly makes you feel that a forth movie is needed. Will as the captain of the Flying Dutchman worked well, however, he did not even end up on the same boat as Elizabeth, which seems saddening after so long of building their relationship up together. The fountain of youth had never been mentioned before, either, and seemed a very random way to end the trilogy... which is why so many I have spoken to believe there will be a spin-off, if not a forth. I'm not keeping my hopes up, but if it happens, I will be the first in the cinema!<br/><br/>And the best part of the movie? Most definitely the wedding of Will and Elizabeth. It was possibly the best film wedding in history."

","If you have seen the first and loved it, then seen the second and taken slightly aback because you thought it was a little too over done, then be prepared to be set in the middle. At first I was going to wait, but when it was to be shown starting 4 hours earlier (due to midnight showings) it was decided to see if it could stand up to the first. The movie was once again mixed with all the things a pirate could want: love, romance, betrayal, twist, action, betrayal, and of course the sea. If people want to place the first movie against this one, it is advised against. Even though the story line continues, it seems to take on a life of its own. You wanted to see where the story went, but when you looked for something to go from in the previous movies, there was only the story. As it progressed I found myself wanting to see what was twisting where and how it was to come to fruition. As to be expected, the action gave some fun to the movie, but the intrigue was well placed. It didn't bowl you over but it was not slow going. ALmost a little long you have small kids with you. If you loved the first one, and like this one, stay for the ending."

","This was seriously the highlight of the movies this year. And it met all expectations. I have to say firstly that the second one wasn't that great but when you watch the third Pirates, you realize why. Everything is explained, every knot is tied and there's even that spark and charm that was loved in the Curse of the Black Pearl. Usually the third movies aren't very good endings. But this was the best ending you could probably ever get.<br/><br/>It was fantastic graphic wise. The scene with the crabs and Calypso was extremely realistic and the arrival of all of the East India Trading Companies' fleet was jaw-dropping. The storm and the maelstrom was amazing as well. Not just the CGI, the fight scenes were filled with excitement and were long but not tedious. And the settings were amazing. Absolute wonder for the eyes.<br/><br/>The plot was also brilliant. It wasn't too complicated and everything said and done had a reason. It also contained lots of action scenes so the storyline remained interesting. In addition to that, there was enough romance scenes and Will/Elizabeth fans, rejoice :D The ending is bittersweet but at least it's not cheesy. And also, not too many new characters join the Pirates crew but those who do are integrated into the storyline very well without being random or annoying.<br/><br/>However, if you don't like watching 3 hour movies, you won't like Pirates. It can be tedious but I enjoyed every minute of it. Also, there isn't as much of Jack's charm as the first movie but he was still the wonderful Captain Jack Sparrow. And Will Turner and Elizabeth were just the cutest couple. There is a bit of action movie cheesiness but you'll ignore that, cause it was really funny :D I am definitely getting the whole box-set for Pirates of the Caribbean."
"jessesweetemail","10","1","2","25 May 2007"," I was blown away...
","Having just seen this, I was expecting much because of the big lead up it held in Pirates 2 and thought it might have the themes that the first two held, a story about piracy but with a certain fluffiness, how wrong I was.<br/><br/>I was shocked and impressed by the beginning and couldn't wait to see how much darker this one was going to be to the first two and it was much darker and the violence much more explicit (but you can still call it a family film).<br/><br/>The acting is wonderful. Johnny Depp was once again at his best as CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow and Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom deserve to be mentioned, their acting skills have come a long way since their break-out rolls. Another honourable mention would have to be Australia's very own Geoffrey Rush, he shined as Captain Barbossa and in my own personal opinion stole the whole movie. Bill Nighy was also wonderful as the heartless Davey Jones.<br/><br/>The story is very strong and you can easily follow what was happening in the movie. The script is very quick witted and original and the mind blowing special effects just add to the brilliance of the film.<br/><br/>I was very happy with the ending and I was glad that the ending for Jack Sparrow, left a possible opening for a fourth film.<br/><br/>I say all in all Pirates 3 is the best yet in the trilogy."
"menuet-1","3","1","2","25 May 2007"," Went The Way of LOTR
","I loved the first Pirates movie. The acting was good, the humor was funny, the action was exciting and it seemed to be an all-around good movie. 2 and 3 however, have been cheesy. In many respects, it's as if the directors noticed that 13 and 14 year old girls were going nuts over the first movie, so they'd cater to 13 and 14 year old girls, instead of going ahead and producing the great movie they had envisioned. It's the same thing that happened to Lord of the Rings - a great first movie developed a large, young fanbase, and those in charge immediately turned up the cheese to make them happy.<br/><br/>So what was cheesy you ask? Tia Dalma inflating like a balloon, pretty little Keira Knightley snapping, jumping on a barrel and giving a ""let's go kill 'em all"" speech, Elizabeth and Jack parachuting on a sail up, away from a ship and to safety, about 5 minutes of people swordfighting while suspended by ropes... as well as about 150 jokes with the freaking monkey."

","I just watched the movie in Singapore yesterday. It's simply fantastic. It's much much better than ""Spiderman3"" (which upset me so...).Even better than the previous two. It's entirely fantastic journey, Depp shines as usual.<br/><br/>The story is weird as usual, but full of laughing points and meaningful words. The director is smart and he gives Depp a individual part to show his talent in this movie. I can't help laughing most of times. It's not just a simple movie for the theme park or a plain comedy. Now I wish the Pirates of Crb. 4 will be considered by the director.<br/><br/>I'm a fan of Depp, I love the movie and wish to watch it again!

","OK so Pirates 3 delivered as well as Spider-Man 3 did. I have not yet gone to see Shrek the Third, but my guess is that people were complaining about the 3rd Spider-Man and Shrek movies because they were just waiting for Pirates to come out. One thing about pirates 3 that didn't make sense was the little Jack Sparrows in Jack's head. Now I can understand the multiple Jack's when he was still in Davey Jones locker, but as specified by the other characters he wasn't imagining things any more. i was not a big fan of the mini Jack's as I will prefer them as. This movie did have great action with great special effects. Yes the story did go in many directions, but hey come on this is a pirates movie. Anyway I thought it was better than Dead Man's Chest and it ended the story well. There is no need for a 4th one. If any series doesn't need a 4th film its this one. I think if a 4th one were made it would ruin the story. I give this film an 8/10."
"beckybex-1","8","1","2","25 May 2007"," Swashbuckling Fun!
","I don't understand all the reviews of this as being rubbish. I enjoyed it and thought it was just as good as Dead Mans Chest. Jack Sparrow was great as usual. I have to say that the love story angle in my eyes is a bit annoying but thats just me. The effects were spectacular and fight scenes really good. The only drawback was the plot being a little bit too confusing but then again there were things that needed tying up from Dead Mans Chest so there wasn't much that could have been cut out. I think any fan of Pirates will enjoy this. Most people say it can't top the first one which is will never do. Curse of the Black Pearl was a film that came out of the blue and that is what made it so good in the first place because it was unexpected.

"rjn538","5","1","2","25 May 2007"," Pirates of the Caribbean: A Worst End
","First off I I want to say that my voting was done bearing in mind the greatness of the past two movies and the level of expectation I had. As a movie on its own my rating might have been slightly higher.<br/><br/>I just came back from the movie theatre . . . and I have to say that I have been extremely let down. This movie just was not of the same caliber as the other two. The acting was incredible, the cinematography was impeccable, and the witty/slap stick humor was hysterical as it always has been, but in the end the plot (for me) just ruined the movie. The movie wasn't too hard to follow. Yes there was a lot of betrayal and new plot twists; nothing that you couldn't eventually grasp. The plot just didn't thrill me as it has before. Not to say that it did not have its good moments (the marriage/sword fighting scene I particularly liked) . . . but that is all they were, just moments. Overall I felt very disengaged form the movie, constantly telling myself things will get better and I'll be able to ""get into it"" but it never happened. Many scenes seemed superfluous, boring, or just strange. The way they handled scenes and plot issues I found just . . . awkward. For instance Sparrow's hallucinations of himself and the rock-crab scene were just uninteresting and weird. A direction the movie just did not need to go. And Calypso's giantess to crab scene was also just as weird and awkward. Overall I found the movie just lacking in comparison to the other two; an upsetting end (or addition???)to the Pirates saga. (Maybe I expected too much?)"
"movie_freak_dubai","8","1","2","25 May 2007"," Gripping finale but we need more Jack Sparrow
","I thoroughly enjoyed Pirates 3 and it did not drag too much unlike the SPidey 3.<br/><br/>The movie is bigger than ever and all the characters introduced the first 2 movies make a reappearance in the third movie with a few welcome additions such as Chow Yun Fat.<br/><br/>Although most of the characters and their story arcs are given equal importance and taken to their proper conclusions i still feel that we did not see enough of Captain Jack Sparrow. Johnny Depp brings his own brand of movie magic to the screen whenever he appears as Captain Jack Sparrow and I personally feel that he could have had more scenes in this movie. Although the movie makers did try to repair this travesty by using his many clones in certain scenes.<br/><br/>All the other performances are good... Keira Knightley came to the fore in a more central role while Orlando Bloom was pushed slightly into the background which was a good thing in my opinion. Geoffrey also had a major role in this. I still feel that the Calypso/Davy Jones story arc was not really required. Wonderful little cameo from keith Richards the muse for the Sparrow characterisation.<br/><br/>All in all a satisfying sequel with a slightly surprising ending but well worth the price of admission.<br/><br/>I only have one complaint...bring back Captain Jack Sparrow/Johnny Depp for another movie without too many other characters to distract the audience from this amazing character."
"creepuzr-m","10","1","2","25 May 2007"," Probably the best of the trilogy
","OK I'm not good at reviews but I can say this movie is better than 2nd- some people may not agree with me that it beats the 1st. Firstly this movie is a lot darker,the opening scene is a hanging. The movies has a lot more deaths and is more graphic in that sense- there is many people getting impaled, a person being shot in the head, tentacles going in peoples mouths and out of there noses. Stuff like that. So yeah there's more deaths. Even a person breaking off there own frozen toe. But there is comedy in this movie as well. Jack halucinating can prove quite funny, numerous quotes from Jack and Barbossa, and some funny action sequence's. Now the CGI is the best I've seen and the end battle is brilliant. Not much more to say really. Cya."
"musica1","10","1","2","25 May 2007"," This is a Whole New Pirates of the Caribbean
","I just finished seeing Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End, and all I can say is ""Wow!"" This movie was so unexpected. I've seen both of the first two Pirates movies multiple times and own the DVD's. I love those movies. I went into AWE expecting more of the same kind of fun, but what I saw was a whole new Pirates universe. <br/><br/>The acting was great again by those you would expect: Johnny Depp, Bill Nighy, etc. But surprisingly Orlando Bloom showed real depth in this one compared to the other two (which seems strange since it was filmed along with Dead Man's Chest.) The visuals were great again, and the score moved the movie along at a nice pace. <br/><br/>But what is most surprising in this movie are the writing and directing. There were still lots of laughs, but this movie is deadly serious at its core, and very trippy-art-house in the way many scenes were written and executed. It wasn't the just sit back and enjoy the ride type of experience that the first two were. Instead, you actually need to pay attention and think in this one. And sometimes what you will think is that maybe you took some hallucinogens before entering the theatre, because this can't really be a Pirates of the Caribbean movie. But it is.<br/><br/>This is a great movie. But be warned that you are not going to see more of what you saw in the first two Pirates movies."

"blt0503","9","1","2","24 May 2007"," Fires on all canons!
","This movie delivers the knock out blow that will put it on top of the money making leaderboard. Johnny Depp absolutely mastered the role of the drunken Jack Sparrow, ironically with little rum! The plot followed in sequence and kept me interested through the entire 3 hours. Special effects and scenery were absolutely jaw dropping and left me wanting little. Knightly and Bloom finally developed into the lovers I thought they would become. Supporting cast filled the gaps that the first two movies were lacking in.<br/><br/>Anyone who does not see this movie in the theater will be committing a grave injustice to themselves. This was a great way to continue the story of the Pirates and left you with feeling of amazement, which is more than I can say for recent third movie attempts *cough*cough* Spidey."
"Constantine_Haghighi","10","1","2","24 May 2007"," The happiest I've been in...well, weeks.
","I would say that I felt better walking out of the theater after the end of ""At World's End"" than I have in a long, long time...but seeing as I saw ""Hot Fuzz"" (another cinema masterpiece) just a few weeks earlier, that would be a rather dubious claim.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, I feel obliged to report that this is a film which does not disappoint in the slightest. The story, far from being ""too convoluted"", offers up both new intrigue and satisfying resolution: there are a few muddled moments, but nothing which lingers long enough to create a problem. The action is spectacular (completely and wonderfully over the top at times), and all the actors (expectedly with Rush and Depp, surprisingly with Bloom and Knightley) put in superb performances. The best praise I can offer, however, is this: I'll see ""At World's End"" in theaters again, and gladly pay for the privilege."
"WBSlinger63","10","1","2","24 May 2007"," Excellent ending
","It's been a long-awaited finale, and an excellent one it is. The film boasts an excellent cast in some very new and exotic locations, not to mention a very very very thick plot that somehow manages to all be resolved.<br/><br/>I'm not going to explain the plot, not because it was confusing, but because for those who have not seen part two will most certainly have not a clue what the hell is going on and why. What I will say is that the conclusions are the most surprising, most tragic, and most satisfying of the series, not to mention that there may be a potential for a sequel. The performances were definitely top-notched this time around, especially for Kiera Knightley and Orlando Bloom, the main characters of the story. Their performances were great, and I actually realized their true purposes to the story.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp's performance was, as usual, fun to watch, especially with him acting far more stranger than before, what with hallucinations appearing and all. Tip of the hat to veteran actors Geoffrey Rush, Kevin McNally, and Bill Nighy, who all add such a persona to the film that one cannot resist being charmed. There are a lot more great performances as well, such as by Chow Yun-fat as Sao-Feng, but it'd be just too tough to list all of them.<br/><br/>I will always be awed by the combination of Nighy and ILM to create the unforgettable Captain Davy Jones. What they've created here is one of the finest CGI performances ever, topping even that of Serkis's Gollum. The character himself is just so sympathetic and so tragic that though he is a villain, one finds him to be in such a tough position in this movie. He hates being the puppet of Lord Cutler Beckett, played ruthlessly by Tom Hollander, and yet he has no choice, for his heart is in jeopardy (quite literally). There's more to his story as well, and it is such a deep and sad one. He takes souls, always asking if they fear death, and yet he himself fears death the most of everyone.<br/><br/>The visual effects of the film are gorgeous and spectacular to watch, with some of the greatest movie naval fight ever, complete with a massive whirlpool and ships combating with next to 30 guns, not to mention a violent typhoon and massive deck battles between British soldiers, pirates, and crustacean-encrusted sea creature-men. ILM's hard work pays through in this film, and not once did I find myself questioning the realism of the CGI, though obviously the stuff done here, such as the Black Pearl toppling towards the edge of the world, are impossible to realize physically.<br/><br/>Do you need to watch the previous films to appreciate this one? It would help to clarify some of the various plots in the film, but not necessary. The sheer entertainment value, the characters, the visuals, and the action, are more than enough to carry the film through its long running time. It feels long, but never boring and certainly never drawn out. There is a lot of fun in this film.<br/><br/>I pray that there isn't a fourth Pirates, tempting though it may be to desire it. This is a trilogy that deserves more than the fate of, oh, the ""Aliens"" saga, and to churn out a fourth would, I fear, lower the lasting quality of the films as a whole and just be an excuse for Disney to make more money. The characters' stories, I think, have also been told and are complete. Let's just say good-bye to Captain Jack, before he perhaps overstays his welcome, rum and all."
"directorstouch","10","1","2","24 May 2007"," Visually Astounding!
","OK, I'm going to ramble so hear me out.<br/><br/>First, I'm going to say that this movie is incredible. It had audience members gasping, clapping, shrieking out in surprise and laughing. Gore Verbinski has put himself up there with Peter Jackson and the other great epic directors.<br/><br/>Stylistically, the movie is probably the best of the three. the cinematography is excellent and there are some incredibly stunning visuals.<br/><br/>The humor is hysterical. Much more macabre than previous films, but it fits beautifully. <br/><br/>Geoffery Rush is utterly incredible. Humorous, likable, frightening and slightly insane all at the same time. The most classic of his lines is when he begins a wedding ceremony in the middle of a frantic battle aboard the Black Pearl. Utterly priceless.<br/><br/>OK, now the negatives. There are only a few so be patient.<br/><br/>The beginning tended to drag slightly and the middle was utterly befuddling in terms of the number of plot lines going on at the same time. Everybody betrays everybody else, each with their own motives and for a first viewing, can be very confusing. Everything is explained throughout the film, but in the middle of the film when everyone is making deals with everyone else, one can feel as if they're drowning in tentacles.<br/><br/>The layout of the script is very similar to Dead Man's Chest. A gruesome beginning, reintroduction of characters and then a humorous interlude (in DMC it was the Cannibal Island. In this, it's the hilarious and unusual land of the dead). Following that, we get into the real story.<br/><br/>There was a lot going on and there were a few elements that the writers obviously weren't sure how to dispatch cleanly so there are some rough edges here and there. But the story still flows really well and by the end there is little to dislike.<br/><br/>The characters are so human. They make mistakes, they make hard choices with strong consequences. The relationships between everyone is so real. Elizabeth's relationship with Will is shaky following the suspicions which arose at the end of DMC. Commodore Norrington is still fighting his internal battle. Do what's right, or do what benefits you. Jack is Jack, what can I say? He's the same old Jack we know and love.<br/><br/>Kieth Richard's cameo is delightful. Chow Yun Fat is well written, but I think they were able to do as much with him as they would have liked.<br/><br/>Overall, a fantastic story, amazing visual effects and a really entertaining cast. I walked out of the theatre grinning."

","This third installment of the rum-soaked Pirates of the Caribbean franchise that turned Johnny Depp into box office gold is pure bliss. The film perfectly wraps up loose ends and hanging story lines. Although, the film is abundant with many confusing moments (alot), it gives the viewer breaks, unlike the second installment, to sort things out in your mind. Jack Sparrows are all over, with great scenes including very trippy ones with multiple Jacks. The cast is just great as well. The length? Maybe long but it is well worth it- it leads up to a truly EPIC final battle and an amazing ending. (Stay tuned after the credits!) And the mass of story lines is just what makes you want to see it again and again, which I truly recommend."

"fotn777","10","1","2","27 May 2007"," Going Out With a Bang!
","Brilliant! Fantastic! Superb! Satisfying! Okay, I may sound completely like a biased fan but it is my own true personal opinion on Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End. My comment may contain spoilers (nothing major but little hints) so to those who haven't watched the movie, be warned. Savvy? Anyways, on to my actual comment. With lots of action-packed scenes and dreamy romantic moments complete with the wrapping of unique Pirates hilarity, this movie (though not as good as the first one) is better than I ever dreamed it would be. In my opinion, not many trilogies are successful (the only one probably being the Lord of the Rings) but Pirates deserves an applause. However, to fully enjoy the movie, it is essential that you know the plot and characters introduced in Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest. Otherwise, be prepared to be lost as sea as the movie can be complicated with plot twists and turns, all of which are the continuation of Pirates 2.<br/><br/>That aside, this movie is at the core what a final movie in a trilogy should be: the loose-end tie-er. Pacing of plot in the movie is very well done (not as densely packed as the second movie), leaving enough time and space for fantastic character development, especially Will, Elizabeth and Jack. However, do not be mistaken that it is slow-paced. With the canvas of an all out war, this movie is anything but slow-paced. In fact, it is the most action-packed of all three. The special effects are amazing. Fans of pirates who are in it for sword fights and swashbuckling action will not be disappointed.<br/><br/>But, as usual, the crowning glory of the film are the characters. William Turner has grown from the naive but noble youth to a pirate with a good soul and a streak of deviousness that gives his character a more well-rounded feel. In Pirates 2, we are given a taste of the imminent darkening in his character and an added maturity, so different from the Will Turner in Pirates 1. In this new movie however, both facades of his character will be reconciled with surprising results. Elizabeth Swann too has grown from a girl with naive fantastical thoughts of pirates to a woman of beauty, bravery and femininity, adding an elegance to the film. However, that is not to say her character has soften. On the contrary, she played an immensely important role in the movie, proving yet again that women are not meant to stay at home and deal with housework alone. Barbossa returns with his usual flair for evil (even though he is a protagonist) and special mention of James Norrington, who I think deserves a mention.<br/><br/>Then, last but most definitely not least, Captain Jack Sparrow himself. I was amazed with his character from the beginning but now, my awe of him just increased. Jack proves again that simply by being yourself, you can be outstanding. His mastery in manipulation and subtlety in controlling circumstance is seen throughout the show so watch for hints of it. His humorous lines and quirks remain intact, shining during the darker moments of the film. He cannot be upstaged by the other characters no matter what. And, it only reaffirms my belief that without Jack Sparrow, there can be no Pirates of the Caribbean.<br/><br/>Impeccable and flawless acting, all the actors have truly grown into their characters, bringing the characters to life. Here, I would like to make a special mention of Johnny Depp (Jack Sparrow). He has truly created (along with the writers) a character of fantastic depth, hilarity and complexity that has spawned fans all over the world. And, he has managed to present this depth with subtle actions that are unbelievably real. Orlando Bloom, Kiera Knightley, Geoffrey Rush and the other actors are no less superb and I applaud them.<br/><br/>Bottom line of this incredibly long review is: WATCH PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: AT WORLD'S END. If not, you will regret it. For those who have yet to watch it, I hope that you will enjoy it as much as I did."

","so this is my review of the finale of a great trilogy... me myself, it usually takes me a day or two to decide how much i like a film. but this one has to rank as one of my favorite movies ever, and one the greatest films made. of course there were a few things, but for the vast majority it was incredible.<br/><br/>i should think by the time most people read this they will have seen it,so i will try not to include spoilers, but there might be a hint of them.<br/><br/>first and foremost, johnny depp continues to shine as jack. who is definitely one of the most well done/played characters i've ever seen. i find it so funny that Disney thru a fit in the first one, look at what he's done for them now!. and he is every bit as good in this film if not the most fun/ of the three. the many jacks in the film were beyond hilarious and i can just imagine johnny loved to play them. and bringing in keith was perfect. i was VERY impressed with keith. he did a great job.<br/><br/>i thought elizabeth was the next strongest character in the film tied with barbossa. she was incredible! very impressed. barbossa will forever be the immortal pirate, as rush was impeccable at it. but swan definitely woo'd me with her great acting.<br/><br/>now i know a lot of the teeny-bopper girls will hate me but will did about the same as he always did. (at least for me) it was a bit better, but still will.... the ending was great in my opinion involving his portion of the plot.<br/><br/>chow did great but i was a little upset that they made it seem that his role was HUGe in the movie, when it wasn't. he did great, but tia dalma was a much stronger character, and in it much more. she did a great job as well, and the only thing i have towards her is a small( well not small, if you have seen the film) but very cheesy... ""end"" to her character. that was a little random. but she still did great.<br/><br/>all of the smaller bit parts were great. and definitely made a great addition to this film. and rigetti.. HOW CUTE!!! anyways, the story is not as complicated as everyone seems to think it is. if you sit back and relax the parts that need to come together will and the parts that don't... obviously don't matter. it was hilarious, and definitely the most romantic of the three films, which i loved, but by the same token, there was TONS more action, and in my opinion, it is the only three of the movie's that actually warrants a PG 13 rating. the special effects are incredible in one particular scene it's astounding. overall. i absolutely loved it. the first three minutes of the movie were completely unnecessary though. they could have done without it. and it's tragic anyways. like i said, a few small issues but completely a overwhelmingly beautiful movie.<br/><br/>ps though.... do not take your little one. like i said it warrants the PG 13 rating.. and i mean leave your kids at home where they can have good dreams instead.<br/><br/>9 out of 10, and WELL DESERVED"

"freeball1","10","2","7","3 August 2007"," you should all vote at least better than 7.3
","First of all AWE(rating 7.3) is never worse than DMC(rating 7.4). This film is much better than many other films being rated much higher. All those guys voting 1/10 should figure out if they have really seen the film or just don't like pirates movies and fans. In my opinion the storyline is great and all the actors fit in their role, such as Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow, Orlando Bloom as Will Turner, Keira Knightley as Elizabeth Swann and Geoffrey Rush as Captain Barbossa. Of course it was difficult to top the first film, but it isn't as bad as many think it is. Everybody does a great job and I hope for a fourth film including them ALL.<br/><br/>Greetings from Germany"
"HotPot","4","2","7","5 June 2007"," Excellent special effects, rubbish movie
","Not much to say other than that, really. It was FAR TOO LONG though: an hour before the end I was bored out of my brain, thinking it should finish soon but looked at my watch and realised there was loads more to go.<br/><br/>The first movie had a great story and script and I loved it. The second and third clearly had much too much money thrown at them in the hopes that special effects could distract from the lack of a plot. I don't know why studios think that more money makes a better film: often, less money makes filmmakers more inventive and imaginative, and almost always more money makes them completely the opposite as this film proves.<br/><br/>At least the first one was something fantastic happening in the context of something vaguely real-world. This movie just seemed to make up its own rules in order not to have to bother making sense in any vaguely real-world context.<br/><br/>As I've said the special effects were, as always, brilliant. All four of my points are for them. If you liked the original Pirates but were disappointed with the second, don't bother with this one. If you like a film with a story, don't bother with this one. If you don't care about plot and just want loads of special effects, you'll love this one!"

They made a tremendous first movie but afterwards they seemed so confused due to the box office stats, that the totally went over the edge and produced this trilogy (not because they had two great stories but to get people into attending two movies). As in matrix the story of the sequels is lousy. The whole movie lives from special effects - the script is of secondary importance. I hope that this will be the end of the franchise because otherwise they will have ruined the great ""Curse of the black Pearl"" totally.

"garry472","1","2","7","2 June 2007"," Ghastly!¨Depp is no Kinski
","Ghastly!¨ Utterly camp and a poor imitation of a movie.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp's attempt here at buying his way into the rank of classic actors such as Chaplin, Keaton (not Diane silly but Buster) and even Steven Seagal fails miserably in this monster.<br/><br/>The rubber masks were OK and the rubber chickens too, but this movie is empty of art. Named after a roller coaster ride (I actually rode this in California once) I found the ride more artistic although the soft wheels on that ride probably contained less rubber than the actors' costumes.<br/><br/>Efforts at quality were filled with Pathos. I cringed. I ached as I would ache for Jethro and Granny in the Beverly Hillbillies. I cannot believethat they are doing this or that! The surrealistic moment when Depp arrives on scene was pathetic and my heat skipped in pity for poor Johnny. Deep you might think. Actually quite silly and the camp cannot disguise the betrayal of principles here by Johnny. Depp is no Kinski and no amount of over acting can remedy this. The efforts by the director to match Herzog (yes there is a midget and chicken in the movie) merely reflected his inadequacy although I will credit him for stealing from Herzog-what with the ship being crabbed over a hill. Fitzcaraldo be damned--We need the dough and all is allowed come blockbuster time and most of the goofs who will watch and pay for this one probably never saw that artsy movie anyway!¨(Hey, I didn't say that, the guys who made Pirates did or likely did while truth abounded in their cups).<br/><br/>I really did hurt for Johnny. Poor lad. He is probably a very nice boy; but alas one who sold his soul on this one for filthy money and no amount of grimacing or back shots hopping a la Chaplin will save this man from a well deserved commercial success. A true Macdonald Artist. A big Depp with lots and lots of cheese."
"Michael_Elliott","Null","2","8","23 May 2011"," Really....Three Hours???
","Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End (2007) <br/><br/>** (out of 4) <br/><br/>The third film in the (then) trilogy has Turner, Swann and Captain Barbossa (Orlando Bloom, Keira Knightly, Geoffrey Rush) going to Singapore to steal a ship and crew but are captured and forced to make a deal with Captain Sao Feng (Chow-Yun Fat). The new crew must then rescue Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) from the ""Land of the Dead"" where we then get nearly three-hours of double crossings in order to get the goddess Calypso released. As I made my way through this original trilogy it became quite clear after the first movie that I certainly wasn't seeing what so many others were. I must admit that I'm rather shocked either of the sequels made any money because it's typically hard to get people's attention for such a long period of time and after the previous 151-minute running time the producers decided to go even further and making this third entry just ten-minutes shy of three hours. If you read my thoughts on the first two movies then this here is going to come off as a broken record but for the life of me I can't see why a ""B"" movie has to clock in at such a running time. I had heard many negative things about this third film but I really found myself enjoying the first hour. I thought all of the characters made a grand entrance and I thought there were some terrific visuals including a rather breath-taking sequence in the ice. Then, sadly, the film decided to throw one plot device after another until the point where the film just comes to a crashing halt and then things are made worse because you realize that you've still got 90-minutes to go. Needless to say I put the full blame of this film on the filmmakers for trying to be so ""epic"" but failing to remember that it's also important to keep your viewers entertained. I thought the dialogue was all poorly written, the story was all over the map and whenever something interesting would happen the movie would then just take off in another direction. As usual, the performance by Depp is the main reason to watch this thing as he clearly has this role down and could probably play it in his sleep. He's certainly lively enough to help keep the movie going but even a master such as himself can't overcome the various flaws. Bloom once again sleepwalks through his part and Knightly appears bored with the material as well. Rush comes out good once again as does Chow-Yun Fat in his part. Keith Richards makes an appearance and his cameo is certainly one of the highlights in the film but at the same time this too is rather disappointing because it's clear that he and Depp are not doing the scene together but instead editing is being used to cover that up. I'm sure fans of the series will find something more entertaining than I did but for me this entire series has been full of ups and downs. There's no question that there's enough material for a good movie but the producers and filmmakers went overboard and in the end none of the films are worth revisiting."

","I have read the novelization of this movie, and unfortunately, I was not satisfied with the ending. I feel that the movie is left wide open for a fourth, and I felt incomplete reading the book. Unfortunately, I also remained full of questions after reading the novelization, and whether it be my lack of knowledge about details or simply bad hits on the part of the movie, I fear that that movie goers and fans alike will be disappointed with the way this movie turned out. Otherwise, I'm excited to see the actual acting, which I hope will compensate for lack of taste on the screen writing.

","Overly long and filled with confusing story beats, character twists and mythology, At World's End closes the Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy with a whimper.<br/><br/>The movie constantly has its characters make weird and unclear decisions and has a muddling plot that seems to take forever to get to the commendable final battle.

The maelstrom at the end of the movie was the most brilliant battle I have ever seen combined with the soundtrack. Please people, do not make the mistake of taking seriously what the others say. This movie is worth watching, you don't lose anything, except maybe the fact that you will miss the most epic ending of the story (for me this is the real ending of Pirates of the Caribbean until now). Trust me. Yes the plot line is complicated a bit but not completely not understandable like other's say.

"elshikh4","2","1","3","16 May 2011"," ""Close your eyes and pretend it's all a bad dream. That's how I get by !""
","According to Gore Verbinski, the Pirates' trilogy director, Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (2003) was a character-driven film and Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest (2006) was a plot-driven film, so to make the whole saga work, he wanted to make Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End (2007) a combination of both plot and character. Well, Mr. Verbinski, I think that you'll going to be burn in hell for your huge HUGE lies!<br/><br/>The plan was to mix the Hollywood blockbuster action with a fantasy epic, but the outcome was billionaires' nonsense. It is a catalogue of incredibly awful script done by a sum of money that could repair an economy of a small nation!<br/><br/>It's too dense, with too much sophisticated sets, costumes, and CGI. It has countless events, dialogues, and characters. Speaking about characters; why all of these teams of pirates?, Jack's father?? AND ALL OF THESE JACKS??? It was like ""loved Jack?, so take many of it, all the load you can get!"". Simply, that was for filling the time of the second in the worst 2 sequels that wanted desperately to turn the first stand-alone (Pirates) into a trilogy anyway, at all costs, most probably to imitate the mightily successful Lord of The Rings of the same decade.<br/><br/>The unbelievable events are endless. Excuse me for forgetting some, because the movie did make me dizzy, and for days after it. I recall that the transforming of the black augur into Godzilla was farcical, like these writers got nothing to do. The moment of the Asian pirate giving away his ship to Elizabeth while his dying can't be more imbecile to write. Why he did that? (rather why his character is made in the first place?!). The plot is about killing someone who's already DEAD (the shoddy issue of Pirates 2 continues!). It's hard to believe that Jack has a female lover. And the end, in which Jack thinks of another treasure, is painful; since they actually aspire after a FOURTH ONE!<br/><br/>The dialogue was unstoppable windbag. While having nothing remotely funny, it tried its best to sound so wise, ending up as idiotically wise. Just read this: ""Barbossa: The world used to be a bigger place / Jack: World is still the same. There's just less in it""???!!! It was too serious in the wrong place. Originally, taking the nonsense seriously is bad. Here's a rule that sums up the movie utterly!<br/><br/>Notice when it, out of the blue, goes to criticize politics, negotiations, and stuff (WHYYYYYY?!!!). That uncovers clearly the way this movie was made: the writers allege something that looks considerable, while it's baloney, then the director strains himself to picture it, mostly wearily, by super wild budget and never-ending money. It could be the highest provocative foolishness I have ever experienced cinematically. Because the brainless costly jam that they all made; lacked anything suspenseful, produced a deadly bore, and gave the feel of a surreal titanic that immerses slowly!<br/><br/>So, it's more boring than the Bold and The Beautiful, more ridiculous than Tom Green, and more heavy than the whole 3 prequels of Star Wars (and I thought that George Lucas is the only billionaire who makes movies for himself!). In brief, annoying wasn't more expensively portrayed like this before. By the way, this is ""The most expensive film ever made, not adjusted for inflation, where the budget ran at $300,000,000"", and ""Filming started without a finished script""; connect between the 2 pieces of info, and you might get the picture of the contemporary Hollywood!<br/><br/>Nevertheless, I liked things from it: The first sequence. The visually dazzling daydream of Jack; concerning rescuing his ship by cooperating crabs. The ship when it overturned to another sea; now that's a fantasy. Some of the climax's action; however it was like a lonely island, solid and rational, in an ocean of hallucination; being the best climax for a big action fantasy that I haven't seen. Moreover, the presence of this movie, as it is, in reality, to be easily memorable example for a familiar tragedy nowadays: zero as a script + 8 zeros on the right of one number as a budget for that script!<br/><br/>I can't hold it; these lines, from the movie itself, fit perfectly as wicked comments about it: ""You add an agreeable sense of the macabre to any delirium"", ""NOBODY MOVE. I've dropped me brain"", ""Once was quite enough"", ""Why would he do that? Because he's a lummox!"", and the most expressive one about my condition during the viewing: ""Close your eyes and pretend it's all a bad dream. That's how I get by"". Believe me, that's how I get by the majority of the American blockbusters lately!<br/><br/>This is made by lummox people, with impudence and millions to spend. It's none other than nonsense epic, too long, too crowded, and too soulless to be entertaining. It's exactly like Davy Jones; rich, ugly, and dead, yet alive noisily and evilly!<br/><br/>The producers get their millions back. And millions of us get punk'd. It's the game now, where their aspiration equals our exasperation."
"eric262003","9","1","3","14 April 2009"," The Best of the Series So Far
","Two years ago when the third ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" came out, I was expecting the continuation of where it left off with the same style we have become adjusted to. Boy was I wrong and for good reasons too. ""Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End"" goes beyond what a expected from a three parter movie as the series seems to get better as it ages, like a fine wine. <br/><br/>As the story continues, Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush)along with Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley)and company attempt to rescue Capatin Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) who's held captive in Davy Jones(Bill Nighy) Locker. While this is happening, the evil Lord Cutler Beckett is going out of his way eradicating one pirate after another bringing them down on the brink of extinction. Cutler who's in possession of Davy Jones' heart, has employed the Flying Dutchman to annihilate the surviving pirates in the area which brings the pirates to band together to take down Cutler and Jones for a grueling battle in which fate is in the hands between the characters.<br/><br/>What's original from the other two ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" movies is that is that the campy humor is replaced by a more darker setting. Even the visuals are replaced with a dramatic feel and a complex story to it.<br/><br/>The format of the the story in ""At World's End"" is more like a real tale told in contrast to its predecessors being that it isn't about ghouls and treasures, but rather standing united to take down what could possibly of a threat of being diminished by a greater evil. It also teaches the valuable lessons in unity and how we should behave as a group when dire consequences comes into play. People may not like this new adjustment in favor of mindless pirate adventure fun, but to me I liked the new realistic approach to the series as it provides a refreshing feel to the story, where the life of a pirate isn't all fun and games. Some of the characters from the previous installment become darker in personality gives you a feeling that unpredictable notion as to who will live and who will die. <br/><br/>The direction was a joy to watch, even though the movie is 2 hours and 45 minutes, never once is it ever boring. I'm glad there was little editing done and was never once shortened just to satisfy those people who have short attention spans. It's the end of the series, so it would naturally be long. So I give a hats off to Gore Verbinski for creating a masterpiece. <br/><br/>The camera work was extremely skillful as every pivotal scene is captured in all its beauty, especially the waterfront scene. The desert scene with Captain Sparrow was kind of creepy but effective. Even the music heard in the background is enough to give you goosebumps. <br/><br/>The acting was breath-taking especially Johnny Depp who's flamboyant nature as Captain Jack Sparrow is one of the the many elements that have remained untouched. But the other performers turned in amazing performances. Geoffrey Rush is still scene stealing as Capatain Hektor Barbossa. And Tom Hollander has more screen time as the evil pirate slayer Lord Cutler Beckett. <br/><br/>Composer Hans Zimmer jumps a few hurdles here by composing a score that will keep you mesmerized and never falls in the category as boring or cheesy. And by adding new themes is also a valuable asset as well. The score makes everything just come alive here. <br/><br/>To summarize, this movie exceeds the other two by lowering the CGI's and the cheap laughter that a plethora of other summer blockbusters possess. The dark content and the complex story is plausible. And the scenes featured here can be very creepy and isolated at times. Though not set to please everyone, the changes borough to this movie is pure magic,in every possible way, from the cinematography to the acting to the remarkable score. This one will leave you with a satisfying aftertaste."

","This movie has problems, but because ""something is always happening"" and almost every segment is visually stunning, it's one of the rare times that I can say the movie is both a mess and kind of amazing.<br/><br/>This movie is the third in the series of ""Pirates"" movies and it's the type of sequel that relies heavily on information gained from the previous movies. In this final installment, there are two tasks that the ""sort of"" good guys must tackle: rescue the pirate Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) from ""Davy Jones Locker"" and fight the powerful British East India Trading Company (who are controlling the seas and forcing the Pirates out).<br/><br/>I wish I had understood the above basic elements of the plot while actually watching the movie. It was really hard to understand what was going on and ""why"". I saw the previous two movies, but couldn't remember all the intricacies of what happened - nor remember the names of so many people and things that were referenced in this movie.<br/><br/>However, like a ride at Disneyland, you can have a good time even if you don't quite get the background context. While much of the plot was confusing, the numerous little sub-plots were a little easier to understand - and a lot of fun to watch. There was never a still moment in the movie and many of the scenes were visually spectacular.<br/><br/>If you're a big fan of the previous movies with a strong memory - you'll definitely get more out of it than the rest of us. For everyone else, don't try too hard to understand the ""big picture"" -- just sit back and enjoy the ride."

The second time I saw it on DVD I focused on it a lot more and pretty much understood it completely. So if you saw it once and didn't like it, watch it again and I can guarantee you will warm to it.<br/><br/>Amazing performances from Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom and Kiera Knightly. Of course also all the other parts too, it would just take to long to list all the names.<br/><br/>This film is ten times more confusing one of the most confusing lines being ""You have to be lost to find a place that can't be found"", but once you understand it you realise it's a very well thought out plot. It's also ten times funnier, the main funny bits coming from Jack the monkey.<br/><br/>During the fight scenes and the war scenes, it really feels like you're there.

The movies starts out really boring in the underworld trying to make it humorous with Jack Sparrow being confused in a desert with some stones turning into crabs, but it is never funny at all.. Then in several parts of the film, copies of Jack Sparrow turns up and the way Jack interacts with these clones is supposed to be funny, but it isn't.<br/><br/>It just felt like they wanted this trilogy to end but couldn't come up with a good story, so they just stuffed the boring almost 3 hours with sword fighting, a heap of confusing facts and a lot of weirdness with Jack Sparrow, that isn't funny but very prolonged and boring instead.<br/><br/>A forced choking love scene is added to the end, that didn't feel natural. So they wanted to make a legend out of this love story, but really, we wanted Jack Sparrow to get the lady and it felt forced. The Bloom character is just too fruity. We didn't even care about those two characters anymore. I am glad this is over.

"Blake Jarred","Null","1","3","14 July 2007"," Yo-Ho Yo-Ho, The Pirate's Life I Flee
","I think this was probably bound to fail. Like ""Dead Man's Chest,"" it doesn't stray far from the first film in terms of execution. It must have to do with the inevitable dissolution of the initially thin concept, sabotaged also by the upheld conventions of movie trilogies that (1) new characters must be introduced late and be piled on thick, and (2) the action must be louder and more calamitous than ever.<br/><br/>These apparent laws of the Epic Trilogy were, I think, founded with Tolkien and ""The Lord of the Rings"" although he was against the publisher's dividing the story into three portions. The arc in the last book -- of an escalating scale and shifting focus from the personal to the universal -- spilled over into Peter Jackson's film adaptations, which turned out OK because Jackson's work was derived directly from the founder of this accidental arc that yet managed to retain strong character and theme.<br/><br/>But the same structure applied to other ventures in filmdom has failed infamously, a particularly glaring example being the third ""Matrix"" movie. And this one's only slightly less of a disaster because the franchise's cosmology somehow continues to yield a few final touches of genuine cleverness, along with some genuinely engaging spectacle. Examples: the conceit of multiple Jack Sparrows in that Davey Jones' locker thing is a nice tip of the hat to Depp's ability as an actor to project multiple ideas of himself -- as an actor and as the character he's playing -- simultaneously. The upside-down horizon sequence where the ship keels over is another splendid touch. The final ship battle in the maelstrom registers a correctly operatic tone without capsizing all coherence (the score helps), and more impressive in its bombast is the final destruction of the Lord Cuttler character and his vessel.<br/><br/>So, at least there's nothing here that's as downright dull as the Wachowski brothers' subterranean Zion, yet none of it's as much fun as the Looney Tunes-ish water wheel scene in the previous film. And where this picture fails it plummets. It is just way, way too long. Yes, even by its predecessors' standards. The confusing double-crosses and hidden agendas of the characters, while intentionally contrived so that we might feel compelled to sit through these movies again and hope to make more sense of it all, do not hold up to the irrefutable fact that the characters and episodes are too dull for a future investiture of one's time to be considered. Yo-ho-ho, and for the love of giant sea goddesses, just bottle it up already!<br/><br/>Blake's rating: 2 (out of 4)"

Overall I think that the movie is really funny and while being just a little bit worse then the first one it is a bit better the Number 2 so I rate it 93%."

","I admit some will hang me for liking Dead man chest but the kraken was the best. well anyway the cinematography, acting, and the amazing direction by Gore Verbinski were superb, but the duration of the film, almost 3 hours make me wanna say please some action must happen. I feel that the Jack Sparrow mania was getting flaw since the 2 hour of the movie and Davy Jones will be even bigger than Jack Sparrow. To finish the end was something I want since the first of the movies and the Fight between Jack Sparrow and Davy Jones was too short and not the epic battle I want between the two, and one last thing Tia dalma final scene was to my point of seeing a way of getting rid of her."
"jaywolfenstien","Null","1","3","25 June 2007"," Exhilarating in the key of excess
","Early in Pirates part 3, there's a breathtaking moment of visual genius. To escape Davy Jones' locker, the crew must turn the Black Pearl upside before dusk (where's the Poseidon Adventure tidal wave when you need it?) Jack Sparrow leads the crew back and forth from side to side, rocking the ship  Barbossa orders the cargo and cannons cut so they'll roll around in the lower decks adding momentum. Back and forth the ship rocks until finally it turns over, flipping completely upside down with masts and sails miraculously intact. Dusk comes, and voilà! Freedom! <br/><br/>The sequence is absurd on so many levels that it's futile to begin discrediting it; however, Pirates 3 embraces this silliness with such energy, and such enthusiasm, that I cheered when the ceiling of water came crashing down, and the Black Pearl triumphantly emerged from the depths of the sea into the real world again. Screw realism. This is why I come to the movies  to see visually spectacular events that cannot possibly happen, actually happening. I repeat, ""screw realism."" Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End fully embraces what it is  a movie inspired by a Disney World ride.<br/><br/>As much as I would love to write so enthusiastically of the later sequences  the epic mid-sword fight marriage ceremony, for instance, which was conceived and choreographed with a spirit of gleeful excitement that threw believability to the wind (critics be damned). Quite frankly, by that point my suspension of disbelief felt like it ran two consecutive marathons, and wanted to take a nap before continuing.<br/><br/>There's excess. There's overkill. There's excessive overkill. And then there's At World's End.<br/><br/>The aforementioned marriage-sword fight takes place after releasing the Goddess Calypso, which turns into a giant wave of crabs, which unleashes a violent maelstrom, which entwines the Black Pearl and Dutchman into a canon battle, pirates swing from one ship to another to engage in mêlée, and somewhere around here Jack does a perpetual Tarzan rope swing while battling Davy Jones and whoever else happens to be caught in a perpetual swing  don't even get me started on the plot and character motivations of who betrayed who, when, where, and why.<br/><br/>It's not that the plot and character motivations are particularly hard to follow, rather it's just mildly annoying when a new deception and/or revelation emerges every time someone opens their mouth. And, actually, Pirates 3 has a great scene that accurately describes itself  Jack shows up to steal the heart of Davy Jones, and discovers two sailors with canons guarding it. Instead of blasting Sparrow, they proceed to get into a bickering contest with each other while Jack observes their fruitless discussion for a moment before he takes what he came for and waltzes off with it. I wish I could pick up the heart of this playful movie and tiptoe away with it while it continues to bicker about the 3 billionth broken alliance.<br/><br/>As the running time counted on, the excess slowly drained the power, the spectacle, the comedy, and the fun to the point that I can imagine myself enjoying Pirates 3 as one of those weekly serials where a small chunk is presented isolated from the rest of the movie. I can imagine myself enjoying each of those independent sections on their own, presented at their own leisurely pace, more so than the combined compressed whole where everything comes rushing like an out of control train. When Davy Jones stabs Will through the heart, I should gasp in horror, not mutter under my breath, ""welcome to the club, kid."" <br/><br/>Of course, Depp, Rush, and Nighy return to their iconic roles, and with great delight I watched Barbossa and Sparrow square off for control of the Black Pearl, the actors clearly having a blast with their characters. And Nighy proving once again he can emote with amazing control and range through pounds of makeup, from a tender scene with his beloved to an over the top conquest of claiming another soul from the sea.<br/><br/>In the end, I can't really point to any one element or sequence and genuinely say, ""I did not like that"" (okay, maybe the bloated plot.) Pirates 3 is littered with lots of great moments, lots of great ideas, and lots of bad ass visuals realized. There is a childlike wonder to Pirates 3 as though Gore Verbinski unleashed his whole crew into a candy store and said, ""Go play. It's on me."" Which, needless to say, is not an easy feat on such a large production, and deserves due credit.<br/><br/>I think part of my problem is that around the 45 minute mark I started seriously studying the film in search of a kitchen sink  surely that's buried in an effects shot somewhere."
"johnreyno9876","4","1","3","23 June 2007"," Plot just too loose
","I guess I like some sort of logic to a plot, and the threads here were not only tangled and numerous, but somewhat tenuous too. Pull too hard (i.e. actually think about what you are seeing) and the whole thing unravels to about halfway. I have just come out of seeing the whole film (so long that the cinema gave everyone a 10 minute 'health break' at a completely arbitrary point approximately halfway through - the screen just went black!) so what follows are fresh impressions ..<br/><br/>Somewhat surreal .. and that can be fine, but here it was surreal just for the sake of being surreal. For example, rocks/crabs that turn into a makeshift crab-conveyor belt for Cap'n Jack's ship .. OK, but how exactly do these fit in? Or the Cap'n Jack doppelgangers?<br/><br/>The whole 'pirates are good' 'pirates are free' thing grated after a while. That Shipwreck cove for the pirates 'convention' looked like a giant Xmas tree, and then like some giant Elven forest tree decked out with lights .. all too nice and civilised.<br/><br/>And on that sort of point, the 'English are bad' 'English are evil' thing also started to grate. And how on earth did the East India Company muster up an armada of hundreds of ships?<br/><br/>Also just odd in my view is how Davy Jones is so under the thumb of Lord Becket (?) The best Davy Jones (yes DAVY JONES) can do now is knock a tea cup out of Will Turner's hand. Yes, I know Becket has his heart and all that, but the fact that DJ has been rendered impotent really does not sit well with his being the tyrant overlord of souls condemned to the locker.<br/><br/>I had hoped for more from Calypso .. I was waiting for a large sea-serpenty Calypso to emerge from the vortex of the whirlpool but my wait was in vain<br/><br/>The problem is that these gripes just mount up and undermine the cohesion of the film .. there just is no good solid story here. It is like sitting down for dinner and being served various kinds of desserts one after another, at least from after half ways through the movie, and up to that point there were only appetisers.<br/><br/>The special effects were fine but I wouldn't see the movie for the special effects (I remember fish people, a short clip of a giant Calypso, and ships duelling it out in a giant whirl pool)<br/><br/>Johnny Depp was pretty good, though had less to work with than in the previous films I thought. Keira K is always nice to watch, but again a caveat .. the film tended towards Politically Correct girls-lead-boys girls-trash-boys stuff towards the end.<br/><br/>Ah well. Somewhat disappointed, having seen the previous two."

","The authors tried to make a fantastic and absorbing mythology in the world of pirates, but they failed. It is dull and not breathtaking. All the characters have their own strange aims, which are hardly to comprehend. The only one scene, which is really amazing. This is when the admiral is walking across the ship, under the siege. Everything around him is burning and exploding in slow-motion! Other scenes are boring. the film shows the soulless of most Hollywood movies. No patriotism, no justice, no God. Jack Sparrow is no longer funny and looks like homosexualist and mentally ill person. Everything turns around some mystic idea, which is not yet clare enough to understand it. Some shooting looks alright, but still this movie doesn't have the main thing."

","You've seen it all before! <br/><br/>Same costumes, characters, scenery, dialog, etc., no new ground broken here, except to try one's patience while waiting for something interesting to happen. I've heard that this will be the final installment of 'Pirates'. Thank goodness! The first installment was great, second was fair at best, this last one was almost unbearable to watch due primarily to it's length, but also because of it's story line and screen play. The first hour had about 10 minutes that I found interesting, the rest of it had me glancing at my watch to see how much longer I had to endure it. It runs for almost 2 1/2 hours and is just too damn long! <br/><br/>Kiera Knightly's character is so well scrubbed throughout the film that she looks out of place against the griminess of all the other characters. Her teeth twinkle with every close up shot, as do Orlando Bloom's.....their characters must have both gone to the same dentist that all the other characters in this film couldn't afford. There are 'Pirates stock characters' like the guy with one eye and his shorter fat friend. These two have a somewhat expanded role of popping up every now and then to do a watered down Abbott and Costello-like pirate flavored routine. ""Hello Poppet""...I saw it already! There are other characters like these two that one will recognize that also have expanded roles...the tongueless guy with the talking parrot, the cute monkey, the two arguing soldiers, etc., etc., when I saw any of them I thought ""hey there they are again....so?..."" As we have all probably heard by now, they manage to squeeze in a couple of scenes with Keith Richards from the Rolling Stones. I think he showed up in his normal attire....no make up or wardrobe needed here. They even have him strumming a few chords on a guitar at the big Pirate meeting....I think I recognized it as ""Little T & A"" but I could be wrong. I enjoyed watching most of the main actors...Depp, Rush, even Chow Yun Fat, and a few others. They are so good at their craft and true to their characters that their performances become part of the few saving graces of this film. When you consider the exorbitant cost of admission, I must say that I can't recommend seeing this in the theater. <br/><br/>The last 20 minutes or so were the most entertaining and I would suggest going to the theater to see something else then afterward sneaking in to see the last half hour of this bore-fest."
"mfisher452","6","1","3","18 June 2007"," Shiver me timbers! Too long and too complicated, me buckos
","Break out your books of hoary sea phrases, laddies and lassies, it's ""At World's End,"" the third and (we hope) final installment of ""Pirates of the Caribbean."" Me 11-year-old daughter did think that this movie was ""awesome,"" me buckos, but even she thought it was too long, just shy of three hours, and both of us had trouble following the plot. After about half an hour, I lost track of the dizzying succession of moves and countermoves, plots and counterplots, crosses and double-crosses. And it turns out that there was a post-credits scene that we missed, so ready were we to get out of there after the film ended. Unfortunately, constructing a comprehensible plot line seems to have been a lower priority---and got less of the budget---than the costumes, sets, special effects, and score, all of which seemed intended to assault the senses. I was disappointed to see that for all the effort at creating ""realistic"" visuals, the movie starts out with an anachronism: It opens in a Chinese bath house in Singapore, and soon after, British soldiers in the employ of the East India Company attack. Now, everything about the ""Pirates"" films---the clothing styles, the ships, the technology, the historical references---places them squarely in the much-romanticized Golden Age of Piracy. But owing to a major crackdown by Britain and the other European powers, this period was pretty much over by the 1720s. The British colony of Singapore would not be established by the British East India Company for another century (1819). Before that, it was an undistinguished fishing village inhabited by native Malays, not by the Chinese, who came in after the British.<br/><br/>But no matter: ""At World's End"" fairly drips (and I mean drips) with atmosphere, me hearties. There are more than enough pirate ships, creaking decks, steam-filled bath houses, stormy seas, long hair, shaven heads, leather, bad teeth, sweat, scarred, craggy faces, false eyeballs, powdered wigs, scimitars and sabers, whizzing cannon and pistol balls, splintering wood, fantastic monsters, and heathen spirits to go around. Great sea battles are fought in which ships are blown up with such frequency and regularity that you wonder that anything is left afloat, yet the characters hardly seem to notice. You can tell when the big action scenes are beginning, because when they do, it always starts to rain.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp's semi-dandified portrayal of Jack Sparrow, and his faux British accent, are definitely wearing thin. Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom, by playing it straight, are much more enjoyable. But to have their characters marry each other in the middle of an all-out sea battle (in the rain, of course) stretches credulity way past the snapping point. Yo ho ho, lots of exasperated scoffing from the audience we were among here, cap'n. Geoffrey Rush is essentially doing a modified Long John Silver impersonation as Captain Barbossa. Keith Richards plays Captain Teague, Jack Sparrow's father and the keeper of the Pirates' Code for the Brethren Court. It is shocking to see his old, lined, craggy face; he has a ""smoker's face"" and a ""smoker's voice."" I have always figured that it would not be the drugs of his youth that would kill him, but rather his tobacco abuse. Chow Yun-Fat, who despite his history of acting in extremely violent films is a very likable actor, mugs so outrageously for the camera in his role as Sao Feng that it reminded me of James Finlayson in the old Laurel and Hardy movies. And half a century of BBC costume dramas notwithstanding, nobody really sounded like that, mateys; the familiar ""standard"" British accent, with its dropped R's and its forward-shifted vowels, did not gain any general currency in Britain until the 19th century; before that, it was actually considered vulgar.<br/><br/>This film definitely looks and sounds impressive on the big screen, but if you wait till it comes out on video, you'll be able to take breaks when it all gets to be too much, and you'll also be able to run it back and watch parts again when you are trying to figure out what on earth is going on. (Maybe they planned it that way.) What really depresses me is that for most of the prodigiously ignorant American children of the past few generations, this is as close as they will ever get to Robert Louis Stevenson, Herman Melville, or Daniel Defoe."

","I'll give it to you straight: I have just walked out of this movie. I don't think I have ever done that and I am not proud of having done it now. As a film lover this really pains me.<br/><br/>I should take the time to affirm that I absolutely loved the first movie (8 stars, going on 9): it was fast, witty and altogether surprising - I am a fan of Johnny Depp but on that movie he especially awesome. Though there is no love like the first one I thought the second was pretty good too (7 stars), with a few really hilarious parts of its own.<br/><br/>I kinda knew this one would probably not live up to the others and, boy, was I right. From the very start, there's too much stuff going on that is neither funny nor exciting. The script is all over the place, you don't ""get"" where the characters' allegiances are or what they are trying to achieve: people keep floating between the action theaters with no rhythm or rime. The parts where Jack Sparrow talks to himself just don't work and, for all his craftsmanship, Johnny can't save his character from being just annoying on these sequences. In fact, none of the characters are really likable and I certainly felt no empathy with any of them which is a first. The combat sequences were dull throughout and, though I'm sure the last one would probably be an eye opener, I just couldn't endure any more boredom so after 2 hours and 10 minutes I left.<br/><br/>To my dismay, this really was one of the most disappointing films I have seen in a long time. For what it's worth, my suggestion is to wait for rental to watch it: I don't give it less starts solely because it would then be dangerously close to Catwoman... and not even this film deserves that."
"biancomano","7","1","3","17 June 2007"," A decent ending---leave it that way!
","A very good trilogy, good family entertainment. Regrettably, tho, the third installment is not up to the first two. That's possibly because the writers attempt to squeeze too much into the finale. The complex intertwining of plots in this concluding part makes the story hard to follow; the viewer has to work. The sub-plots carry some degree of contradiction to earlier established/implied story lines. Other sub-plots go beyond the movie's (until now) acceptable ""over the top"" style, creates a performance that will leave some viewers ""jaded."" Still, as a package, ""Pirates"" is one of the best performances of the decade. The writers, I feel, would do well to leave it that way. I understand a fourth installment is being discussed. I believe that would be a mistake."

","I went to see Pirates 3 the day after it opened and to be honest it was a huge letdown.<br/><br/>The plot was over crowded and messy. There were reports that it had not been completed by the time shooting had started and it showed.<br/><br/>I don't mind and ensemble cast but this movie will be used as an example in later years to prove why less is more.<br/><br/>There was just to much going on.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp was as consistent as ever as Jack Sparrow, and that is nota compliment. Yes he nailed his performance as Jack yet again, but one character does not make a movie. I did not like all the Jacks when he was hallucinating through out the movie it didn't work and it looked as though the writers had a bad day and thought ""I know lets just add a few more Jacks for comic relief to hide the fact that we don't know where the plot is going yet!"" <br/><br/>Orlando Bloom hardly had any screen time, not that I am complaining. He sailed off into the Sunset in Davey Jones ship and hopefully will stay out to sea collecting souls for ten years<br/><br/>Keira Knightly got even more screen time in Pirates3 and has gone full circle from damsel in distress to ass kicking Pirate leader which is a good thing <br/><br/>Captain Norrington the most fleshed out character went from being a major player in the Pirates 2 to having a bit part in Pirates 3 and to add injury to the insult he was killed of in a quick sword fight by a character he had never met before for no particular reason.<br/><br/>Bootstrap Bill went insane and killed Norrington for no reason then sailed off with Will. No actual real point of this character <br/><br/>We had more of the comedy pirates and more of the comedy British soldiers to add even more comedy to an already unfunny film. Don't get me wrong - some of the comedy worked and only some of it. The movie was in danger of being to expensive and full of its own smugness for its own good<br/><br/>Barbossa was back and we can all be thankful for that. Geoffrey Rush stole the show and was clearly enjoying himself all throughout the movie.<br/><br/>The Black Pearl crew were all back and had a few fun moments.<br/><br/>The meeting of the Pirate Lords was interesting and was a fun idea. The Keith Richards cameo added to the films self importance. He served no purpose and was just a pat on the film makers back. He added nothing in the long run to the film apart from a few pre-release headlines.<br/><br/>The action was very good though - especially the action at sea and the battles on the ships. It was exciting to see all the Pirate ships line up against all the British Soldiers. I did not like the super size Tia Dalma/ Calypso it looked bad and served no purpose in the end as she jumped into the sea in a huff never to be seen or spoken of again - so much for hell hath no fury like a woman scorned.<br/><br/>Pirates1 was a fantastic film and still is and Johnny Depp thoroughly deserved his Oscar nomination for trying something a bit different, but Pirates of the Caribbean did not ask for a sequel nor to be made into a trilogy. Films are sometimes better left alone and not turned into a trilogy just for the sake of it.<br/><br/>The Pirates trilogy is just a money making machine and clearly ran out of ideas and steam at the end of the 2nd one. Of course there will be people who will defend this movie to the death, but honestly enough is enough. Pirates3 ended with a hint of a 4th and judging by the amount of money this one has made it is a possibility.<br/><br/>I give this movie 4 out of 10. A point for the action, a point for Barbossa, a point for the score which was again very good, and a point for me - for actually sitting through the whole 2hour plus saga.<br/><br/>Don't rent then movie - you wont watch it until the end.<br/><br/>The Pirates of the Caribbean franchise has now officially drowned in its own hype."

","In my opinion this movie was a perfect end to the POTC series. But I guess Johnny Depp will still keep making these movies (even though Keira Knightly and Orlando Bloom have said that they won't do any more POTC movies) because he truly loves his character. The movie ended so that it is easy to start doing an other movie where Jack and Barbossa competes about the fountain of youngness (or something, sorry I don't remember how the real name went.. ). So are you waiting for that movie..? Personally I'm not really waiting for it, because I think that it can spoil the whole idea..

They have become more than characters to me: they have become friends.<br/><br/>Pirates are not good guys. They are plundering, gallivanting, dirty old, well...pirates. This movie demonstrates more of the true nature of what pirates were than the heroics of the first one. I like this one because it goes to the dark side of life, showing how people can resort to treachery to help their plot along. The hoisting of the pirate flags in the climax of the movie demonstrates what Jack says all along about the life of a pirate: ""What a ship is [...] is freedom."" To me, the fact that there were holes in the plot towards the end-- though they may indeed choose to do a fourth, but I don't believe so-- is to prove that in piracy, there is always another adventure to be had. Such is the life of a pirate. From the tear-jerking beginning, to the flash of green in the sunset at the very end (and i mean waaaay at the end, such as behind the credits), this movie will make you feel what it's like to be a pirate (and a schizophrenic)."

Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), Elizabeth (Keira Knightingly), and Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) must travel to this location and save our favorite pirate, in a plot that is somewhat overblown with too many characters, plot twists, and impulses of randomness. Besides being overloaded with just a little too much of everything, 'Pirates' is also much longer than necessary at a running time of nearly three hours. What powers 'Pirates' is not the plot, but the visuals. What's really amazing about the movie is use of special effects. From a ship full of Johnny Depp's to a climactic battle literally at the world's end, 'Pirates' never fails from continuously dropping the jaws of moviegoers. Though for me, the whole 'Pirates' idea is a little old, and with an ending implying a forth, it seems like money is all the franchise has in mind, I still enjoyed the movie thoroughly. The movie will make you want to doze off during any inaction, and want to wait for the action to start up again, but make sure that you don't doze off during the sessions of dialog, for you will find yourself quite lost. So pay attention, or after the movie you'll say to yourself, ""Wait...what just happened!?""

When I go to the movies, i don't want to see some cute little indie or another romantic comedy with some big names. I want to see a film with big action and big laughs: a film where it pays to have hundreds of people sitting around you. ""Pirates"" certainly fits into this category.<br/><br/>""At World's End"" is basically the story of how all the opened holes from the second film are sealed up. Luckily, however, it doesn't seem forced at all. The film is long, but it stays strong all the way through. It's a funny, thrilling, and beautiful thrill ride.<br/><br/>The laughs in ""At World's End"" are numerous, and they pop up all throughout the film. like in the first ""POTC,"" we even get funny one-liners and slapstick laughs during serious sword fights. There's slapstick comedy, great humorous dialogue, jokes about pirates, situational irony, and every other kind of humor you could possibly imagined. I laughed out loud more during this film than during ""You, Me, and Dupree,"" ""Little Man,"" and ""Just my Luck"" combined.<br/><br/>The visuals are stunning, as expected. I found myself examining Bill Nighy's digital Davy Jones ""face"" whenever he was on screen. The area shots are also beautiful, and the film looks really expensive, which is a good thing.<br/><br/>Depp steals the show as usual with his fantastic performance, but Keira Knightly, Geoffrey Rush, and Bill Nighy held up well as well, turning in stellar work. Keira Knightley was especially terrific. She is one of the few gorgeous modern women who can act extraordinarily well while entrancing the audience with her looks.<br/><br/>Yes, the film is a bit long and unruly, but the whole thing is enjoyable. Johnny Depp is always immensely interesting and fun to watch, and the plot is very funny in itself. This is a great film for any pirates fan, and I urge you to see it."

","The summer blockbuster. Those films that are so highly anticipated all winter long that millions of people around the world flock to cinemas and spend millions and millions of dollars just to see what all the buzz is about. <br/><br/>Fortunately, Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End is worth the price of admission. Director Gore Verbinski did the right thing in holding true to the story, bringing back all of the characters and not introducing too many new ones.<br/><br/>When we last left our band of pirates, Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) was eat by the Cracken, a giant squid that terrorizes sea-faring vessels, and was sent to Davey Jones Locker. Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), Elizabeth Swan (Keira Knightley), Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), and the rest of their pirate brigade, must bring together all of the pirate lords from the four corners of the world and try to combat Davey Jones and the East India Trading Company for control over the seas. There is one problem; Depp is one of the pirate lords and all nine are needed.<br/><br/>The crew must travel to the end of the world to get Depp and bring him back to complete the Pirate counsel and make a decision on what to do about Davey Jones. They all band together along with Chow-Yun Fat as Captain Sao Feng whose pirates derive from Singapore.<br/><br/>The first half of the film is dry in parts, but with Depp and Rush back at the helm, it is hard to go wrong. There are some very interesting scenes with Depp battling his own conscience and trying to stay ""sane"". The second half really picks up and erupts into a climactic battle of epic proportions on the open sea.<br/><br/>The flow of the film is steady and twists and turns enough to slightly confuse you, but in the end it all makes sense and that feeling of being lost is gone. Alliances are broken and new ones are formed as the final showdown gathers into a fantastic storm of edge of your seat action.<br/><br/>Verbinski finishes off the trilogy using the same techniques that worked on the two previous films; a hefty dose of computer effects and witty one liners. Additional swooping shots showcase the grand scale of the film and how far Verbinski and Disney Pctures goes to bring this world to life.<br/><br/>The one downside like the second film in the series had was the running time. This one goes for a whopping 168 minutes and it hits you. After the final frame, a feeling of exhaustion sweeps over you. DON'T LEAVE AFTER THE CREDITS! Stay for the bonus scene. It gives the series a nice wrap up.<br/><br/>No, there shouldn't be a Pirates of the Caribbean 4. Like all blockbuster hits, there is a limit to how far you can go (i.e. Jurassic Park. Love the first, not the rest). At World's End is a solid finale to one of the most successful trilogies of all time."
"gilroy0","7","1","3","5 June 2007"," Despite the chatter, not bad at all
","I know there's been a lot of negative buzz on this movie but I have to respectfully disagree. I think they actually did a good job creating a mythos almost entirely out of whole cloth, while remaining true to the feel of the children's' tales that inspired the trilogy in the first place. Some people walking out of the theater complained that the story was random but what they really meant was ""complex"" -- you have to dive into the mythos for it to work and you have to connect some dots yourself.<br/><br/>Those who compare this to Matrix:Revolutions are off base. There is one thread that is not tied as well as might be hoped, but most of the important ones are drawn tight. Like any good epic, the Pirates trilogy started local and small and evolved to more grand stages as it progressed. Meanwhile the characters did flesh out somewhat -- everyone at least and at last seems to have a real motivation -- and the sense of Something Big Changing comes through clearly.<br/><br/>Pulling off a third movie is always hard, but I think the producers came through on this one. It's no Return of the King but it does a nice job nonetheless."
"darkrain24","6","1","3","4 June 2007"," Just didn't do it for me
","After seeing Pirates 3 all I can say is what happened to the interesting, although still funny and lightheartedness that was the first film. I did somewhat enjoy this film but I only enjoyed the imagery and practically nothing else. The characters of the first film were hardly recognizable in this and it was not a good thing. Jack Sparrow just didn't seem to have that comedic attitude as before and the parts were suppose to be funny just weren't. The character of Elizabeth seemed to be mostly out for herself and nothing more. I will say that Will was mostly the same, an idiot, but at least before his idiocy was charming and entertaining. In this film I did not really care whether he was there or not. Davey Jones was better than before but, I still didn't find him all that great. I will say that the only character that I felt stayed rather awesome was Barbosa, he was cool. <br/><br/>Overall I just wanted the movie to end after about 2 hours, and whenever there was a lame attempt at something funny I just had to think back to the times of the first to keep me from falling asleep. I also thought the first movie was great for young and old alike because of the cheesy but still fun battles. The battles in this movie were all huge spectacles, which are cool, but I wanted another Jack/Will sword fight in the blacksmith shop. I am not going to get into the plot because it has been done in all the other comments, but I will say it was way to complicated especially when thinking of the younger audience members.<br/><br/>I really wanted to like this movie, and tried again and again throughout the film to like it but just couldn't. I think the only part that I really liked was when Jack was back on the sunny port being himself and not being pulled into the boring Gray abyss of Davey Jones locker."
"AlrightGuy","Null","1","3","4 June 2007"," A beautiful, glorious, long mess (spoilers)
","Just saw it yesterday, and it was about what I was expecting. Too long, took itself too seriously at times, too overblown. There were some good bits, but if not for Johnny Depp this movie would have died quickly. Barbossa was welcome back, though I didn't cotton too much to him and Sparrow getting along and having meaningful conversations at one point. Keira Knightley was badass but way too pretty amid a vast crew of filthy pirates. The movie was far too long. They could easily have trimmed out twenty minutes of 'atmosphere' and battle scenes. Speaking of battle scenes, I had a problem with the big fight at the end. The Pearl and the Dutchman were firing at each other across the center of the maelstrom and blowing each other all to hell, but look at the ships-they are both tilted towards the center, which would mean the cannons would completely miss each other and hit the water below. The endings were great for everybody except Will and Elizabeth. That really sucked. Sparrow should have done the deed, as he had nobody to come back for. I guess it's better than Will dying, but it still sucked. This really made me miss the Curse of the Black Pearl. That was an awesome movie. This series has hit the same problem the Star Wars series faced--reacting to crowd response to a great original movie by trying to turn it into an epic saga. The result in both cases was a ludicrous plot that took forever to get anywhere. If I had Jack's magic compass, it would have been pointing to the theater exit."
"Robert_duder","6","1","3","4 June 2007"," Continues it's unfortunate descent into confusion rather than entertainment
","I will start this review right off the bat by saying it needs a second look by me. When I see it again under proper context I may completely re-edit this review. What do I mean by that?? Pirates of The Caribbean 3: At World's End needs to be watched back to back with it's predecessor Dead Man's Chest. At World's End is so closely entwined with the previous installment that if you haven't seen #2 so that it's completely fresh in your mind you will be confused and completely overwhelmed. This is exactly why the professional critics are calling the film so confusing because Dead Man's Chest was kind of forgettable and because of that At World's End is more of the same. Somewhere along the way during Dead Man's Chest this brilliant Pirate premise and epic lost it's magical touch. Curse of The Black Pearl was downright brilliant but by the third installment you're a little bored with most of the characters and they seem equally as bored. The 300 Million dollar budget is unnecessary when you consider the best part of the trilogy (the original) was made with a 'paltry' 140 million and was brilliant and stunning. That being said the special effects still are very strong in At World's End. The sword play and fight sequences are still amazingly fun but there is far less of it in this installment.<br/><br/>I'll start with Johnny Depp who completely changed cinema history by bringing Captain Jack Sparrow to life in 2003. I still find that since Dead Man's Chest and now with At World's End Depp's Sparrow is very toned down and changed. He's more powerful and less subtle and likable. His clever one liners and over the top personality just isn't what it was with the original. All that being said Depp's Jack Sparrow is still memorable and he does still have some great lines and the 'trippy' effect of multiple Jack's is hilarious. He still is great in the role and certainly no one else could play the part. Geoffrey Rush returns as more of an ally as the scurvy Captain Barbossa and really does steal the show. Rush is basically everything Depp's Sparrow used to be. He's funny and evil and yet likable and such a strong anti-hero and he is brilliant. Orlando Bloom returns as William Turner but I'm not sure why because his character is now seemingly useless. He does the usual sword play but he's hardly the hero and barely makes a blip on the radar and is kind of boring now. Keira Knightley also returns as a very different Elizabeth Swann. Her character certainly made the most changes from the original film and not all of them good. She was much better as the damsel in distress who longed for adventure than as a Pirate King who barely resembles a lady any more. She was the balance in a film chock full of testosterone and she certainly left that behind in At World's End. Bill Nighy also returns as the diabolical Davey Jones and his performance is as good as Rush's Barbossa. Davey Jones is a terrific villain and the special effects on him are stunning. Most of the supporting cast are all return character from the original films which is good to see them come back but they really don't add any new character to the series with the exception of Naomie Harris as Tia Dalme and the Ocean Goddess Calypso in a rather unnecessary turn to the story.<br/><br/>As a trilogy Pirates of the Caribbean certainly holds it's own but it needs to be seen one after another in a day long Pirate extravaganza. The characters and stories are timeless and instant classics but certainly the series has gradually declined in quality since to the original brilliant beginning. Nonetheless the series is moving on taking 2+ Billion dollars since starting so don't be surprised to see another one coming. I would be fine with this if they take a close look at carefully recreating the characters and coming up with a new less complex storyline. At World's End is a little more violent, a little more dark and still leaves itself wide open for another sequel. If you did love Dead Man's Chest then At World's End will be right up your alley. I was disappointed that they made the catchy and action packed music a little more subtle in this installment and in the entire film Jack Sparrow only says ""Savvy"" ONCE!! It's worth seeing but don't expect to be blown away. 6.5/10"
"dstreiff","6","1","3","4 June 2007"," what a good movie this could have been...
","The third part of Disney's aspired pirate saga began so promising and amazing. The starting scene under the gallops and the brethren song chills you to the marrow and continues where the second Pirates part raised your hopes. And even to the middle of the movie you are fevering every second when you sail to Singapore, the World's End and see the piracy's end dawn under contracts and conspiracies. <br/><br/>But then something strange happens: amid action and progressing story more and more scenes of ridicule start to show up and impede the flow of the story. I can understand the idea of picturing Jack Sparrow's lunacy, but as much as I like to see the two British deserters switch into pirates, this just kills the momentum. By the time, we witness the 20th gag in the middle of deaths and relationship dramas, you just can't help but roll your eyes and hope for some surprise in the end (well, no). We hit the (anti)climax when Will and Elizabeth get married in between killing half an army of pirates. Fortunately, they find time for the bride's kiss after stabbing two foes. <br/><br/>Folks, THIS IS NOT A FUNNY PIRATE MOVIE, IT IS MAKING FUN OF PIRATE MOVIES! Probably I should have known better since Disney produced it, but the second part really raised my hopes for more. And catering the humor to kids does not really make sense in a PG13 rated movie, does it?<br/><br/>Compared to the second part At World's End does not feel too long, just a little annoying, and you will find an alright ending, but it never reaches the originality and coherence of a story as Part I. Yes, the special effects are amazing, the locations stunning and the actors do a good job. They make up some deal for the -I say it again- INCOHERENCE of the story, but not enough: 6 out of 10<br/><br/>I just wonder what this movie could have been.."
"ginger_northener","9","1","3","4 June 2007"," Will - what a plank!
","Now there are many reviews posted declaring this pirates to be the greatest/worst movie ever filmed, but I am going to focus on something narrower. For what it's worth, I enjoyed the film, despite a couple of minor disappointments.<br/><br/>First and foremost - how did Will get Liz? Now it's been clear from the last film that she was tempted by Jack but at the same time often repulsed by him. Will was nowhere near as exciting, but he is honest and dependable. Well not any more! She went to the locker to rescue Jack because she felt guilty, while Will went with every intention of betraying him once again! Quite frankly when Will turned ""nasty"" he lost the only plausible claim he may have had on Elizabeths heart.<br/><br/>Second - further complaints about Will I'm afraid, maybe Orlando fans had better turn away. What a selfish so-and-so! He's only going to see Elizabeth one day every 10 years. Now 10 years ain't too long if you're immortal - Liz ain't. Given the average life expectancy at the time she's probably got a weeks worth of visits tops. She's going to wait her entire life for one good week? He should have let her go - she could have continued her career as the pirate queen. She could, if she wanted to, have gone for Jack. Instead she gets left holding the baby waiting for Will to come visit once again.<br/><br/>Finally, this isn't a complaint, just my 2 cents worth. People think there will be a 4th just because Jack has the map for the fountain of youth. They may well do another one, but don't assume they will based on that alone. It's Captain Jack Sparrow! Savvy! Bring him that horizon. They couldn't possibly leave him with a happily ever after. He has to have another adventure in store, whether we see it or not. Knowing he's off on them is good enough for me. And that's without a single drop of rum!"
"trinityblade13","6","1","3","4 June 2007"," When did POC become the Keira Knightley show?
","Don't get me wrong, i thought the movie was great. Who doesn't like pirates? But when you make the star of the show Keira knightley, that becomes a HUGE problem! Since when does a move about pirates revolve around a woman? (and no I'm not sexist, I just think there's a right time and place for things like this, and a pirates movie isn't one of them!) even my wife got REALLY irritated with all the focus she was getting. We came to watch pirates, namely Jack Sparrow, not some lady in a dress trying her best to impersonate a pirate! <br/><br/>My other issue was the use of gags and jokes - it went a little too over board and for a second there, I thought i was watching another b-grade walt Disney movie! It was also a bit too arb in places - maybe i would have enjoyed it better if I was on acid? <br/><br/>There were some plot holes eg. the Calypso and Jones vanishing. Perhaps it may be explained in a 4th movie, along with the fountain of youth quest - who knows! <br/><br/>I would say the saving grace of the movie was definitely the ending - not your usual Walt Disney 'hearts and flowers' ending which was quite refreshing! <br/><br/>All in all go and see it for yourself. particularly if you LOVE Keira Knightley!"
"timhayes-1","8","1","3","3 June 2007"," Pirates, triumphant
","For the third film in the popular series, Pirates Of The Caribbean: At World's End is easily the best of the three. There are more double crosses, more pirate battles and intrigue. For those who said they have problems following the storyline I have two questions: 1) Did you even see the first two films? and 2) Were you paying attention. I ask this because having seen and been a fan of the first two, I had no problems following the story and all of the double crosses. I was thoroughly enrapt in the film and understood every well calculated move it made. I think that those who find problems with all the double crosses were really being just too lazy to keep track of the story and so they just let the film ride on its visuals. Mind you, the visuals are amazing. Davy Jones is resplendent in his squid like glory and the pirate ships at war are a sight to behold. Johnny Depp slips so easily into the role that by this point its like a second skin for him. Really now people, but he should get an Oscar win for this role, not just a nom. Its truly the role of a lifetime. Even Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom whom I always viewed as the weaker links in the cast both turn in fine performances this time out. As always, Geoffrey Rush is divine as Captain Barbossa. He is the epitome of what a pirate should be. All in all, Pirates 3 is great fun and a fitting way to end the series...or is it?"
"lee_a_scott","7","1","3","3 June 2007"," Yo-ho!
","Not as good as the first, better than the second, basically more of the same: Johnny being brilliant, Keira being lovely, Orlando being largely useless. The plot is all over the place, and the ships seem to travel the oceans faster than a modern speedboat, but it remains a daftly enjoyable romp, and worth the entry fee just to see Cap'n Jack Sparrow doing what he does. I was disappointed that, following all the hype, Chow Yun Fat's Singaporean pirate lord Sao Feng is actually little more than a cameo, and offers little to the actual action. Other than Sparrow, the star of the film is actually the monkey, whose misadventures are genuinely excellent. The film ends with a couple of surprises (always nice, considering how predictable most films are) and certainly puts all the bits in place for a fourth film, but if this is actually the end I think we can all say thanks for the ride and agree we had a good time."
"TheHande","9","1","3","3 June 2007"," Surprisingly good!
","POTC 3 was pretty much what I expected, not nearly as good as the first film, but definitely better than the second. In all, despite its length, a brilliant movie altogether.<br/><br/>POTC 3 has many things worthwhile about it. The cast which brings back Geoffrey Rush is just as memorable as before, but now the characters of all the characters are explored more deeply. This is a nice little improvement over the last film which seemed to be carried, more or less, by mere action-sequences.<br/><br/>Variety in locations was also nice and the comedy is even sharper than before. I especially loved the bickering between Sparrow and Barbossa. Seeing Keith Richards was also impressive, though his role in the film wasn't at all what I was expecting. The multi-level story doesn't become convoluted even though it is a little heavy-handed at times.<br/><br/>The one part of the movie that really got me by surprise was Jack's delirious visions in Davy Jones' Locker which can be considered almost borderline artistic.<br/><br/>The only reason why I don't think it lives up to the first one is simply because I loved the more grounded feel of the first film. I doubt any future installments (given there will be any more) can ever really compete with the first one. Those of you, who've seen Dead Man's Chest, this film is a must-see and for POTC-fans it's going to be a blast.<br/><br/>An excellent movie all around."
"Dmagic5000","1","1","3","2 June 2007"," At Worlds End is Visually Stunning but falls short of expectations
","The third and possibly last chapter of the Pirates of the Caribbean series has amazing special effects and battle sequences, but unfortunately, has lost the magic it once had.<br/><br/>After Elizabeth (Keira Knightly), Will (Orlando Bloom), and Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) rescue Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) from the land of the dead, they must face their foes, Davey Jones (Bill Nighy) and Lord Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander). Beckett, now with control of Jones' heart, forms a dark alliance with him in order to rule the seas and wipe out the last of the Pirates. Now, Jack, Barbossa, Will, Elizabeth, Tia Delma, and crew must call the Pirate Lords from the four corners of the globe, including the infamous Sao Feng (Chow-Yun Fat), to a gathering. The Pirate Lords want to release the goddess Calypso, Davey Jones's damned lover, from the trap they sent her to out of fear, in which the Pirate Lords must combine the 9 pieces that bound her by ritual to undo it and release her in hopes that she will help them fight. With this, all pirates will stand together and will make their final stand for freedom against Beckett, Jones, Norrington, the Flying Dutchman, and the entire East India Trading Company.<br/><br/>At World's End has some of the most amazing action sequences I have witnessed in a long time. The film itself is visually stunning and good to look at. Director Gore Verbinski captures stunning shots. I would recommend seeing this movie just because of these very reasons.<br/><br/>After the very entertaining Curse of the Black Pearl and Dead Man's Chest, At World's End has clearly lost its magic. The movie is nowhere near as funny as the others. I sat there rolling my eyes at the ""funny parts."" For instance, in At World's End, Jack suddenly has this ""multiple personality"" which the writers threw in there to try and grab a few laughs. The first time they appear is when Jack is stuck at world's end. Now at this part, it was funny, I admit I laughed a few times. However, once the crew rescue's Jack, the multiple Jack's should have stopped, but the writers just kept it going to the point where they just became plain annoying! One of the very cringe worthy parts is when one of the multiple Jack's is a skeleton and screams, ""Nobody move! I think I lost my brain."" Really, is that supposed to be funny?<br/><br/>The first 20 minutes or so of the movie are very promising, but once they rescue Jack, the plot just goes downhill. I sat there for almost the whole movie having no idea what was going on. My friend and I were leaning over to each other constantly asking each other what was going on. Once the movie was over I did feel kind of dumb for not understanding the movie, however, afterwards I was talking to many people and even some of the smartest people I know, didn't even understand what was going on. Sure you can say that you go to see a Pirate movie for the action and not story lines, but come on, there's a certain extent as to how little of a storyline there can be.<br/><br/>The amazing battle sequence near the end is almost ruined by one of the most cheesy and dumbest scenes of the trilogy. Right in the middle of battle Will asks Elizabeth to marry him right there and now since it might be their only chance. She agrees and they yell for Barbossa to perform the ceremony because it states in Dead Man's Chest that captains have the power to perform weddings. The writers must have thought that this would be a great way to grab even more laughs but it just creates groans and eye rolling. I understand that it might be their only time but it still felt really cheesy and dumb. The reason why it felt like that is because they're saying their vows while fighting and killing the enemies and you can clearly see that it was intended to be funny but it just wasn't.<br/><br/>The best performances of the movie go to Geoffrey Rush who is extremely convincing as Barbossa and has the right voice and everything for a pirate, and Johnny Depp who has been great throughout the whole trilogy but does seem less funny. Keira Knightly gives one of the worst performances of her career. She is just extremely awful in this movie it's painful to think about. Orlando Bloom was good but not great. <br/><br/>All in all, At World's End was a major disappointment, with failed attempts at being funny and a really confusing plot, and there are still many things which I disliked but don't have enough space for it. However I am recommending it just because it is a Pirates movie and if you are a fan of the first two you should still go see it, and the performances of Depp and Rush really make the movie slightly enjoyable, nevertheless because of the many problems of the film, At World's End rates at 2/10 and is one of the major disappointments of the year so far."
"CelluloidRehab","6","1","3","2 June 2007"," The Trilogy Curse Strikes Again
","This is yet another summer blockbuster gone Hollywood awry by being a bloated, self-indulging ""more is better"" behemoth. The series is based on my favorite Disney amusement park ride of the same name. By this point I was surprised that the end product has been this tolerable, considering the sword of Damocles hanging precociously over the entire series. At World's End was the piece-of-eight in my beer that overflows the glass. <br/><br/>The story takes over from the end of Dead Man's Chest: Davy Jones' Kraken kills Jack Sparrow, Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann are in couple's limbo, Captain Barbossa returns from the dead and newcomer Lord Cutler Beckett is attempting to do away with all pirates. If you thought the second movie was confusing and went nowhere, then you will be right at home here. Where the second movie contrasted the unevenly paced and somewhat dull movements of the first movie by going over the top(and campy) with the plot, action and characterizations, the third movie tries to outdo the second movie through sheer bulk. <br/><br/>Up to this point the saving grace of the series is Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp). This movie ultimately dumps him into a secondary backup role in favor of promoting Barbossa, Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann (who continue their pouting, emotionless whining as primary backups to Rush's pirate babbling). Davy Jones, who once was good character, has now been reduced to a lackey. Chow Yun Fat seems to be doing his best impersonation of Vincent Price or Chistopher Lee, by starring in useless cameo roles. Maybe for his next English language movie, he can add to his contract that his character must at least live into the second half of the movie. The character of Calypso is a complete waste of time as that story arc sinks to the bottom of the ocean (literally). There is a nice cameo of Keith Richards playing Sparrow's pirate father, that comes across more like the king of the gypsies than a pirate captain and ultimately is useless and fluff. The characters of Pintel, Ragetti, Mr. Gibbs, Cotton and Marty round out the supporting pirate cast and provide a nice array of comic moments. That's they're role after all and they do it pretty well.<br/><br/>The continuation and proliferation of a plot based on backstabbing the back stab, with a back stab and double-dealing double deals, just had me not caring. It had gotten a bit ridiculous before and it is even worse now. In this movie, I just didn't know why people were doing things except that it was in the script. This is a major problem with story telling these days. Instead of writing a compelling story that you can experience over and over, writers instead option out for ridiculously convoluted stories with improbably plot points that stretch out over long periods of time without saying anything (or when it does say something it is horribly simplistic or enigmatic to the point of confusion). <br/><br/>You are probably asking what is left. There is some action, though not a much as you would think and spread unevenly. The start of the movie has very little action, but it eventually gets to it. It is much more satisfying than Spider-Man 3 (which isn't saying much), but at times it doesn't know when to stop. The final action sequence (what Fleet Week should be every year) is a perfect example of too much, including the most ridiculously cheesy pirate wedding in the middle of a battle while falling into a vortex in the middle of the ocean. I kid you not. <br/><br/>Ultimately, this movie seemed to be lacking enough of Jack Sparrow. When he is on screen he is no longer the cunning rascal and is quite predictable. It was interesting to see Johnny do his best Being John Malkovich impersonation, however, his character was amusing at best. Whether Johnny, the script,the director or sheer over-use of the character is to blame, what is true is that Jack Sparrow needs to sail into the sunset on his dingy. <br/><br/>This slack is picked up by the man who single-handedly made Peter Sellers an uninteresting bore. He is the constant of the movie. Now who wants to see the dead-pan and unfunny pirate rantings of Geoffrey Rush over the course of two hours and forty minutes? I sure don't. By the end, I was wishing Barbossa would have had his head hacked off or at the very least got shot in mouth. <br/><br/>You maybe thinking this is a little graphic, but it is in the spirit of the movie. This is probably one of the most graphically violent movies I have seen from Disney (so far?), and without a doubt the most violent in the series. The opening scene is a grime gallows, where men, women and children are being hung. This segues into a musical number reminiscent of Pink Floyd's the Wall and I was on the floor laughing. Unfortunately, I was the only one in the theater to do so. <br/><br/>There is a political message there, but it is superficial and confused at best (dark times/dark empire/current events). Much as Leonidas' freedom speech had me laughing during 300, so did Elizabeth Swann's pirate freedom . It would be the equivalent of writing a speech about human rights and making Joseph Stalin deliver it. The intentionally funny moments are mostly tepid and everyone involved seems somewhat over the subject. The apathy is not as bad as the cast of Spider-Man 3, but it is still present.<br/><br/>The movie predictably wraps up the story and is the best thing that could have happened to the series (namely finish). The editing is atrocious and seems to have been done by recovering alcoholics, locked in a liquor store over a 4 day weekend. The similarities to Return of the Jedi are uncanny. Here's wishing we don't get any prequels."

","Spider-Man 3 was good but not great, Shrek 3 nice but not good and Pirates 3... well, to me At Worlds End is over long, confusing and at most times pretty boring. Too many story lines made the movie so fragmented that I didn't care about the ending anymore. I saw the movie four hours ago and frankly, there wasn't one scene that really stood up. Oh yes, perhaps the surreal Jack Sparrow ones in the afterlife. Well done. Reminded me of the ending of 2001. Keira Knightly looked as pretty as ever. The cameo of Keith Richards was also very nice though not vital to the story. I liked Pirates 2 a lot. That was just no nonsense fun with some great visual jokes. I hope the producers will let the Pirates franchise rest a while and maybe come back with a new chapter in five years. Or better: make something entirely new. But with the billion dollar box office success I expect mr. Sparrow to be back with a new adventure before 2009. Too bad."

","Of course you've got to see the third if you've seen the other two. So, I went tonight. I guess it's sort of a trend, the third movie of trilogies is never as good as the first or second. It was still entertaining, all the same. Great action, if that's all you're into. And a continuing main plot from the others.<br/><br/>The side plots were, however, kind of 'meh' in my opinion. Mainly my beef is with the Calypso plot. I'm not one to complain about a movie's length, but this plot would have cut down on movie length, and, considering the target audience was EVERYONE a shorter movie length would have been more fitting for the youngsters. It was still a good flick. Just that Calypso was kind of a lame side plot. Any other thoughts on this? I don't want to reveal thing for people who haven't seen the movie yet.<br/><br/>Another thing that I found was for the amount of sword fights in the movie, there was a complete lack of blood. Even after impaling people, there is no blood, and Jack Sparrow still wipes his sword clean. I'm assuming it was for the PG-13 rating? Although, I would have thought PG-13 allowed for some blood.<br/><br/>Overall, a good watch. A must watch for those who have seen the other two. Not sure that I'll be rushing to the stores to buy the trilogy when it comes out, since I don't own the other two on DVD. The best movie of the summer? Probably not."

I consider his line in film, most dramatic. Lord Cutler Beckett - present businessman, man, which knows, that such "" the business approach "". He very beautifully was lost in the third film, having proved, that he the correct captain.<br/><br/>In film still there are a lot of heroes, and all of them to not list. But everyone in film has made the contribution. <br/><br/>Huge thank Hans Zimmer, which has written such beautiful, graceful piracy music to film, I was in delight from music in film!<br/><br/>On my sight, it is the best film about the pirates, and it is looked very smartly!

Also be not frightened of so long duration of film 168 minutes, the film is looked on one breath, and the time flies Imperceptibly! <br/><br/>The large thank to the founders of film, that they have created such beautiful film, and so beautifully have finished the piracy trilogy, the trilogy "" of the Pirates of the Caribbean Sea "" which for ever remain in my heart! <br/><br/>I put to film a rating 10 of 10! <br/><br/>Любите этот фильм!(Love this film!) ;)"
"jaredmobarak","8","1","3","31 May 2007"," Oooo, a peanutPirates of the Caribbean: At World's End
","Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End is the final part of a very cohesive trilogy. There are no recaps between the films; they consist of a single story that is to be followed part by part. You must watch the first movie to be introduced to our heroes and supporting players because it is their actions here that make them the people they are later on. I would recommend seeing at least the second installment again before viewing the finale, however, it is not necessary as being a fan I was able to compose myself very early on with where we had left off. Credit to the filmmakers for realizing that this was the second half of the long tale that makes up parts two and three and not a standalone entity. The fanbase is intact and if you didn't like the previous, why should they cater to your needs of refreshing when the film isn't made for you? With all that said, I believe this film to be on steady ground with the two it follows, rounding out what is a very successful trilogya tough thing to come by lately.<br/><br/>We enter the film with a prologue showing the singular will of the pirate community, something that is strong and will come into play later on. The sequence is effective in giving the audience a chance to rejoin the dirt and atmosphere that these movies have so effectively portrayed. Our main action soon follows as our heroes continue their quest for Jack Sparrow and his Black Pearl. Some need the ship to free the bonds of servitude for loved ones, some need Jack to assuage their conscience, while others just want the ship back in order to fulfill a promise that brought them back from the dead. Each character's motives are held tightly to their chests and we are privy to numerous changes of allegiance and multiple double crossing, although not always crossing the ones we think. Alliances are struck and pirates join together in order to save their kind from the East India Company's tyranny and Davy Jones' renegade, murderous bent created from his sacrificing the one being that ever loved him. Don't worry, though, if you have been having fun and following along, all the twists and turns make perfect sense. Also, the intricacies of the plot really impressed me because whether or not originally planned as a trilogy, the attention to detail and past occurrences truly allow one to become totally wrapped up in the action.<br/><br/>Once again the acting is top-notch. True it is oftentimes over-the-top, but that is what is expected here. This is a fantastical adventure story seeped in mythology, history, and romance. Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley have evolved into very serious people who have seen much pain and death. There is little humor with them as in previous installments, however, their love for each other still exists and whether they trust the other or not, they do what they have to do to keep that bond alive. Johnny Depp is again in top form and just adds to the Jack Sparrow role. The laughs still exist, but we also get to see a side of Jack that has been missing, a true drive to fight and a willingness to sacrifice himself for the victory.<br/><br/>These three do see a bit of a push to the background as we are bombarded with characters from all sides, though. Barbossa is back, and this is a great thing. Geoffrey Rush was one of the best pieces that the original film had going for it, and to have him and Depp together again, this time on the same side, is a treat indeed. Naomie Harris returns with effectiveness and the ability to still look gorgeous even under her gypsy woman garb; Bill Nighy proves once more that no matter how much cgi is used, it is his skill as a performer that truly overcomes; Tom Hollander portrays his villain with the same amount of sleaze mixed with a false arrogance that he is covering all his bases as in the second, when in reality he is working with pirates, they swear allegiance to no one; and Chow Yun-Fat adds a nice air of professionalism in an intimidating role whose motives are never really known.<br/><br/>Besides the writing being true to the franchise and the acting never missing a step, the real success again lies in the animation and visuals. Director Gore Verbinski has a superb eye and a creative streak shown at numerous moments. The visual effects are once more the best in the business and some sequences, such as Hollander's descent amidst an imploding ship or the final ship battle inside a giant maelstrom, are truly breathtaking to experience and wonder how long it could have taken to orchestrate to perfection. Some moments crossed the line a bit, like every time Depp's psyche brought out multiple versions of himself, whether in Davy Jones' locker or out. These instances showed some nice effect in superimposing many Jack Sparrows interacting with each other, but they were overly long and ultimately totally unnecessary to the story at hand.<br/><br/>After it all, I can't think of a better way for this franchise to finish. There was no degradation in my opinion throughout the series and with a fully fleshed beginning and end, I hope that this will be all we see. Verbinski needs to continue on to other things, bringing his singular vision with him to create new and innovative films. As for the characters, I believe they have finished strong and whole, any more entries will only demean the integrity that has held thus far. Don't be surprised too if people die that you do not expect, Pirates does not cop out, and as a result succeeds that much more."
"sweetbum1989","9","1","3","31 May 2007"," pay attention or you'll lose yourself
","All those that go and see this film will not be disappointed; the storyline is full of twists and turns that would make a roller-coaster dizzy, the characters are well thought out and played to a tee and the special effects are exciting enough to stop a girl going to the ladies (well i didn't want to miss anything did i?!). However when watching the movie keep your wits about you as it is not an easy ride, with so many different plots and sub-plots it is easy to lose your head. Some said that the storyline would be predictable; it is far from it, they said it wouldn't be as good as the previous ones; they were wrong. if anything this movie only highlights why the previous films were such big successes. Finally there are only two more points i would like to make: 1. those who are hardcore romantics, try not to be too disappointed in the end 2. and those who like me wished that Orlando Bloom and Johnny Depp would wear less clothes in the movie then I'm afraid more disappointment is in order....lol<br/><br/>Enjoy people....."

"exusninja","5","1","3","30 May 2007"," Pirates 3 leaves a salty taste in your mouth
","This movie is neither terrible nor superb... Its close to being good...but a few things take away from making it a 7 or 8 out of 10. FIRST: Funny things #1. Giant Calisto looks like a Sam Raimi Titan from the Xena TV Show #2. Female empowered Swan ""KING OF PIRATES"" reminds me of the Aqua video My oh My...where the main female gets abused by the guys and then becomes there leader #3. Crazy Johnny Depp scene in the desert reminds me of a Twin Peaks moment.<br/><br/>Review Simply put the movie is way too long...there are too many pointless scenes that have little or nothing to advance the plot. The movie actually flows fairly well until the conclave of the brotheren. Then the movie seems to written by someone else. It starts to move in directions that just don't fit. Like all of a sudden Swan's developed relationship with Sparrow is forgotten, and revolves around Turner. But lets say its just to give people what they want (although i'm sure people would have rather scene Sparrow and Swan), in the middle of the LONGEST most DRAWN OUT and utterly CONFUSING fight scene they decide to get married. Pointless and unnecessary. Also Calisto and Davey Jones relationship is pointless. She's there simply to create the storm at the end. Many other things bother me about this movie...but that's enough negative stuff for now.<br/><br/>Fix these things and cut 45-60 minutes out the movie rates a 7.<br/><br/>And directors reading this: Length does not equal substance."
"fhfgjg","6","1","3","30 May 2007"," Worth watching to finish, but does no compare to the first.
","This series started out fantastic. Curse of The Black Pearl was probably the closest thing to a modern Indiana Jones film I had seen in years. It was original, captivating, and the perfect epic adventure film that today's audience needed.<br/><br/>Next was Dead Man's Chest, which was not as good, but still a worthy sequel.<br/><br/>Then comes this, a long long long drawn out film that leaves you nothing but confused and sort of exhausted.<br/><br/>This movie was not bad, no. Was it fun? Yes. Was it something I would watch again? Sure.<br/><br/>It was however, much like most 3rd films in trilogies these days, and that is one word.....disappointing.<br/><br/>Part of the disappointment lies in the fact that this movie was drawn out so much longer than it had to be. It was as if they put some parts in there just to fill time. Seriously, had they cut it down 30-40 minutes this movie would have been much much better.<br/><br/>The acting from Johnny Depp was even a bit bizarre at times.

"Drewski-3","4","1","3","29 May 2007"," It Could Have Only Been Slightly More Boring ::Spoiler Alert::
","I loathed the second Pirates of the Caribbean, so needless to say I was not expecting much out of the third installment. But even with my expectations so low, they were not met.<br/><br/>It was completely evident that the story was half-heartedly tacked on to a film that was really not meant to have sequels. The loose ends and unnecessary sub-plots served only as nails to squeeze tight this sea-bound coffin.<br/><br/>::SPOILERS BELOW:: <br/><br/>I have a few questions for the filmmakers: <br/><br/>1. If you made such a big deal out of Calypso, why is it that she only served to create an easily escapable whirlpool? At first it seemed that everyone was making a mess out of their pants when they heard about Calypso, and it didn't make sense to have her appear, but then only to disappear without any consequence.<br/><br/>2. Why were we supposed to care about the hangings and the song in the beginning? The beginning might have made sense if we saw more about how the reign of the Trading Company affected ""normal"" people's lives, but all we saw was a bunch of random people dying, apparently for no reason. Yes, we knew the Trading Company was evil. What was intended at the beginning was trite and unnecessary. Thank you Gore Verbinsky--you just downplayed the imagery of mass murder. Which leads me to my last question.<br/><br/>3. Seriously? This is Pirates of the Caribbean, not Schindler's List. You don't care THAT much about the characters, and the reason the first film worked so well is that it didn't take itself so seriously. The character development of Elizabeth Swann was shoddy, the lack of resolution of plot was frustrating, and so many other elements of the film were something you might expect from an academy award winning drama, not something manufactured in the Hollywood mill.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed the original, and I'll continue to watch it from time to time, enjoying Johnny Depp's performance each time. There were a few Depp moments in this last one that made the Matinée price of my ticket stub almost worth what I paid.<br/><br/>Other than that, this film is pure crap."
"mg!","6","1","3","29 May 2007"," Pirates of the Caribbean: The World of Tia Dalma
","Tia Dalma was the darling of Pirates 3. She was the center of almost the entire film, with the whole universe spinning around her. Personally, I think she was THE WEAKEST and MOST UNINTERESTING of every single character ever introduced since the opening credits of Pirates 1. She appears to have as much face time and lines as Captain Jack Sparrow. Johnny Depp's character was too few and too far between. The film makers tried to make up lost time by ""duplicating"" a technique ripped from the pages of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.<br/><br/>It is a very, very long movie with a great deal of talk and serious discussion of pirate politics that was near NPR quality. Keira Knightley was wonderful to look at despite of her ""Braveheart"" moment. The plot was incoherent with a great deal of emphasis extracting sympathy of piracy as a respectable, productive profession out of the audience.<br/><br/>Still, it was not a miserable movie and any who enjoyed the first two will not regret watching the 3rd. With high production values, there was a lot to look at. Other supplemental characters truly pulled their weight and made Pirates 3 enjoyable.<br/><br/>Highs: Johnny Depp, Keira Knightly, Yun-Fat Chow, and most supporting characters, production values.<br/><br/>Lows: Talk, talk, talk. Not enough Sparrow, too much Tia Dalma. Infertile plot twists.<br/><br/>Score: Pirates 1: 8, Pirates 2: 7, Pirates 3: 6."

","Pirates Of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl was the best out of all of them. OMG!!! Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Mans Chest was the funniest. and Pirates of the Caribbean: At worlds end was the saddest ever. Kiera Knightly was excellent as usual but there was not a lot of Johnny Depp unfortunately. This movie is better than Spiderman 3. So ignore the stupid people with the bad reviews and go buy a ticket! You wont be disappointed.<br/><br/>I went yesterday at 6:00 p.m. to see the movie and I was not disappointed. Im a huge fan of these movies myself. In the trilogy Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann are back with a lot more action packed stunts like sword fights and cannons.<br/><br/>STAY after the credits. There's a scene that opens up the 4th movie and its good. So go out and watch it. Although, 2 characters die but then one comes back to life. Im not saying which one though. I will tell you a few facts. Keira recently said in a interview she was done with acting when she turns 22. Johnny also said he got the idea for his character from Keith Richards and a drunk guy. KEITH RICHARDS is always drunk so no comparison there :] GOO SEE ITT!!!"

Of course I didn't want to give anything away, because I want her to enjoy the movie just as much as I did. <br/><br/>The multiple personalities were interesting and caught my interested attention.

You know, like the scenes that you want to watch over and over again. At Worlds End, that's what I got. This movie is a definite 'got to have' movie. I prefer for people to go out and see it on the big screen. But if not, get it on NetFlix. Better yet, buy it. I strongly recommend this movie to be viewed by young adults, adults, preteens...

"miss-victorious","10","1","3","29 May 2007"," Definitely worth seeing...for those Pirates fans
","If you are a die-hard ""Pirates"" fan, this movie is definitely for you. However, if the first two films did not satisfy you, I recommend not going to see this movie because you will be confused and even tired of Captain Jack and his crew and enemies. It fulfills everything that it was meant to: it clears up major questions (like how/why did Barbossa come back from the dead?); it is terribly funny; it finally brings our two favorite love birds together; Barbossa returns; there are even more scallywagging pirates; Keith Richards acts as a cameo; and the good guys win in the end. For those who loved the first movie as I did, the latest ""Pirates"" film pays great tribute to it...but I won't spoil you with the details. As for Jack Sparrow, what can I say? You see plenty of him...trust me, you will definitely see plenty (emphasis) of him. He is, as always, hilarious to watch, from flying (by rope) from one ship to the next to his memorable lines: ""Who am I?"" (addressing Beckett...who looks at him, clueless) Jack responds (hurt) ""I'm Captain Jack Sparrow!"" Various reviewers have said they were disappointed by the film. I have heard it titled as ""boring""-- in my opinion it was far from it. Action ranging from Jack Sparrow fighting Davy Jones on top of a mast, Elizabeth and Will fighting while being married by Captain Barbossa who is also fighting, to Davy Jones stabbing Will in the chest...it is an action filled movie that will guarantee pleasure, but really only if you are a die-hard ""Pirates"" fan...as I am."
"Juni78ukr","5","1","3","29 May 2007"," Absurdity rules at World's End
","This comment may contain minor spoilers.<br/><br/>I greatly enjoyed the first Pirates movie because it brought something new and fresh in the world of Hollywood blockbusters. The Dead Man's Chest was in many ways below original, the story had much more chaos and less common sense. However despite all its flaws the second movie still was entertained enough to keep you on the edge of your seat and enjoy the show for two and a half hours. <br/><br/>I wish I could have said the same about the third. The charm and romance ultimately have gone and instead of them all what we've got is visually attractive but totally ridiculous marriage scene and some pretty week dialogs all over the movie. In a few minutes it's also became clear that the Pirates of the Caribbean is not the movie for the young ones anymore. The scene of hanging in the beginning was so much over the top that it made me cringe. Of course the first two parts of trilogy probably deserved PG-13 rating but they hardly contained any strongly unappreciated for young children material. Now the movie based on Disney's theme park, which attracted children with their parents from all over the world, has lost family audience. <br/><br/>There is nothing original at the World's End, everything what was brand-new, funny and enjoyable in first movie now became annoying and at best it's worth only a few cheap laughs. The script is a total mess where one preposterous scene change another with ridiculous, though technically solid and impressive visuals. What is even worse is that somewhere towards the middle of the movie the characters become almost uninteresting to the audience. With all these inexplicable plot twists and continual betrayal from anyone there's no point to care about our heroes. No matter who will die or who will survive and all that remains is idle curiosity what will happen next, where incredibly wild imagination of the screenwriters finally could bring us. All possible attempts to make things add up eventually failed and in the results writers got lost in the labyrinth of betrayals and plot twists they constructed. There is no point to tell anything about dialogs  nearly everything is banal and clichéd. <br/><br/>The acting is pretty much the same as in two previous parts. Johnny Depp has much less screening time now and his character is not in the center of all events. Somehow it happened what Captain Barbosa who was the main villain in first movie now became actually the most attractive and worthy character. The main antagonist  nearly almighty Lord Beckett is just a bloodthirsty murderer who maniacally chase our heroes all other world without a clear reason. Elizabeth looks like a curse for everyone who fell in love with her or just approached her and Will is as always indecisive and unpredictable. I don't think that was the way the audience wanted and there is no much logic about all of this. The final battle is a complete theater of the absurd. No one has any idea where those enormous fleets (absolutely impossible for that period) came from and what was looking as the greatest sea battle of all-time turned into long duel between two ships with its strange conclusion. <br/><br/>Visuals in the movie are pretty good, sometimes impressive or even spectacular but with too many plot holes, wide discrepancies and lack of logical ties all other the movie they can't save the third adventure of the Pirates from sinking. It's remarkable how strongly screenwriters did their best trying to avoid mentioning any real names or locations on world map. Singapore is the only one place that connect the movie with the real world but this connection is lame in historically inaccurate because there was no British in Singapore in that time, only harmless fishermen and small Portuguese, later Dutch outpost. The entire movie looks like a box of candy with beautiful cover but bitter to taste. The commercial product was made and delivered to customers and the studio is already counting thousands of gold coins coming from all over the world. The final became one more proof that future sequels are quite possible but it's just a matter of money and in the extreme case they can always rise anyone from dead or go even further to make hundreds of million dollars. <br/><br/>Anyway it's worth to see what became of potentially one of the all-time best trilogies or as we can say now potentially endless franchise, but if you're interested in more than preposterous conglomerations of visuals, long but pointless battle scenes and cheap jokes you might be disappointed. The poor storyline ruined nearly everything."

","Saw Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End and was prompted to write a review on one of the year's best movies.<br/><br/>If the Curse of Black Pearl gave you a good story, Dead Men's Chest was loads of fun. But POTC3 has both- great fun and a brilliant plot. The film truly belongs to Johny Depp (Sparrow) and Geoffrey Rush (Barbosa)- the two standout performances for me. Bill Nighy (Davy Jones) was also quite up to the mark.<br/><br/>Pintel and Ragetti again impress so does Lord Beckett. However, I feel 2 hours 45 minutes runtime is little long but the movie does manage you to keep on the edge of your seat. Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley once again prove that they are the worst actors in Hollywood. I didn't like their performances and felt as if they were begging the director for screen presence in the entire movie.<br/><br/>Watch it for Captain Jack Sparrow (Depp). He once again proves his versatility as an actor and is just brilliant and as usual funny. The moment you see him, you will always laugh in the film.<br/><br/>And for Sam Raimi, Please do watch this movie. This is how you make a sequel/trilogy. I give this one 4/5."
"NavyOrion","3","1","3","29 May 2007"," Wait for the DVD
","I must admit I enjoyed the first movie of the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" trilogy (although anyone who considered it the best pirate movie ever simply hasn't seen enough movies.) And I suppose it was inevitable that there would be sequels, given how much cash Disney managed to rake in on it.<br/><br/>But take all of the complaints that you might have had about last year's ""Dead Man's Chest"" (too long, tedious and pretentious, needlessly-complex plot) and double them for ""At World's End."" <br/><br/>Have these people never heard of an editor? Or could it be that no one at the studio has the nerve to tell Gore Verbinkski to back off a bit? For heaven's sake, the movie is three hours long! You're telling me that nothing could have been trimmed? Example: the interminable ""limbo"" scene with the humorous-but-overrated Johnny Depp mincing around the Bonneville Salt Flats; after seeing this worthless scene, which advances the story not a whit, I cannot fathom what scenes will appear on the ""deleted scenes"" section of the DVD release. Similarly, the final battle, while visually impressive, seems to take forever to reach a conclusion.<br/><br/>As in ""Dead Man's Chest"", a relatively simple story would have been preferable to the ridiculously complex mishmash presented here. Eventually, you just don't care who's on which side, because you know it's subject to change at a moment's notice. Betrayal by a leading figure should come as a shock to both the other characters and to the audience, but after a few hours of it happening repeatedly, there are no longer discernible sides to the conflict, but just a squabbling rabble.<br/><br/>Verbinski also insisted on unnecessary ""growth"" in characters both major and minor. Although Depp's Jack Sparrow is toned down a trifle, Orlando Bloom is much darker this time out, and seems to have little motivation other than being generally annoyed at the world. Keira Knightley, while always nice to look at, is even more laughable as an action heroine (and King of the Pirates, believe it or not) than as an actress. A contrived romantic history between Calypso the bayou gypsy and Bill Nighy's Davy Jones provides him with unneeded motivation (since when must mythical bad guys have more reason than just being bad guys?) Mackenzie Crook and Lee Arenberg, who were likable as comic-relief pirate bumblers Pintel and Ragetti, are expanded to the point that their comic duties must be taken over by a pair of British soldiers. For Pete's sake, even the darn monkey and parrot get extra screen time! (It's almost reminiscent of the ""Lethal Weapon"" series, which with every new outing seemed to pick up a new character, like a ship picking up barnacles.) On the other hand, Governor Swann (enjoyably played by character actor Jonathan Pryce) is killed, off camera, for no discernible reason.<br/><br/>A couple of nice additions: Chow Yun Fat playing the pirate lord of Singapore, and Rolling Stone Keith Richards as Jack Sparrow's dad (although the latter casting was an obvious economy measure, as Richards was able to supply his own clothes and makeup.) <br/><br/>The cinematography and Hans Zimmer's score leave no room for complaint, except that there is about an hour too much of each.<br/><br/>One last nit-pick. At the end, when the Black Pearl and Flying Dutchmen are each poised to fire a broadside into Beckett's flagship, we're treated to the implausible scene of Beckett unable to come up with an order in response. Hmmm, let's see: his ship has a couple hundred cannons run out and ready to go.. how about ""Fire!""? Alas, that might have made the movie go on even longer, so he unbelievably remains silent as his ship is destroyed. The scene smacks of a belated decision to ""let's-just-get-it-over-with."" <br/><br/>I suspect that the main problem with this film is that Verbinski was hired to make a nice, fun little popcorn-muncher of a summer movie, but somewhere along the way he started to believe he was making an epic. Unfortunately, there's just not enough here to float that boat. Remember, all this is based on a 40-year-old amusement-park ride.<br/><br/>It would be nice someday to see this a version of this movie (ditto ""Dead Man's Chest"") that's drastically tightened up, with an hour or so left on the cutting-room floor. There's a really fine movie in there somewhere, amidst all the flotsam and jetsam. For now, wait for the DVD, and use the fast-forward."
"matt21480","7","1","3","29 May 2007"," A mixed bag of pirate fun and non-sense
","Most people who go and see ""Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End"" probably already know what they are getting themselves in for. Elizabeth Swann (Knightley), Captain Barbossa (Rush) and Will Turner (Bloom) are back in what amounts to a series of adventures, misadventures and somewhat confusing double-crosses. Basically, Lord Beckett now controls the seas having Davy Jones (Nighy) and the powerful ship The Flying Dutchman under his control. The film basically follows the Swann, Turner and Barbossa as they try and save Captain Jack Sparrow (Depp) and stop Beckett and Jones from ending piracy and sea freedom forever.<br/><br/>The strong points of the film by far are Depp's performance and the visuals. The photography, art and set direction are all terrific combining picturesque ocean scenes with detailed seeded locales (Shanghai and the pirate hangout) that look like they are out of ""Blade Runner"" or ""Star Wars"" only on the seven seas. Then, Johnny Depp does a great job once again as the goofy and eccentric Jack Sparrow. Depp adds some needed humor and lightheartedness to what is a bit overlong affair.<br/><br/>The weaknesses of the film, in my opinion, are that because it has several story lines going at once and it needs to combine them altogether by the end into fitting denouement, the film ultimately gets a bit muddled and confusing. Some of the stories and characters end abruptly and other scenes seemed rushed or done as plot devices rather than anything else. As just one example, Swann's escape off of the Flying Dutchman is beyond making any bit of sense. Other than Bootstrap, where is anybody??? Plus, a few of the scenes near the conclusion are a bit heavy-handed and sometimes tacky.<br/><br/>All these complaints aside though, everything you expect and want from your comedy/adventure movies are here, some solid action, funny characters and scenes and at least one great performance (Depp). While the film is a bit too long at 2 hours and 47 minutes, it doesn't always feel that long, during the action and comedy sequences the film moves at a steady pace, it's only in some of the dialogue heavy moments that the film really slows. Ultimately, I give ""Pirates 3"" a somewhat generous 7 out of 10, it is a bit slow and heavy-handed, but you certainly get your money's worth."
"thelawrences","8","1","3","29 May 2007"," It's Still Pirates!
","On the up side, it was Pirates! The main characters all were great in their roles, they have really settled in to the characters. We got to see more of Tia Dalma, and Keith Richards was wonderful as Captain Teague. I wish we could have seen more of him. Some of the developments in the ""bad guys"" were great as well. Of course the effects were spectacular, and there was plenty of humor thrown in to offset the drama/fighting. On the down side, a few of the CG scenes went on too long, particularly one of the sea battles, the view of Sparrow at World's End, the transformation of Calypso. I found the same problem with King Kong. What begins as an amazing scene eventually becomes boring and doesn't advance the storyline at all. I also didn't care for the ending, which I won't share here. It's not that I have to have a happy fairy tale ending, but just thought this one could have been thought through better. You will also hear you should wait through the credits for a special scene at the end. Let me just say that there are about 15 minutes of credits, and the extra 3 minutes of movie isn't particularly special. Just have someone who did stay tell you about it."
"stephenmogg","7","1","3","29 May 2007"," At my wits end !
","Ever been in the cab of an out of control juggernaut with no driver ? no, neither have I but I would imagine it feels a lot like sitting through this film. Plots and sub-plots come thick and fast and are discarded in a thrice. Maybe I am asking too much, decent script, prudent editing and a less buttock numbing running time would be nice. The story is very loosely based around rescuing Jack from Davey Jones locker and waging a war for Pirates rights (I think). The humour from the first of the franchise is largely absent, the much publicised cameo by Keith Richards cruelly squandered for want of a script and its chief villain Davy Jones(and the best thing in 2nd movie) hobbled by a lack of accompanying Kraken and being under the thumb of the Brits. What you are left with is a CGI spectacle which has its moments for sure, but leaves the movie a bit like Mr D. Jones himself, without a heart."
"iHaveBankai","7","1","3","29 May 2007"," Lots of 'Pirate-Action' -- not so much story...
","As people are running around wanting to catch the latest 'Pirates' flick, I wonder to myself if all a movie needs to be successful is good CGI and lots of action. Because that's what you have in 'Pirates 3'. The graphics were definitely superb, a lot better than those in Spider-Man 3, as well lots of action to keep you on the edge of your seat.<br/><br/>Another interesting thing in this movie is that it has a lot more innovation than the previous film in the series. There are a lot of new camera tricks that they do that could be described as quite abstract yet artistic, which contributes greatly to the film's cinematography, which is another thing I found to be quite well done. Not only that, but the funny moments in this one are quite original, unlike those in 'Dead Man's Chest' which were recycled from the first film.<br/><br/>Despite the great CGI, action, cinematography...and even acting, this movie did not live up to my expectations in terms of the story. I personally think that they went totally overboard with the complexity of the story that it just became too confusing and too hard to follow. At the end of the movie, you're bound to have a discussion with your friends about why some of the events in the movie actually happened. I also didn't like certain story elements, like Calypso for example, which seemed to not have any use in the story.<br/><br/>Lastly, the film was just too darn long! There were a lot of very long and slow scenes, as well as useless scenes that do nothing more than add to the complexity of the movie, which it definitely doesn't need. If some of those were a bit trimmed and made the movie simpler for audiences, I'd give it a higher rating.<br/><br/>All in all, I'm giving it a 7."

","A pirate movie is supposed to be about sword fights and swashbuckling not committee meetings. The movie gets bogged down in dialogue as each of the main characters conspires with allies and enemies. Cast your mind back to POTC1 - conversations were carried on DURING well choreographed sword fights. This combination of action and advancing the story is sadly missing in POTC3. The result is dull beyond measure. Even Jack's wit and wisdom has lost it's edge. What you get for your money is 1 sword fight, 1 good battle and effects that we've seen before i.e. not special.

","I am a huge fan of Pirate films as a genre, and loved the first POTC installment. The second one seemed like half a film to me, so i was keenly waiting the conclusion of this tale. I could not have been more disappointed.<br/><br/>It is easy to forget that the first film focused on the roguish charm and wit of Jack Sparrow, told a coherent story, was well plotted, pacey, and had few special effects. ""worlds End"" has grown into a bloated monster, fat on the success of the first two installments. Hugely impressive, and expensive, special effects have dwarfed the plot such that Sparrow has been relegated into little more than a bystander in this juggernaut of a CGI driven picture.<br/><br/>Many of the scenes were shot during last years filming of the second ""Dead Mans Chest"", and apparently the script had not been finalised at that point. It shows. This franchise has become a ""Mision Impossible"" style enterprise whereby the set pieces are put together first, and then joined up by a script that tries to make some sense of it.<br/><br/>Sadly, i do hope that this is the end for this series.The English Rose innocence of Keira Knightley now seems wet, her attempts at being Action Woman risible. And as for Orlando Bloom, he is about as dashing as Larry Grayson, as he hangs around to win his lady's heart. Jack, previously the vibrant life of every frame has been sidelined by a tidal wave of special effects that are simply there because the money is there to provide them , rather than because of any dramatic imperative.<br/><br/>Farewell, and bon voyage - i will remember the good times."

","WOW!<br/><br/>That is the best way I can describe the new Movie Pirates of the Caribbean At Worlds End. The movie was an overall success, Except for the end, which left me, and I'm sure most, wanting more of Captain Jack Sparrow, and his Zainy ego. I also found the quick death of Sao Feng a setback, and the design of Davy Jones locker was different then the image put in my mind from without this series. Hans Zimmer was as amazing as ever in composing the music for this summer blockbuster. The movie was confusing at times, and I found myself getting lost within Dialouge or plot at times. Many characters were killed off, and Calypso and Tia Dalma were useless to me, along with the brethren. I found the guest appearance Of Keith Richards fun, although his part was short. The last battle was an amazing thrill ride, and Orlando Bloom was amazing in the way he brought out the ""power of the dark side"" in Will. The hilarious humor was kept, and I'm glad we didn't go of onto a cannibal infested island, or a beach with a giant wheel on it this time. Staying in the ocean kept the real pirate feel to the movie. I didn't find this movie ""weaker"" than the first one, like in the case of Shrek the third, I found this movie to be better than the original times ten. I enjoyed this movie, and I'm a huge fan of Johnny Depp, who is brilliant in my opinion. Oceans Thirteen is next ion my list of movies to see over the summer, along with Harry Potter and the order of the Phoenix, as I am a huge fan of the series, and I was disappointed by the fourth one"
"zorgclyde","6","1","3","28 May 2007"," an action-packed if long Pirates
","I went to see this movie with no expectation, since I heard so-so reviews about it. The good news is that if you go in not expecting much, it actually is not a bad movie. It is quite long - almost 3 hours. It's probably an hour too long, and I am still not sure why they had to go to Singapore in the first place (could have rewritten that part to cut 50 minutes off). However, the special effects are spectacular, all the favorite characters looked great. And of course, Jack Sparrow gets extra screen time. The problem is that they tried to have too many stories weaving in and out of the main plot. There was multiple events happening at once, and I am not sure if that's a good thing in an action flick like this. Also, there was more action and not as much light-hearted humor as compared to the original, which made the movie felt even longer. Overall, it's not a must-see movie if you haven't watched the previous Pirates. However, it's good eye candy for 3 hours if you've seen them or just like the main characters. Just sit back and enjoy, and not worry about too much about the plot. P.S. There is a little clip at the end if you sit past the looong credit list. And yes, Keith Richard really looks like Jack's father, hehe (they must have used tons of makeup on him b/c he actually look pretty OK)."

Granted, just a little creative editing, could have cut this down to a more manageable time. For example, after you see Keith Richard's role, ask yourself ""What the heck did that add to the overall movie?"" Moreover, we know the pirates are on a ship, things that float on water. Cut back on the grandiose water shots, focus on the acting and action. Sadly, I am forced to abandon my own advice regarding the virtues of brevity, as the site will not accept my review without my adding additional, unnecessary words, submitted in this sentence.

I spent 90% of the movie wondering what the hell was going on, and not in the good ""I wonder what will happen here"" way. They threw too many conflicts in at once, and you spend the whole movie trying to decipher who is screwing who over, though it wouldn't spoil it to say it is predictable that the good guys will be good guys in the end.<br/><br/>All this film seems to be is an exercise in how good CG can be in a film, and as my summary suggests, there is only so much CG I will endure without having an Xbox pad in my hands. Visually it is fantastic, but it is all for nought when there is no story. The only plus side for me is that Johnny Depp is once again brilliant as Jack Sparrow, although even then (and this is not Depps fault at all), the character flip flops between being a coward and having balls of steel in a heart beat.<br/><br/>The longest 3 hours of my life."

I thought a lot of questions were answered, and actually I felt the very last scene after 20 minutes of credits left plenty of room for another movie which I will also see (if there is one). The next adventure has already been locked and loaded, therefore I suppose the gross dollar will tell us if there will be another one. You cant bean the Bahamas for a perfect backdrop to the movie. The adventure was wonderful, the action was terrific, and I felt there was more humor in this than others which I loved!! My 13 year old and my 20 year old also loved it......good for the whole family! As far as the ""confussion"" of the plot, maybe the length of the movie took critics to the bathroom and they missed an important part.

","I found this movie to be quite enjoyable and a very fitting way to end the series. I have to say, though, to counter those who wish to bash the movie for its ""confusing"" plot... I understood the plot perfectly, and although it is a bit tricky, I think it was meant to be that way, but you can still understand what's going on based upon who the characters are and what developments they make throughout the progression of the storyline. One has to really pay enough attention to what's going on in the story and recall what happened in the previous two movies, or the plot will seem to fall apart. The special effects were amazing too, and you really can't complain about that. Being over the top, as in falling off the edge of the world to rescue jack, is just part of the brilliance of the story. It is a fantasy piece after all. I don't think any pirate movie ever made actually reflects the truth about the real pirates of the caribbean."

Considering that I am a huge fan of the entire story I thought that it was simply brilliant. It has the same sense of adventure, humor, and excitement as the first two with a darker edge and interesting new characters. The overall plot of the movie is a little difficult to follow, so to anyone that has not seen it, I highly suggest re-watching the first two before hand. A few things that I loved about the movie were how you could see how each character had grown from the first one, the excellent special effects, and the way that the script incorporated jokes from the first two movies. Bottom line, if your a ""Pirtaes"" fan you wouldn't be disappointed, and even if you aren't, I would still give the movie a chance."

Yes it has complicated plot twists, it is more or less a rehash of the first two films as far as characters and special effects, and the acting was not inspirational, but boy was it fun to watch. As a movie, I guess it all depends on what your expectations are; we wanted to see Keith Richards, he was great and deserved to have more screen time, we wanted to see what happens with William Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley), we wanted to see pirates fighting on the high seas, and we wanted to see if Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) would be brought back to the realm of the living.

","And what it can give is nothing short of spectacular, in the most fantastic sense of the word.<br/><br/>'Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End', despite the petty accusations of an allegedly 'convoluted plot' (it's not confusing-just pay attention) and complaints over overly-fantastic situations (they really are overly-fantastic...wait, that's a good thing for fantasy movies) remains as a shining example of how the conclusion to a long-standing and beloved trilogy should be.<br/><br/>'Pirates' will fling you on a strange emotional thrill ride of humor, romance, action, macabre and tragedy while keeping you interested in the fate of the huge cast of lovable characters laid out in the previous installations in the trilogy and the awe-inspiring situations they find themselves in.<br/><br/>--A feat which few other summer sequels this year can boast to have accomplished, especially without relying on ridiculously idiotic visual presentation or ungodly plot holes which insult the intelligence of the movies' audiences (Shrek and Spider-Man, respectively) and going to ridiculously hideous ends to disassociate each 'final chapter' from its predecessors.<br/><br/>Granted, some may find the plot overbearing. If you're looking to relax and not think about anything while looking at pretty moving pictures for three hours, I strongly advise against Pirates.<br/><br/>But if you're looking for an engaging story that sends repeated chills down your spine, colorful characters who never let up, twists and betrayals at every corner, and all-out piraty fun, I recommend Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End.<br/><br/>Ignore the complaints (they're mostly uneducated).<br/><br/>Just...go see it.<br/><br/>It's really good."

The film is often a dark background film like the last.<br/><br/>This time, there is more plot & less county fair rides. Actually that is not bad as it helps to explain new characters & the plot is one which while it appears to not be a plot initially keeps the viewer engaged as it twists & turns its way through the movie. This installment is quite long, but it has to be. There is an opening sequence before the credits that is tied very loosely with the rest of the movie. Keira Knightley has less to do this film than the last one though she arouses interest early on.<br/><br/>There are some dandy sets & scenery throughout the film. The costume department at Disney has outdone itself again. Even the special effects are top notch. Johnny Depp is excellent as himself & him selves in different sequences. While he is not the entire film again as he was in the first installment of this series, there is plenty of Johnny to go around.<br/><br/>This film has plenty of action too & goes from a wedding to a funeral in a matter of a few minutes. It also leaves us an opening for an intriguing 4th film sequel which would not surprise me if it comes about as this one is sure to make another shipload of money. No one even walks the plank. The film has a secret ending, after the films credits. If you don't stay through the credits you miss something good. Overall this film is even better than the last one. <br/><br/>Yo Ho Ho & a bottle of rum, Captain Jack Sparrow comes back from World's End & we are happy he did.

","Everyone knows that third parts are never good. At least not as good as its predecors. At Worlds End is no exception. Don't get me wrong, I love pirates of the Caribbean. I love them because each movie adds very interesting stories, characters and situations that are both original and entertaining. At the end of dead man's chest I was so thrilled, Jack was dead, Barbossa was back, Elizabeth seemed to love Jack, Beckett had the hearth, Norrington was now a bad guy and Davy Jones was now under the control of the East India Trading Company. All this came to one question: What's next? I was so impatient to see the third part that I almost thought that world's end was even going to be better than Pirates 1 and 2 all combined. I was wrong.<br/><br/>Gore Verbinski did a brilliant job directing this film, the battles where much better than any of Pirates 1 or 2. The scene of the multiples Jacks was brilliant, but the crabs scene is even better. If you are not dying to see some action then I bet you will enjoy these scenes. The special effects where great, once again ILM did a masterpiece with Davy Jones and his crew and the final battle is impressive. Even I laugh more in Dead Man's Chest the humor in this one was really good, quite the top with the humor of Pirates 1. What disappoint me was that at the end only the Flying Dutchman and the Black Pearl fight, the other pirates act like if they were going to fight but finally they stayed behind and just watched. The scene where Calipso is freed from her human form is totally stupid and ridiculous. Anyway the direction was very good.<br/><br/>Ted Elliot and Terry Rossio did another heck of a ride with the script of pirates 3. Although there where many wholes like in any other pirate movie, the plot was interesting and capturing. Although the main story lost its originality, I mean: ""we must get ready for the final battle that will end all wars"" is a very used concept and I didn't expected to be used in a pirates movie. As much as I love the movie ending I must say that not all the characters had a fine ending. One of the most pathetic roles is Norrington. I really hated that he had no role in this movie. He just disappeared, and it was like ""ja! One down!"" His appearance was totally unnecessary. Tia Dalma's character develop is good until the half of the film where suddenly she looses her meaning when you are not quite sure what does she want and what is her point. She disappears, likes Norrington, and the writers just leave you with the question and no answer. Besides its many, many flaws the script has its originality and is entertaining. It is regular.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp once again returns as Captain Jack Sparrow and it seems you can never get tired of watching him. In this movie Jack Sparrow is too much. He talks too much, he does too many things and there are too many much of his. Nevertheless he is still charming and entertaining. The best performance in the film is Geoffrey Rush as Barbossa. He is excellent, even better than the first, he is like the bad Jack Sparrow, with its own originality. Jack and Barbossa will be enemies for ever. Orlando Bloom performance has not changed from the second film, the one that has changed its Keira Knightley, that girl just keeps better and better. In this film she is much more real and believable and she is not as dull as the second. All the actors show their quality in Pirates 3 specially Depp and Rush. If all the other aspects of the movie were bad, it would still be worth of checking it out, just to see how those two fight over the command of the Black Pearl. Very Good acting.<br/><br/>It is not as good as the first two, but it has fine ending and some amazing battles. It is a definitely yes for all fans and non-fans. 6.6"

Kira Knightly is great in this film, her role enlarges and along with it, the comedy and action that comes with here character. But by far, the one character I enticipated to see most was Barbossa. Barbossa was 10x better in this film than the first. It was great, hilarious, and much much more.<br/><br/>Together with everything that happened in this movie, by no doubt will there be people that bash it and say it was sucky for one reason or another. But one thing we all have to remember, is the story is not about us. THis movie was by far the best of 2007."

","Follow-up to the movie, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest, At World's End was a hit! The fighting scenes were fierce, the love scenes romantic, and it had the same great 'Pirates' humor we have grown to love! Although a few scenes were a bit far-fetched, such as Calypso growing to a 50-foot giant and diminishing into crabs, but nevertheless, it was surely a thrill.<br/><br/>Although the movie was nearly 3 hours long (plan bathroom breaks!), every second was interesting. It tied up everyones lives and every last question was answered..except for the famous 'What mark did Jack leave on Beckett?'.<br/><br/>Cameo role from Rolling Stone's, Keith Richards was absolutely amazing as well. Keith, playing Teague Sparrow (Jack's father!), was the holder of the pirates code. His character really looked like a hardcore, downright dangerous and fierce pirate. We can all tell now why Johnny based the character of Jack Sparrow on him.<br/><br/>The ending of 'At World's End' consists of some characters back at where they were at the beginning of 'Curse of the Black Pearl'. Elizabeth and Will, in love, but unable to be together, Jack sailing away on a dingy, and Barbossa off with Jack's ship, 'The Black Pearl'.<br/><br/>However, other characters die in this movie. One of them being Will, but is brought back by Jack taking his hand, giving him a knife, and having him stab the heart of Davy Jones. Davy then dies, but Will becomes immortal, and sails the seas, only being able to touch land but once every 10 years. With this, he will not be able to see his wife, Elizabeth but once a decade. But, Elizabeth stays loyal to him for those 10 years, and the curse was broken. Will was then able to live a normal life with his wife and his 10 year old son.<br/><br/>Other characters that die are Governor Swann, Sao Feng, Mercer, Beckett, and Norrington. We never see Governor Swann die, but all we know is that Beckett killed him. Sao Feng was shot by a cannonball and had a large piece of wood sticking out of his stomach. Mercer had gotten his face 'cleaned out' by Davy Jones when Davy attacked him with his tentacles. Beckett was so shocked in the final battle that the Dutchman and the Black Pearl teamed up against his ship, that he didn't speak and just savored his last few moments before he was blown off of his ship and into the water. And then Norrington, as he tried to be a good man again, and help Elizabeth escape, he was stabbed in the gut by Bootstrap Bill Turner.<br/><br/>Also, there's a new meaning to the phrase ""The kiss of death'. Elizabeth kissed Sao Feng, Norrington, Will, and Jack (Her kiss with Jack from the last movie). Each one of them ended up dieing. <br/><br/>There is really no way you can describe all of the fun at adventure in this movie! This does end with room to do a fourth 'Pirates'. We have heard that it will never happen, and we have heard a maybe. We'll just have to wait and see if Captain Jack will make another adventure!!"

","This next installment in the Pirates of the Caribbean series picks up where the 2nd part left of: Captain Jack has been swallowed by the Kraken, the war between government and pirates is growing harder by the day. The trailers tell much of what is about to happen: a confrontation between good and evil in the form of government and pirates. The rest is what is to be expected: a good sense of adventure, lots of things happening in all places at once, and all the actors of the previous parts coming back for another part to be played.<br/><br/>For me this third part was what I had expected from it: slightly worse than the 2nd, still better than the 1st. It was slightly weirder, somewhat less stable, but overall still a good lot of amusement and action.<br/><br/>8 out of 10 pirates sailing at the end of the world."

","I may be in the minority, but I still think that Curse of the Black Pearl was the best of all 3 Pirates of the Caribbean films. At World's End is an entertaining film, if a bit too long. Additionally, the main plot and various sub-plots are a bit too complicated for younger viewers to follow, bearing in mind this is a Disney production. Johnny Depp is again excellent as Jack Sparrow and the wonderful Geoffrey Rush is superb. I only wish that there were more scenes between these 2 characters as they compliment each other perfectly. The special effects are amazing, especially the battles at sea. I only wish that we could have seen a bit more of Jack Sparrow and may be a little more humour along with the special effects.<br/><br/>All in all, At World's End was a good film but I can't help feeling a bit disappointed. May be if it hadn't been made back to back with the second film, there may have been more time to perfect the script and reduce the length of the film."

","This movie really sucked. Sure the special effects were well done. The plot, dialog and most of the acting, however, were completely ridiculous. I felt real sorry for most of the theater-going world and wanted to run out about half-way through, but stuck with it because I thought maybe I was just in a bad mood and the seven other people I was with might be enjoying it.<br/><br/>Turns out all eight of us thought it was tedious, cheesy in a bad way, and just plain sucktastic.<br/><br/>This brings me to the question: Why do people give good reviews to this film. Are good visuals all you need? Are monkeys that make cute noises and Johnny Depp that makes cute noises all it takes for you to fall in love with a movie? Because aside from hearing the word ""fire!"" and a cannon going off every two minutes, a convoluted plot(?), and some effects, there was nothing much else to this movie.<br/><br/>Summary: It is lame.

","After Elizabeth, Will, and Captain Barbossa rescue Captain Jack Sparrow from the clutches of the Kraken, they must face their foes, Davey Jones and Lord Cutler Beckett. Beckett, now with control of Jones' heart, forms a dark alliance with him in order to rule the seas and wipe out the last of the Pirates. Now, Jack, Barbossa, Will, Elizabeth, Tia Delma, and crew must call the Pirate Lords from the four corners of the globe, including the infamous Sao Feng, to a gathering that will make their final stand against Beckett, Jones, Norrington, the Flying Dutchman, and the entire East India Trading Company.<br/><br/>I've watched the second film, almost forgetting the first film. I've then rewatched the first film, almost forgetting the second. Now I'm watching the third which remembering only the first film. Did that help me understand any part of this film?

Okay, well, I needed the internet's help to resolve all of this problem.<br/><br/>*10 minutes later* Okay, I get it now but I really think they should make it clearer for the audience. So, the beginning of the movie was a really good ""attention getter"" for the audience. You know how they say, if the people don't have fun, you don't? Well, my audience didn't laugh at some certain scenes, and they sounded bored. With that, I was very bored with this movie. In fact, number two could have been boring, but since the audience was actually getting into the movie, I was having fun with the second. So I'm being fair with this third movie.<br/><br/>I could let the boring scenes go away. There were some great action scenes in the film. In this film's third act, whenever you were bored throughout the movie, you could actually forgive it for being boring because in this act, it's really fun and filled with special effects and swashbuckling action!<br/><br/>I liked the weird acting by Johnny Depp. I also think, while not as good as Depp's, that Orlando Bloom's and Keira Knightley's acting were good, if not great. The special effects in this film is really great.<br/><br/>It depends if you'll enjoy this movie. If you have a great audience, you'll probably love this. If you have this boring audience, like I did, you'll be so bored but you'll forgive it for having its last hour really entertaining, although it's a bit too long."
"film_riot","5","1","3","28 May 2007"," Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End
","There happens so much in this film, but at the same time there happens nothing worth remembering. That's due to the fact that the conflicts are coming and going almost like nothing happens. Nothing leaves any traces on our main characters, everything is manageable, nothing is or seems impossible. As a result no tension whatsoever builds up. I didn't give a damn about any of the characters. In fact, ""Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End"" has the exact same problems than its predecessor ""Dead Man's Chest"". Effect, effects, effects, and a pinch of fun, that is all. The also not-so-great ""Spider-Man 3"" had at least likable characters, for which you rooted to make it. But here I often asked myself: What is the goal of all this fighting and why should I care? Who are these people? To conclude, I will just repeat a line I wrote about ""Dead Man's Chest"": It provides some entertainment at the moment you watch it, but that's it."
"DickNay","7","1","3","27 May 2007"," A (Disconnected) Heart, A (Missing) Brain, and a Little Dog, Too
","""At World's End"" opens with the stark image of a noose hanging limply, unoccupied, in a sunny breeze. At first this seemed a highly inappropriate image to impose on the viewers of this third (and possibly final) ""Pirates"" film. However, upon further thought, it seems Gore Verbinski, the helmer of all three films, has brought into the spotlight a theme shrouded in the background of the previous two films: hanging, gallows, and general death. In the first film, Jack Sparrow paddles by an area near the port, where a small clan of pirates (they are now skeletons) are hung, with a sign across all of them: PIRATES, YE BE WARNED. And since that, there have been encounters, and near interaction with the gallows and the nooses, but none have proved fatal just yet. In showing us the stark image of a noose, Mr. Verbinski also mentally prepares us for a heady film, full of swords, brine, and a surprising amount of pathos.<br/><br/>At the end of ""Dead Man's Chest"", Jack Sparrow dives into the awaiting mouth of the Kraken, sacrificing himself for his fellow pirates. We then learn that it is the mission and determination of Will Turner, Elizabeth Swan and the apparently-undead Captain Barbosa, to rescue Jack, and in doing so, the world. This is a brilliant set up for the next film, but it is not used in ""At World's End"" as well as it could have been. And the film's producers are not trying to convince you otherwise; in trailers for the film Jack Sparrow is heavily featured. This is understandable, as he is rescued (by his cohorts and by himself) within the first hour of the film, of which there are nearly three. From then on, it is the mission of Jack and his crew to find Davy Jones (the always-awesome Bill Nighy) and set his record straight with the man; however, it is Will's determination to free his father, Bootstrap Bill (Stellan Skarsgard) from Davy Jones' locker. Those are the two main plot lines, and they are constantly intertwined with the other more diminutive ones, like those involving the elusive East India Trading Company.<br/><br/>As was proved in the first two films, Mr. Verbinski has an adept hand with CGI effects; his combination of live-action photography and computer animation is seamless, to say the least. I mean, a major character's face is completely computer-rendered, and yet that character is the most emotionally readable of them all! However, Mr. Verbinski's talent is not equaled within the writing staff. Ted Elliot and Terry Rossio, who co-wrote the first film with two others, and co-wrote the second picture themselves have penned this most recent script, which is long, contrived, and generally unfunny. The plot takes the first hour of the film to really kick into gear (it is supported mostly by a long action sequence in Singapore to jumpstart the film) and even when it does start to move, the film always seems tired and deflated. The ""Pirates"" series has evolved much like the Kraken monster: in the second film, it was smooth, intense and supremely entertaining, and the third film is a dieing pile of skin and suckers lieing on an empty beach somewhere outside of Aruba; the breathtaking visuals are still intact, but, thanks to the actors and screenwriters, there is no spirit behind them, and the film is just a gaseous treatise, exhaling its final guttural moans, giving the world a few final toots of its horn, before its penultimate extinction."
"to_fathom","2","1","3","27 May 2007"," Absolutely worthless
","This movie was a total disappointment. The only reason I saw it was so I could witness any conclusion from that piece of crap sequel. This movie was so horribly contrived, I can't believe it's still being played. They over-complicate things to the point where you hardly believe this movie is targeting a young audience. (Does anybody, after seeing it, actually believe 10-15 year olds could possible follow along?) Besides the ridiculous confusing plot line, hardly a thing comes together in the end. All it was was a bunch of stupid made-up bribes. I didn't feel satisfied with a single character's individual journey (because nearly everybody had one.. and none of them resolved.) Horrible movie. I gave 2 stars only because the props were realistic."
"mrw8","5","1","3","27 May 2007"," Buy the Cliff notes first. More complicated than King Lear.
","an hour after watching this nearly three hour affair, my girlfriend and I are still trying to puzzle it out. Unfortunately, we would have to see the film at least three times to solve the puzzle. Is that what Disney wants? See this movie three times and eventually you will understand how Calypso, a heart, a monkey, a branded ""P"", a key, a storm, a map, Davy Jones, A boat, a first mate, a fake eye, bad teeth, dead people, living people, and everything else fit together. Because I can not understand what happened. By no means is this a finale. Nope. I expect at least one more sequel and definitely a prequel. They will drain this cash cow until it evaporates in the Caribbean sun. A spectacle? Oh, yes. Not since King Kong has there been such a spectacle. Visually it is jaw dropping. Just kindly forget that as a terrific battle takes place inside a hurricane the two armies just hang out and watch. What are they doing? Why did they show up? My head was spinning. I sympathize with the children in the audience who were the actual demo Disney targeted. There is not a chance in the world that those kids understood even 1/4 of the many different plots and sub plots. There were incredibly subtle touches of betrayal and back story that are neither resolved nor justified. They involve events that can only be explained in a flashback or in a 2.5 hour flashback called a prequel. If you take a ten minute conversation and set it in an exotic jail cell aboard a ship...you still have a ten minute conversation. I sensed the writers had modeled their approach after Indiana Jones Raiders of the Lost Arc. There is humor and a brazen attitude, heroics are matched by cowardice. Etc. But never in the three Indy films did two characters prattle on for ten, fifteen, twenty, thirty minutes about minute details of their past. In fact, one conversation that takes place in Pirates includes more dialog than THE ENTIRE INDY series! I love dialog, but when that dialog actually contains tiny clues and subtle hints of emotion and past sins, then it lifts me out of an ""action adventure"" film and plants me in...a ""drama"". Note to Jerry Bruckheimer: don't mix genres. I just don't know what market he was aiming for. No 13 year old is going to catch a sexual organ metaphor and no 30 year old is going to laugh at a monkey getting shot from a canon (though I did chuckle). I'll see the fourth and the fifth film when they arrive, but these writers need to learn the value of the delete button. If there were notes to this film then I want them. Maybe I'll understand what happened then."
"Igenlode Wordsmith","7","1","3","27 May 2007"," Better than before
","Good or bad, this was always going to be one of the biggest blockbusters of the year, just as its critically-decried predecessor did enormous business: the fans were going to see it anyway. I know, because I'm one of them.<br/><br/>And good or bad, it was never going to benefit from the sheer surprise factor of the original smash hit -- like it or not, ""Pirates"" is a franchise now, and the public knows what to expect. Bigger-better-badder: a sequel has nowhere to go but to up the ante, with more ships, more characters and more supernatural spookery.<br/><br/>The good news is -- this time round, it works, more or less.<br/><br/>Ten minutes in, and I was thinking 'they've blown it again'; flashy camera-work, showy stunts, suspect history, pieces of eight -- but not an ounce of magic. The film appeared to be going through the motions of a standard Hollywood blockbuster, but it was just too crowded, loud and perfunctory to raise a smile, let alone to raise hearts.<br/><br/>Cut to desolation. Cut to empty salt. Cut to one man -- however many of him there are -- and with room to expand and to breathe, the film finally finds its feet, and its salvation. I suppose I shouldn't have been surprised; after all, the first film was little more than historical pastiche.... until it hit upon Captain Jack Sparrow.<br/><br/>Jack's back, and this time the writers seem to have got a grip on what makes the character effective. In ""Dead Man's Chest"", too often he came across as a caricature, trying too hard to recapture the accidental appeal of the first film. Here, by luck or judgement, he pulls it off as of old. Playing it solo in his first scene here -- given time for action, reaction and disgusted response -- Johnny Depp turns in one of the best sequences in the whole film.<br/><br/>Escalation is always a risky business, and ""At World's End"" undoubtedly suffers from too much plot. (Ironically, it also has large holes; Cutler Beckett remains a cipher throughout, with no clue as to his history and actions save his apparent incarnation of ""good business"". His end is as blank and unexplained as his origins.) However, the film gets away with escalating its supernatural element still further, with a trip past the end of the world and the invocation of the goddess who first set Davy Jones on his grisly path. It even manages to establish Elizabeth Swann in an improbable ascendancy via a series of plausible explanations, rather than by straining the feminist superhero line too far -- although I still find her sudden acquisition of two-handed swordsmanship from the second film a trifle hard to swallow! Unlike its immediate predecessor, the picture generally avoids the gratuitous set-piece sequences that produced the impression that we were watching the game of the film: no pirate kebab, three-way duel or water-wheel balancing here. There is some rather over-the-top flying around the rigging, but at least there's some swashbuckling precedent to that -- although not quite to this (computer-generated?) extreme...<br/><br/>The body-count is lavish, mainly of the usual anonymous extras of whom every ship seems to carry an enormous number... but named characters are not immune either, and the film isn't afraid to deliver one or two real jolts which considerably raise its impact. About halfway through we think we know what's going to happen (it's been pretty plainly telegraphed, and neatly ties up the ends): well, it doesn't.<br/><br/>This film isn't as confused as ""Dead Man's Chest"" and I'd say that it has better dialogue, although most of the resonant lines go to Barbossa and Tia Dalma. Due to the vast cast list (frankly, too large) most of the characters get relatively little time on-screen, their motivations being assumed to have been set up in the previous film; and since most of the motivation-setting was fairly turgid stuff, this is an improvement. The major disappointment is Keira Knightley, who has a fairly major role and produces a number of dismally flat line readings at various points in the process: her hoydenish Elizabeth in the first film was more credible than her pirate part here.<br/><br/>Overall, I think this was a project too ambitious, and if there are more spin-offs to come, as I dare say there will be, the producers would do well to learn the lesson and stick to one treasure, one curse, and one adversary at a time. It's a pity this film can't stand on its own without its disappointing second instalment. But there's still fun to be had amid the apocalyptic pretensions -- it could have been very much worse."

"MaxBorg89","6","1","3","27 May 2007"," Captain Jack leaves with style... Yo ho!
","So, this is it: another massively popular blockbuster franchise reaches its conclusion. After Spider-Man and Shrek, it is time to say goodbye to Pirates of the Caribbean (and Jason Bourne will follow in a few months), although, like many other number 3s, At World's End vaguely suggests a fourth movie would not be impossible to make (and we will see what Bruckheimer thinks about it once the cash starts rolling in). Still, should this be the last Pirates, it isn't a bad epilogue, though not a truly brilliant one either.<br/><br/>Picking up about a month after the events of Dead Man's Chest, the third episode opens on a surprisingly dark note: with Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) ""dead"" (actually, he's stuck in some sort of Purgatory) and Davy Jones (Bill Nighy) working for Lord Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander), piracy is facing extinction, as shown in the prologue, where dozens of people, including a young boy, are hung without a fair trial. All hope is not lost, though, as a small group of rebels, led by Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) and Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) is reuniting pirate leaders from all over the world to come up with a plan to get back their control over the sea. The only problem is, one player is missing: time to bring Jack back...<br/><br/>That is when the film really starts: no offense to the rest of the cast, but POTC's success depends entirely on Johnny Depp, and so it is slightly frustrating to have to wait half an hour for his entrance. But once he arrives, it was completely worth the wait: adding new nuances and quirks to the character, Depp is shamelessly entertaining from start to finish, whether he is talking to himself (the ""multiple Jacks"" scenes are hilarious) or interacting with others (especially Rush and Knightley). His charisma is what keeps the movie on track, especially in the third act, where it is all too obvious writers Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio finished the script when filming had already begun: some inconsistencies are given a rushed (and a little pompous) explanation (e.g. how come Jack's resurrection was much more complicated than Barbossa's ?), others are not explained at all, and while it is a joy to see the balance between action (Black Pearl vs. Flying Dutchman: a visual treat) and laughs (the two moronic soldiers from the first film finally return after an inexplicable absence in Dead Man's Chest, and Keith Richards' cameo is comedy gold as expected) is intact, the story's complexity seems to slip out of control in places, probably because unlike Sam Raimi, who constructed the similarly flawed Spider-Man 3 starting from elements he had introduced in the first two films, the writing duo behind Pirates created a huge mythology almost separately from the first installment. Whereas Curse of the Black Pearl featured only one ambiguous character (Captain Sparrow) in an otherwise linear series of events, this time everyone betrays everyone, making At World's End move from twist to twist, even after the climactic showdown, providing an extra fifteen minutes (and the entire film lasts almost three hours) that are, for the most part, skippable.<br/><br/>And yet I liked the movie, and I am willing to forgive those missteps. Why? Because at the end of this overblown, but spectacular and tremendously fun ride, everyone realizes what Pirates of the Caribbean was about in the first place: the trilogy started with Jack, and it ends (?) with Jack. And that, my friends, is good enough to justify the excessive running time.<br/><br/>6,5/10"

This is not a movie for those who are not willing to keep their minds open for thinking because I found myself laughing at things that no one else in the theater laughed at because it flew right over their heads. Character development was begun in the first 2 Pirate movies, and this one completes the process, giving insights into the thought process of the well known characters, and introducing some well known actors to aid in the process.

Written in what seems like a different movie series altogether, this movie makes no sense. You feel as if you have come into the end of the trilogy without seeing the first two, because this movie is almost impossible to follow. They take themselves a bit too seriously, having none of the fun laughs offered by the first two. I did laugh out loud a couple of times, but I'm not sure if that was necessarily a good thing. Jack Sparrow seems to have lost the charisma that the first one had so strongly, and feels almost like a character from Ghost Rider. Although this movie is too long, and progressively gets worse as the hours pass by, the ending does try to save itself. Cool final battle and an entertaining last portion, with some things that make you laugh, I give this movie a 5 star."

In some parts of the movie, it was cheesy, maybe meant for comic relief for kids, but thats OK, cause the rest of the movie was great.<br/><br/>On top of the storyline, there was more then enough special effects to make you want to continue watching this movie. Add some sounds and music to this movie, and it made the movie better.<br/><br/>Acting was nothing special of course, Depp will always be Depp and he is a good actor. And Orlando? lets face he, he will be forever be branded an elf. Kiera was nice eye candy.<br/><br/>all and all i had a great time, definite worth a 10 to me, only second to lord of the rings, return of the king."
"vanoverdj","9","1","3","26 May 2007"," Good acting saves confusing plot
","Depp, Bloom, Knightley, et al, are, if anything, better this time around. Even though it is about 20-30 minutes too long and has a somewhat confusing plot line, the biggest criticism I have of the film is the overuse, in my opinion, of CGI. You know, there is a time for an action sequence in this film, several times over, but just because you can do something with the computer does not mean you have to. As one example, the scene with Lord Beckett on the Endeavor near the end of the film is way overdone. The director seems thrilled with what effects can be achieved, and he uses them even where the context of the film could be, in my view, better served without the obviously computer generated effects. But, other than that, a very enjoyable film. In fact, I saw it a second time and was more impressed the second time around."
"davidsterngold-1","3","1","3","26 May 2007"," Am i missing something?
","I thought, after viewing Spiderman 3 last week, that I had seen the very pinnacle of melodramatic, ridiculous, un-inspired movies.<br/><br/>Pirates 3 proved me wrong.<br/><br/>Goofy plot twists, hackneyed humor, and utterly silly special effects abound. The ""story"" of the film is so convoluted that far before the film has reached its ""epic"" conclusion, we stop caring entirely. ""Lets see how many plot twists we can cram into a movie"", we can hear the writers whisper deviously to one another. ""No"" says the director, ""lets see how many slimy, creaky, dripping props/characters we can blow up"". The characters, who were actually quite well-drawn and fun in the first film, are completely lost in the chaos. Depp manages to be the only one who truly stands out, a nod to his fine skills as an actor, rather than any witty dialogue or inventive character interaction.<br/><br/>But, ultimately, what really gets you is just how preposterous the whole thing is made out to be. At one point, Kiera Knightly and Will Turner turn to each other in the middle of heated combat to exchange wedding vows, slaying countless numbers of evildoers, while Geoffrey Rush barks out unintelligible nonsense that we suppose means something to the effect of ""you are married"".<br/><br/>In another scene, Depp and Knightly swoosh safely away from a wrecking ship on what appears to be a thatched parachute.<br/><br/>A monkey is shot out of a cannon.<br/><br/>The dialogue, especially a rousing speech given by Knightly near the end, made me cringe. The writers/director use every single worn out, exaggerated, asinine phrase all writers/directors usually dread of using.<br/><br/>And oh my god! The ""fight for freedom"" scene! Ah! I covered my eyes and sunk low in my seat so as to avoid the popcorn i felt sure would be flying at the screen. They are pirates for god's sake! Freaking PIRATES! In Spiderman 3, our webbed friend glides over buildings only to be suddenly and spectacularly framed by a big, billowing American Flag. In Pirates of the Caribbean 3, Kiera Knightly gives the good ole' ready em up speech, persuading her ragged, ""cut-throat"" band of pirates to fight, essentially for no definable reason, under the honest to god, not-even-poking-fun-at-itself-even-in-the-least pretext of ""We fight for freedom!"" Anyone disagreeing with the my opinion on the utter movie-making sophmorishness of this film must first somehow justify this scene. It is--and I say this only because this is the only strong word meaning ""stupid"" i've yet to use in this review--completely retarded. <br/><br/>I am being overly harsh. To be honest, the movie is entertaining, if for all the wrong reasons. Go to see this film if you enjoy a good laugh at some silly dialogue, or if you like to see nicely designed sets blow up, or if you enjoy looking at kiera knightly.<br/><br/>Just don't see it for the sake of watching a good movie. You will find yourself thinking, as I did at many points in Spiderman 3, ""What were they doing?""<br/><br/>Making a hugely successful film, unfortunately."

","Dear oh dear. 168 minutes was an hour too long. There were far too many plot lines, far too many plodding, irrelevant scenes and the end result was a confusing, drawn-out mess. Yes, it had things to recommend it - the finale was exciting, Geoffrey Rush was terrific, Depp was, well, Depp and the film looked fantastic.<br/><br/>But I was disappointed. No way should this movie have been three hours. When I saw it the kids in the cinema grew restless very quickly and some parents had to take their kids out early. Nearly three hours for a family movie? What on earth were they thinking of? As well as the afore-mentioned many, many plots, I have to say that Bloom and Knightley's performances left me cold. I found myself shrugging my shoulders over their romance and Knightley's rallying speech, intended no doubt to be inspiring and moving, was laughable.<br/><br/>The next one should be a much shorter, uncomplicated romp. I don't mean dumb it down - just don't stuff it so full of plot it has to be this gargantuan length.

","Most important: I took a nap for about 30 minutes in the middle of this movie, and it was the perfect length.<br/><br/>Storyline not as good as I, cheap jokes don't work as well as in II. Depp is good, Kiera Knightley useless because she gets too much screen time, plus she doesn't ever look very hot. Orlando Bloom is confused and confusing. Finale disappointing, ending is confused. Action disappointing (way too OTT, and not in a fun way like the spinning wheel in II). Also whatever military strategy is involved is hopeless, but I suppose that is to be expected. Locations and foreigners all a bit pointless. Too much talk of ""true love"" and ""freedom"" as a way to pad length. Secondary characters also get way too much screen time, revealing their flatness.<br/><br/>However, many moments are stirring (beginning is wild) and Pirates remains a fantastic franchise.

The movie is so long people fell asleep, mainly kids and oldies. Also to note, POTC:3 has so many twist turns and death in it you really just don't give a it who dies and makes the film somewhat more confusing with its unhighly detailed subplots and references to the past that we never saw. Acting in this film is getting old, Depp has a great character and after this film you just get tired of him. The ending is an ending. The beginning is a middle or a half made future from which the film never points out how long. Fights and special effects are done nicely and the film's score is'nt that bad but its nothing new. There is some nice comic-relief in the film that is'nt the smartest but will get you chuckling. POTC:3 is a film that gets tired fast, has a almost never ending plot twists, mediocre acting, some nice visuals that altogether make a film that is passable at the lowest level."
"jaddison383","6","1","3","27 May 2007"," Pirate movies are hard to hate...
","In the third and final chapter of what is quite possibly the most popular movie series of all time, we find Will and Elizabeth Turner on a voyage to rescue Captain Jack Sparrow from Davy Jones Locker. Once that is over, the entire movie is taken over by a theme never as strong in the series as now- Every man for himself. Every main character in this film has his/her own agenda and will stop at nothing to reach their goal. By the climactic scene, you don't know what the heck's going on. One of the funniest scenes is right after they rescue Jack: Will, Elizabeth, Barbosa, and Jack all instantly point their guns at each other. After a moment, they laugh and let them down- then they all aim at each other suspiciously once more. In this simple scene, we find the heart of the movie.<br/><br/>Everyone is back for this final installment. Orlando Bloom plays a rather selfish Will Turner. Kiera Knightly plays a much more stand out of an Elizabeth. Then of course, there's the infallible Geoffrey Rush as Barbosa, and the now-legendary performance of Jack Sparrow by Johnny Depp. Bill Nighy, Naomie Harris, and Kevin McNally all contribute nicely as well. Truly, the cast is never a problem at all. This films main problem is that it is so damn confusing! Throughout, there are about twelve hundred different stories involved, and by the end we just have to assume that it is all resolved. We can't really tell what exactly happened.<br/><br/>But....<br/><br/>The movie does not fail for this. It's hard to dislike the movie, for the same reason (in my opinion) that the series has been saved all along: It's a pirates movie with probably the best actor's who could possibly bring it to screen. What more do you want? It's the kind of fun film-making that in this day and age has mostly disappeared from the theaters. So, despite plot holes galore, hard to follow story lines, and more, we still like this movie. And we'll still continue to like it. There's probably not too much they could have done to make people dislike this movie. Honestly, I enjoy loving it for no real reason. They're just fun to watch! So, the Pirates of the Caribbean comes to an end with a final film that stays true what has been the creedo of the films all along: We're here to have fun. That's why we love these movies. 7/10 stars!<br/><br/>Jay Addison"
"toetie84","9","1","3","26 May 2007"," Aye mates! A pirate's life for me ...
","*May contain spoilers!* I looked forward to seeing Pirates 3 ever since I saw Pirates 2, which was slightly disappointing. After Pirates 2, my hopes weren't up too high, and this might just have been the right attitude towards this movie: don't expect too much and you'll be surprised in many ways.<br/><br/>Firstly, the special effects were amazing. I was stunned by the final battle scene. Secondly, I didn't think the movie was too long and too slow. Just like the characters, the audience is gradually getting ready for the final and ultimate battle. The characters have to be patient, the audience is expected to be so as well. Thirdly, it was great to have all the characters reunited. This movie made me realize how much Barbossa was missed in the second movie (Let's admit that Geoffrey Rush is playing one of his best parts ever!). Finally, I don't think the audience was bored. There are so many things in this movie that you don't have the time to get bored: humor (the audience was very enthusiastic), adventure, amazing special effects, love and romance, betrayal (everyone has a hidden agenda), great costumes, old characters, new characters and so on.<br/><br/>Pirates of the Caribbean got a worthy end. I think most of the questions the audience had after the second movie were answered. It was especially nice to see the changes the characters had gone through. I was especially pleased with Will's development: he annoyed me in the first to movies, but now he steps up and finally shows what he's worth. Jack, who didn't care about anyone but himself, learned what it is to look after someone else.<br/><br/>I had a big smile on my face after the movie ended, and the other people in the audience were smiling as well. Most of them even applauded when the credits were on, which is not usually done in Belgium. We are known to be one of the most critical audiences in the world  we're hard to please  but Pirates 3 even convinced the skeptics in the audience  Don't miss it..."

"Chalice_Of_Evil","6","1","3","25 May 2007"," This is not a musical...
","Though you'd be forgiven for thinking it is, given all the singing that goes on at the start of the film. An off-key kid starts singing, then everyone else who're about to be hanged suddenly burst into song. It was a far less funnier version of the 'Always Look On The Bright Side Of Life' crucifixion scene from Monty Python's Life of Brian. Lots of hanging, though. If you enjoy watching people get hanged...then this is the film for you. We're then treated to the much lovelier Elizabeth singing in her boat (she can actually sing *on* key), as she meets up with Barbossa to go confront Capt. Sao Feng (Chow Yun Fat - who doesn't exactly add much to the movie). Keira Knightley, meanwhile, is one of the few bright spots in this otherwise lacklustre film. She's especially funny in a scene at the beginning where she has to check all her weapons at the door, and she pulls a giant pistol from...somewhere. Her character's just gotten better and better with each film (especially when it comes to the action/comedic side of things). Will Turner, however, has been rather limp throughout the movies, and so it should come as no surprise that his screen time is reduced in this film. He only becomes somewhat interesting by the very end.<br/><br/>But enough about those two. What about Capt. Jack? Well...it takes a while before we get to him, and I must say that his entrance this time around pales in comparison to his entrances in the previous two films. There's a lot more of him in this film than the previous two, but herein lies this movie's flaw: Thinking that *more* Jack Sparrow automatically equals a BETTER movie. Now, I think it would be hard to find anyone who doesn't like his character, but when you've got umpteen clones of him running around on screen (plus a version of him that looks like Will's dad), then perhaps you've gone just a tad overboard. Jack's scene in Davy Jones's locker was...nonsensical, to say the least. Rock crabs that can move a ship? Jack clones (one being a Jack who clucks/thinks he's a chicken/lays eggs, while another looks to be getting cozy with a goat)? Yeah, not many people at my cinema really knew what to make of all that. It especially got silly when we saw two little Jack Sparrows hanging off regular Jack's dreadlocks and whispering into his ears. None of it was funny, it was just stupid (as was Jack and Barbossa arguing like an old married couple/their lame telescope visual gags). Tia Dalma's role is increased as well, and she proves to be more important to the film's storyline than we may have first thought, but she too descends into silliness when she grows HUGE, then explodes into thousands of crabs.<br/><br/>As for ol' squid-beard, Davy Jones winds up being Cutler Beckett's bitch in this film, which is sad to see. Also sad is learning the fate of the Kraken - Beckett ordered Jones to kill his ""pet"", and we're later treated to the horrible sight of the dead Kraken washed up on a beach with Pintel and Ragetti standing atop it like a prize kill (as if I didn't hate them enough already). Bill Nighy gets less screen time than he did previously, but at least you get to see Jones in human form. Meanwhile, Keith Richards makes a very brief, but memorable, cameo as Jack's dad. Fans of Norrington will be disappointed with his demise at the hands of Bootstrap Bill (as if Will's dad wasn't unlikeable enough). Norrington and Elizabeth's father are both wasted in this movie. Beckett meets his end in a laughably over-the-top slow-mo sequence, where all I could do was wonder, ""How is he not getting hit in the head by all flying debris exploding around him?"".<br/><br/>This film is WAY overlong, with far too much going on. The so-called ""plot"" is a muddled mess, it's hard to keep track of who's on whose side/who is betraying who. A lot of time wasted on stuff that could've been left out, and the build-up (with all the different pirates coming together) kind of amounts to nothing/is anticlimactic. As you'd expect, there are some standout action sequences (such as the maelstrom at the end), as well as a few select bits of gruesomeness (look out for the death-by-squid-beard scene especially. This is easily the darkest of the three films, with the earlier mentioned mass hanging, gaping bullet holes in people's foreheads, toes breaking off due to frostbite, faces bitten by eels, impaling, etc). However, it all ends up being far too much for one movie. The writers don't seem to understand that quality matters more than quantity. I find myself enjoying/appreciating Dead Man's Chest a lot more than I originally did (when compared with At World's End).<br/><br/>The extra scene at the end, by the way, is much more significant than the scenes at the end of the credits for the last two films (ie. monkey stealing treasure and dog being worshipped by cannibals). The scene at the end of this film actually has a point, and was a nice little add-on. It's worth sticking around to see, if you have the time/patience/don't already have a headache and simply wish to escape the cinema.<br/><br/>Overall, the first film was a surprise success, the second film - while unnecessary - did in fact prove to be entertaining, but this third one is just too much. You're better off pretending it didn't happen and instead coming up with your own conclusion to the series."

Throughout the entire thing I was left wondering what was going to happen next and how they would get themselves out of this situation. It had the same great humor that was in the first two, but not to much. This movie was everything that the Pirates movies have come to be. It is so much fun and you fall in love with the characters. Each character, no matter how small was important. Really just a great movie. I think this was the best out of all three, and even though Orlando and Kiera may not do anymore, we can bet that anything with Jack Sparrow would not be boring. All in all I thought this was a great was to start off the summer movie season. I prefer not think about Spiderman 3. This was the movie to kick off the summer blockbusters.

"adastrame","4","1","3","25 May 2007"," A Tragedy At Sea
","I've been a fan of the Disney ride since 1996, so I was all the more excited when I saw the first movie in 2003. I absolutely loved it, it was a solid, spirited story and great escapism. But now imagine the writers - you have a great hit movie, the people are screaming for more, so what do you do? Throw all the characters from the first movie in a pot, add some new ones, hell even bring some back from the dead, flavor it with lots and lots and lots of action and fantasy, stir a few times, and boom, there's your story! Does it have to make sense? I guess not.<br/><br/>The second and the third movies can't live up to the first. Their story lines are heartless and wobbly as Jack's brain. They both might visually be mind blowing and make you feel like you're a pirate in the Caribbean yourself, but story wise they are just confusing. I had a very small headache when I entered the theater and a really big headache when I left.<br/><br/>The character developments are more than questionable - they change their opinion by the minute and you never know who is on who's side, it's incomprehensible what their motivations are. The extra portion of epic love just didn't fit into this movie, nor did the sudden change of heart in a battle scene, of which we do not even know what the meaning of it was, just as we don't know why other certain things happened. Allover I can't even put my confusion about the plot into words. It's way too much to absorb and it'll just be confusing to think about it any longer.<br/><br/>The one scene I enjoyed the most was when the screen went all black and you could hear far away singing and rattling and a voice slowly saying ""Dead Men Tell No Tales"" - those were original sounds from the Disney ride, and I felt just like I was in there again. It had such a great atmosphere, even the air in there is unforgettable. And then the screen went white.<br/><br/>The third movie is deeply melancholic from the first to the last scene - despite all action. The ending leaves the audience frustrated and discontented. The scene after the credits seems to close the trilogy - which is a good thing, because nothing will ever live up to The Curse of the Black Pearl."

","I refuse to divulge the plot. That said, every ""T"" was crossed and every ""I"" dotted from plots of Pirates 1 and 2. ""POC: At World's End"" draws together the loose threads remaining from #1 and 2 and knits them into a plausible conclusion. Good writing, guys! Certainly, if the business is good and the project has legs, the door is open for a fourth, one would hope. Mullroy and Murrtog are back and as delightful as before. Many of the pieces that worked in 1 are used again in 3. If audience reaction is any indication, the two groups I sat with last night loved them. PLEASE sit through the credits for the tease footage at the very end of the film (That's why I suggest NOT getting the large drink.). There is one on this POC as well.<br/><br/>Because our AMC theater was sold out, I saw the movie in a different theater complex. The sound was muddied in a few places and dialects are strong (English accents, Tia Dalma's Caribbean-type accent)and with wind/rain effect noise on top of lines and audience reactions, some dialog goes missing--a good excuse to watch the film again in another venue with a quieter house.<br/><br/>Parents--and this is as much of a spoiler as I will give--you are cautioned about two scenes: One is a rather graphic extreme close up shot of someone being dispatched by Davy Jones which drew groans from college-aged folks and there is a near-explicit romantic scene at another point that had me saying, ""This is a Disney film..."" It did not push the barriers, just came close; and given today's hip kids with their overexposure to the world and tech savvy, I'm probably an old prude.<br/><br/>Overall, good work by all hands on and off screen. Lots more buckle than swash. Might have wished a few more feet back on the camera work on the fight sequences with Will, Jack, Elizabeth, etc., but I like to watch the choreography of things coming, going, flowing. Seemed more intense and rushed and out-of-focus somewhat with the tighter camera placement; may have been the theater projection as well. Another reason to watch again.<br/><br/>I particularly enjoyed the scene with Will and Elizabeth where they put their foreheads (third eyes)together. Aha! Who thought of that? Beautiful touch. Words were totally unnecessary between the two. Perfect. Sit back, reflect, Mr. Bloom. You have earned the privilege.<br/><br/>Captain Jack is back as only Jack can be, thanks to the multi-talented Johnny Depp. There are so many unique character bits with deft comedic timing. Truly a great talent. Mr. Depp makes it look effortless. He wears the skin of Capt. Jack with ease. Finally, we get to see Keith Richards as Jack's father. Not to be forgotten, the animals and their handlers are truly amazing. The animal characters are truly a part of POC3. Great fun, all.<br/><br/>Not to be missed are the oblique references to currently global situations/politics. Love it when a period piece can comment on current events--even if poking fun at them. Between drought, fires, war, terror--we need some pirates and laughter. <br/><br/>Mr. Bruckheimer, I believe you have another blue ribbon entry. The hard work and talents of all make for one wild, enjoyable 3-hour ride away from our current problems. Thank you!"

","Before I get going let me just say that I would not have voted this movie a 1 if it weren't for the horrifically high rating it currently has. Surely it deserves at least a 2.<br/><br/>To say this movie has plot holes would be to imply that originally someone intended it to have cohesion. It feels like this movie was made using every idea anyone ever considered a possibility for a story. In the midst of trying to wrap your head around a barrage of plot lines that you will never understand, more are constantly added to the mix.<br/><br/>This movie falls victim to the infamous recipe for a sucky sequel. Take a movie that was never intended to have a sequel. Then take all the jokes from the first movie and repeat them, changing the person who is saying them if necessary. Spend all the time effort and money you spent developing and original and interesting screenplay and use it all on special effects. Done and done. I am so glad I got into this for free, I hate donating my money to reinforce this kind of movie making.<br/><br/>In closing: This movie makes following the plot of ""Memento"" seem like following that of a Muppet's movie.

There were definitely some hilarious moments and cool fight scenes, but overall I think I was disappointed by this movie. <br/><br/>Johnny Depp was brilliant as always; Orlando Bloom was poor as always; and Keira Knightley was Keira Knightley, as always. The Keith Richards Cameo was definitely the coolest part of the movie. <br/><br/>I just was not fond of this plot, thought they cut corners. The resolution wasn't satisfying either. <br/><br/>I think they found the Cracken dead on the beach just so they wouldn't have to explain it's absence on the ocean. <br/><br/>Not that the first movie's plot was plausible or realistic, but these last two just seemed sort of ridiculous. <br/><br/>I guess I can just never be satisfied with anything less than the quality of Curse of the Black Pearl, it was just so damn good!"

"Jo_the_film_junkie","7","1","3","24 May 2007"," Not only the final act of a trilogy, but a homage to the first film too
","Why do people go into sequels? Well, because they know what to expect, and they want more of it. So obviously, as you make a sequel to a very successful and popular movie you are forced to up the ante. The first Pirates was a stand-alone movie with an open ending, but it was somehow finished. Bad guys gone, the curse lifted from the Pearl and Sparrow on the loose again, that was it. Now since Pirates wasn't a classic pirate adventure but a fantasy pirate film with a lot of yarn and legend come to life with undead pirates and all, it all had to be more spectacular in Pirates 2 and even more so in Pirates 3. And to make these two come together they ended in a cliffhanger where one of the major characters has to be saved in the last part. There are too many parallels with the original StarWars to go into (main character ""dies"" at end of film two, rescue mission, two opposing fleets in final battle...). Anyway, the fantasy elements clearly got stronger in films 2 and 3 than they were in the first. It is still enjoyable and visually impressive on a big screen, but things like the 3-people fight in the wheel in Pirates 2 and the (HEAVY SPOILER) maelstrom fight between Pearl and Dutchman are too over-the-top and reminiscent of theme park rides, which is not surprising what with Pirates being based on one anyway. No question, the CGI carry a lot of the film, while the complex and intertwined plot with everybody crossing and double-crossing everyone is a bit confusing and you are surprised about the changes in character. Jack is the only reliable of the whole bunch of back-stabbers, because as a dishonest man can of course he can be trusted to be dishonest, and so his betrayals are not really surprising anyone. His, or rather Johnny Depp's performances are again the driving force of the movie. I don't know exactly how to call these sequences, but let's say his afterlife schizophrenic hallucinations, when he talks to his other sub-identities, at one point commands and crews a ship just by his very own selves, are the most hilarious scenes. Jack is best when interacting with the other characters, especially Rush's Barbossa with whom he squabbles constantly over the Pearl's command including some hilarious 'mine's-longer-than-yours' references. And Jack meeting his parents (yes, both of them, in a manner of speaking) is also not to miss. Verbinski also tries to tie all three films closer together, not only by unraveling some of the mysteries spun in Pirates 2, but also by paying homage to the other two movies, especially the first one. There's the rum that is always gone, the sea turtle story, and Jack's two slapping strumpets. This time even the two redcoats guarding the Interceptor in the first film are back. But there's more, Verbinski quotes himself repeatedly. The film starts and finishes on a song, and Captain Jack once again rides into view in one scene standing on top of the mast (only this time it is really a ship not just a boat, oh and the ship doesn't ride on the crest of a wave but on a crest of crabs...through the desert). Even though the film is really exciting and enjoyable to watch, it has a very major flaw in terms of picturing the villains. I don't mean Davy Jones, despite his vessel's submarine capabilities and his organ-playing which remind me of Captain Nemo. But what about the East India Trading Company that makes all pirates' timbers shiver, and who have control over Davy Jones? Well, at the start of the film Lord Beckett is shown as introducing a terror regime at Port Royal that is casting him as an earlier version of Robbespierre, possibly to make the pirates seem more humane (freedom-loving, code of honour...). If Beckett and co. are so tough why do they leave all the work to the Dutchman (HEAVY SPOILER) and why does their vastly superior fleet not engage the pirate brethren? Why doesn't Beckett fire a single shot? Generally, what is really missing from this film is that battle of the two fleets which from the trailer I was somehow anticipating. There is only one time we see the pirates from all the corners of the world fight, and that is in the council chamber among themselves. Apart from Sao Feng, they were a mere footnote to the whole film. That it all boils down to a duel between Pearl and Dutchman instead of an epic battle with dozens of ships is a bit pathetic. That would have been the proper sending off for the trilogy. The missing of this battle was one of the things that just weren't predictable. Neither were some of the twists and Turns in the movie, especially the final one, but others simply had it coming, such as the already-mentioned references to the previous films. Finally, the big parallel to the first movie is that again the trilogy is now finished within itself (like Star Wars), but it is still open ended. Johnny Depp has repeatedly said he still would love to play the character again, and the map Sparrow has at the end of the film leaves many magical places still to explore, but I don't think this is going to happen in the immediate future. Maybe a number of years down the road, but not right away. I would see them too, as long as Jack's on board. I would also see this one a second time on the big screen, and for fans of the series and Captain Jack it is a must-see, despite the things that I pointed out ...hmm-hm-hm,...and really bad eggs... drink up me hearties, joho"

","The problem with this film  and it's a big one  is the script.<br/><br/>It looks great and the cast is generally good to excellent. But the script The film is made up of scenes that should either have been cut by a third or cut out all together. The dialogue labours heavily over a ""who cares"" and extremely convoluted so-called plot and it just goes on and on and on with barely three actual jokes to brighten its running time of over three hours.<br/><br/>In the hands of a nimble and witty script writer there's no way this film would have clocked in at three hours and it certainly would have been a much, much better movie. As it is, its exhausting and dull length is the result of very poor story telling pure and simple, creakily papered over by special effects and big bucks.<br/><br/>I would challenge anyone at any given minute in this movie, to explain what's going on and why. And I mean that from the very first scene which has no plot connection with the rest of the film at all. And of course, characters are constantly doing things to get the movie to the next scene rather than because it makes sense for them to do it.<br/><br/>My score of three is for the effects and the cast. The actual movie is a woeful waste of time and resources."

","As a lover of the first, i was seriously disappointed. CGI effects were very impressive, but the pointless, dull and contrived story combined with the horrible length made for a boring waste of on-screen talent. Not enough action scenes and pointless dialogue explaining things that didn't matter historically and don't lead anywhere. I can't believe in the high budget and production that such a thing as story telling can be lost. Script writing too seems to be a thing of the past. Additionally all the CSI type shows and movies Jerry Brockheimer has been involved with, very few would he be proud of.

","I just wasted 3 hours of my life watching this movie. The story line was confusing. It is way to long. If you are going to make a 3hr long movie at least make it good. After all the build up I was very disappointed. Unless you are a die hard Pirates of the Caribbean fan don't bother, you will find it very long and boring. It does however have some good special effects. Maybe I did not like it because I don't relate to any of the characters. If you are going to watch it be prepared to watch it again and again otherwise you are just wasting your time. I hope they don't make a sequel. They should leave it as a trilogy, a rubbish trilogy."

","Where to begin? If you like movies that make no sense, have awkward moments that make you ask what you're doing seeing this movie, and are incredibly too long...then this is the movie for you! The film could have been an hour and a half shorter. The plot was ridiculous. The acting, except maybe for Depp, was horrible. This was a great example of how to turn a great movie (the first Pirates) into a horrible trilogy. When will the studios learn that shooting two sequels at the same time, never, NEVER works!! (See Back to the Future II & III and The Matrix II & III) I thought it wasn't possible, but it's worse than the second Pirates.

"peter-1850","3","2","10","26 May 2007"," Self-indulgent rip-off
","We went to see this today. It's a long film, with far too much time spent in boring fight sequences. The plot is peculiar and convoluted to say the least.<br/><br/>Sadly, too, there is little novelty here. The same old characters, mainly, continue in the same old way.<br/><br/>If you enjoyed the previous two films, then there is much to enjoy here, it is fun, but it leaves you much less satisfied than before.<br/><br/>I was surprised, and impressed, that Captain Sparrow appears to be something of a classicist, or lawyer as, at one point, and aptly, he says 'res ipse loquitur' and there are no sub-titles to interpret the remark. Could this lead to more children taking an interest in Latin? If so, three cheers to the film, that sort of intellectually enriching stuff is seldom seen, or, rather, heard, in a Hollywood film.<br/><br/>There are some amazingly sloppy anachronisms, though. Early in the film a child sings before being executed, and shows us that he is undergoing modern orthodontic treatment. It'd have been easy to conceal his braces, or, better, to have used another child. Is this just laziness, or is it a deliberate signal that they're taking the peess out of the audience because they don't care as long as they get the money - or is there some excuse that it's a 'post-modernist' piece of deliberate rubbish (relabelled because of IMDb yankish puritanism)?<br/><br/>Some scenes appear to have been left in without any recollection of the original point. There's a rotting sea creature (a giant squid perhaps) on the beach at one point that the characters walk around, prod and consider it's huge eye - the reason for this isn't ever explained and there is no point to it in character or plot development, it's just there. Why couldn't it have been cut out? The film would have been shorter and less pointless - I suppose they spend a lot of money making the creature so had to include it as some sort of justification.<br/><br/>Keith Richards appearing as Jack's father has very little point to it, apart from just that - it's a self -indulgent reference to Depp using him as part of his character development. Clearly Keith manages to live, against all odds, but he can't act.<br/><br/>Unless you're really keen on the Pirates, and I'm quite fond of them, I must say, I'd avoid this. The little Latin isn't enough to make it interesting, not really. There were one or two rather good jokes, but, tellingly, I can't remember them a few hours later. The multiple Depp instantiations, as Sparrow's hallucinations, are, again, simply self- indulgence, it diminishes the effect of Depp's character and makes it all feel as if it is just a vehicle for his acting - good acting, certainly, in context, but shallow and mannered when isolated like this, it makes him appear simply hammy, an unkindness, I think, to Depp's undoubted talent.<br/><br/>Calypso, the goddess, apparently, was deeply unimpressive, as was the silly puzzle that looked interesting, but was trite in solution, to returning from Davey Jones Locker.<br/><br/>In summary, to long, to thin and too lazy."

","The first pirates was a 8. The next one was a 5 and this one is a 3. The joy with the first one was the wittiness and fun factor.

Though I think the main backstabbing was the backstabbing of the viewers. Look they added a intriguing new twist. Remember that Caribbean lady well see not just a Caribbean lady see she's a sea goddess. That good be interesting. But you see the ""screenwriters"" must have gotten bored with her because she grow 30x and explodes into crabs. Dumb ""twist"" like that happen through out the film.

"jboothmillard","3","1","4","22 November 2007"," Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End
","I said I would see it to see why Barbossa came back, but to be honest, I wish I hadn't bothered, this has to be one of the worst sequels ever, the writers and director Gore Verbinski (Mousehunt, The Ring) have truly lost all sense of reality. I only give it an extra two points because of the still quite impressive special effects, and one or two interesting ideas or twists. The basic story (tut, yeah right) is that Will Turner (Razzie nominated Orlando Bloom), Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley), the usual crew, and resurrected and now good Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) by Tia Dalma (28 Days Later's Naomie Harris, still using that great, sometimes amusing Jamaican accent) head to the land of the dead (aka World's End, aka a locker) and rescue their friend Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) (apart from Barbossa, who he has disagreements with), who was eaten by the Kraken. All together again they are now on a mission to face their foes, squid faced Captain Davy Jones (Bill Nighy), and Lord Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander), who's in control of Jones's heart. They gather all Pirate Lords from four corners of the world to release the goddess Calypso, Jones's damned lover, mainly just to create fear, but it doesn't work, and it is a bit silly it being Tia Dalma. The final scenes of the film are The Black Pearl, The Fkying Dutchman and all the other ships in battle to end the war for control of the seas. Also starring Jack Davenport as Admiral James Norrington, Jonathan Pryce as Governor Weatherby Swann, The Office's Mackenzie Crook as Ragetti, Lee Arenberg as Pintel, Kevin R. McNally as Gibbs, Stellan Skarsgård as 'Bootstrap' Bill Turner, Crouching Tiger's Chow Yun-Fat (Chow) as Captain Sao Feng (as Chow Yun-Fat), Keith Richards as Captain Teague (supposedly Jack's dad, of course, Richards inspired Depp's performance) and Omid Djalili as Askay/Pusasn. The interesting moments are Jack seeing himself carious times, rocking a ship under water to be the right way up, pirates losing their ugly looks for moments (including Jones), and a really unusual marriage with Will and Elizabeth while they are fighting (they see no other time like the present). The big problem with this film is that there is too much to focus on, too much spectacle and not enough put into the story, and ultimately, I didn't have a clue what was going on most of the time. Don't bother with it unless you have a crush on Depp or Bloom, you love special effects or you want to send yourself to sleep. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Makeup and Best Visual Effects, and it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Special Visual Effects. Adequate!"

","Wow! Summer is here and marking it for the summer movie season is the third installment in the 'Pirates of the Caribbean' series named 'At World's End'. You see, if I named the film, instead of 'At World's End', I'd name it 'The Film that Never Ends'. A 2 hour and 48 minute runtime for a popcorn Disney flick is not stupid, IT'S F__KING PSYCHOTIC!!! If you thought the second film was a pointless, annoying, ass-numbing experience (ass-numbing because you're constrained to a dinky little movie theater chair for hours at a time), you have no idea. Brace yourself, I used to think the cruelest form of torture was castration, but not after seeing 'Pirates of the Caribbean 3'. If someone walked up to me and told me I had to sit through Pirates 3 one more time, I'd most likely cut my own balls off. <br/><br/>The third installment takes off where the second film left off. Captain Jack Sparrow is lost in the cabinet of Davey Jones and.... you know what -- F_CK IT! Do we even care about the over-the-top, ridiculous, and hard to follow plot? I don't think so. I think the biggest reason people sit through through these piece of sh__t movies is because of Johnny Depp. Another reason would be horny teenage boys who for some reason despite the PG-13 rating, think Keira Knightley might by some chance get naked. The third reason would be horny teenage girls who think the same thing, except applied to Orlando Bloom. But back to what I was saying, the plot in 'Pirates 3' is terrible. Sure it's complex, but complex doesn't mean it's coherent. It's all over the place, and it will make your brain hurt if you attempt to figure everything out. <br/><br/>The action sequences are well-made and entertaining, but after a certain point watching them gets to be an exhausting experience. At the 2-hour mark of 'Pirates 3' I was ready to leave, but stayed in hopes that for some act of God it might get better. It didn't. Big freakin' surprise. From an acting stand-point the movie isn't half-bad though. Johnny Depp is as hysterical and scene-stealing he can be with poorly-written and cheesy dialogue, and Oscar winner Geoffrey Rush is exquisetley over-the-top as the villain pirate turned hero. Orlando Bloom is as flat as always, and Keira Knightley is average at best (but not bad to look at.) The members of the supporting cast are decent enough -- veteran actors Bill Nighy (Love Actually, Still Crazy) and Stellan Skarsgaard (Insomnia, The Exorcist: The Beginning) are great in their roles, Chow Yun-Fat is annoying to say the least in his role but doesn't break character, and Naomie Harris as the Voodoo woman would be better if she wasn't so over-the-top. <br/><br/>In my review you probably noticed I used the phrase 'over-the-top' several times. That is because that statement pretty much sums up 'Pirates 3'. It's too much. Too much plot, too many drawn-out action sequences, too much cheesy dialogue, too many characters, etc. Although it isn't the absolute worst movie I've seen, it's one of the most painful to sit through. I don't mind three hour movies, in fact I love three hour movies. 'The Godfather' and 'Schindler's List' are two of my all-time favorite films. I just like three hour movies that are, say Oscar-caliber material, because if I'm going to sit in a theater for three hours, I BETTER be blown away. Sitting through this movie made me want to cry. I used to think rape was the worst thing that could happen to someone, then I sat through this movie. OKAY, I'm being a tiny bit melodramatic, but still, it's pretty goddamn awful. These three hour pirate movies need to stop-- what the hell do they think a film editor is for?! Dear Mr. Film Editor of Pirates 3 -- DO YOU F__KING JOB!!!!!!!!. Grade: D+"

","Writing about the second part of the Pirates of the Caribbean saga, Dead Man's Chest, one reviewer wrote that it was 45 minutes film stretched into one and half hours. Now, the concluding saga At World's End is even longer, two hours and forty-seven minutes, to be precise. But you can't complaint about it being stretched. Rather, it's crammed, to the point that you wish if some of the plots were not there at all. Director Gore Verbinski seems to have taken a leaf from Spider-Man director Sam Raimi cramming as many things as he can, thinking perhaps that it's his last chance with the seafarers. But as the film ends, finally, you half expect that there's a next one coming. But first, the world's end! It begins at Singapore. The destination is Devey Jones' (Bill Nighy) locker where Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) is trapped. For that the crew, comprising of the usual suspects, captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), Elizabeth Sawn (Keira Knightley), and the mysterious sorceress Tia Dalma (Naomie Harris), must first obtain the navigation chart from a formidable pirate Sao Feng (Chow Yun-Fat). By why do they need captain Jack? Because, Lord Backett has obtain the heart of Devey Jones and he's on a pirate hunt with the help of the Flying Dutchman. Now, Jack is one of the nine pirates who's part of the council that can stand against the might of the East India Company. But the adventure is not as smooth as it looks when everyone of them have a plan of his own, and when everyone of them seek to outwit the other at any cost. Will wants his father free, Jack wants to get rid of his debt, Barbossa has promise to keep and so on. Add to that Devy Jones love affair and Lord Backett's politics you have quite a complicated plot, and it's all happening at the sea, in one ship of other. And did we mention a host of new characters meandering through this complicated drama, including the Rolling Stone guitarist Keith Richards in a miniscule role as Jack's father. Add to that loads of pirate myths, rules, and such mumbo jumbo and the mandatory sword fights, cannon fires and battles at the sea, you have quite heavy stuff hear, as heavy as the Black Pearl, which change hand for god knows how many times. But the film is far more superior than its predecessor and takes you the same kind of adventure that made Curse of the Black Pearl so popular. Rush is back, but not as formidable as before, Harris gets bigger and better footage, Nighy gets to show off his tentacles, Bloom fights as usual and the new addition to the franchise Yun-Fat shines as a Chinese pirate. But it's Knightley all the way. She gets to do everything possible aboard a pirates vessel and she does them all convincing well. The star of the show is however, obviously is Johnny Depp as Jack Sparrow. His solo acts of delusion with so many of Jacks filling the screen is just awesome. You go to see Pirates of the Caribbean for Jack Sparrow and he lives up to your expectations, a marvelous achievement, especially when the scenes are so crowed with so many interesting characters. There are no skeletons here. But the special effects are the real winners, especially when you wouldn't even realise that they are graphics. Watch out for the journey into the other world and watch out for the final battle. So, get aboard folks, and set the sail. Only be on the track and if you get confused, don't complain."

Not to mention that the vagueness of some of what was being mentioned kept me scratching my head because I forgot a lot of what was said in ""Dead Man's Chest"".<br/><br/>I was expecting a lot more, and I was definitely expecting to understand a lot more. For instance: when did Calypso enter the picture, and how come they never alluded to her existence before? What the heck did she say once she was transformed into the attack of the 50 foot woman? Why did Elizabeth Swann want Jack Sparrow back, she was the one that killed him after all? Why was Elizabeth Swann so clean throughout the whole movie? I thought she was a sister of Legolas the elf from ""Lord of the Rings"", that guy never got dirty, and Orlando Bloom was in this movie as well. Ms. Swann, for whatever reason, all of a sudden made an excellent pirate and captain, thereby showing her magnificent strength and resolve, or just how overrated pirates really are.<br/><br/>The story tried to insert too much instead of taking the approach of less is best. On top of that they shifted focus to characters I wasn't interested in, namely everyone other than Jack Sparrow. And then, however romantic they tried to make it, the marriage during the battle was just plain dumb, and quite a thrill kill. After a while I really thought the movie was running too long. They could have done with half of the banter and side stories, got rid of Elizabeth's cliché rally speech, and the movie would have been twice as good."

You have an established win with Johnny Depp's Jack Sparrow; some good plot threads to tie off from #2; and a huge summer budget. They could have stolen the plot of ""Cutthroat Island"" and had a huge success.<br/><br/>The Good: Johnny Depp has never disappointed me in a role, whether or not I liked the particular movie. One of the better actors of our generation, I would say without reservation. Jack Sparrow is made 'real' in a way few other actors could hope to accomplish.<br/><br/>Still Good: The special effects are, for the most part, awesome and well done.

More than a few were unnecessary and done just because they *could* be, I believe, but even so, done very well.<br/><br/>That said...on to the Bad and/or disappointing.<br/><br/>Put simply, the movie had no 'heart'.

Visually stunning, occasionally humorous, thrilling every so often, but under the flash and bang, there's no substance.<br/><br/>Opening scene is mass hangings and a song. Okay, that's obviously why the mass hangings were taking place, to get a cheap chorus line going. We assume it's important but it's never explained in the movie. We have to come home and read message boards and bounce ideas and make assumptions. Watching the movie...if there's a serious WTF Moment in the first five minutes and it isn't cleared up by the end...the movie has problems.<br/><br/>Next, we're in Singapore. This would have been a voyage of several months at least...one way. And it appears Caribbean pirates make this trip regularly, because everyone knows everyone else and has long and frequent interactions with them over the span of their mutual history as pirates. But willing suspension of disbelief and all that...I guess the Caribbean isn't exotic or big enough, the script hacks felt they had to go farther afield than Davy Jones' Locker.<br/><br/>Then it's off to World's End...or at least Davy Jones' Locker. This part was awesome and could have been expanded to fill the movie much more satisfyingly than the rest of the drek they felt necessary to inflict upon us.<br/><br/>Then we get some god-awful Calypso storyline that has no point, purpose, resolution, or meaning other than the opportunity to showcase some more spiffy effects and throw in a few more betrayals.<br/><br/>The first movie stands as one of the best, funnest movies to come out in the past ten years. High-seas adventure and hi-jinx had by all, a good rip-roaring adventure tale. The sequel was inevitable, and possibly a trilogy...so #2 (DMC) you sort of expected to have some threads left hanging to open the door to #3.<br/><br/>The actors all did an outstanding job with what they had to work with...but honestly, the producers should have shaved a few of the special effects and spent the extra money on a coherent script. While there's plenty of PotC fans willing to spend money on anything and slavishly sing its praises...this was not at all worthy of being attached with the name of the first movie.<br/><br/>Rumor has it that both Orlando Bloom and Kiera Knightly have stated they won't do a PotC 4. Given their experiences with this one...I don't blame them a bit. Everything that made the first one great was missing in this installment, replaced by special effects and a Bigger Is Better mentality.<br/><br/>My advice: go see it at a matinée, because the effects are worth seeing on the big screen. The story doesn't deserve full-price admission, though."
"annabelledumas","4","1","4","6 June 2007"," What should we expect?
","Honestly, I was a little excited to go see the ending of the trilogy. But I didn't keep my expectations too high knowing what almost always happens when the first movie is a block-buster so for some reason instead of making just another movie people have to use two movies to make one. LOTR I adored because like the books it was suppose to be 3. But PotC was a failure again like the Matrix.<br/><br/>The story line had aboslutley no point. The comedy was pure stupidity of either using animals or Jack (if you have seen it, I think you know what it is) by the third movie that stupid, clumsy love for the pirate is starting to fade away.<br/><br/>But crediits still go to an obvious high budget film. The picture is beautiful and the action is good. But who can watch 3 hours of that? Watch it on DVD. But it might even loose more of its charm when watched without a big screen and an audience"
"dkncd","5","1","4","6 June 2007"," Story adrift
","""Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End"" has notable performances, particularly from Chow Yun-Fat, Geoffrey Rush and of most notably Johnny Depp, back as the infamous Jack Sparrow. The film has excellent special effects, a great score, great moments of humor and memorable scenes and dialogue. The film has a number of notable battle sequences. The ending is interesting and satisfying given the direction the film took.<br/><br/>However, this ""At World's End"" has the same problem as ""Dead Man's Chest""; it has a long and dragging plot line that is contrary to the focused and engaging first film. The story of this film was more engaging than that of ""Dead Man's Chest"", but it is still a far cry from the quality of ""The Curse of the Black Pearl"". It is safe to say that if you found ""Dead Man's Chest"" disappointing, you will also be disappointed by ""At World's End"" because it similarly deviates from the style of ""The Curse of the Black Pearl""."
"crushtv-1","5","1","4","5 June 2007"," A Betrayal of the Original Story
","There were three problems with PotC: At World's End...<br/><br/>1. Too long. This story could have been trimmed 30 minutes and been improved by it. A 3 hour movie betrays a total lack of editorial discipline.<br/><br/>2. Disasterously complex. By the beginning of the third hour, the audience is clear that everyone is trying to betray each other, but few will be clear on exactly why and how.<br/><br/>3. Worst of all, this screenplay is a betrayal of the original story. Jack Sparrow is a pirate, yes, but one can't imagine him making his living by murdering, raping, plundering coastal villages as Barbossa's crew did in ""The Curse of the Black Pearl"". The first ""Pirates"" movie had a pirate as a hero, yet stopped short of actually ADOCATING piracy. To the contrary, in ""Curse"", Jack Sparrow actually FOUGHT pirates (for his own selfish reasons, of course).<br/><br/>""At World's End"" however has decided to portray pirates as freedom fighters and piracy as a quaint alternate life-style.<br/><br/>In the first movie, Jack's adversaries were pirates. In ""Dead Man's Chest"", the writers upped the ante by pitting him against the monstrous Davy Jones. But it appears that Davy Jones was not monstrous enough for the final installment. What could possibly be worse than a cruel, cold-blooded sea-tyrant with an octopus of a head? Why, an international corporation of course. How original.<br/><br/>Finally, the writers were so anxious to invoke contemporary politics into this story that the themes lead one to bizarre conclusions that the writers (surely) could not have intended. If the East India Company is a kind of George W. Bush administration, stripping civil liberties in a mad hunt for pirates, does that mean that the nine pirate lords are Al-Qaeda? Are we supposed to cheer for Al-Qaeda's victories as we are for pirates at the end of ""At World's End""? Look, I know it its just an action movie and we aren't supposed to think that hard about it. But how can one be expected to turn off his brain while watching a movie this labyrinthine?"
"ajoo","3","1","4","4 June 2007"," Disappointing to say the least
","Make no mistake about it, I am a HUGE Pirates fan myself and thought that the last movie was probably the classical definition of what a sequel is supposed to be like. However, At World's End failed to impress me. I believe with expectations as high as they were after the last two movies, it would be difficult to live up to it, probably IMPOSSIBLE, but I would still expect the makers of Pirates to do it and keep doing it each time. For one, there were very few links between the first two movies and the third (compared to the brilliant links established between the first two movies). Also the level of wit seemed to have gone down considerably. Some scenes seemed to stretch beyond limits and kill the smooth flow one associates with these movies. The two people who did well though were Johnny Depp and Hans Zimmers and indeed Hector didn't disappoint either. However, the movie had far too many open ends to be the final movie of a trilogy, far too many unanswered questions. Frankly speaking, I expected Gore Verbinski to do better. Had it been a movie of the same standard with different characters and bad music, I would give it a 1, but I cant quite do that to Captain Jack (though he doesn't seem to have a clear future ahead)."
"darthaero85","2","1","4","30 May 2007"," Jerry Bruckheimer should walk the plank!
","Start filming a movie with NO SCRIPT, huh? I feel bad for Verbinski. The movie suffers because there is no story, nothing more than random scenes thrown together. The actors know it too, they all seem bored with their characters. The once great glory from ""Black Pearl"" and ""Dead Man's Chest"" is gone. Jack Sparrow seems bored, Barbossa and Davy Jones have lost their evil edge. A billion subplots are worked out through two hours of expository dialogue to the point where I was checking my watch, just waiting for the final battle. Despite some visual effects and some amazing battles at the beginning and end of the movie, (not to mention a fantastic, and all too short cameo by Keith Richards, the only actor who truly seemed in character), this movie was lacking heart. It's boring, long-winded, and just not enjoyable. To all you people who claim to like it because ""It has Jack Sparrow"", WAKE UP! It's a slapped together piece of crap because Jerry Bruckheimer is giving Transformers the time it needs to be a decent movie so he can start another franchise. He knows that it he filmed grass growing for three hours and called it ""Pirates 4"", everybody would pay to see it. I hate it that so many trilogies end on a poor note (except Lord of the Rings), and Pirates has definitely fallen into that ""curse of the third."""

","Two different ratings can be given to this movie. One for those who look for entertainment, and those who look for something IN movies farther than mental drudgery for a couple hours.<br/><br/>If you go for entertainment, this movie won't please you. This movie is so much more complex than many of the movies I have seen these days. They gives you about twenty different story lines and character ideas to follow, you never really know who is on who's side.<br/><br/>This movie definitely did sway away from the ""family values"" that the first (and sort of second) had. At worlds End was too violent and too complex for the young-lings to grasp. It may sound condescending to anyone under 14, but no one under 14 should bother watching this.<br/><br/>I loved this movie, but I did have a couple problems. **Spoilers**<br/><br/>The pirates had about 11 or so ships, while the Trade Company had about a hundred. Now tell me why the hell only two ships went to battle? To Avoid the maelstrom? Not very patriotic.<br/><br/>Secondly, while I loved every minute of the complexity, it was still confusing even for me. I think the ""triple agent"" ideal on most of the main characters was relatively unnecessary.<br/><br/>But yea, It all depends on what you expect to see in the movie before you actually see it, to tell if you'll like it or not. If you go in expecting it'll suck, then it will. If you go in expecting that it is VERY different from the first two, you might enjoy and understand it."
"samseescinema","5","1","4","24 May 2007"," Lost its Charm and its Excitement
","Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End reviewed by Samuel Osborn<br/><br/>The Pirates of the Caribbean franchise has been a menagerie of CGI magic, dreaming up seafaring worlds of swashbuckling majesty, the emptiness of such computerized beauty filled in by the drunkenly feminine charm of Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp). His personality was big enough for all the rest of the characters, of whom consisted mostly of archetypes we'd expect from a trilogy based off an amusement park ride. The plots are confusing little numbers, spinning half-baked legends around the myriad of story arcs each character was put to. They work mostly to provide coal for the furnace of stunt-work and CGI, both of which turn clenched jaws of suspense into wide-hanging maws of amazement. The characters, even Mr. Sparrow, are corkboards for personalities to be tacked on to. There's no evolution to these people; simply punch-lines and singular motivations. But up until this third installment, the shaky equation worked. I'd give much of the credit to director Gore Verbinski, who achieved the unlikely feat of maintaining an artist's handiwork throughout the duration of the colossal project. (Does anyone remember the creative collapse of X-Men when Brett Ratner took the reigns of the trilogy?) But with At World's End, the tangle of the franchise's formula catches up. The song put on repeat that each character sings has grown tiresome. And the plot mangles itself into a confusing bundle of tedium. After 168 minutes, it becomes a strange and bizarre phenomenon to be bored by such spectacle.<br/><br/>Picking up where Dead Man's Chest left off, Will Turner (Orland Bloom), Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley), Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), and their merry band of adventurers seek to bust Jack Sparrow from the confines of Davy Jones' (Bill Nighy) locker. The path to World's End, where the locker unexplainably exists, is held within the map of Captain Sao Feng (Chow Yun-Fat), a Singaporean Pirate Lord obsessed with steam. Finagling a shadowy deal with the Captain, Will Turner manages to secure a ship and a crew to take to Jones' locker with the understanding that Mr. Sparrow will repay a longstanding debt with Sao Feng when retrieved. You see, Turner isn't saving Sparrow for the sake of their friendship. Jack has always had a thing for Turner's fiancée, Elizabeth Swann, and has never been mum on the subject. Will is instead looking to save Sparrow to, in turn, use him to free his imprisoned father on board Davy's ship, The Flying Dutchman. It hasn't been fifteen minutes and already we're confused. <br/><br/>Anyway, it isn't long before Jack's busted out and a new plot thread must spool out. The nine remaining pirate lords, for a reason I missed somehow, decide to hold a summit on Shipwreck Isle. And here's where things get really confusing. Between Elizabeth Swann, Jack Sparrow, Captain Barbossa, Will Turner, Lord Beckett, Tia Dalma, Captain Sao Feng, Davy Jones, Bootstrap Bill, and Norrington, there are at least ten different motives for the script to juggle. But since all ends meet at Shipwreck Isle, the entire second hour of the film is spent making deals, betraying loyalty, forging accords, and stabbing backs before the summit is held. By the arrival of the third act I managed to have caught up. And seeing the immense mound of plot the script had hauled forward, it's realized that the epic tangle of characters and motives would be impressive were it not so damned tedious. <br/><br/>The plot razes all traces of the franchise's main attraction: charm. Investing fully in the complex web of story, it forgets that we care little for the motives of these characters as they pertain to the plot. Sparrow wants to be a pirate forever. Fine, what else did we expect? Turner wants to free his dad. OK, that's cute, Will. Swann likes the life of a pirate and wants the torch to be carried on. Whatever, she's like that. We care for these characters most in times of their clever verbal jousting, twirling swordplay, fantastic adventures. How they strike accords and deal with British administrative law are mere obligations to a story set in the pirating world. Yet At World's End insists upon putting that piece to the puzzle front and center. It's not a cushy piece of swashbuckling wonder with which to sink our teeth deliciously into. It's a surprising wooden block that our teeth shatter upon. It's boring, in short. <br/><br/>But when those clouds clear and the moonlit charm returns, Pirates is still, after all, Pirates. There are moments in those final two hours of this ridiculously long-winded saga that remind us why the franchise has raked in so much money thus far. They're few, but shining. And that first hour, when Barbossa and company go to world's end to crack the lock on Jones' locker, it's glistening, rousing entertainment. But like The Matrix Trilogy a few years back, Pirates of the Caribbean winds itself into a dry wrap of self-importance, forgetting the reasons seats were filled the first time round the ride. And by the time this go-round finally comes to a halt, the excitement has all but faded. <br/><br/>Samuel Osborn"
"Arkayoh","Null","1","5","7 June 2007"," Pirates of the Caribbean: At Wit's End.
","There's no ho ho in this infuriating, wasted opportunity. I can't believe I stumped up £7.80 (that's around $15) of my hard earned booty to sit through this squalid wreck of a movie. The first was brilliant, the second not bad. But boy is this lame. And confusing. And pointless.<br/><br/>One of the film's motifs, the stone crabs, provides a nifty metaphor for the film. It's like a nasty dose of crabs: the pay off for some previously experienced pleasure. And while I still admire the first in the trilogy (please let it be a trilogy: no more sequels!) this has rather stolen its luster. Cutthroat Island was better than this... No, maybe not. But at least Cutthroat Island had the decency to sink without a trace."
"soreyj","7","1","5","31 May 2007"," So Much Untapped Potential
","The third part of a trilogy is often the hardest of the three. By the time the third film roles around, there is a great deal to be expected: plot lines must be resolved, visuals must be on par with previous films...indeed, there is far less wiggle room available for a third installment than in any other. And, in addition to all of these pre-requisites, the film itself must stand as a separate work- it cannot be simply ""Part 2 (cont.)"". <br/><br/>At World's End tries to reconcile these two aspects-tying up plot lines with introducing new stuff so the film doesn't seem old. The problem, though, is not that the plot lines are not interesting or poorly done, but rather not expanded on enough.<br/><br/>For example, Chow Yun-Fat's character, Sao Feng, is, at first, a simplistic, shallow, and over all unpleasant pirate lord, but as the film progresses we see some interesting sides to his character. These, however, are never expanded on. Captain Feng had the possibility of becoming just as recognizable and memorable as Depp's or Bloom's characters, albeit for different reasons. Instead, this plot line is thrown to the side.<br/><br/>The other pirate lords are also interesting, or at least comedic, and yet they too are brushed aside. Norington had a lot of promise, yet he too is not expanded on. His mini-plot is given closure in the most remote sense of the word. We never really get to know Cutler: sure he's nasty, but WHY is he nasty? Even Davy Jones, ripe as he is for character development, doesn't feel properly expanded on.<br/><br/>Indeed, so much new material was presented, and so much time was spent closing the stories of the 4 main characters, that the possibilities of the new material were forsaken, making much of the movie seem like little more than filler.<br/><br/>It is my opinion that a Pirates 4 ought to have been planned, given the new material in this movie. I would gladly wait another year or two for closure if it meant that the new characters and plots were given the time they deserve. A great film tomorrow is better than a good film today.<br/><br/>The ending, however, is perhaps the most appropriate one for the series. It is not a fairy tale ending, as this has not been a fairy tale. Fairy tales have shining, glorious champions of good astride noble steeds, where the lines between good and evil are clearly drawn.<br/><br/>The Pirates of the Caribbean are a band of daredevil thieves and rogues; their foes are clearly evil, but that doesn't make them good. The values of a knight- justice and honor and a pretty girl- are different from those of a pirate- freedom, wealth, and fame- and therefore their ideal endings are going to be different.<br/><br/>While many will say that the ending is a cop out and meant to allow for a fourth film (which is a understandable conclusion to draw), I also believe that is the ideal situation for them- they all love freedom and adventure, and the most thrilling thing in the world to them is the sight of adventure on the horizon- and that is what they get."

I went in expecting to love this and I came out feeling gutted.<br/><br/>Most of the movie is spent by building up the finale and the climax is simply ruined by chasmic plot holes, the badly written story lines attempting to find closure all at once, and by the fact that the climax is not so climatic as we were led to believe.<br/><br/>The movie's only redeeming characteristics are the superb score by Hans Zimmerman and the fact that the ending was so ridiculous that my friends and I laughed as we gleefully fled the cinema.<br/><br/>I do not recommend anyone to see this movie if they want to remember the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise fondly."

""Orders, sir?"" let's just die. and then the thousands of other ships are like ok lets just go home. bro. bro.<br/><br/>there are so many more little things. things that are done just for the audience that make NO sense. that are impossible or just ridiculous coincidences. all over the place. the whole calypso story did not impact anything. also how they unleashed her was so stupid, you have to say it as if it's coming from a lover. oh and jack sparrow can grab any rope on the ship and launch himself or even fly or create a parachute. there is so much more. this movie deserves a hilariocity review"

I have to admit, I got a kick out of just about the entire movie, though there were times when the story seemed to get shifted around and it got a bit tenuous to follow. Watching the 'Pirates' films out of sequence doesn't help either I imagine, but I take them as I get them.<br/><br/>It's funny, but I remember the very first time I ever heard of the concept of Davey Jones' Locker. It was in the mid Fifties when I was a kid reading comic books, and there was a story in a Mighty Mouse comic that had a story about Davey Jones' Locker. I can't remember what it was about, but there was something about the idea that was ingrained in my memory ever since. I'm pretty sure it didn't have anything to do about Davey shepherding dead souls over to the other side though.<br/><br/>There's a lot of swashbuckling action in this picture, and a lot of well placed humor as well. As usual, Johnny Depp delivers as Captain Jack Sparrow, although he came across as almost a secondary character in this particular story. More of the action centers around Captain Hector Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), and Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley). Supporting actors also play a significant part, like Chow Yun-Fat as Captain Sao-Feng, Naomie Harris as Tia Dalma, and the pair of humorous crew members of The Black Pearl, Pintel (Lee Arenberg) and Rigetti (Mackenzie Crook). Those two guys showed up in some absurd situations that were made even more comical by their presence.

Their characters, well put into picture and with plenty of surprises, are determined to achieve their goals, no matter the methods. Thus, it manages to keep the viewer interested, in part thanks to its story. Speaking of which, it isn't anything brilliant or something, but it's good enough to keep it all together. <br/><br/>In terms of action, you get some intense fighting scenes from time to time, culminating with an epic naval fight, but it also leaves quite a lot of time with more to be desired. They've made a lengthy movie, with more than two and a half hours of screen time, fact which doesn't do it a great favor. It seems over prolonged, having plenty of scenes which present something irrelevant, which could have easily been skipped, just to try and add some more amusement, but often failing in this aspect. <br/><br/>It terms of laughter, this third installment leaves plenty of room for improvement. It does manage to make you laugh from time to time but nothing spectacular. Just some random irony or gags which seem quite forced. In terms of visuals though, everything it top notch. The CGI is very good, managing to amaze with every chance it gets, and it really has time to do it. <br/><br/>As an overall impression, I saw an entertaining movie, which could have been a lot better if it had a shorter length, a better story or a better comical side. As a plus, you get intense fighting scenes, great CGI and an epic final battle. It's ok, but a bit far from the first movie of the franchise."

","This movie isn't as good as the previous movie, but not as bad as the next ones. Each movie in this series seems to be a bit worse than the previous ones.

","Although I liked the first two movies this was a bit much. They tried to put enough material for two full-length movies into one. The plot wasn't properly explained leaving me clueless as to what was actually happening half the time. Because of this, the movie was filled with action and/or violence that ended up looking just like noise on the screen. Then, to top all this, in the thick of a battle with sword fights Will Turner asks to get married! I usually love this genre but this time I almost didn't finish watching. It puts to shame the first two movies, which I loved (that's why I'm rating this 3 stars). I think that this could have been a great movie but they tried to hard and ended up covering too much ground without developing the plot enough. The ending was also disappointing with Will Turner becoming the new Davy Jones."

","When push comes to shove, the Pirates films are about one thing and one thing only, entertainment. Amidst all of the nonsensical humor and action, I don't know how you wouldn't at least be entertained by what Johnny Depp & company had to offer.<br/><br/>At World's End once again doubles down on everything that made the second film ridiculously fun. Except this time the film is a solid 2 hours and 48 minutes long. I guess if you're going to spend 300 million dollars on a film might as well make it lengthy, right? The length and it's convoluted and wandering plot are sure to annoy some viewers (it certainly annoyed me), but there's more than enough to make this another worthy entry in Disney's bankable series.<br/><br/>After Beckett and the Navy managed to steal Davy Jones' heart and impose a ban on pirates across the seas, Will, Elizabeth, and Barbossa must form an alliance to find Jack Sparrow and come together for one final battle. There's a lot to like here, including some of the best choreographed and shot action of the entire series. Merely analyzing the final 35 minutes was enough to get my blood flowing. This series has never shied away from going all out with action and escapades, and At World's End is no different. I'm not even sure 50 percent of the films made today look half as good as this film does. However, there are always downsides to relying heavily on the spectacle.<br/><br/>As I mentioned with Dead Man's Chest, the spectacle overtook any sort of uniqueness or cleverness to the script that made the first adventure so fresh. Johnny Depp is way past the point of over-the- top, and so is the film. You feel like there's real danger in the first film, but most of that is gone by the supernatural and fantastical elements they bring in here. Nobody expected to see Sparrow sit an entire film out after being eaten by the Kraken last film, but it sure seemed pretty easy to get him back. And when we do get him back, he spends most of his time talking to hallucinated versions of himself that refuse to go away. The plot also tends to always fall back on one member of the crew being either 'missing' or 'captured' by another ship/crew. It gets tiring after a while.<br/><br/>I think they set out to make the biggest adventure possible, and you have to give the people involved credit for truly bringing it. But I can completely understand where people get tired of mindless action without much wit and far less charm than the first film had. But hey, I'm still having a blast going back and re-watching some of my childhood favorites.<br/><br/>+Spectacle is unmatched<br/><br/>+Zimmer's score is epic<br/><br/>+Jaw-dropping action<br/><br/>-Plot wanders<br/><br/>-Lengthy<br/><br/>7.8/10"

","For me, this one was the best so far. A bit too long for my taste, but so are previous two so I can't complain on that. Well designed adventure, with bit less characterization than before, but those are the same characters we already got to know well, so it should not bother anyone. Acting is good, story shifts between drama, fast action and emotional parts in tempo that prevents you to get bored during 3 hours of this awesome adventure.

","I've read that this is the most expensive movie ever made. It totally looks it. The production design is out of this world, and there are a handful of moments of such visual beauty that take my breath away. The confidence Disney had in these movies shows in every aspect of the production. There's a long stretch where Jack Sparrow occupies a deserted purgatory, conversing only with multiple versions of himself and a large group of crabs, which happen to be made of rocks. It's an audacious sequence for a family blockbuster.<br/><br/>There's also new locales, new characters, a mythical pirate lore introduced, and backstabbing and twists aplenty. It's all very complicated, so much so that the story is hardly worth following. You know what you're in for when you watch this; everything else is just a means to an end.<br/><br/>I do wish that with all of the attention paid to the complicated story and the production design that they had focused on making this at least a little bit fun. It's almost like they felt the story slip away from them and then overlooked the unique tone that made this such a smash in the first place in an attempt the steer the ship back on course."
"filipemanuelneto","6","0","1","13 April 2016"," The near-end of the pirate saga
","This movie ends the story told in ""The Dead Man's Chest"". The pirates, led by Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), will have to travel to the other side of the world in order to seek an unlikely alliance to stop the ambitious Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander), who wants to use Davy Jones (Bill Nighy) to dominate the seas. Directed by Gore Verbinsky has screenplay by Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio, and other collaborators.<br/><br/>The release of this film was expected given the previous film need a conclusion. However, the film didn't bring anything surprising, nor could surprise a lot. The differentiating factor of the previous film was, clearly, how the central characters have changed throughout the film and the way the plot takes advantage of that to become more complex and interesting. In this case we have the closing of a cycle, not its development. Perhaps the biggest surprises are the return of Captain Barbossa (played by Geoffrey Rush), this time in the ""good side"", the unexpected importance that Naomie Harris's character will have at the end and the conclusion, a bit disappointing, of the love story between Will and Elizabeth. The moments of humor remained the main dish of Jhonnie Depp, but the film also has a certain dramatic tension than the previous two had not. At least not so as present and ravishing.<br/><br/>This film was designed to end the most popular pirate's saga that cinema has ever seen, but the demands of the film industry, eager to make more money with the public's wishes, will give rise to a fourth film. Dramatic, tense, interesting but far from being surprising or inventive, this movie deserves congratulations by the way that, supposedly, would have ended to that story."

","The action is awesome in this film. Cannons, muskets, and the clang of swords are everywhere, but it doesn't go overboard, nor does it seem out of place (like that wheel- balancing sword-fight in Dead Man's Chest). It just seems right.<br/><br/>But then there's the humor, that was ever-present in the Black Pearl, but seriously lacking in Dead Man's Chest. It's back, and boy is it great. Black Pearl became known for doing a great job at intertwining action and comedy, and At World's End brings it back and does a great job. Again, the comedy is no where out of place, and the timing is perfect.<br/><br/>Those in the press who gave this movie a disappointing rating need to see it again, and actually pay attention. Those who go into this movie with the predisposition that it'll be disappointing will only find disappointment, and thus will miss the great experience that At World's End is. The storyline is beautifully done and leaves you wanting more.<br/><br/>And to those who call this a finale, not so fast. There is plenty left open, plenty of questions to be answered, and the ending scene following the credits, along with the last scene before the credits is proof of this. Will they make a fourth Pirates? Who knows, but I'm hoping so, and that fourth Pirates would easily make a finale.<br/><br/>With the resurrection of the comedy and action found in Curse of the Black Pearl and the elimination of many of the problems with Dead Man's Chest, At World's End is a great film that is going to be on my buy list when it hits store shelves (Blu-Ray, of course). I highly recommend this film for those who loved the first movie and either loved or even felt disappointed by the second."

","Here is a blockbuster that has been ridiculed by many, not least for the fact that it was at a time the most expensive film ever made. It feels rushed and isn't serious enough wherever it should be. Despite the fact that they are not in it as much as before, William and Elizabeth still provide far too many cringe-worthy moments. Many important factors are not even explained, it tries to be too epic, and Jack Sparrow just goes all-out weirdo here. But the fact of the matter is, it was so damn fun. Despite its numerous flaws, this is the entry that has the most fun factor out of the franchise. There are so many entertaining parts and it is very re-watchable. I can see why it was hard to follow for some, what with the ever-changing allegiance from the numerous characters, but to me the pacing was fine. I adored Barbossa as one of the protagonists (if you could call him that) and the constant banter and bickering between him and everybody's favourite captain. This was truly a fitting, though flawed, ending to a superb trilogy. You don't get many trilogies where all three films complement each other so well and are so enjoyable."

"CinemaClown","Null","0","1","17 July 2015"," A Satisfactory Conclusion, If Not A Memorable One.
","The third & final instalment of Gore Verbinski's Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy is a bloated & convoluted mess that unnecessarily adds more complexity to the plot by introducing too many characters instead of bringing its pirate mythology to a satisfactory conclusion, lacks the very sense of fun that made its predecessors click so well and is the weakest film of the three.<br/><br/>Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End continues the events that unfolded in Dead Man's Chest and follows Will Turner, Elizabeth Swann & the crew of the Black Pearl as they team up with the resurrected Captain Barbossa on a quest to rescue Captain Jack Sparrow from Davy Jones' locker and then join the other pirate lords to make a final alliance against their common enemy, the East India Trading Company.<br/><br/>Directed by Gore Verbinski, there is no denying that At World's End is visually striking but the issues that surfaced in the previous chapter only get worse here for the story features too many new subplots for what was intended to be the series' finale, takes way too much time to get things moving, and also happens to be tediously paced for the most part which makes its 169 minutes of runtime a challenge to sit through.<br/><br/>On the technical scale, the film fares much better for the set pieces are grand, impressive & finely detailed. Cinematography is very much in tune with the previous instalments and the camera makes fab use of its angles, movements & colour tones. Editing however is a major step down for the length of its narrative isn't justified at all plus there are many sequences it could've managed without plus a better pace would've definitely benefited the experience.<br/><br/>Visual effects continue to make its mark and its use is much more extensive in this chapter, especially in the action-packed moments and of course, the grand finale. And last but not the least is the background score by Hans Zimmer which presents the legendary composer at the top of his game for the soundtrack carries the same epic feel of its predecessor with a melancholic tone seamlessly blended into the narrative and it amplifies the experience by a great deal.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, At World's End brings back the cast of the first two films for one last venture and has a new addition in Chow Yun-fat who plays one of the pirate lords. Johnny Depp's rendition of Captain Jack Sparrow is a mixed bag for there are glimpses of the usual wit & charisma that made him such a beloved character in the first place but his eccentricity is stretched to a point where it almost stopped working and those hallucination scenes are simply unacceptable.<br/><br/>The contribution by its supporting cast is all over the place though. Orlando Bloom & Keira Knightley do a fine job in their respective roles of Will & Elizabeth, Bill Nighy as Davy Jones has his moments, Tom Hollander as Cutler Beckett takes over the role of prime antagonist of the series, Naomi Harris' character gets a major expansion in this chapter yet the finest work comes from Geoffrey Rush whose Captain Barbossa is the only character who shows no loss in form and is absolutely thrilling to watch.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End joins the long list of second sequels that failed to capture the magic of its predecessors and while not as rewarding as expected, it still ends the trilogy on a satisfactory level thanks to its final hour that redeems much of what was wrong with the picture with an effects-laden & action-packed finale even if it seems quite over-the-top. Enjoyable in bits n pieces, entertaining in the second half but also marred by useless twists, At World's End nonetheless packs in a few thrills & spectacle to bow out on a slightly fulfilling note, if not a memorable one."

","Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End (2007): Dir: Gore Verbinski / Cast: Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom, Keira Knightley, Geoffrey Rush, Bill Nighy: Third in this impressive franchise about old pirate clichés. It regards death and life as many notable characters move forward. Great opening has Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann allied with Captain Barbossa to free Captain Jack Sparrow from the clutches of the enemy. Third act derails slightly due to length and corny humour and mainly spills into an ongoing array of action violence. Directed by Gore Verbinski who has made a name for himself with these films, and is backed by tremendous production and visual elements. Johnny Depp returns once again and is hilarious as Sparrow who is involved in an intriguing dream like sequence in the opening. Keira Knightly as Swann is appointed ship captain thus rising her position. Orlando Bloom as Will Turner desires to free his father thus placing himself in potential danger. Geoffrey Rush as Barbossa switches gears opting for good. We remember him as the main villain of the first film, but at any rate Rush delivers a likable comic performance. Bill Nighy plays the empowering Davy Jones with monstrous makeup that bring out a hideous form. Third film is as entertaining as the previous two and it is a visually impressive showcase to end all well. Score: 7 / 10"

But no one can accuse him of indifference. He gives Captain Jack so many more faces than a comic pirate. He's an amazing actor. Conveys as much with expression as he does with words. That Jack Sparrow remains a hero despite his very obvious flaws is telling. At least for me, Will Turner and Elizabeth are rather self serving. Jack Sparrow will always be the great one. And comedy-wise there were some lines that were priceless such as the name given the crewman with""no arms and half an eye."" In 2015, it feels like Johnny Depp might be entering a new phase of his career. Hopefully, his film projects going forward will be true to his singular talent."

In Shipwreck Cove, the nine captains vote to declare war.<br/><br/>This movie really needs an opening 'previously' segment. It dives right in without explaining which makes it tough to get going. It's pure chaos while trying to remember what came before. Davy Jones' Locker is a weird fascinating world. I really like the surrealism. It's funny and a break from the Pirates world. The idea of a landlocked ship and the stone crabs are imaginative. The problem is that the movie keeps piling on revelations. I don't really understand all the Calypso stuff. The movie is just overstuffed with plot, CGI and characters of all kinds."

","""The Pirates of the Caribbean:At World's End"" is the 3rd film of the Pirates of the Caribbean series. Actually, I love this movie the most and I have watched it again and again. In this movie, many computer graphics are used, for example in the battle scenes on the sea, there are wonderful real waves (they are actually not real!), so you feel that it is more realistic. Also, the story is interesting and has individual characters. Of course Jack Sparrow played by Johnny Depp is a crazy funny character, Orlando Bloom as William Turner, Keira Knightly as Elizabeth Swann, Geoffrey Rush as Barbossa are charming members of the Black Pearl (the ship which they sail). In addition, the enemies liven up the story, Davy Jones who has a face like an octopus and Cutler Beckett who is the lord of the East India trading company. In this movie, there are new characters. One of them is Sao Fen who is a pirate of Singapore and he makes the story more interesting. Do you think the story is only battles? The answer is NO!! There are not only battles but also love, action and funny scenes. Maybe you think the love scenes are only between William and Elizabeth, of course they fall in love. However, in this film there is one more love story, Davy Jones and Calypso (Tia Dalma) who is called Sea Venus fell in love in the past. Besides this, you can find out about how Davy Jones to be a kind and loving man before he became a scary octopus man. If you have watched the first two films, you can enjoy this film, because it is the third movie in the series. A person who has never watched the previous movies may be confused because of the complexity of the story. Also, the film is longer than ordinary films, it is 169 minutes long. In Japan, it was broadcasted on TV, it was divided into two parts, The rescue Jack Sparrow part and The East Indian trading company part. In addition to these points, sometimes characters use dirty words because they are pirates, so if you hate such words, you may feel uncomfortable and have a bad feeling. Despite these points, you can enjoy this movie, but it is better that you watch the two movies before (The Pirates of the Caribbean: the curse of the Black Pearl and The Pirates of the Caribbean: dead man's chest) because the third movie is more complex."

Maybe it's because they have gone through so much in (as we saw in the first two films), maybe it's because of where they currently are and their situations as the 3rd movie picks up?

"breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com","7","0","1","1 September 2014"," Has bigger issues this time but is still fun
","When a sequel performs just as well at the box office as its predecessor, viewers know that a third entry is already underway in hopes of making a trilogy. This was no shock at all to viewers when Pirates of Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest (2006) blew away the competition when released. In fact, the entire cast began preparing for the third, simultaneously while completing the first sequel. These particular preemptive steps are not uncommon, but risky if plans did not go accordingly. Thankfully for them, their hunch was right. As for this particular entry, it continues to maintain the fun factor in multiple aspects of the film. Yet, there are a few things that don't work this time.<br/><br/>For one thing, the continuity remains faithful to the last two films. After Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) died and went to Davy Jones' Locker, Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley), Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Capt. Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) join together to find a way to get Sparrow back. The catch, is that it requires more help than they think. Also returning is Davy Jones (Bill Nighy) and Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander) who make a temporary alliance to help get what they want as well. And as for every other character from the last two films, they appear too, plus a little extra. For example, Naomie Harris as the witch, Tia Dalma, returns for a larger role, Chow Yun-Fat plays a Pirate lord from Singapore and even Keith Richards from the Rolling Stones has a minor but entertaining role. The best part of these casting decisions is that the new and old characters have the right charisma for each role and are likable on screen.<br/><br/>Unfortunately with this comes a price. The drawback being that there are too many individual character story lines. It's overwhelming and confusing at the same time. Will Turner, Jack Sparrow, Davy Jones, Capt. Barbossa, Cutler Beckett, and Elizabeth Swann all have their own agendas of which none agree with anybody else's goals. With this, the end results in quite a cluttered story with several subplots – it's not easy to follow. And the fact that its not easy to follow is the most surprising part. With a running time clocking in at almost 3 hours, one would think that there would be enough time to fully understand each character's plan, but only a few are actually understandable. Plus, not every viewer can sit through a movie close to 3 hours. The story telling has to be really focused and unfortunately Terry Rossio and Ted Elliot just put in too much all at once. I guess they forgot bigger isn't always better.<br/><br/>The only other problem this film has is that again, with it having the longest running time thus far, it feels like it also contains less action sequences that the last two. Or at least the action feels more sporadic. It's disappointing because a 20-minute finale sometimes doesn't make up for lost time in-between. Thankfully, the special effects do mesh well with the live-action and when there is action, it does entertain. Sword fighting and cannon fire is exciting to watch at sea. So that's not to say that these two writers from the last two films didn't do anything else right. There are also several moments of comedy throughout and they all don't belong to Johnny Depp either. Mainly Geoffrey Rush has several comical lines but so do various shipmates as well.<br/><br/>Cinematography as always looked great. Dariusz Wolski maintains his steady hand getting great shots of the sea and various islands. It should make viewers feel like that's where they should go for their next vacation. Lastly, the musical score was produced by ever-popular Hans Zimmer. For the most part, Zimmer continues to sustain his catchy pirate themes for Jack Sparrow and the franchise. But for this entry, Zimmer includes some new tunes of which some come across as more bizarre than engaging. An example would be when Sparrow is in Davy Jones' Locker. Zimmer just plays ""boing-boing"" sounds. It does represent the scene accurately because Jones' Locker is weird, but it feels like there could've been a better way to express it. It's not as strong as the last two but it still has a level of quality and entertainment.<br/><br/>Its cast and crew preserve the traits of the last two movies with its set of likable characters, catchy music, energetic action and special effects. The biggest problem with this entry is that with too many smaller story lines cluttering the main plot, it can get tiring to follow with a clear understanding. Plus, with a running time close to 3 hours, it may lose its viewer's interest by then."

I am sure I will get a lot more of the fun and excitement in a theater. But for now I will watch them on TV. I can see where this could be a great child's move. Enough happening ng to keep them i interested... and not so scary they will be afraid."
"CinematicInceptions","8","0","1","28 July 2014"," Complex, but well done and entertaining.
","I have seen this movie three times and liked it more the second and third times than the first. Indeed it is a movie that you need to see twice, so if you're one of those people who don't like re-watching movies, I recommend that you avoid this movie. If you can follow the alliances and small knot of intricacies in it, the movie is more enjoyable, but it's difficult to do that if you only see it once. This, I believe, is why people who aren't fans of this series are averse to the later pictures. There are so many loopholes that the plot has to get through to reach its conclusion that viewers tend to forget how they all work. I don't find that that sort of thing detracts from the experience, but I'm the type of guy that likes to re- see movies every year or so. The film is very well done, like the others and retains the ability to make most everyone the antagonist at some point and let the viewer decide who to root for. The effects, story, execution, and acting are very good as well as Hans Zimmer's moving and exciting score. Davy Jones makes an almost likable bad-guy, and Cutler Becket is so wimpy and cocky that his demise at the end is just perfect. Jack Sparrow is still wonderfully selfish, quirky, likable, and funny. His conflict over the Pearl with Barbossa comes back in a fun way (""What ARR you doin!'). And Jack's expression when the crabs drag the Pearl away is just classic The pirate lords and their disagreements retain the ideal that pirates are too independent to unite, but manage to anyways. The crew members' roles are not lessened by the importance of the climatic events. The battle at the end over the Maelstrom is excellent. The movie ends in the only way it really could in a way that you don't exactly like, but kind of prefer to the usual happily ever after. I would recommend At World's End to most people who like movies that have a good amount of effort put into them. It's primarily an action movie, but can please people that are partial to several other genres as well. If you are deliberating over whether to see it, I would suggest seeing it with a friend that can explain how it all works out (after seeing the first two of course), or watching it a second time a few months later for comprehension. Overall Rating: 8.6/10"
"alindsay-al","8","0","1","3 July 2014"," A return to form for the pirates franchise
","After the second film being a slight flop there was a lot of pressure on this film to succeed and I believe that for the majority it did. This film picks up where the last one leaves off with Will, Elizabeth, Barbossa and the rest of the crew going to Davey Jones Locker to save Jack Sparrow and unite all pirates against Cutler Beckett and Davey Jones oppression. Just like every Pirates film it is the Johnny Depp show as Jack Sparrow and he is great as always and his performance as Sparrow still hasn't got old yet for me and I always see these films expecting him to be great. The supporting crew is also great Elizabeth, Will, Cutler Beckett, Davey Jones and the supporting are all solid and good but my favourite has to be Barbossa he is just one of my favourite characters there is in films and his chemistry with Sparrow is excellent and he is a key part of this film. The story is good, however, there is some confusing unnecessary plot points which do take me out of it and I wish they had kept it a bit simpler. The script is also decent but not as good as the first pirates film as some of the dialogue is hard to understand and wooden. The style though is taken to the next level and especially towards the final battle especially the CGI is amazing and breath-taking which adds to the epicness of the film. This third film does a lot right and returns to the better days of pirates of the Caribbean."

","Pirates of the Caribbean: At Worlds End is a good movie with a great storyline although the plot does feel all over the place at times,it is without a doubt the worst of the franchise, but the cast make it better,especially Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow.The movie was clearly originally suppose to be the final Pirates of the Caribbean,sand it is for most of the main cast members, including Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley,and the reason I felt like the plot was messy is because it seemed like they were trying too hard to wrap up the franchise instead of focusing on a new and original story,and they brought a lot back from the first and second one as well,Bill Nighy did a great job as Davy Jones in Dead Mans Chest but I really don't think it was necessary giving him such a main role in this movie.It certainly will disappoint fans,but At Worlds End is still a funny and action packed pirates adventure.<br/><br/>As they intend on sailing past their maps,the pirate crew come across some people and locations they hoped they'd never see again for one big battle."

"Mackiatoe","8","0","2","1 June 2012"," The Best of the Series
","Anyone who says that At Worlds End is a stupid film is very correct. It's completely ridiculous in parts and poorly acted in others; it strains under the weight of its own idiotically high budget; certain scenes truly baffle the mind, and will certainly beg the question of how a trilogy about pirates ended up going to these places.<br/><br/>Here's the thing though: it doesn't pretend it doesn't know how ridiculous it is for even one minute. Rather, At Worlds End revels in its stupidity and blows it up to a scale that dazzles on the big screen. The story may be convoluted, but its a good, strong story nonetheless; Keira Knightley really isn't suited to her role in this film, but its brilliant to see how confidently she is used as Elizabeth Swan; the same goes for Orlando Bloom - he's there because he's there, and for no other reason; the villain, Cutler Beckett, is perhaps the best aspect of the film, and provides a solid antagonist to hinge the film around.<br/><br/>Furthermore, to deny this film of the accolades it deserves for is visuals because of its ridiculousness would be frankly criminal when you consider just what an incredibly well shot film this is, and how visually appealing it is. The CGI is gorgeous, and has aged absolutely seamlessly, certainly outdoing the more recent additions to the POTC series. The battle in the Maelstrom is a real standout, as well as the cinematography for the destruction of the HMS Endeavour. <br/><br/>Much of this odd and very subjective brilliance is down to its nature as a film. It's the ultimate incarnation of the Pirates Of The Caribbean film; a thoroughly Hollywood-ified version of the 18th century Caribbean that glosses over historical accuracies for the sake of entertainment. Only here, it goes further. Rather than trying to be overly serious, or indeed to take itself seriously in any way, it drops all pretences and just goes for it, with the logic seemingly being ""if they're gonna criticise this film for the uniforms that the British Navy personnel are wearing and the plausibility of getting from Singapore to the Antarctic in a matter of days, we may as well go all out and a scene where the Black Pearls is carried by hallucinatory crabs over some salt flats whilst Johnny Depp eats peanuts.<br/><br/>This film is so stupid that it ends up being so brilliant. Its Hollywood trash with a proper high quality finish. Big screen entertainment that gives you a bit to mull over on without forcing you to think about what you're watching. It knows you think its stupid, and it carries that and runs with it. The most remarkable achievement though is how, amazingly, it doesn't end up being a huge, catastrophic mess, but rather one of the most entertaining, most visually appealing and most well executed big screen blockbusters ever made."
"dave13-1","7","0","2","13 April 2012"," Solid ending to epic saga
","The Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy, taken as a saga, has the epic sweep and wild energy of the old time Hollywood pirate adventures. It's fun nonsense worthy of Robert Howard or H. Ryder Haggard, with deft comic timing, death-defying stunts and a literal boatload of roguish supporting characters. The final movie is an improvement over the second one, which I nonetheless enjoyed. Like any good adventure flick, this one takes the audience to places only imagined. The trailer hinted at this, showing previews of the Black Pearl making its way to end of the world and going over the edge! Although quite long at almost three hours, the viewer is taken to the end of our world and into the next, to Davy Jones' Locker, to the Singapore fortress of Asia's most dangerous pirate, to Shipwreck Cove and its town built entirely from the hulks of wrecked ships (!), to a final showdown with the British Navy at the edge of a maelstrom that threatens to sink both fleets. Money and technology were well used here to give color and flesh to what is essentially a very tall tale. A legend of the sea. A fish story. Blu-Ray takes great advantage of this, bringing out the high end effects with eye-popping clarity.<br/><br/>Some reviewers have complained that it is 'unrealistic'. Tosh. Realism is for weepy dramas. The characters are sometimes dwarfed by the scale of things, but then again Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom are supposedly playing ordinary people following extraordinary destinies. And anyway, Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush can steal any scene, even one with a kraken in it. The script is a little thin, but at least workable and again an improvement over Pirates #2, albeit a slight one. Neither really has dialogue worthy of its sweeping story line.<br/><br/>The ending, BTW, is perfectly suited to such a legendary tale, bringing characters together and sending others on their way as the saga continues."

","Less than a year after the previous installment of the popular pirates trilogy, Jack Sparrow and company return in Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End. The film should be great, given a three hundred million dollar budget, huge anticipation, and the closure a third installment inevitably brings to a series. While this film does show its budget and is quite visually arresting, it lacks a fair share of resolution to the trilogy and confuses with its overflowing exposition rather than purely existing to entertain.<br/><br/>Even in an action packed pirate movie, overly chatty sequences will simply bore audiences just because it's too hard to follow what exactly is being said. The movie really just had too many vague or unnecessary plot points that didn't affect the main plot at hand.<br/><br/>All the acting was perfectly fine, with Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow and Geoffrey Rush as Captain Barbosa unsurprisingly being the standouts. The introduction of Depp's character in the pirate equivalent of Hell called Davy Jones' Locker is a particular favorite, as well as the scenes at World's End, which somehow involves a giant, deep waterfall. Keith Richards' hyped cameo as Jack's father is nothing to go crazy for, he does a decent job, but his screen time lasts only about two minutes.<br/><br/>Director Gore Verbinski and his crew knew going into this that the reviews would be mixed and the plot would be confusing (in order to encourage repeat viewings), but honestly, at nearly three hours, the more the film confuses you the more it becomes an endurance test. Also, rather than providing a satisfying conclusion to the series, the end opens up the possibility for a fourth installment, which might not even happen. The crew put every penny of the film's budget on screen, made evident in the hour or so of its bloated climax. The film looks and feels like a true epic, shots are wide, locations are vast, costumes are extravagant, and the scope is large. However, the film needs to scale down its plot in order to let the characters we fell in love with stand out and shine, as that's what makes these films unique."

","...and so the two part Pirates 2/3 story (made to look like a 3 part by cunningly fashioning part 2 to fit to the original) comes to a conclusion and, in so doing, blows away a lot of the goodwill generated by 1 and maintained by 2.<br/><br/>This is a mess, and it is difficult to conceive that it was developed at the same time as the far-more-coherent part 2. There is nothing inherently wrong with the cast (although Keira Knightley is starting to get a bit tiresome in this one), performances or effects. It's all down to the script.<br/><br/>The problem is that there are too many factions and each one has its own agenda. You have Jack, Elizabeth, Will, Davy Jones, Barbossa, Norrington, Beckett, Calypso, the pirate council, and they all have different ships and ever-changing alliances and maguffins (especially Davy Jones' heart) switching backwards and forwards between them. It becomes very like a bedroom farce, only with pirate ships instead of bedroom doors, and with locked boxes, maps, and magic compasses instead of trousers which won't stay up.<br/><br/>This was not a complete disaster, but it was a definite disappointment after what had come before."

","If I'd had to choose a favorite installment from the Pirates of the Caribbean film, my choice would surprisingly go with 2007's At World's End. Back at the time it received some negative reviews. To me, however, it was the highest peak of the original trilogy (which started with Curse of the Black Pearl way back in20'03), bringing together plot threads and characters from the two previous ones and giving us Captain Jack in all his glory - as if to let the series go out with a bang. Obviously it didn't, since we got a fourth installment in four years later, but that's another story...<br/><br/>Anyway, to me, At World's End felt like a truly epic adventure, the culmination of the first three. Someone wrote elsewhere that as the series advanced, the films got bigger and bigger – and to me, this is a good thing.<br/><br/>The beginning with the memorable chant ""A pirate's life for me"" followed by the coin flipping and the title appearing on screen dictated the town of awesomeness that then followed. After that, the film was just filled with zany, wacky and hilarious adventures all jumping at you from all corners - the multiple Jacks stranded in no-mans land, the Keith Richards cameo as his father, the surprise twist with the Calypso character, the pirate brethren, the Chinese threat arising from the east, the countless twists and turns which followed our beloved characters from the previous films.<br/><br/>And finally, there was this bittersweet ending to the Will and Elizabeth story, that made you look back and remember this amazing trilogy and appreciate it for its entire extravaganza - especially this third chapter which, although at times convoluted, was the biggest, wackiest and most epic installment of them all.<br/><br/>I gave it 10 out of 10."

But overall when it comes down to it all, this trilogy is a amazing adventure that is worth seeing all the way through. This installment however seems pretty forced in some areas and although Capt. Jack was fresh and unique before, his character comes off slightly old in this. The plot comes off way more convoluted in this and yet not very memorable or stands out like the first movie in this franchise, while the supernatural aspects goes over the top. For a family movie, the convoluted plot gave the whole thing a negative direction instead of a positive one. It's good they tried to put more emphasis on the plot this time around, but the direction of it all wasn't crafted very well. However on a positive side the special effects are top notch in this and the visuals are really well done. The action sequences such as when the pirates are battling on land and on ships is amazing at times. Even if the creators of this flick tried a bit too hard to make it really epic since they though this is going to be the final installment and wanted to go for the grand finale direction.

","Okay, I seen this movie at the drive-in back in 2007, and I had a great time, and I enjoyed the movie. I even own the DVD, and have watched it a few times since seeing it in theaters. This movie is not horrible. It's not great, but it's good. 7 out of 10 isn't bad from me. The best scene was definitely the Maelstrom battle. Until the end it was great. But there were quite a few things I wasn't too thrilled with.<br/><br/>WARNING: SPOILER ALERT I was disappointed with Davy Jones' Locker. I expected it to be creepier, and more disturbing. Yes it was disturbing already with the hallucinations and nowhere to go, but isn't the Locker supposed to be a lot worse? I also didn't like that fact that Elizabeth didn't apologize to Jack for what she did. In my view, that conversation should have been in the movie.<br/><br/>I also didn't like how Will turned kind of sinister in this film. The Will Turner from the first and second film would never trade another's life for a ship. Even Jack wasn't going to do that in COTBP. That's explained in a deleted scene in COTBP BTW.<br/><br/>I was also disappointed with the ending. I'm not a big Elizabeth fan since she hurt Jack, but there are a lot of Will and Elizabeth fans who were heartbroken over seeing them separated for ten years. Plus, Barbossa saving Jack and marrying Will and Elizabeth during battle? I could understand if they asked someone else to perform the ceremony but why in the world would you want the man who was going to kill you, not to mention maroon Jack and steal his ship be the one to perform the ceremony? I also didn't like that they killed off Elizabeth's father. He was a good guy, and didn't deserve that.<br/><br/>I think it would have been better had James Norrington still lived, been in the Maelstrom battle, and he would be the one to stab the Heart. That way he would find his place again, Will and Elizabeth could go on their merry way, and Jack could sail off into another adventure. It was also really disappointing that the Kraken was dead. That creature was awesome in DMC, and should have been brought back.<br/><br/>AWE is my least favorite of the Pirates movies, but it wasn't a bad movie, and was quite entertaining on some parts. The Maelstrom battle. I also liked the music in the scene when Will is saying goodbye to Elizabeth. And Jack and Barbossa's scenes always crack me up. :) Good movie, but not great."

After the appearance in the finals of a contented faces of Captain Barbossa and his faithful monkey phantom audience (I, anyway) and waited impatiently for the conclusion of this trilogy. A year later, we saw the conclusion ...<br/><br/>""Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End"" came out on Russian screens in May 2007 along with two other candidates in a record box office performance this season - namely, ""Shrek the Third"" and ""Spider-Man: The enemy of reflection."" However, the creation Verbinski has left behind (but not so far) of their competitors. ""At World's End"" - one of the most high-budget films in cinema history. The budget is nearly $ 300 million, most of which, apparently, went to the fees actors and special effects. Internationally, the picture has collected more than $ 900 million, so that Bruckheimer and co. with interest paid back on their expenses.<br/><br/>The plot without distracting from the framework of the previous parts. In my opinion, that ""At World's End"" is the best film of the entire trilogy. The script is great. So many plot lines, curves fit in pretty solid timekeeping (169 min.)! Totally unpredictable, but because the painting imparts more ""credibility"", the ending is only good as the regular plans of Jack and Barbossa suggest a short extension (""Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides"" is put into production under the auspices of the director's Rob Marshall, creator of Oscar-winning musical ""Chicago"" and ""Memoirs of a Geisha""). Cinematography (Dariusz Wolski) and music (Hans Zimmer) is not satisfactory. Everything was done professionally and efficiently. Developed special effects studio Industrial Light & Magic (ILM), so too write about it (just look at the world famous ""Star Wars"", ""Iron Man"", ""Transformers"" and the like blockbusters).<br/><br/>The cast is really inspires his stardom. The main trio - is, of course, Depp, Bloom and Knightley. The first and the last kept a stiff upper lip, but Bloom, as in ""Dead Man's Chest,"" disappoint. Not a very strong game. Also like Geoffrey Rush (Captain Barbossa), Tom Hollander (Cutler Beckett), Chow Yun-Fat (Xiao Feng), Bill Nighy (Davy Jones) and Naomie Harris (Tia Dalma / Calypso).<br/><br/>In general we can write as much about this film and about the whole trilogy, but fact is fact: ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" will forever in movie history, at least for the simple reason that this story was born thanks to a new unique image of Jack Sparrow."

"alucard0617","8","0","1","24 November 2010"," Good movie, but has some major flaws.
","First and foremost, this is a good movie, nothing more, nothing less. It's not groundbreaking or a movie I would immediately think of when someone asks me what are some of the best movies out there. It's just good.<br/><br/>Anyway, this movie serves as a conclusion to, what now appears, to be the first trilogy in Pirates of the Caribbean franchise. Does it serve as a suitable ending? No. This is the reason why this movie falls short, because there are so many things that were left in the open and so many characters were never used to their full potential.<br/><br/>For one thing, characters such as the Kraken and Norrigton were killed off with their potential never realized. The Kraken literally only shows up once as a corpse, why? The movie gives one line of dialogue that can be easily missed that explains how it died. This creature, who was such a great part of the second movie, should have been given a much more epic send off. I thought that so much could have been done with the Kraken, with the epic battles at the end, and was looking forward to the heroes making a clever and complex plan to finally destroy it. Some people say that it would've have been impossible for them to kill, hence why the creators just offed it. No, in these movies, and this one proves it, anything can be pulled off.<br/><br/>Norrington could have also been a great character to expand upon and become a pivotal character in the final battle. Nope, he decides to betray his side again and gets killed off, lame. What about Will's father? Oh, three scenes and absolutely serves no part in the story either. Speaking of betrayal, geez, was that plot point over down in this movie. In one scene alone, there are over five betrayals by the various characters. This is why this movie is so hard to follow, it's because it's complex. Complex movies have a well written story that has good twists and turns throughout the ride and comes together at the end. Here you have a convoluted story where the it seems the producers made it up as they went along.<br/><br/>Along with that the script was absolutely horrendous in this movie in which horrible lines are said in an epic and dramatic fashion. Ex: ""The ill material has become...ill-material"". I'm sorry am I listening to a speech by George Bush or a movie? In all seriousness though, this movie has dozens of horrible lines, from Jack giving a speech about cuddle fish that makes no sense, to Barbossa and Jack going back and forth like children. These two characters are way too clever to simply only come up with ""have to, have not"" as comebacks in an argument. The story, while overall good, has some seriously silly moments (Elizabeth becoming the pirate king)that are meant to be taken seriously.<br/><br/>Okay, by now it sounds like I hate this movie, so why do i think it good. The acting I thought was terrific as usual, especially Depp and Rush, despite the horrible script. The battle sequences and fights were amazing to watch and were very intense and kept my interest, the fight between Jones and Jack is particularly exciting. And despite some ridiculous plot points and open questions, the ending does feel closed with the character's stories tied up and all the villains and their plans distinguished.<br/><br/>Overall, this move was exciting, but could have been 10 times better if they used more of the potential of certain characters and plot points.

","The third (and final?) Disney pirates film may be, in fact, the best. Defying the idea that sequels are often weaker, this one has plenty of plot, action and even romantic twists to keep the fans interested.<br/><br/>Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) doesn't make an appearance until thirty-three minutes into the film. I think this is a great thing for the film -- while Depp may bring the crowds, having a film rely on him is largely a gimmick. Having to rely on the plot, or acting of Orlando Bloom is a much better way to go. If you can succeed on that, you have a great film -- and they do! <br/><br/>I should also point out the soundtrack. All three films have a decent score which is very unique and also listenable outside of the movie (though maybe not appropriate for night driving if you want to stay awake)."

","OK, so this film gets a lot of shtick from reviewers, but I like it. <br/><br/>That being said, there are a lot of things wrong with it. First of all, the storyline is far too complex and confusing to be understood on the first viewing. Or the second viewing, or the third... I've seen it loads of times and I still don't really get it. There are so many deals and agreements and betrayals that it's impossible to figure out who's on who's side and when. Secondly, it's a bit too long. And thirdly, Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley cannot act to save their lives, but bless 'em for trying. This doesn't matter so much, though, because they have Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush to pick up the slack.<br/><br/>The way I recommend watching this film in order to get maximum enjoyment out of it, is simply to NOT try and understand the storyline. Just watch, and the gorgeous cinematography and funny dialogue between the characters will do the rest. <br/><br/>In a word, this film is EPIC. And fancy. Very fancy. Lots of awesome outfits and special effects and fight scenes. And it's got Johnny Depp in it. That just spells out entertainment, no matter how many plot holes there are. <br/><br/>Despite this not being the film of the year, it's certainly worth seeing."

","I was more excited to see this PIRATES film than either of the previous when it arrived in theaters. The second film had left the series with an awesome cliff-hanger and I was desperate for resolution: Lord Beckett (Tom Hollander) of the East India Trading Company has found himself in possession of Davy Jones' heart and now controls the Flying Dutchman, Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) had just been eaten by the Kraken, and the remaining pirates were about to embark on a mission to bring their captain back from Davy Jones' Locker with a little help from one of my favorite characters of the series...Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush). It's the conclusion to the PIRATES franchise and so now it's time to tie up all loose ends, and there sure is a lot of them.<br/><br/>One of the primary complaints about this film is that it's entirely way to complex. I can't understand that complaint, and almost agree with it. At this point in the series, there are so many double and triple-crosses that it becomes almost a chore to keep up with it all. Upon seeing the film a few times, I've gotten a good grasp of it all and can now appreciate the depth the writers, Ted Elliot and Terry Rossio, managed to work into their trilogy. That's not to say the story's perfect, as there are a couple aspects I couldn't help but roll my eyes at. Jack Sparrow says it best in regards to the position of captain, ""They're giving the bloody title away now."" If you've seen the film, you'll know what I mean, as the characters of Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) are elevated to unnecessary proportions. Throughout the series, I've never really cared much about Will, and Elizabeth was a fine supporting character but my attention was always drawn to Sparrow, Barbossa, and Jones. We now have all three of my favorite characters in the same film and the focus seems to shift to Elizabeth and Will.<br/><br/>Despite this attention shift, the movie is still great entertainment. My favorite segment would have to be Sparrow's imprisonment in the Locker, in which he finds his personality each represented by another Sparrow and together they hopelessly crew a a grounded Pearl. I also enjoyed the sequence in which we are given a chance to view the Brethren Court of Pirate Lords and the colorful characters that populate the seas. Top it all off with an incredible final battle in the raging seas of a maelstrom and you've got some great fun. Depp, Rush, Naomie Harris (as Tia Dalma), and Bill Nighy (as Davy Jones) are worth seeing this film alone but it's also got the usual collection of talented supporting players. Seeing as how the film is complicated for first-time viewers and can be a challenge to watch at a (quick-paced) 2.5 hours, I wouldn't say this film is better than DEAD MAN'S CHEST but it's still a worthy addition to the series and a fine bit of closure."

","People always like to complain. Nothing is never good enough for them. Everyone have already decided that almost every damn sequel MUST be bad, and that exactly every third movie in a franchise MUST be terrible, accept for The Godfather 3. That makes no sense; because The Godfather 3 is one of the lamest movies I have ever seen in my entire life. And with this movie, Pirates of the Caribbean: At Worlds End, people whine and whine and whine. You hear them telling you all the time that the first movie of these is the best, and that the second and this one can't be as good. Let me tell you this - I first saw the first movie. I thought it was great. Nothing major special; but still great. Then the second movie came, and I was sold to it. It was even BETTER than the first movie. More jokes, more stuff happening, more charming characters, and you just wanna see more. ESPECIALLY more of Captain Jack Sparrow! Then came the third movie... and boy, what a movie this is. It IS the best one in the franchise, without a doubt. I still think all three of them deserves 10 of 10 - but this one is still the far superior. But as I said before, people love to complain as small crybabies. They say that there's too many characters, which there isn't. It's a pirate story; what do you expect? And they say the plot is bad written... yeah, sure. I have never seen ANY movie use their imagination even CLOSE to what they do in this movie. The Harry Potter movies' imaginations is like a single cell in comparison. Then, they also says the jokes are bad and old... yeah, that's why everyone laughed their asses off in the cinema, huh? Thing is; if you are a REAL fan of Pirates of the Caribbean as I am, you love all three of the movies. These could possibly be the best movies ever made in my opinion. I think though I know the problem - people are corrupt. I mean, if they watch the movies, they should obviously love pirates, correct? Then, these movies are everything you can wish to see, and even more. It's like that old TV-series Pirates of Dark Water, that they sadly enough canceled. Or like One Piece; only less crazy though. But I mean, what is there to not like with this movie?<br/><br/>They are planning to make a fourth movie; and I can undoubtly say that it's just wonderful that they want to do that. Captain Jack Sparrow on adventures beyond your own imaginations will never get me tired. Jack Sparrow and the Pirates of the Caribbean movies will always have a special place in my heart. We can just pray they won't make the fourth movie CG.<br/><br/>I give 10 of 10 to probably one of the best movies ever made. If you don't like it, I don't understand why you even bother to watch any pirate movie at all."
"Sirus_the_Virus","7","0","1","2 August 2009"," Pirates of the Caribbean: The curse of the trilogy.
","For years people have been saying that once a series gets to a third film, it will be the weakest of the series. Pirates of the Caribbean: At world's end fits that category. Pirates 3 was the worst of the three films. Also the most disappointing. There are many flaws. Problem #1: The film is way too long. Problem #2: Elizabeth ( Keira Knightly) becomes pirate king. She doesn't even have pirate blood. Problem #3: Elizabeth and Will (Orlando Bloom) get married during a sword fight. That really is retarded. Pirates At world's end has a conjoluted plot. Maybe not the plot but some of the things that happen in it are. Johnny Depp isn't in it that long. It sounds like i'm giving it a non recommendation. I am giving it a slight recommendation because the film has special effects galore and is entertaining at most times. Another problem, some of Pirates of the Caribbean 3 are boring. We don't care about the Pirate kings or anything like that. All we care about is the drunk Jack Sparrow who keeps the series alive."

","By this film, I had enough of the up and down relationship between Elizabeth and Will, I was fed up with them as a couple and individually.<br/><br/>Why I kept watching was because of Captain Jack Sparrow as he was still the only one that kept me entertained. I did enjoy the rivalry between Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) and Jack (Johnny Depp). It was so funny to watch them have a battle of wits against one another and compete for ownership of the Black Pearl.<br/><br/>It was brilliant to finally have Keith Richards in this third film, he was well worth the wait and really looked good as a pirate.<br/><br/>All the loose ends in Pirates 2 were tied up. Finally Will and Elizabeth married but I didn't care by this point. Davy Jones was killed and the crew released from their bonds and Cutler Beckett got his come-uppance.<br/><br/>As usual Johnny Depp is on top form and for me, again steals the show, really loved the scene where he escapes from Beckett's ship and the scene where he is in the locker going a bit mad with a crew made up entirely of Jack Sparrows.<br/><br/>The special effects really pushed the envelope particularly the storm scene which was so convincing and action packed."
"jangomac72","8","0","1","20 June 2009"," It's good but where's the fun gone?
","The so-called Pirates ""trilogy"" comes to a conclusion with the third film, filmed back to back with Dead Man's Chest, as Will, Elizabeth and the crew of the Black Pearl are led by a revived Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush returning after his brief cameo at the end of the last film) to Davy Jones's Locker to rescue Jack Sparrow before war is waged on the Pirate Brethren by Lord Cutler Beckett (Hollander) and the East India Trading company.<br/><br/>Keeping up? Good, it's as convoluted as it sounds!!! And that is part of the problem. As before, the filmmakers get so bogged down in the various subplots and double dealing that you feel you should get a free leaflet with the purchase of every disc in order to keep up with the plot! In trying to retroactively shoehorn in the two sequels into a trilogy with the first Pirates movie, the writers, once again, lose that sense of fun that made the first film so great. It's only in the films closing battle that the film gets anywhere close to re-capturing the magic of the first film again.<br/><br/>What does work? The cast obviously led by Johnny Depp, his continued quirky turn as Sparrow makes these films worth watching. The film benefits a lot from the return of Rush's Barbossa whose chemistry with Depp enlivens the film as they try to captain the same vessel, the Black Pearl. Bloom and Knightley continue to do good, yet not outstanding, work as the star crossed lovers whilst the rest of the cast (Crook, Arenberg, McNally, Skarsgard) fill out their roles amicably, plus Keith Richards has a nice cameo as Jack's father, Captain Teague. Production and costume design as well as superb FX from ILM continue to shine throughout the film.<br/><br/>An honourable mention should also be made of the ending of one of the plots. It's all too rare in Hollywood these days that filmmakers make the right decision and go for the natural ending for their characters but I feel they got it completely right with Will & Elizabeth's arc. Without going into spoilers, it was a bittersweet conclusion to their journey and you do get the feeling that they could so easily has waved a magic wand and gone for the easy and obvious happy ending. I glad they didn't.<br/><br/>What doesn't work? Well, as mentioned before, the convoluted script really doesn't help at points. Such twists and turns are made that unfortunately sideline the excellent Bill Nighy as Davy Jones who is hardly used in the film after the build up he received in the previous film. And once again the film is a good 30 minutes too long and, at times, gets very dark. The hanging scene at the opening of the film has to be one of the darkest beginnings for a summer blockbuster yet.<br/><br/>But again I really enjoyed the film despite these faults. I actually think that the two sequels work far better as a two part movie rather than part of a ""trilogy"" with the first film remaining a stand alone adventure.<br/><br/>As mentioned at the beginning, Disney never planned for any sequels and were quite surprised at the success of the first film. The decision was then made to turn the series into a trilogy by picking up on the little bits of info briefly mentioned in the first film. Perhaps they should've made the films more stand alone instead? As before, an enjoyable picture but let's have a bit more fun for the next voyage 8/10 Speaking of which, with a Pirates 4 planned for release in or about 2012 I have three requests for the producers - 1) Make it a stand alone adventure, keep it fun and don't get bogged down in the self importance of your franchise. I'd be very happy to just see Jack and Barbossa chasing each other after the Fountain of Youth rather than have another nearly three hour overblown adventure. This isn't Lord of the (Yawn!) Rings! 2) Don't feel that there's a need to bring back every character from the previous films. As mentioned above, some character arcs have a natural conclusion. If they don't serve the story don't put them in.<br/><br/>3) Ensure you've got a working script this time rather than beginning production without one! Then you'll know where you're heading."
"Hellrazr360","9","0","1","13 April 2009"," At Series' End, At Finest End
","It's a bit funny that the third Pirates of the Caribbean film is titled ""At World's End"" when this is what we see and go through within the first thirty or so minutes in. And given the film's near three hour runtime, it leaves far more to the film than the title might imply. Yet this is rightfully so, given the introduced circumstances and cliffhanger ending to Dead Man's Chest. Going in the Matrix sequel route, At World's End saw itself released very shortly after its predecessor, especially for a sequel. Not surprisingly, both sequels to both franchises were met with very mixed reception, almost having nothing but lovers or haters of each of the films (unless I'm hearing talk of another Pirates of the Caribbean film series). That said, what's one more guy's opinion? <br/><br/>The two things At World's End seems to demand of its viewers are patience and multiple viewings. For a first viewing, it's quite easy to get lost with the plot in how it seems to twist and turn all over the place and makes the lengthy runtime seem inadequate in regards to fleshing the story out. Due to this, the film can be argued to have some pacing issues, though after seeing the film enough times the story comes off as far more cohesive and doesn't seem nearly as uneven in its pacing as before. While watching the same two hour and forty-nine minute film multiple times might seem demanding, it's ultimately worth it in the long run.<br/><br/>Other areas the film has drawn plenty of flak is in regards to the characters, the acting and dialogue. Yet this is another area I must respectfully disagree. While Depp and Rush might not be nearly as good or charming in this film as they were in Curse of the Black Pearl, they, as with the rest of the cast, do a more than sufficient job fitting back into their roles. Knightley definitely does her most charismatic acting in this film of the current Pirates trilogy (as of the writing of this review) which, admittedly can sometimes come off as over the top, though most of the time she fares well enough, and certainly a lot better than just about any other actress around her age would have. Orlando Bloom also at least deserves some credit for this film since he tackles a more down, serious and emotionally torn character. He's far from the best young actor out there, but as far as I'm concerned, he does a solid job in this film and, like Knightley, pulls off arguably his best acting job in the series. The rest of the supporting cast are just as well, with Bill Nighy standing out once again doing a great job as Davy Jones.<br/><br/>Easily the film's greatest strength though is its entire presentation. The film is excellently shot, with little to no lack of great cinematography. As with its predecessors, the special effects are top notch, and we get plenty of this demonstration in the last action scene towards the end. Speaking of the action scenes, while there's not too many of them, what are present are definitely amazing, with the aforementioned final action scene being quite impressive. Yet it's the film's amazing score that really sells the picture. While it hasn't garnered much attention make no mistake the score pieces throughout the picture are wonderfully placed and used to great effect. Many scenes in the film work so well thanks to the superb score. Not many films seem to utilize the potential of fitting score placement well enough, but this film pulls it off with ease and can easily win you over just for that.<br/><br/>Judging by what I've said, I think it's easy to determine my regards towards the film. One key reason for this is because this is a film that becomes more rewarding with each repeated viewing; another viewing lets me take notice of several things that really make this film so much more than the majority I've seen recently. Call it blasphemy, but I hold this film as superior to Curse of the Black Pearl and definitely higher than the sub-par Dead Man's Chest. This film feels more complete, doesn't suffer dragging on as much from multiple viewings (the one major weak point of the first film), has far less of the silly, unnecessary jokes which plagued the second film and wraps the trilogy's story arc up satisfyingly while leaving us curious as to what will happen next. Give the film the time and it will grow on you. Watch it once or little more than once and you'll likely hold in ""mid-series"" regard at best. Patience is a virtue."

","""Lord Cutler Beckett"" (Tom Hollander), who has declared war on piracy to the point that he will order the hanging of a child who is remotely associated with pirates, is in the possession of ""Davy Jones'"" (Bill Nighy) heart. Since he has the heart, ""Jones"" has no choice but to do his bidding, and goes after every pirate ship to destroy it.<br/><br/>However, the great pirate, ""Captain Jack Sparrow"" (Johnny Depp) is trapped in Davy Jones' Locker, and has to be released by the crew of his ship, which are being led by ""Will Turner"" (Orlando Bloom) and his love, ""Elizabeth Swann"" (Academy Award nominee Keira Knightley).<br/><br/>Let me say first that some of the scenes are hard to see on television. This is due to the shadowing and dark colors used in these scenes. I noticed that I was paying more attention to my computer than the movie during these scenes.<br/><br/>The performances, on the other hand, are as good as the last movie in the series I've seen (I have not seen the entire series, and do not recall which one was the last one I watched). Knightley is wonderful as the leading lady who seems to get in some trouble at times, but can fight back when needed. Bloom is nearly perfect as the charmer. Nighy is real good, but the animation effects on the tentacles off the character's face may be a little distracting to pay attention. And Depp is absolutely fun in what may be the role he will be remembered for when his time has come.<br/><br/>Another thing you can't help but notice is the wardrobes and special effects. The pirates outfits appear to have not been washed in about eight months, while the military uniforms appear to be authentic. As for the special effects, they are absolutely fabulous -- especially make-up effects. You can actually believe the actors faces are real and not prosthetics.<br/><br/>As for action, I wasn't too impressed. Because of when the movie is set, you get cannon fire and a lot of sword play. If you ask me, there is just a little too much going on with sword-fights involving most of the cast. In one scene, a ceremony takes place during one of these sword-fights. The fighting around the ceremony, which briefly stopped when one of the others came in to fight those involved, was pretty distracting. However, this scene got some funny moments, as intended.<br/><br/>I didn't think that the actors chemistry was not that great in this film. When Knightley, Bloom reconnect on-screen with Depp, it just didn't work that well if you ask me. I also found that there was little chemistry with the new cast members and the ones already established in the franchise.<br/><br/>Another thing I was not really impressed with was the soundtrack. Although the music enhanced many scenes, I just can't remember any of the music except the excerpt of ""A Pirate's Life"" sung by ""Sparrow"" to himself at the end of the movie just prior to the closing credits. Most of the tunes are instrumentals, and are done well. However, none are really memorable.<br/><br/>The script itself was kind of weak as well. I think the writers slacked off after the success of the first movie. The story is pretty good, though far-fetched with the story with the heart.<br/><br/>If you are a fan of the franchise, check this movie out. However, if you have not seen this movie, I strongly suggest that you watch the entire series due to the majority of the characters are well established in this film. I think only one or two characters had some character development in this film, and we learned some background on them. While other characters had little to no new development of any kind.<br/><br/>I would rent this one, and only add it if you have the other movies in the series in your video library."

","This sequel is much weaker than the earlier two films in the Pirates trilogy. Still its reasonably entertaining. Johnny Depp is absent in the first hour as the film focuses on Geoffery Rush, Knightley and Bloom. Rush is excellent as usual but the young leads are average. The opening fight sequence in the far east is disappointing. WIth Depp's entry however, the film regains its sense of fun. There's some demented humor and some striking photography as Depp is shown all alone 'at World's End'. There are double crosses galore, and things get confusing in the mid-section. Thank heavens for a rousing sea battle which occupies much of the final hour, as Sparrow and Davy Jones (a fine Bill Nighy) go head to head.

","The first POTC movie is a real gem and we all knew that a sequel would mean more of the same: Hilarious jokes, funny characters, great and exciting battle-scenes and still able to maintain a gloomy atmosphere. In fact POTC uses the same ingredients as Indiana Jones.<br/><br/>In this perspective, Dead man's chest + At Worlds end, were decent follow-ups. <br/><br/>Story/plot: While Dead man's chest lacks a good plot and makes you often wonder if the story will ever go somewhere, At worlds end has one too many, but at least you had the feeling that the story is getting somewhere. In my opinion, the plot of restoring the divinity of Calypso was unnecessary and it contributed to much of the confusion near the end.<br/><br/>Acting: The acting is not overly different from the previous movies. This movie doesn't include the best actors, but a good dose of humor and over-the-top acting makes up for it. In the previous movies, Orlando Bloom tried to be funny, which he never was. In fact he was more annoying than funny. In 'At world's end' he doesn't try to be funny anymore, in fact his character has become much more grim and depressed and this is a great improvement over the last 2 movies.<br/><br/>Music: The Score is terrific, just like in the other movies. I really liked it and I definitely plan on getting the albums.<br/><br/>Jokes: The movie includes various styles of jokes: Ranging from obvious slapstick moments, over-the-top acting, to extremely funny dialog phrases (""Slap me thrice and hand me over to my momma"" instead of ""Wow"" or something). When I watched the movie yesterday I almost rolled over the floor laughing.<br/><br/>Special Effects: Special effects are great except for the Calypso bit. A gigantic Jamaican women just looked stupid and I never understood the purpose anyway.<br/><br/>End: I see that many people are disappointed about the ending: William Turner becoming captain of the Dutchman, being separated from Elisabeth Swann, except for 1 day every 10 years (why cant he take her on the ship anyway) and Cap'n Jack Sparrow being bereft of his Pearl. Why does it have to be a happy end anyway? Although we all like Jack Sparrow, he is a terrible weak excuse for a captain. He is totally incapable of commanding a ship and the only reason people obey his orders is that they pity him or just like him (Biggs is practically the only one that is loyal to Jack no matter what). He runs, rather than stand and fight, he never takes responsibility for his actions but hides behind others. In my opinion it's highly unbelievable that he'll ever be able to captain a ship and crew for decades. Jack Sparrow is not a pirate, he is a dreamer who is in love with the sea. Barbossa is a much better captain and in my opinion it's only obvious that he successfully retakes the Pearl, although I feel sorry for Jack that he lacks the backbone to pursue his dreams."
"vip_ebriega","7","0","2","13 December 2008"," 3rd 'Pirates' movie has AWE-some effects, action.
","My Take: Though confusing, this third 'Pirates' movie isn't out of batteries just yet. <br/><br/>(Pardon me with using the abbreviations, but I guess you know exactly what they stand for.) Funny how the 2-disc DVD of PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: AT WORLD'S END which I got for Christmas included a list of the many questions asked by fans about this third, possibly the biggest, chapter in the highly successful, wildly excessive yet strongly executed series. But after seeing the film (having overlooked it for a very long time since its release), I realized what the list was for exactly. For, while the biggest most elaborate 'Pirates' of them all, it was also the longest and most confusing. While the first and the second film in the series had their own shares of overlong and muddled moments, POTC: AWE has probably the most confusing plot, not just of the series, but probably for any summer-action 'event' blockbuster for a very long time.<br/><br/>The new adventure, still penned by the originals' Ted Elliot and Terry Rossio, tries to tie up the loose ends from the previous chapter, DEAD MAN'S CHEST, and putting the big-budget series to a complete close (reminding me much of what George Lucas did with RETURN OF THE JEDI). But before the curtains drop, POTC: AWE packs in as much twists, unlikely conclusions and other goodies that the film is either too big to fit in the package, or the package is just too big to fit in to everyone's heads. Too much details, too much characters and too much conclusions make for one confusing escapade that's a bit too hard to follow. By this time, POTC: AWE would seem to drown its own vessel with its own cargo, but in comes Johnny Depp's hilarious Jack Sparrow, in comes the elaborate special effects and in comes are favorite characters which we all loved from the series. When they do, the show gives us exactly what we came for.<br/><br/>POTC: AWE may be too hard to follow, but it is exactly what we came for: A big-budget, go-for-broke action adventure that takes us on a roller-coaster ride that doesn't have a seat belt to keep you from falling from the edge of your seat. The 'Pirates' series has certainly evolved form the enjoyable, if somewhat overrated, CURSE OF THE BLACK PEARL. And while this one isn't as good as POTC: DMC, arguably the best in the series, it's still the biggest and most elaborate. In this third (and probably final) chapter, The gang of Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) and back-from-the-dead Capt. Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) is off to rescue Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp, still in perfect shape) from the legendary Davey Jones' locker, then do battle with their angry-as-hell foes including the corrupt Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander), the slimy Davey Jones (Bill Nighy) and an entire armada of battleships, leading to a 1-hour climax that only a talented action director and a team of creative special effects wizards can create, and the team behind this, and the rest of the film, is just that.<br/><br/>Director Gore Verbinski is a top-flight action director, here showing his best in the film's most action-packed sequences. On the other hand, he also shows his talents in humor in the film's funnier sequences, joined by Depp and Rush's hilarious performances (but I guess that goes to everyone). The special effects are still astonishing, the action is one thrill after another and the comedy is still sharp and hilarious. For pure action and comedy, trust this pirate! <br/><br/>Rating: ***1/2 out of 5."

","Long time after I finally culminated to saw The Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy, and indeed I think it was a good way to finish the story. To be honest, this latest film isn't as spectacular and successful as the others, but we must admit that it has good performances and excellent special effects, that are carried to the limit in a classic epic battle in a whirlwind, but even this the story itself alone, in other words, viewing the film as a single movie, it doesn't work and doesn't propose anything new rather than closing all questions made in the previous chapters.<br/><br/>For many this is the most boring of the three films, since they focused much of its story in the love triangle and history of Turner-Swann-Sparrow, which is actually good as we move further into the motivations of the characters and know closer his ""human"" side. To others this is the movie that puts less emphasis to pirates fights, but the battles here are much more striking than in previous deliveries and the effects much more detailed, the reality is that the film works well and fulfills its mission.<br/><br/>I was satisfied, it isn't the great film that I hoped but meets my expectations, especially given this kind of end to the film, something totally anti-Disney, because is a ""happy"" ending but not the circumstances that makes it in a sad way to finish the story, thanks to screenwriters Elliot and Rossio we can say good end to a story of pirates.

","As far as i am concerned the Pirates of the Caribbean movies should have stopped at the first installment. But since it was successful there was no doubt there would be sequels. Thats not to say that the sequels weren't good.<br/><br/>Ever since Lord of the Rings it seems that every third film has be the longest. Pirates has followed. Running at a unnecessary 168 minutes. The whole Pirates politics bothered me. It made the pirates seem less dangerous. The movie could have done with a few scenes being cut.<br/><br/>Again Johnny Depp stole the whole show. Without him this would be a 2/10 film. His hallucination scenes were hilarious. Also there wasn't a person who wasn't laughing when he had his scenes with Geoffrey Rush.<br/><br/>A strong weakness in this movie is the Elizabeth and Will storyline. It drags and drags and are not believable as a couple at all. <br/><br/>Curse of the black pearl is still #1. With Worlds End coming in 2nd place.<br/><br/>The Ending was done pretty damn well. With a final fight that will definitely get you sitting up in your seat.<br/><br/>The visual effects were top notch. I have to give mention to how realistic Davy Jones looked.<br/><br/>I recommend it if you have seen the first two movies.

"amugglenamedCaity","8","0","2","27 May 2008"," It's not rocket science.
","All I ever seem to hear about At World's End from the majority of people I come across is, ""It's too confusing."" How exactly? I know the characters all have their own hidden--or not so hidden--agendas and constantly back stab each other, but is it really that hard to follow? Will wants to keep Elizabeth safe and save his father; Elizabeth wants to be with Will and avenge her father's death; Barbossa wants to free Calypso, as well as steal back the Black Pearl from Jack; Jack wants immortality, and uses everyone in his quest to get it. Pretty clever of him once you notice that his plan is formulated from the first time we see him and gets strung throughout the entire film. I needed to see the movie a couple times before I caught every bit of this, but really. It's not rocket science.<br/><br/>I do have to say, though, that in order to follow along, you must pay close attention to the film. I know most people going to see a summer blockbuster don't want to watch a film where they'll have to follow along closely to catch everything, but you have to do so with this film, and apparently with its predecessor, Dead Man's Chest, as well. If you're looking to watch a film where all you have to do is sit and enjoy the show, then I'd suggest looking elsewhere. Unless, of course, you don't care about the plot and just want to see the amazing visual effects. You'll definitely hit the jackpot with this film if that's your only reason for seeing it.<br/><br/>Oh, and just so we're clear--as this film is classified as a sequel, that generally means that in order to understand it, you should see the first two before you see this one. That's just common sense.<br/><br/>Overall, I'd probably give this film an 8/10. While the eye candy, in more ways than one, leave you utterly breathless and in wonderment as to how they manage to make everything look so real, the script, as well as character development, are sorely lacking in certain areas. Particularly with Keira Knightley's character, Elizabeth. It's great to see a female character hold her own against a cast mostly made up of men, but I think the bar was risen a bit too high in her case.<br/><br/>Even with the somewhat lacking, cheesy script, the actors all seem to bring as much to their roles as they possibly can. Johnny Depp is as brilliant as ever. I mean, when is he not? Keira Knightley does what she can with her role; she plays the part well, no matter how Mary Sue-ish it turns out to be. We all know that Orlando Bloom isn't the best actor out there, but he played his part well in this one, I think. At World's End was a step up from Dead Man's Chest, at least. And who could forget Geoffrey Rush? Certainly not me.<br/><br/>Despite what the majority of people say, this film is not that confusing. Really, it's not. If my ten year old cousin caught onto everything the first time she saw it, then I'm pretty sure you all will be able to as well."

I thought Barbossa was definitely a great part of this film, all the scenes with him and Jack were the most enjoyable.<br/><br/>When getting the DVD, however, I found that I wanted to skip all those long and drawn out fighting/cannon balls/guns/romance scenes. This movie was just too long. They should have added more Jack and less Will. I loved quite a few of the scenes, like the one when we find out favorite captain is stuck in Davy Jone's Locker, having a hallucination that is filled with copies of himself. I also really enjoyed the beginning, even though Johnny was not present.<br/><br/>Though I first saw this movie in Finland, and the bottom of the screen had huge red subtitles in Finish and Swedish, I definitely loved this movie and would love to see more of these movies, and I am excitedly waiting for a 4th movie and 5th a movie."

I did find this a satisfying end to the trilogy (although there's word of a fourth movie with Jack and Barbossa). It was also a nice touch to bring in Keith Richards as Captain Teague, Keeper of the Code. Richards was actually quite good in the role; you could tell it was a cameo he enjoyed. He even got to play ""Spanish Ladies"" on acoustic guitar. This movie I classify as having the best marriage scene ever.<br/><br/>Watch it. However, watch the others first so this makes sense.

","Great cast, vast scope, decent writing and plot, excellent effects, fair directing - mediocre movie.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp drunkenly and flamboyantly swaggers through yet another piratical farce as Jack Sparrow, the apparently dead captain of The Black Pearl. Another dead captain (Barbossa - Geoffrey Rush), Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), Sao Feng (Chow Yun Fat) and the lovely Elizabeth (Keira Knightley), team up to extract Jack from Davey Jones' (Bill Nighy) Locker - a desert island where dead pirates end up. Why? Well, it's actually sort of unclear, but it seems that they want to end Jones' scourge and gain their freedom from the British fleet's persecution once and for all... or something. And oh ya, they bring along the goddess Calypso, bound ages ago into a human form by pirates, just in case she wants to help her persecutors fight against her former lover Jones.<br/><br/>Rush is great, Depp is amusing and the rest of the cast does well. The sea battles and visual effects are particularly good. But the film's meandering plot, and over-emphasis on frenetic visual activity detracts from its aesthetics and renders it merely entertaining in a very Disney way. Epic, repetitively paced and hyperactive, World's End is the least interesting of the Pirates of the Caribbean Series."
"irongliss","8","0","1","6 April 2008"," Great Ending to a Story
","Pirates 3 has a great combination of effects and stunts, along with an outstanding cast and crew, and the story allows it to tie up loose ends while allowing debate among fans as to what will happen next to various characters. By the time the Endeavor is destroyed, most of the loose ends are covered, with the fact that the pirates are once again free to roam the seas and the Royal Navy has been defeated, along with Davy Jones and his crew. Yet, we are still left with the question of whether or not Jack Sparrow, once again left to sail the seas in a dinghy, will find the greatest treasure of them all. Also, what will happen to Will and Elizabeth's relationship now that he is bound to the Dutchman forever, but is married to Elizabeth with a son. Many people might say that these are story lines to be picked up in Pirates 4, but I believe that they are left intentionally for fans to discuss and debate about and wouldn't actually be up to being the basis of a whole other movie. Though I would like to see Jack and the rest of the cast come back for more, I like where the trilogy stands now and believe that a fourth movie may end up being overkill. I enjoyed this movie a lot and the only reason it didn't get 10 stars is the fact that it was a continuation of Dead Man's Chest, which was still good but didn't measure up to number 1 or 3. I recommend this to anyone looking to watch a great movie."

","after the first sequel was just a little too long and convoluted to be fully satisfying, the pirates of the caribbean franchise is definitely back on track with its third entry. OK, it still runs a little longer than it ideally would and the plot still is a little more complicated than necessary, but these flaws barely register as everything else is amplified to the level of ultimate awesomeness. stunning cinematography, gorgeous costumes and sets, dazzling special effects and action scenes... the visuals are just mind-blowing. the movie also has a darker and more epic tone than the previous entries that makes it feel significant; fortunately, it still keeps a healthy sense of humor.<br/><br/>the characters still are what makes this franchise so great. Johnny Depp (as Jack Sparrow) remains the star and he has great chemistry with newly returned antagonist Geoffrey Rush (captain Barbossa). but the biggest surprise is Keira Knightley (Elizabeth Swann) as her character finally gets developed the way she deserves. she now definitely isn't the typical romantic interest/damsel in distress anymore, and Knightleys impressive performance gives the film a subtle, very welcome feminist undertone. more fantastic characters are introduced, most notably Chow Yun-Fat as Captain Sao Feng and Keith Richards as Captain Teague. my secret favorites, however, are Lian and Park (the twin-girls in the first scene with Yun-Fat) and mistress Ching of the Brethren court.<br/><br/>so, despite its flaws, at worlds end is so awesome that I've actually enjoyed it more than the original pirates of the caribbean. if this is the end of the franchise, its a graceful exit. if they'll keep making sequels, i can only hope that they'll be as great as this."

","*Contains Spoilers!!*<br/><br/>Okay, this has got me so angry. It seems like the third movie was just sped up so fast. They killed off practically every single main character. Norrington, Beckett, the Governor Swann, Sao Feng (Who BTW was barely in the movie to begin with and it seems like his character was pointless) Poor Davy Jones, and even the Kraken!<br/><br/>Did anybody else notice Elizabeth's kiss of death?

I would most certainly hope not!<br/><br/>I'm sorry, but I am rating this as a 7 out of 10 mainly because the script could've been written SO much better. So many people who died could've stay alive and some parts were very confusing. (I understood most of it, but had to explain a LOT of parts to family members who did not understand.) The battle scenes were great on the other hand, but just the script was bad. The acting was fantastic as usual, though. Don't get me wrong there.<br/><br/>Jack's father?<br/><br/>What was the purpose of him? Keith most definitely should not have been in that movie!<br/><br/>I read that Johnny wants 6 movies?

","""At World's End"" has a lot going on. A whole lot.<br/><br/>The most confusing part of ""At World's End"" is that nearly every main character has a subplot. Normally, I wouldn't see that as a bad thing in a movie, since I believe highly in character motivation and development. The problem that occurs in ""At World's End"" is that the subplots of the main characters overlap so many times through constant bartering and twists that it takes away from character development. Whereas ""The Curse of The Black Pearl"" had nice moments where characters would intermingle and development would take place, ""At World's End"" suffers from having too many of those moments that are too brief and convoluted to see development. It is just too complicated, and even with repeated viewings, you will have trouble making sense of things.<br/><br/>What ""At World's End"" does have going for it are the two key subplots to the overall story that work nicely into the climax of the film. Understanding what these subplots are helps to make some sense of where the film is going and actually highlights key characters. The trick to enjoying these subplots is in keeping track.<br/><br/>What is disappointing for me is that there isn't much time for the actors to really bring their stuff in the movie. ""At World's End"" continues to have a great cast, but the convoluted story doesn't allow many opportunities for them to stand on their own and play their character to their greatest potential. But there is praise to be given: Bill Nighy and Naomie Harris flesh out their characters very well, and there is a definite chemistry between them that is one of the highlights of the film. It will be something to look forward to in seeing these actors play their part in ""At World's End"".<br/><br/>Overall, this is a fairly good film. It suffers from being overly complicated, but there are nice moments between characters that can be looked forward to. I'd recommend watching it after seeing the first two films, as a lot of ""At World's End"" continues from them.<br/><br/>Rating: ** 1/2 - Fairly Good"

OK, the embarrassing cameo by Keith Richards was pretty awful, but other than that this was a great pirates movie!<br/><br/>To pick up Captain Jack Sparrow is lost in Davy Jones' locker and its up to Barbosa, Elizabeth and Will to rescue him, this is handled well as they travel to Singapore to enlist help from Chow Yun-Fat. Cool sets, the movie didn't stint on the seedy feel of southeast Asia and some of the humor was spot-on here! <br/><br/>After Jack's rescue they journey to Pirate's Cove on Shipwreck island for a final showdown with the English, Davy Jones, et al. The effects are marvelous and the action first-rate. Johnny was terrific, even though we've seen this trick performance before it was still fun. Keira Knightley never looked lovelier and Bill Nighy managed to give some heart to the squid-faced Davy Jones, no easy feat. There were plenty of plot twists and surprises and the movie moved well considering its 3 hours long!<br/><br/>Please note they didn't take the easy way out with Will Turner and his doomed Dad Bootstrap Bill.

When Disney advertises movies as being a great adventure should I consider it a crap shoot in entertainment? Why was it boring? I was looking for action since they are all swashbuckling pirates and there was a lot of dialogue. I just didn't think that a pirate movie had a drippy, tongue gagging, love story written into it. Oh well, maybe Pirates 4 will have more swashbuckling, intelligent story writing, etc. than the last 3."

","This review is written per the DVD release so the comments below are for that DVD package the 2 disc ""special edition"" & of the movie itself:<br/><br/>The last film of the series (maybe) is my least favorite.<br/><br/>Not as fun as the first two films. How many spoilers does 1 want here?<br/><br/>Killing off multiple characters (will not say which here not to spoil the surprise to someone who has not watched the film yet) except to say 1 character brought into this film alone & with the notable actor playing the part gets killed off what half way through the film. Badly done Disney.<br/><br/>I did enjoy, like in the 1st film, the lines taken from the Disneyland attraction.<br/><br/>OK, the problems with the DVD package:1. Those HORRIBLE, little flip open plastic cases I hate these things!!! 2. Disney giving away spoilers INSIDE THE DVD PACKAGE!! I did not get to see the film in the theater, so when I bought the DVD & saw the packaging/inserts inside 1 of them gave away plot points. Disney, you should know better than that. 3.

","*Big spoilers in this review.* <br/><br/>Now I watched this last night, so I might be forgetting a few things. The movie starts off with a long line of people waiting to get hanged, and repeated pulls of ""the lever"" to hang people. After about three pulls, a little boy is to be hung, and before he hangs, he starts to sing this song which we find out later, I guess, forced these great pirates, nine of them, to meet, ""The song has been sung,"" Barbossa says to another pirate lord. Cheery, start.<br/><br/>Here are some, not all, of the plot lines in the movie: <br/><br/>The stabber of Davey Jones' heart must take his place as Captain.<br/><br/>We find out that Tia is some super lady named Calypso with some sort of powers, and she brought Barbossa back to life so that he can assemble the 9 pirate lords to free her. Barbossa plans to use her to save them against Beckett and his armada.<br/><br/>Tia is the one that Davey Jones loves, and she loves him.<br/><br/>Davey Jones was suppose to be ferrying souls that died at sea to somewhere, then once every 10 years he gets to go ashore.<br/><br/>The reason Davey Jones was so mean is because Calypso didn't meet him after 10 years, and the reason why he won't ferry souls back and forth, and the reason why everyone is turning into sea critters.<br/><br/>After being dead, Jack schemes the whole movie to stab the heart so that he can sail forever.<br/><br/>Will and Elizabeth play hatesies throughout most of the movie so that you can wonder if they will ever get together. Then miraculously Will proposes in the last battle, and Barbossa marries them in the middle of that battle, which is just in time for Will to take a fatal stab in the heart.<br/><br/>People come back to life right and left, yet Will getting stabbed is somehow permanent. Shows how bad a movie is when you don't think that a main character getting killed is serious. ""Oh that's not serious, they can just resurrect him.""<br/><br/>Calypso (Tia) with all her awesome power gets freed, and right afterwards Will tells her that it was Davey that got her locked away in human form all these years. Supposedly, she has a deep love for Davey as well, yet after being freed, she never talks to Davey, sees him, confronts him with this new information, or anything, but create a big whirlpool with the Black Pearl and the Flying Dutchman in it. That's it. They spend all that effort and time in the movie, and that's all she does, turns into a crabs and makes a whirlpool, LOL.<br/><br/>Every single main character (Asain pirate, Barbossa, Tia, Davey Jones, Beckett, Jack, Elizabeth, and Will) has their own backstab plan, and a side plan to go with that, and they intermingle with about half of the others. It's literally impossible to keep them all straight. So right before the end, the combatants come ashore to talk with one another for some reason, the outcome of the parlay is to trade Jack for Will, and I was like what the heck was that all about? Davey Jones's locker looks a lot like the Utah salt flats with an ocean in the unseen distance.<br/><br/>You get to Jones' locker by sailing to Antarctica, off the edge of the world, and down a waterfall which will wash you ashore next to the desert next to the Utah salt flats.<br/><br/>So at the end we are treated to Will and Elizabeth being in the same position that Davey and Calypso were in. So they can meet once every 10 years, and we, the viewing audience, knows that it will work out since they have such a strong love. But wait a second, Will is dead, and supposedly will not age. Elizabeth will age normally, and is expected to meet him once every 10 years. What kind of relationship is that, and who would expect someone to wait 10 years for them. Why not have Will pull a Davey Jones and bring her into the crew.<br/><br/>The ending was as convoluted as the movie."
"ZekeRage911","7","0","1","28 November 2007"," Better than the last one by far, but still flawed
","I pull no punches here. I disliked the last one so thoroughly that I couldn't help but like the introduction scenes to this one. Much more grounded, better paced, with more subtlety and originality. Where Dead Man's Chest opened with characters narrating the plot to each other, this one opened with the plot in motion where we were able to follow along without major irritation or insults to our intelligence.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, this film suffers from many of the plagues of the last one. Namely: Unnecessary complications due to pointless treachery. Let's think about this for a moment. The last film had Commodore Norrington relieved of command. In the opening of this film, he is Admiral Norrington. We sat through over two hours of Norrington's scheming only to find him back where he started, slightly ahead, and then when he finally shows some redeeming qualities, he's killed. Does his character even have a point? If he'd been written out of the last two movies, they'd easily be half an hour shorter, more direct, and less ridiculously convoluted.<br/><br/>Next is Calypso. Why is she being introduced NOW?! Everyone who spoke well of the last movie said it was setting up for this one. Why are we learning that this odd witch with an accent is actually a heathen goddess? Wouldn't this information have been relevant twenty bucks and four hours ago? Then, the sudden parallels between Elizabeth and Will and Jones and Calypso is again introduced far too late. Not to mention Davy Jones death scene was horribly anti-climactic. He falls over. He just falls over. And of course, the really evil bad guy, having almost NO set up whatsoever is given an incredibly overdone sendoff as his ship explodes to splinters around him, and he stands amidst the chaos untouched. Why? What was the freaking point? I could understand if he'd been introduced as the most fiendishly evil corporate criminal in human history (not to mention the first) but he's glossed over. He's just sort of cast aside. He was far more threatening in the last film, and he didn't even DO anything. Also, why are the nine pieces of eight introduced so haphazardly, when they are a major factor in the plot? And what effect does releasing Calypso actually have on the world?<br/><br/>While I did enjoy the story, and the ending was at least satisfying without being needlessly cryptic, the movie has too much of a forced epic feel to it. As if the writers were far too concerned with twists and turns to remember that the story is going to end a certain way, and anyone with half a brain can see it coming the second Elizabeth is referred to as Calypso. It's about as subtle as a cannonball.<br/><br/>Now that all of that is out of the way, here's why it's significantly better than the last movie. Captain Jack is back in his natural character, being a goofy, well-meaning rogue who is essentially selfish, but pragmatic and not one to slaughter just for the sake of slaughter. Will and Elizabeth finally have real tension again, instead of that forced back and forth, I'm a prisoner save me, relationship (that went in BOTH directions... a LOT.) Davy Jones is no longer the cartoonish slimy bad guy, but a character with depth and, believe it or not, actual motivation and direction! The action scenes are darker, and while still don't always move the plot along, they're not quite as obvious a waste of time and special effects money. I never did like the Kraken, so I'm glad it was dead. It just seemed to make Davy Jones too damn powerful (and where did he GET the damn thing from anyway? Why not sharks with laser beams on their frickan heads at that point?) Jack's goofiness is finally revealed to be part of a real psychosis, entertaining though it is, and allows us to see he's actually able to see the consequences of his actions, even if it's a bit cartoony at times. Overall, the pacing is significantly better. Everything proceeds at the same speed, or at least, at the appropriate speed, with everyone acting in character, on target, and towards a conceivable goal.<br/><br/>So here's what I would have done. Cut out the middle of the second movie. Set up Davy Jones, the heart, Calypso, the love parallels, and the bad guy MUCH earlier. Write Norrington a better part, or kill him off altogether. Chop off the first 45 mins of the third movie and stick it onto the second. Then use the leftover time in the third movie to actually address all the unanswered questions and loose ends they failed to wrap up.<br/><br/>See, the problem is the first movie was a nice, self-contained story. When they decided to make it a trilogy, they just tried too hard. Someone should have distracted Bruckheimer with a shiny object and then a professional editor should have looked at the scripts, and sat down with the writers to make some changes. So instead of a brilliant and awe-inspiring epic trilogy, you have a flat roller coaster that spins you around until you have no idea what's going on. Seriously, with a little extra time and effort, this could have been an Oscar sweeping series, AND a blockbuster franchise. I mean, would it have killed these guys to spend one or two more weeks on the script? Hell, I'll do it for free next time! Seriously!"

Trinity,Morpheus and the Chinese guy go to rescue him. Jack sparrow is trapped inside Davy Jones locker. Elizabeth swan ,will turner,Barbarossa and monkey go to rescue him from worlds end. Notice anything similar. all the third installment of popular trilogies. All have the favorite character trapped somewhere. Its getting boring guys . Think of something new. I was really looking forward to AWE 's release. Captain Jack Sparrow being a major reason .In the end the movie disappointed.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp was amazing.The graphics were out of this world. There were lot more ships and battle scenes. Amazing cinematography.Acting was top notch( Keira knightley and Chow Yun Fat excluded.) what went wrong??? answer "" the script. Clearly it was written without care. Just a reason to bring back characters and use some graphics.1d10ts. They forgot why we love pirates so much. 1. Jack sparrow. 2.pirates..they re supposed to be bad guys who loot,steal and plunder, hide treasures on some unknown island,get cursed.,killed. ,have a code(which they don't follow). we love law breakers don't we ? 3.reality with a shadow of the supernatural. we had immortal skeletons and people who looked like they came from a sea food buffet. but we also had cannons and sword fights . there was rum. the hero was human, he was selfish and cunning.<br/><br/>what did they do. no jack for 33 minutes. and no intro for him either.and he doesn't get enough screen time.They show will ,Elizabeth for so long that we get tired of them. Barbossa is a good guy now. what a stup1d concept.(especially him marrying will and Elizabeth.)Pirates are the good guys here.Sort of rebels and the British commander is a bad guy. Seriously ..could u hang children like that in public??reality is a myth in this film. The ocean opens into a water fall!!and the crew survive the fall!! After surviving the fall all of them come ashore a beach and the waterfalls is nowhere to be seen . just the ocean. Don't tell me they all swam all the way to the shore.. including monkey!!!!. All the Davy Jones and calypso sh1t was just irritating( especially the calypso cr@p).If we wanted to watch that we could catch harry potter instead. The final scene promised so much and delivered so little. It was not even thrilling. i guess we were all waiting for the movie to end.<br/><br/>This series still has life..it still has Johnny Depp.I hope there is a fourth installment and it better wash away the sins of this movie.This movie is what temple of doom was to the Indiana Jones series. Gore Verboski has directed good movies (pirates,mouse hunt,ring etc). All the hype got to him and unexpectedly disappoints. I am beginning to hate sequels,What with spidey3,potc3 and shrek3 being a shadow of their originals. The producers aren't going to realize that as long as the cash registers keep flowing.<br/><br/>jack sparrow: everybody freeze..i ve just dropped my brain!!!!"
"dv-rec","4","0","1","19 November 2007"," Too much from everything results in ""nothing to remember""
","Well, just how it is with all monster trilogy/sequels ""Pirates..."" has to be even more bigger and spectacular as the first two ones. And it is, the movie is far more than two hours long, there are more characters, more tricks and more plot lines.<br/><br/>Everything starts really cool and after the first 30 minutes without Johnny Depp we feel still fine with what's happening. And then, Sparrow arrives, does weird one-liners, jokes, moves and everything, and we still feel fine, because we liked the first movie - in a way. After about 50 minutes we still believe there has to be a believable story behind all this, and after about 80 minutes we were confronted with even more mysterious plot lines and desperately hope that everything fits together in the end...<br/><br/>But, this does not happen. Instead we are confronted with lots of ""this is my ship, get your own crew, get off my ship, let's enter the other ship, and where is the plot anyway?"". The result is really boring after half of the film and continues 'til the end, which is even more disappointing. In conclusion, there is nothing we can follow through the film, just the hope that a final showdown will solve all our problems. But if even this showdown fails, the whole film remains in our minds as just an bombastic pirate movie-clip with nothing to remember at all.<br/><br/>And Johnny Depp? Well, we plays his role just like before, which was basically great in contrast to the other characters and a quite simple plot. But this time - within all this chaos - his character somehow lacks any believable profile, so that he emerges into ""something weird"".<br/><br/>Overall, this movie lacks too much of those basic things that makes a movie really watchable over and over again."

","Oh this was a god-awful end to a good series. What made the first two so good was a put-together story, and this movie was all FX and convoluted plots. Bloodrayne went bad fast, this monster of a rotten tomato killed you slowly. Jack himself got lost in the whole mis-thought-out plot, and the foolish twist with Elizabeth and Will just left it rotten to the core. When Calypso emerged from Tia's form, I don't know about you, but I didn't see what that was all about, and then she leaves them, so how DID she really get her revenge on Jones? Oh-it must've been the treat she left behind--a real deal at Red Lobster I'm sure. Put this stinker in the can, it's been left out too long."

","This is the adventures of the pirates who must align themselves to fight against the British forces.<br/><br/>I am bitterly disappointed by this movie. The second Pirates of the Caribbean movie was entertaining and fun, and yet this one drags on and on. The storyline is very confusing and is often incoherent. One minute they are in an ocean of ice and another minute they are in the desert. It is not helped by the flood of minor characters present, and most of them are dispensible and appear for a few minutes just to take up screen time. Calypso's accent is ever so hard to understand, and I barely understood a thing she said. The jokes are not funny, and there is hardly anything entertaining with the film. The constant fighting, which is supposed to be exciting, gets tiring after 2 hours. I feel very bored with the film. I regret watching it."

","The first is ALWAYS the best. The second fell short for me. And the third, great. It was a confusing plot, no doubt. You have to pay close attention. But the action is great, the romance, humor, acting, everything is great. Why give it a nine? Well, the ending and the how much to threw into this movie.<br/><br/>In my opinion, they could have cut down on a few scenes and made it not so long. And the ending should have been different. Jack should have sailed away on the Black Pearl and Elizabeth should have /somehow/ gotten to be with Will.<br/><br/>But I saw what the writers did with Jack and Barbossa in the ending. Everything was set up just how it was in the beginning of the first movie. Catchy touch.<br/><br/>The acting, once again, superb. Captain Jack, my favorite, shined once again. You never become bored when watching him, or Johnny Depp.<br/><br/>Keira Knightley truly is growing in her acting. She's gorgeous and I hope she does well in the acting business. She has what it takes.<br/><br/>Orlando Bloom.. well, he could use some work. And a haircut. I enjoy Will Turner, but Orlando Bloom is on the bottom of the list.<br/><br/>Barbossa. I loved that he's back. One of the best villains around! Geoffry Rush is an amazing actor and fits perfectly into the cast.<br/><br/>Bill Nighy couldn't be better as Davy Jones. And the visual effects put into this character! Wow! Overall, this movie was great. But the first movie is still number on my list. I'm hoping there won't be a 4th. That would be too much.<br/><br/>Great job all the same. Pirates is amazing."
"drgrozozo","7","0","1","13 October 2007"," try that again
","Well I loved original Pirates very much. Second part had it's moments. So I was anxious for number three. First off, this is visually spectacular movie. I watched it twice and I'm bound to buy a DVD. It's adventurous and long, as I like it. <br/><br/>But besides that it doesn't deliver too much. As for cast, Yun-Fat Chow is a great addition, Kevin McNally gives his standard enchanting side-kick part, and Geoffrey Rush is simply BRILLIANT, I'm really glad this sequel returns masterful captain Barbossa into play. On the other side Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom are leading in their horrendous acting that's getting worse from sequel to sequel. My favorite Johnny Depp with the help of the script slowly but surely crosses the line in overacting his Jack Sparrow making it less and less attractive. Keith Richards role is superfluous although acceptable. As for the story, it repeats the standard mistake of sequels, trying to tie up all loose ends and reveal everything mentioned in all other parts. We all saw that before with Star Wars and dissection of Anakin Skywalker mystery, but obviously makers thought why not, it brings good money. Eternal love, eternal suffer, some story concepts sound good but are laid down too weekly and they miss the spot. Big adventure, but if I ask you who, where, why, what at the end of this movie, I doubt you could give me a coherent answer. <br/><br/>So if you like pirate stories like I do, watch this movie for it's brilliant sets, costumes, photography and effects. What we could yearn for is masterpiece that this kind of visuals could bring if coupled with a better, more daring script. This could be a cult movie, forging and crafting peoples taste instead of blockbuster conforming to the bland average taste of masses. Well, let's wait for number 4 (pirates and the fountain of life as we learn), this movie is just good enough to make you crave for more..."

No redemption whatsoever. I can't believe how corny and clichéd the lines were. The first Pirates could've been a real classic had they not totally de-railed by money-hungrily making the second and third movies.

","1st watched 9/2/2007, 4 out of 10(Dir-Gore Verbinski): Plenty of action, comedy, and romance but overall a pointless movie-going experience once again from Gore Verbinski and the gang trying to turn a Walt Disney amusement park ride into a third movie for all the kiddies and adults to dish out their money on. There is a little more of the comedy aspect in this one than in the second turning the Johnny Depp character, Jack sparrow, almost into a silent comedian-type with all the shtick that he goes thru. The movie makers teased us with the upcoming Keith Richards cameo as Sparrow's father and the romance of Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley's characters blossoming into a marriage but these were very minor parts of the overblown and overlong 3 hour + movie that this one turned out to be. This adventure started in Singapore as pirates around the world(representing free men) are trying to unite against the evil British-like empire(representing the oppressive slave-based upperclass). Jack Sparrow is in Davy Jones's Locker going mad as he commands a crew of his own look-a-like's which leads to some funny scenes. Bloom & Knightley and others are trying to find him and free him from this other-worldly grave for one reason or another. They are successful, of course, and the battle begins. kind of. There are so many other elements to this movie too numerous to mention that just confuse the heck out of the thing to the point where you realize that all the dialogue is just going to lead into an action-filled climax, so as the viewer you kind of give up on the particulars and wait for this. This, in my opinion, is the fault of the director(if he can't make us understand the plot why include it at all??). Pieces of these specifics include a witch turning into A giant force of nature, the return of the Davy Jones ship and it's crew siding with the Brits, and a guy-girl romance with the hint of jealousy over Jack Sparrow, of course. All of this is thrown together into a money-wasting overblown swashbuckling adventure leaving the viewer looking at this watch wondering when it's all going to end. Oh Hollywood, when are you going to believe that the American audience is smart and has a heart instead of peddling us this junk as entertainment?? -- I guess never because we keep shelling out the dough so that another one can come out with the same senseless stuff as the one before(don't be surprised if there is a number four in this series and more...)."

Add to that a lot of ""boy that was convenient"" sort of moments, and you begin to ask yourself, how good a script was this to begin with? On the up side, the acting is decent, the effects are great, and there is even some humor. Just don't try to figure out why anything that happens matters."
"vdiane1580","6","0","2","14 August 2007"," Not the best of the 3 movies and too late for a spoiler
","I obviously love these pirate movies as I would not be commenting. Pirates 2 was the best of the trilogy, where Pirates 1 was a very good introduction to the series, Pirates 2 stole the show. Johnny Depp truly carried the first one as Captain Jack Sparrow. I remember saying to someone I just love this goofy pirate. Johnny is just great as Captain Jack Sparrow. Will played a great sidekick or should I say apprentice to Jack.<br/><br/>Pirates of the Caribbean Curse of the Black Pearl was the best written and acted. Pirates 3 was just too much. Too much as too many story lines, too much action where the previous storyline could have been explained. Too many villains to the point I could not follow the story. Jack's part was great, but Elizabeth was blown up so much she almost outweighed Jack. I loved the explanation of Tia Dalma, but it was just a bit too much. I can't wait for Pirates 3 to go to DVD so I can make sense of many of the parts and players. I did not like the ending with Will dying, but since he is immortal now, he can make an appearance in other installations of the movie.<br/><br/>Many people seem to think Jack and Elizabeth blended well together, but I don't. Jack was not the type Elizabeth would be satisfied with. She would always try to change him which is a big no-no. She was better with Will, he was a pirate through and through, but honest enough to satisfy her varying taste in men. Secondly, even though Jack has this youthful appearance, he seemed a bit too old for Elizabeth. I have never liked the way Hollywood put together romances with men to old for the female. It would never work in real life, not unless the man was extremely rich and the female is a good pretender. Jack is better off with the hookers, I just love the character, but he is a bit sleezy. One big hurrah for Disney, Jack's character is goofy, but extremely intelligent, handsome and witty. Perfect blend."

I saw this movie with some members of my family and with our small, little critics, this movie didn't really set well with them. It was a bit to long, and got a little to boring and hard to follow. The sensitive of us were a little horrified at a couple scenes (espically the beginning).<br/><br/>Comeback or setback, Pirates 3 is a good movie.

It really annoyed me. But I don't know why but I sort of still knew what was going on. It's just too hard to explain. And I want to explain it. Also, the Calipso thing was confusing. I don't know why she had to do with the movie and Davey Jones, except that she was his lover, and why when she was released she just suddenly attacked everyone with crabs? The ending was funny when people had the crabs snipping their tongues and stuff.<br/><br/>The positives, this movie was funny, and still continued where we left off, with Jack Sparrow and Davey Jone's locker and so on.

","There are two good scenes in ""At World's End"". At a runtime of 168 minutes, that's not a lot, but they are, indeed, excellent scenes. Magical even. The first is set in an otherworldly state of limbo. Captain Sparrow's ship is stranded in a featureless white nowhere halfway between the moon and Utah, without a drop of water in sight. Sparrow is not technically alone, but except for a few shape-shifting crustaceans, all the other inhabitants of the otherworldly plain are nothing but copies of himself. Small surprise Sparrow is continuously on the brink of madness. True, it's a dual rip-off: Vincenzo Natali's ""Nothing"" meets Spike Jonze's ""Being John Malkovich"". But the cinematic craftsmanship is magnificent, and the madman is, after all, Johnny Depp. He's been a safe bet as the offbeat nut-case ever since ""Fear and Loathing and Las Vegas"". The second scene features a weathered Englishman as the Keeper of the Pirate Code. Any more, I won't say. Who am I to spoil *both* scenes that make ""At World's End"" worth your while?"
"kinetsmac","7","0","3","5 July 2007"," A Great Film that needs a few barnacles scraped off (spoilers)
","Pirates Of The Caribbean, Curse of the Black Pearl, was one of the most surprisingly great movies I think I've ever seen in cinema. It had everything; a great plot, terrific characters, clever action, and dialog that reeked of both classic filmography and modern wit. To be honest, I really didn't expect a sequel, and if there was one, I truly didn't think it would be nearly as good as the original.<br/><br/>Wow. Was I wrong. Pirates 2, Dead Mans chest, came like a mighty wind, building wonderfully on past material and introducing some fantastic new faces to the cast, including the stunningly animated squid faced maw of the unforgettable Captain Davy Jones. Many people bash the sequel, saying it doesn't live up to the first, but that's likely because the first was so memorable that the second just seems to be caught in the shadow of it's greatness. I took Dead Mans Chest in context with the first as an extension of the story, and for that reason, I enjoyed it immensely, and in some areas I actually feel that its BETTER than the original. I figured it out pretty quick that if there was an out of nowhere sequel that there would probably be a threequel, ala-""Back to the Future."" I wasn't expecting the dark cliffhanger that ""Dead Mans Chest"" provided, but it certainly kept me in suspense about the third, and I was eager to see how the story would wrap up all the loose ends.<br/><br/>Finally, Summer of 2007, it came. Pirates of the Caribbean, At Worlds End.<br/><br/>And, Wow...it was...pretty good.<br/><br/>I wanted you to read my history with this series so you can better understand my feelings about the third installment. Perhaps with all the backtracking you can fully understand why I feel that pirates 3 is a good movie...but falls flat in the face of its predecessors. The hardest part of writing this review is that its difficult to pinpoint what's specifically wrong with this movie. Really, in terms of writing and acting, there's nothing fundamentally bad about it. But at the same time, there's nothing fundamentally GREAT about it either, and I think therein lies the rub.<br/><br/>As you watch this film, the first thing that might make you raise an eyebrow is the VERY abrupt and VERY dark opening. It's probably this, more than anything else, that damages the movie as a whole. You may remember with the first two movies the mysterious and intriguing openings that led you into the story, (No opening credits. YAY!) like in COTBP where you see young Elizebith singing a pirate song and in DMC with older Elizebeth alone at an empty, rained out wedding ceremony. In AWE, however, we're treated with something remarkably different. A bunch of men, women, and children getting hung mechanically by the British army for ""consorting with pirates."" I'm sorry, but this just struck me as a terrible way to begin the movie, especially one with such a wide audience age range. Plus, it just felt out of spirit with the series, which always had a sort of swashbuckling, light-hearted charm about it.<br/><br/>The entire script feels conflicted within itself. You get the distinct impression that there was some brilliant talent behind the keyboard, but they were working within a confined plot that was constantly holding them back. One can't help but wonder if they wrote all the cliffhangers in Pirates 2 without fully thinking out how they would work in the third. (I later found out on the internet that they didn't. The script wasn't even fully written before the filming started.)<br/><br/>Some stuff just feels pulled out of thin air, like the ""Ten Pieces of Eight"" malarkey or the idea that the extremely memorable voodoo witch from 2 is really the sea-goddess calypso in disguise. True, there was a super-hidden connection between Davy Jones and the witch in the sequel movie, and if you looked up the Davy Jones legend in literature you'd find out that Calypso was indeed the classic characters heart-breaking love, but the structure of this movie that leads to this discovery is shaky, to say the least.<br/><br/>There are some blazing moments of greatness in this film, most of them involving, you guessed it, Jack Sparrow. His dramatic return on a wave of netherworld crabs is truly awesome. And the ending battle is equally incredible, resulting in the most beautiful marriage of CGI and real-life combat animation you may see for a long time. Also, the dialog, while somewhat hindered by the confines of finally ending the series, is just as quirky and funny as before, with classic stooges like Jack, the two pirate guys, and those chumly soldiers from COTBP all returning in top form. <br/><br/>The ending, if you haven't seen it by now, is surprising. Very surprising. So surprising that many would say it sucks. I don't hold this opinion, but I will admit it irked me. I'll leave the final verdict on this little subject to you, the viewer.<br/><br/>Pirates 3 is probably the best threequel to come out of Summer of 2007, and that's a good thing. But at the same time, it takes some major risks with the franchise, and not all of them pay off. Pirates 1 still stands as a modern classic, if there is such a term, and its sequel is terrific as well. Unfortunately for Dead Mans Chest, its plot is irrevocable tied to its controversial prodigy, which I fear may drag it down to the depths of ""meh"" ness like a kracken dragging down a frigate. <br/><br/>Pirates 3 is a worthy addition to the franchise, but I can easily live with it not being added to my movie collection. But that's just me."
"Rcwilkinson123","8","0","3","5 July 2007"," ""Worlds End "" Is Laughable, Ridiculous
","Gore Verbinski and Jerry Bruckheimer went WAY over the top in the finale of this mega hit trilogy to the point that once the nearly three-hour-long strangefest is finally over, you walk out of the theater going ""what the heck was that all about?!""<br/><br/>Continuing the story left in ""Dead Man's Chest,"" Barbossa, Will, Elizabeth, Tia Dalma and the gang go to the World's End to free Jack from Davy Jones' locker. In the meantime, the East India Trading Company is using the Flying Dutchman and Jones as their weapon, with Jones' crew at Trading Company commandeer Cutler Beckett's mercy since Beckett holds Jones' heart as ransom. Before rescuing Jack, Barbossa goes to Singapore to convince Chinese captain Sao Feng to ally with the eight other Pirate Lords in order to release the mysterious Calypso from her human bonds in the lords' quest to find assistance in battling the Trading Company and the Flying Dutchman. <br/><br/>""Dead Man's Chest"" had enough digestible supernatural elements to accept, but the supernaturalness in this one you'll throw right back up, because it's so ridiculously weird. For example, a woman grows to over 200 feet tall; she is actually the goddess of the sea; she conjures what many would say is a completely over-the-top maelstrom; the giantess turns into thousands of crabs out of nowhere; crabs carry the Black Pearl across sand; Jack Sparrow is split into hundreds of Jack Sparrow; the ship mysteriously gets turned over into the sea to keep the day from expiring. Dumb, dumb, dumb! The characters and story is incredibly inconsistent, a product of a horribly written script. Don't be surprised to be disappointed by how it ends, both with the futures of Will and Elizabeth and Jack. It is clear that scriptwriters Ted Elliot and Terry Rossio had no more ideas and were plucking random, ridiculous things out of the air.<br/><br/>If you want to be weirded out, by all means go. But if you want a sensible while at the same time exciting adventure, go to something else."
"Pavel-8","4","0","3","3 July 2007"," Close your eyes and pretend it's all a bad dream.
","Batting third in the summer of the sequel lineup is ""Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End"". Shot simultaneously with last year's ""Dead Man's Chest"", this one picks up where that one left off. Which is to sayI have no idea.<br/><br/>Okay, that's not entirely true. When last we saw Johnny Depp's Captain Jack Sparrow, he was being swallowed by the giant sea monster Kraken, which means that he's now surrounded by himself in a strange sort of purgatory located, that's right, at world's end.<br/><br/>The story initially involves getting Jack back from Davy Jones' locker, which is necessary in order to save pirates from extinction, because (if you remember from the second one) the British Navy is holding Jones' heart hostage, and thus forcing him (he's the octopus-faced undead pirate) to exterminate the remaining pirates. If you were able to follow all that, good, because that's the most comprehensible portion of the plot. It's the trunk, from which plot lines and motives sprout like Hydra heads from every possible location, layering on additional story arcs that only complicate things. Hammering out all the whys and hows would take far more time and effort than such a movie is worth. Too often, the details of what's happening are fuzzy or uncertain, which is most frustrating because the plot is actually relatively simple.<br/><br/>Fortunately, that barely matters, because the point of the movie is to create moments and imagery that awe and enchant. On this level, Pirates 3 succeeds wildly. There are battles with visual effects so stunning that they are scarcely noticed. There's a great scene accompanied by wailing electric guitars that calls to mind the classic westerns of Eastwood and Wayne. The dramatic score is again filled with hard-driving strings and horns that rile adrenaline and make for an over-the-top movie experience. Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom are still beautiful people. There's a great cameo by a legendary rocker, and Depp still owns the idiosyncratic Captain Jack in every way possible. Just look at that poster! Is that not the epitome of cinematic coolness? All these similarities to the first two are good, but also part of the problem. Some sequels (""Shrek the Third"") get ripped because they are too different from their predecessors. Others get downgraded because they are too similar, which is the category that ""Pirates 3"" falls into. Many of the parts are good, but essentially it's is just more of the same, with an emphasis on the MORE. There is too much here in the almost three hour movie. Continuing the tree trunk analogy, the movie is an out-of-control tree that needs to be pruned back. Clip off those stray branches. Trim the bunny trails and betrayals. Shape the tree into a more presentable and palatable two hours plus.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: ""Pirates 3"" had its moments, and wasn't a bad experience overall, but the exhausting length constantly throws needless curves and double-crosses into the relentless fray. As my dad said at the end, ""I hope they stop."" 4 of 10."

"thousandisland","Null","0","3","30 June 2007"," Bad movie all around.
","I've figured it out. The fans are so loyal to this franchise now that they can't bear to speak an ill word about it, even though we now have TWO sequels that absolutely suck. Most of the negative reviews have mentioned the serious problems in this one, and they are very obvious, but I will summarize:<br/><br/>*Way too many characters and different ship crews, all with different motives. Impossible to follow or keep track of. Who is with whom? And why?<br/><br/>*No character development. There isn't much dialogue, period, but no one really learns anything or does anything interesting. Elizabeth is the same brilliant swordsman and pirate that she was (inexplicably) in the second one, and Will is still hardly in the movie at all, and has no interesting scenes. Then there are all the new characters like the Singapore pirates and the new English officers, whom we never learn anything about. They have no character whatsoever and I didn't even know their names by the end of the movie.<br/><br/>*Calypso... What a retarded plot device. No one cares about this character or knows anything about her. Half the time you can't even understand what she's saying, because of the accent. Then she turns into crabs and disappears; the whole thing was built up to be important, but actually it does nothing and is pointless.<br/><br/>*Confusing elements. There is no explanation for how Barbossa came back to life. Like a lot of the bizarre stuff in this movie, it is just assumed to be the case, and it is not questioned by anyone or seen as unusual. The new British naval officers in particular, are totally emotionless and don't find it remarkable to be working with undead mutant pirates. It's just like any other day.<br/><br/>*Not fun. Even if it doesn't have distinct humor, a movie like this should have charm and flavor like the first one did. But this is just dark all over with almost no fun moments. Sparrow is the only character who has any real life in him, and they milk that at the expense of everyone else. Even the enjoyable culture clash between Elizabeth, Will, and the pirates is totally gone now, because they are all pirates and act like they always have been, so there is no variety in character types.<br/><br/>I didn't walk out, because I was expecting it to get better at any moment, but it never did. There were maybe 2-3 good scenes in the whole movie. The rest of it was just mindless and overblown, and often very long. I am also surprised that it squeaked by with a PG-13, as it is the most violent so far and has one particularly disgusting and graphic scene. It is so weird how this stuff is considered ""ok"" for little kids, when the same content in any other live action genre would be out of the question.<br/><br/>Even weirder... Can kids really sit through this?? At my showing, even the adults were restless and clearly not entertained by this long and confusing saga. I would think anyone under 10 would be crying or begging to leave, purely out of boredom.<br/><br/>At the end of it, there is a pretty distinct setup for another sequel. I will definitely be skipping any more to come."

The film even starts in a place that is not in any of the other films and does not explain the story of getting there and is weak on determining the point in which being there. The best part of this film is the acting by Johnny Depp and the situation in which he is in at upon first seeing him. The film doesn't even have the phenomenal script as ""The Curse of the Black Pearl"" did. The film's main problem seems to be finished with ease and not much time. This is quite the worst Pirates of the Caribbean film made yet. Out of the three hours in which you will be seeing the film, only the last hour has entertainment without major confusion."
"funkyfry","3","0","3","27 June 2007"," Another poor sequel
","Speaking as someone who greatly enjoyed the first ""Pirates"" film (heretofore referred to as ""POC"") -- which I saw in the same drive-in where I saw this 3rd installment -- I have to say I find the whole situation pretty sad. It's a reasonably entertaining film in a way, although you'd best be advised to put your brain in neutral to avoid the possibility of headaches and nausea. But where P1 featured fiery dialogue that brought life to the trite events of the film's plot, this film tries to build up a complex story and leaves the characters hanging on a limb.<br/><br/>A big part of the problem, I think, is that while in the original film all 3 of the major characters' motivations dovetail into one enveloping plot, for the 2nd and 3rd films the writers have taken them off in separate directions and never seem to really be able to bring them back together again in a convincing way. Whatever resolutions this (hopefully) final film has to offer feels likewise disconnected and forced. There are characters such as Calliope and Davy Jones who have been made major plot motivators but about whom I personally felt forced into caring about. People seem to disappear and reappear in other places for no reason other than the demands of the film's twisted plot. The skeleton pirates from POC were absolutely classic, but the fish-person HP Lovecraft-reject hammerhead sharks and so forth never had any charm or personality, and this 3rd film doesn't even have the imagination to supplant them with a new or more interesting menace. They don't even look good on screen IMHO -- they look like they just walked off the set of a 1980s episode of ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"". In particular I never cared for Will Turner's dad as a character -- he was better left in the audience's imagination. We do see a kind of ""Council of Pirates"", but for me it just brought back painful memories of the silly made-up villains of ""Dick Tracy"".<br/><br/>All in all I would argue that the writers totally lost sight of the things that made the original film so much fun. They made the classic mistake -- just like Lucas in the mostly awful ""Star Wars"" sequels -- of turning something that's essentially a pulp-styled adventure film and trying to turn it into a ""LOTR"" style epic. They completely the missed the appeal of Geoff Rush's Captain Barbosa -- in this film he is neutered of all menace and therefore his words and actions carry no weight, like a shadow of the original character. I would rather he just not be in the film; it's pathetic that the freaking monkey got more screen time in these sequels than Rush.<br/><br/>And of course you have to mention Depp's Jack Sparrow. It's easier to analyze plot weaknesses and so forth than to talk about a performance, but the performance really has lost a lot of the spontaneity and energy that it had originally. Again I think some of this is basically unavoidable -- after all, Depp has already created the character so he's not nearly as challenged or engaged in this film as he was in POC. But part of the problem is, again, that lack of menace. We now see Jack Sparrow as essentially a good guy and no intelligent viewer is going to be confused by the film's meager attempts to keep us guessing at his motives. with all the major characters firmly established as ""Pirates"" (and even a ""Pirate King""), the mystery and sense of danger from POC has gradually been watered down to nothing.<br/><br/>Then there's also the fate of one of my favorite supporting characters, Commodore Norrington (Jack Davenport). In POC, he was given some surprisingly complex character development -- he begins as a stuck-up rival to Will Turner and ends up becoming a friend to the heroes. The 2nd film reversed his character development as if the end of the film hadn't even happened, and this film basically recycled his character transformation from POC, with the same idea but of course now with no surprise or charm. In fact the scene where he rescues Elizabeth feels very rushed, as if the director didn't want to do the scene at all.<br/><br/>What more could I say? I'm just very disappointed that a film that really exemplified to me the highest possibilities of the so-called ""popcorn movie"" has been turned into a series just as pointless and dull as ""Resident Evil"". I hope they make no more of these films and I hope that I never have to see it again."

Enough is enough, there was no story to begin with, and we forgave them that..but no more...I like Johnny Depp and no doubt he has bills to pay, but I never want to see him ponce around like that ever again, it's pathetic, the only bright spot in the whole thing was Keith Richards, he has actually got screen presence, and knocked everyone else off the screen in his brief appearance...not worth waiting a whole 2 hours for though.

This time my head hurt from all the CGI's. The fighting scene near the end where they're intertwined in the swirling vortex dragged on, was one big special effect and didn't really make the movie any better. Here are a few other random questions about the movie:<br/><br/>-Was it really necessary to kill Will and make him the captain of the Dutchman? I hated that! (remember, I'm the hopeless romantic) -What was the point of releasing Calypso? -3 hours long??? man, they could have easily shaved off 1/2 hour off the movie -How many times did Jones need to ask ""Do you fear death?"" -The scene where we see Jack in the ""afterlife"" dragged on...and on and on. Hallucinate, Lick the rock, throw the rock, pull the boat, hallucinate some more....enough already!!!!<br/><br/>Anyways, I have to say I was very disappointed with ""At World's End"".

The first instalment of the trilogy was amazing, Johnny Depp creating a character that was so lovable and appealing to all ages made the film the most talked about for a while. The 2nd film while still entertaining mainly due to Johnny Depp was long winded and took so long to entertain, that you were no longer interested after an hour. The third film unfortunately not even Jack Sparrow could save. Orlando Bloom succeeded in being more annoying and amateur like than the first movie. A fête which I thought was near impossible for any one actor to accomplish. Keira Knightley again did nothing but make me want to get up and vacate the cinema every time she appeared on screen. The film although mildly entertaining if stood alone seems to have departed so much from the first movie that you could easily assume that the trilogy had nothing in common except the use of the same characters. The Curse of the Black Pearl managed to encapsulate all that people would associate with pirates and bring all the ideas together. Resulting in a film that was entertaining, funny and wrongly or rightly had you rooting for the triumph of the pirates. In my opinion the two latter instalments achieved nothing but disappointment. Hopefully now this will be the end and I can try my hardest to gain back the hours of life I have wasted by watching this movie."
"olihine","6","0","2","24 June 2007"," confusing and disjointed
","The original film in this franchise, The Curse of the Black Pearl, has not been well served by its two sequels. The first film worked so well partly because of the novelty of Johnny Depp's Sparrow, and partly because its writers kept the plot entertaining without feeling the desperate need to change its direction every few minutes to keep their audience's interest. Unfortunately, the latest pirates romp fails on both counts; Depp is still funny, in parts, but his eccentric mannerisms are relied upon in places to conceal a desperately inadequate, disjointed and confusing plot. Furthermore, Keira Knighly may convince as a feisty Austen heroine but she fails dismally as a rough-hewn pirate laydee, no more so than when she attempts to deliver a blood-raising speech with the shrill voice of a netball instructor. She is however able to display more machismo than Orlando Bloom. The couple together display zero chemistry, even when canoodling on a sandy beach before a ten years' forced separation, which is quite an achievement. I'm desperately fond of the original pirates film, and really wanted to like this one, keen to believe that the first sequel, Dead Man's Chest, was merely a blip. However, now I'm convinced that Black Pearl was the exception, and that under the tangle of dreadlocks, black make-up and contrived, hyperactive plots, there is little of substance here."

ALso, I still think Barbossa is the coolest pirate ever.<br/><br/>To wrap it up, this movie was somewhat enjoyable but not nearly as good as the previous two."

","*Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End*: a whole lotta something that ends up a whole lotta nothing.<br/><br/>Director Gore Verbinski puts so much effort into this summer blockbuster that it boggles the rational part of the brain  look at that cinematography, look at that set dressing, look at that costuming and attention to detail on every starboard bow and odd bodkin and shivered timber. But pull back and the fault lines appear quickly: once again, Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley play star-crossed lovers; once again Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush play ham and cheese with lots of dressing, once again Hans Zimmer's soundtrack beats you to a bloody pulp  in ""Pirates 2"" (2006) these elements walked the edge of the tolerable plank, but mish-mash them amongst a wretchedly convoluted storyline and unnecessary, eye-straining, computer-graphicking spectacle and what started as a good idea back in 2003's ""Pirates 1"" is now an epileptic nightmare. <br/><br/>Written by Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio, *At World's End* opens with the British government repressing civil liberties in the quest to eradicate piracy, not realizing that they become as villainous as the factions they are trying to overcome in the process - quashing the right to assemble, denying the right to *habeas corpus*. <br/><br/>We never really ""meet"" the characters; more like ""catch up"" with them in the middle of a fine mess  why exposit when there's so much action to get to? From the press junkets, we learn that Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) can only repel the British forces by convening nine Pirate Lords, one of them being Jack Sparrow, who is dead, which presents a problem. <br/><br/>Verbinski has been taking film-making lessons from George Lucas. And his film fails in exactly the same ways that Lucas's do. <br/><br/>Firstly, there are no rules that this Caribbean universe adheres to: people die but can't seem to stay dead; ""dead souls"" abandoned by Davy Jones float by in the water, then are suddenly floating by on little touristy boats; Davy Jones himself (Bill Nighy) suddenly gains the ability to walk through walls; Chow Yun-Fat is Pirate Lord Sao Feng  until he bequeaths his title to Elizabeth (it's that easy to become a Pirate Lord? No wonder Jack is one).<br/><br/>And there is nothing at stake if you swordfight someone who can't be killed with a sword. And who knew the dead still harbored ambitions to live like the living throughout their death? <br/><br/>Making that age-old movie marketing mistake, Verbinski identifies his ""selling point"" (any layperson could tell you it is Johnny Depp as madly fey Jack Sparrow) and follows the fallacious market research on summer blockbuster sequels that informs him to then glut the screen with his selling point. After waiting twenty minutes for Depp's Sparrow, suddenly we're wishing he would Go Away, as we find him in Davy Jones' Locker (i.e. Death  which is apparently an actual ""place"" rather than a condition), talking to himself  literally. Whereas in ""Pirates 2,"" Depp exploded out of left field with the half-drunk, half-transvestite, Keith Richards-inspired Jack Sparrow, now the joke has worn thin. And putting hundreds of him on screen - each one feyer than the last - only makes one person happy: George (More Is Better) Lucas.<br/><br/>A rock turns into a CG crab. But why stop at one  when you can have a million? Why should the British armada stop at a hundred ships when you can populate the horizon with a thousand (which all might as well be a matte painting, for all the sitting there and doing nothing that they do)?; and why stop at ""inspired by"" Keith Richards  when you can HAVE Keith Richards?! Keef cameos for twelve eyeblinks as Jack's wayward pirate pater, the irony being that Richards really IS a zombie and wears enough makeup on Stones Tours to make him look alive.<br/><br/>The *Pirates* franchise started as a filthy romance between a statesman's daughter, Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley, still flatter than an ironed pancake with a face that never gets dirty, hardened features so enamel-coated you could cut bread on them), and blacksmith Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), while a soldier, Norrington (Jack Davenport), wooed her with ""proper"" British etiquette.<br/><br/>Then came Jack. And though the film-makers held a semblance of love quadrangle through ""Pirates 2,"" here there is just too much bluster for the flimsy chemistry to hold. Elizabeth aches for Jack; Will is her obsolete brother and Norrington somehow pulls off the only ""romantic"" parlay of the film, a scant poignant moment where two people actually act like they have human feelings for each other.<br/><br/>The unmitigated stupidity of Will and Elizabeth's ""marriage scene whilst dueling"" holds not one shred of emotion. Will becomes the New Davy Jones, who must stay seabound and only come ashore once every ten years to spend filthy time with Elizabeth but why can he only conjugate with her on land? So is it BECAUSE of her marriage vows that we are meant to believe Elizabeth will be faithful to Will over TEN YEARS of celibacy? And it's quite plausible for her to remain celibate for ten year stretches HANGING AROUND PIRATES.<br/><br/>Yes, we know we're meant to take it all like a ripping yarn, but there's just too much yarn and not enough ripping; how many times can people double-cross each other before we stop caring who's on whose side and whether Orlando Bloom will ever get to touch Keira Knightley there? It's not ""fun"" anymore - the rascally diversion of the *Pirates* series has turned into a MUST-EARN overblown bombast of money-raking white noise consumerism.<br/><br/>Lord Beckett (Tom Hollander), channeling Corleone, constantly qualifies his quest to wipe out piracy by sneering, ""It's not personal. It's just business"".<br/><br/>And that, swashbucklers, is why *Pirates* fails."

","My friends organised a trip to the movies to see Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End. Now i remembered mildly enjoying the first one at home and being underwhelmed whilst half-watching the second one at a friends house, so i wasn't exactly thrilled at the prospect of having to sit through this, but i felt it would be best to be sociable.<br/><br/>So anyway, i sat through it and even though my eyes were drooping for the last 30 minutes (seriously) i managed to get the impression that whoever organised the production of the latest POTC had absolutely no idea what they were doing.<br/><br/>Firstly, the general genre and feeling of the movie was completely mixed up and contradicted itself on several occasions. It portrayed itself as a fantasy/adventure laced with (poor) humour. Yet after setting this tone for a good while the last third of the movie in my opinion basically becomes some warped form of Mel Gibson's Braveheart. This all starts when Keira Knightley goes and delivers a god awful 'rousing' speech, which i strongly suspect was derived from Gibson's in Braveheart and it was done quite laughably. And i thought this just completely crippled the movie from then on, throwing the audience off the scent of any kind of finale.<br/><br/>Secondly, the acting skills of Keira Knightley were cringe worthy, as i have said that badly written Braveheart parody made me want the ground to swallow me up. Keira was basically screeching (did anyone else notice how funny her voice sounded when she was shouting?) for two minutes, demonstrating her ineptitude to time her lines into an emotional crescendo and in the end she just went down like a lead balloon.<br/><br/>Thirdly, the humour was unoriginal and predictable, the only thing which made me laugh was when the two pirates were looking up Keira Knightleys skirt through the crack in the floor and in reflection even that wasn't funny. Also, the Calypso segment further convoluted the plot into a mess of story lines i for one failed to grasp.<br/><br/>Finally, i must once again go back to the similarities i felt this film shared with Braveheart, for some reason it just struck me as a complete rip off of the 1995 epic from the last battle on, almost shadowing it in the battle scene. Examples include, the final battle where when the two sides line up across the sea, the 'enemy' side vastly outnumbering the side we want to win by at least 3-1 as it does in Braveheart. Another is where the leaders of the opposing armies meet in the middle to negotiate and no resolution is found making battle inevitable.<br/><br/>On the positive side Johnny Depp gave a relatively good performance and worked well with what he had as a script and some of the action scenes were visually impressive.<br/><br/>All in all, a poor effort and i hope this vastly overrated film series ends now.<br/><br/>4/10"

Dispatching their romance into such a tragic end did a disservice to the whole story. You don't go to watch Pirates to feel depressed at the end. Laughs were scarce and the storyline was convoluted.

","I have a lot to say about this movie. Unfortunately, most of its negative. Therefore, I will try to keep this short and to the point. I went into this movie with low expectations and these expectations weren't even met. I loved the first Pirates, but I was let down by the second as most were. Therefore I wasn't expecting a lot from the third installment. It was a complete drag sitting through the first 2 hours of the movie. The storyline was weak and some things could have been easily cut out to make for a shorter, somewhat more enjoyable experience. It wasn't until the last fight in which I was really into the movie. The last 45 minutes of the movie is why its is getting a 5 from me instead of a 2 or 3. I really like where the characters were taken at the end and how everything resolved. I like Keith Richards in the movie, but I was hoping of more laughs between him and Jack Sparrow. Johnny Depp is what makes all of the Pirates movies interesting. He is a great Jack Sparrow in this film just like in the first two. However, a movie can't be rated on one actor so unfortunately his great acting can't save the movie. This movie could have been so much better but the writers and director dropped the ball. Here are the best things about this movie in summary: Johnny Depp, the score for the movie, and the last fight. The rest is pretty much crap, which is why this movie is getting a 5 out of 10. If you thought DMC was a disappointment, you will be even more let down by this film. It makes DMC look good."

The only thing Dead Man's Chest needed was captain Barbossa.<br/><br/>now we get part 3, which could make a great end. but instead, they throw in about 10 new characters which get underdeveloped and their true goals are a mystery to us. if they had sticked to the original cast, and only added 1 or 2 characters, it would have been fine. but now it's all getting confusing.<br/><br/>good movie, great special effects, great cast, great humor, great make-up, great music, great atmosphere altogether. but just BAD BAD BAD writing and BAD BAD BAD character development!!! and last of all: I MISSED THE KRAKEN!"

","Pirates of the Caribbean is one of my all time favourite movies. Everything in it was pitched just right - it was a wonderful, rollicking, feel-good adventure. Unfortunately Pirates 2 was an unmitigated disaster. I kept the faith though and had very high hopes for Pirates 3, especially with the return of Geoffrey Rush.<br/><br/>He did indeed perform well but the other leads seemed to be treading water and I was bored along with them. The script was the major disappointment though. Far too many characters, few of whom were of interest, and a meandering, deadly dull plot.<br/><br/>I found the whole affair leaden. There was comedy, yes, but it was heavy handed and felt laboured. It was also too often offset by far too many deaths which made the comedy elements seem jarring.<br/><br/>Finally, the final ""battle"" just didn't convince me. Lord Beckett's actions (or lack thereof) were frankly unbelievable and I felt cheated by the lack of action.<br/><br/>I have given this film 4 stars only because it is marginally better than POTC 2. There was one character who was definitely a 10 star act as far I was concerned though - the monkey. He stole every scene he was in and was by far the best actor on screen. It's a pity he wasn't allowed to write the script as well!"

","While I count Pirates...Curse of the Black Pearl...as one of my favorite pirate films (right up there with Captain Blood, Cutthroat Island, Pirates! (the Walter Matthau film), & Crimson Pirate), and I did enjoy Pirates 2 somewhat, I found Pirates 3 to be a waste of time & money. There was very little of the witty dialogue & humor that made the 1st 2 films so good, & there is just too much reliance on CGI scenes. Also, the story was so contrived and disjointed that it was almost a hindrance to the action. Also, the ending, with Orlando Bloom's character ending up as the new ""Davey Jones"", & Keira Knightly's ""Elizabeth"" spending the rest of her days sitting on a lonely beach waiting for her lover to come back once every 10 yrs for a quickie, was not my idea of a happy ending. Johnny Depp is a great actor, but in this sequel, he just seems to be going through the motions so he can collect a fat paycheck. All in all, Pirates 1 is a keeper, but #2 can go into my next yard sale, and I won't throw my money away on a DVD of #3.

The pace in this film was clearly lacking from the previous two (especially the first one); again, perhaps it was the convoluted plot with its intricacies.<br/><br/>The humor was really missing from this film; the witty banter that marked the first so prominently and slightly dropped off in the second was demonstrably absent from this film. Two-thirds of the way through, I realized I just hadn't laughed much with this film at all.<br/><br/>The conclusion was good -- ridiculous as expected, but good. The imagery of the two ships spiraling down while fighting for their lives was great. But it just took too much time and energy to get to that point. And what happened to Calypso? She just turned into crabs, brought some bad weather and disappeared? Not very good resolution in that storyline, considering all the play it got in the first parts of the film. Also, the deaths of Gov. Swan (off-screen?) and Adm. Norrington were disappointing since the deaths were so ... irrelevant. I mean, why even both including either one of them in the film's plot? The acting was fine; Depp was at his worst with his clones, however. Geoffrey Rush seemed to have a different accent than he did in the first film, and Calypso?

"charchuk","5","0","2","9 June 2007"," An okay conclusion to a disappointing trilogy
","It was alright. About on par with the second one. Both are big disappointments, in my mind, when compared to the first one, as tends to be the case with simultaneous sequels. The filmmakers seem to have forgotten what made the first film so much fun and have instead just gone for the epic feel. These films work best when they're about the characters, and the interactions between them - not the expensive action scenes. As such, my favourite part of this film was the first hour or so - before the action started. The last hour might have looked pretty, but I found it kinda boring and rather silly. Not really that entertaining. And the ending is just begging for another trilogy, which would not be welcome.<br/><br/>It starts off great, with the very poignant hanging/singing scene, the immensely entertaining Singapore sequence, and the comically brilliant Davy Jones' Locker stuff. It was uncharacteristically weird and bizarre and whacked out for a film like this and I loved it. And the hallucinations that kept coming back were just as great. And then the very eerie and very sad dead ferry bit. But once they get back to the real world, and start backstabbing each other and meeting with each other and conspiring with each other it loses a lot of its steam. I really liked the pirate's council, even though it wasn't really needed, and Keith Richards' cameo was brill. But by the time the final battle happens, you just want it to be over. It doesn't help that it's not a very thrilling conclusion.<br/><br/>The problem is that there's too much set-up and not enough payoff. There's way too many characters and almost none of them get proper backstories or even multiple dimensions. There's just so much left hanging. They could have cut Chow Yun-Fat's utterly useless character, as well as some of the double-crossing and backstabbing, and used the spare time to actually add some depth to the film. Not to mention it would have shortened the running time considerably. The film was far too long, and, unlike certain epic films, it certainly didn't need the three hours or so. I was never bored, but I'm sure I would be on a second viewing.<br/><br/>The performances are rather uneven, ranging from terrific (Depp + Rush) to downright wooden (Bloom). A lot of the supporting characters are given more to do than the leads at times, which is very strange, and causes the film to lose some of its focus. The dialogue was great (if a bit pretentious) until that silly freedom speech, after which all bets were off. Technically, though, the film is superb. The visual effects are outstanding, the production design, makeup, costumes are all stunningly beautiful and show true care and attention to detail, and even the cinematography is creative and fluid. The score hasn't changed much from the first one but it's still worth a listen, and everything fits together well. It's a pretty film to look at, if nothing else, and some editing and a few rewrites would have done wonders. It's not great, but it's not terrible either, and it's certainly not as bad as Spider-Man 3."

I expected to be wowed and pulled into a fast-paced world of action as I was when viewing ""Curse of the Black Pearl"" and ""Dead Man's Chest,"" but I was bored.<br/><br/>Before ever seeing AWE, I had heard there was too little action; not enough sword fights, exciting battles with strange creatures of the sea, etc. I had always thought of myself as one who disliked action in movies, and I just thought of it as filler. However, this series absolutely needs action and those famous sword battles on top of moving objects (like the giant wheel shown in the second film) that we have all come to know and love. Without that needed action, the film unfortunately became dull. And the numerous sappy plots of the film, such as Will's (Orlando Bloom) ordeal with his father as well as Elizabeth's (Keira Knightley) situation with her father, were just not enough to keep the viewer entertained.<br/><br/>And that brings me to my next point---all this boring talk about fathers. Nearly every other word out of both Bloom and Knightley's mouth was ""father."" To speak the truth, the movie was mainly about the character of Will Turner talking about his father, and Elizabeth Swann crying over hers.<br/><br/>I have never been a Johnny Depp fan until seeing the first film in this series. Depp brings character, humor, and entertainment to the screen. A lot of critics are saying this and I must agree---there was not enough Johnny Depp. He made the first two movies such wonderful films, and with the third missing his presence in too much of the picture, it failed. Depp has a tendency in really any movie to spice things up. I looked forward to seeing Depp because I've noticed he makes otherwise boring scenes just fantastically entertaining. The movie missed a lot due to his lack of appearances.<br/><br/>There were also a number of confusing scenes that left many questions unanswered. Instead of focusing on the film, I was stuck trying to determine whether ""it was real or just a dream."" These weirdly baffling scenes distract the viewer from any real significance they actually had. For instance, the first scene involving Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) was incredibly strange, although I think the writers were going for more of a ""creative"" feel. It is wildly weird, and never explained. Perhaps if there was some sort of explanation, the importance of the scene would have been shown.<br/><br/>Even after all the flaws AWE had, I did enjoy some aspects of the film. As always, composer Hans Zimmer brings a wonderful set of songs into the movie, including the easily recognizable ""He's a Pirate,"" the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" theme song. <br/><br/>The appearance of Keith Richards as Jack Sparrow's father was quite interesting also. Richards had supposedly been asked to appear in the series for quite some time, and I am glad he took a part, in my opinion, the perfect part. I would have liked to see more of Richards though, because his part was rather small. <br/><br/>The special effects were, as usual, great. With the potential for much more action that was never capitalized on, there could have been plenty more special effects though. But, what was included in the film was substantial.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I guess I would say ""At World's End"" could have been much better, but we have to deal with what we are given."

","I was looking so much forth to seeing this movie... but boy was it ever a waste of money, time and none the least braincells. To be honest I think this movie is too over-hyped and overrated. <br/><br/>The first 10 minutes had me thinking 'this is gonna be grand'... But after the fight scene in Singapore in the beginning there was only one way for this movie and the plot was heading the same way as Barbosa and Will Turner in the scene where they get to the edge of the world: Down. Talk, talk, talk. And am I the only one annoyed by the constant jokes the one-eyed pirate and fat pirate kept telling? At least leave 5 minutes in between the jokes if you want others than people with the mentality of the cast from 'Hills have eyes' to take the movie a little more seriously. Plus what was up with this 'Calypso'? First it was Knightley then the Jamaican chick? And in the scene where her name has to be said 'as to a loved one', when the heck did the one-eyed pirate start loving her? Maybe I missed something but that seemed a little out of the blue. And the end: I thought that Verbinski would had had the great idea of ending the whole trilogy by making the whole Armada and remaining pirate lords fight an epic battle but apparently he thought that only two ships circling around in a maelstrom would be cool. Even though I liked the fight scene (not the sea-battle but the hand to hand combat-scene) in the end of the movie I might have had too great expectations to this movie. <br/><br/>The last pirates-movie that is in the making can only get a better script even if the screenwriters tape a pencil to a kittens tail and make it walk across paper. For the record, I'm not convinced by this movie and I wasn't the only one who found the plot confusing and rancid. I might be harsh but I expected more especially since pirates 1 and 2 were so great."

","After planning on seeing this film for a while, I went to see it last night. Through the film a couple of people walked out, but I continued to endure it as i was hoping for it to get more interesting. It didn't. All in all, I was really disappointed. I liked the first film in the series, however in trilogies the last film is always inferior to the first two. I just didn't expect this film to be so bad. 3 hours of disheveled plot and fake overly predictable characters. The plot line was ridiculous, the film too long and poorly edited. I give some points for short scenes with vivid imagery but other then that a waste of time and money, but not for Hollywood apparently. Save yourself your energy!"
"mcmillancookiejar","6","0","2","7 June 2007"," good but
","I think the first one is the best. For those of you who have seen it & weren't sure if you liked the end remember one thing. Davy Jones job was suppose to guide spirits & because he didn't do his job he was cursed. Between Jack & Turner, who would have been more adapt at handling the job given & doing it properly? For you who haven't seen it, it does bring together all of the regular characters & complete all of the underlying story lines. It is worth watching just to finish it although it does leaves room for a sloppy TV series. I say sloppy because it wont be the same without Depp & Bloom who are to big time for a series so writers, please don't bother!"

","This movie definitely isn't the worst movie I saw this year ( I save that spot for 300) but it doesn't come close to being the best. I was and still am a huge fan of the original and the second movie. What this movie was lacking was everything good about the first two. It was neither light hearted adventure like the first one nor dark epic action like the second one. It attempted to be epic but fell short of the mark by a long shot. The story was more jumbled up than an 80's hair do and the characters were more confused than barney from andy griffith. I understand Cap'n Jack has been in the undead world for a while but must he go absolutely insane. I like Depp as much as the next person but the old saying too much of a good thing is a bad thing comes to mind when seeing him in about 8 different spots at once. This was the first sign that confusion was about to come my way. The next time I knew confusion was coming was when all the plots that were built up started to fall through the roof. First off, When Chow Yun Fat tells Knightleys character she was the Calypso or whatever she was called, I genuinely became interested in seeing her become the ocean goddess. But that entire story line fell off the deep end when we found out from Barbosa that Miss Cleo was the Maiden of the sea. So I bit into that and was hoping for something amazing to arise from her being brought into true form again. I was sadly disappointed as basically nothing came out of releasing her except to create a vortex in the water. Also I thought the Davy Jones character was played out after the second one and that the father of Blooms character should have had more of an effect on the movie. As the credits started to roll and I jumped out of my seat with glee to be free of that awful movie, I was stunned at being disappointed by a pirates movie. All I can say is, total let down"
"Hjulben42","4","0","3","7 June 2007"," In a word: Disappointing
","The third Pirates installment is a grand disappointment in the way that you get everything you expected but none of it is the least bit exciting. The first movie revived a long dead genre and the second build up a real 'Empire strikes back' cliffhanger but unfortunately the third fails to deliver. The first two hours are spent with endless tired dialog and unfunny jokes, and when we finally get to the action scenes they look like something ripped from either of the two first movies. The plot twists and turns with more backstabbing than you would imagine, and the main problem with this is the fact that there is a path that would make everybody happy, but nobody seems to acknowledge it (least of all the scrips writers).I caught myself looking at my watch 4 times during the film wishing it to end, which is something I can't remember feeling since 'Phantom menace'. And for the love of god don't wait for the after-the-credit scene as it is completely unnecessary and certainly not worth the long wait. I really wanted this to be good, but in the end I just wanted to go home and watch a Hornblower movie."

","""Pirates Of The Caribbean: At World's End"" is too much.<br/><br/>Trust me. It's not a recommendation.<br/><br/>It is too long, too loud, too boring and there is too much stuff going on on screen. Utterly confusing and incoherent. As for the acting... I know that it is too much to expect anything more than acting broad strokes in a Summer Blockbuster tent pole release, but Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley were personality vacuums and Johnny Depp was not nearly as funny as in the previous movies. And Keith Richards cameo? OK. I admit it. I did smile when he appeared.<br/><br/>Keef rules! Yes, ""Pirates Of The Caribbean: At World's End"" cost a lot of money, and make no mistake, the money is all up there on the screen ( the special effects are astounding), but it is a terrible, terrible movie in almost every other way possible.

"toolownsyou1","10","0","4","6 June 2007"," Well...What the Hell...
","Let me first say that there aren't many movies I enjoyed more than the first two Pirates of the Caribbean. I loved how light hearted and fun the first two movies were. They were the perfect escape from the day to day grind. So I was very excited to see the concluding number 3. The movie started off good with first the search for Captain Sao Feng, and later the trip to save Jack Sparrow from Davey Jones locker. After that the movie began to go downhill. Where had the light hearted atmosphere gone, where had the fun gone. Also as the movie progressed I began to dislike Jack Sparrow and Elizabeth Swann more and more. Most of the time I love movies that make me feel any kind of strong emotion. But, all Worlds End made me feel was frustration at all the self centered back stabbing. Also the writers decided to change important plot points as the movie went along (I won't mention them here ""spoilers"" but if you are anything like me they will make you mad). It was almost as if they were writing during the filming. The best part of the film was the battle scene in the end which was truly amazing. Im afraid it was not enough to make up for the rest of a picture that lacked any kind of focus. The ending is also I felt no way to end my second favorite trilogy of all time. LOTR of course being first. In the end I will say it must be seen by anyone who loved the first two movies if only to add closure. Be warned it will only bring disappointment."

This film was smothered in plot that although intrigues is extremely boring. The movie was entertaining, but not a quality movie. Not to mention, the end leaves you hanging. There is no sum-up for the trilogy. Are they making another film? Who knows? To be honest, I hope the stick with the trilogy. I think that they ran out of ideas after the second film. I mean, Depp can only keep Jack Sparrow an entertaining character for a certain amount of time. If you saw the other two films then see this one just so you can get some resolution. If you've never seen the pirate films then just disregard this one and use your imagination to fill in the missing pieces after you see Dead Man's Chest."

"max-vernon","5","0","2","4 June 2007"," Pretentious, overlong film which departs from swashbuckle genre into sprawling fantasy epic.
","I enjoyed Pirates 1. It was an unpretentious swashbuckler which was a cut above the average. Pirates 2 and 3 have departed from this genre and attempted to create a Harry Potter-cum-Lord of the Rings fantasy epic which fails to satisfy. Plot, character and well-paced action have been sacrificed to special effects and mumbo-jumbo. The Jack Sparrow character, so well-crafted by J.Depp esq., gets lost in an over-elaborate and impenetrable story-line. The writers are guilty of extreme self-indulgence.<br/><br/>Aztec curse I can live with. Characters from Greek mythology, Land of the Dead, Davy Jones, The Flying Dutchman, etc., etc. have been cobbled together into an unbelievable supernatural mishmash. Pirates 3 was much too long and must leave a lot of children baffled and disappointed. I know of one who walked out before the end.<br/><br/>I was intrigued that Chinese pirates were to be included in this film and bitterly disappointed at the result. A more realistic inclusion of Chinese or Barbary pirates could have taken the film into (literally) uncharted waters of pirate fiction. A rich multicultural tapestry could have resulted. But the Chinese dimension added nothing at all to the film.<br/><br/>I suppose I wish that the writers had researched pirate history more thoroughly in order to produce a more realistically-based story-line. The over-complex screenplay severely damaged the entertainment value of the film. The moral must surely be, 'Don't change genres in mid-trilogy.'"

It wowed me, it wowed my family, It wowed everybody I talked to! Disney brilliantly left you hanging and yearning for ""At Worlds End"" before ""Dead Man's Chest"" was even over. <br/><br/>""Dead Man's Chest"" and the ""The Curse of the Black Pearl"", are two solid ten star movies in my bookbrilliantly written, clever yet witty, full of content and substance with most everything logically justified. The acting is superb with well detailed characters from Jack on down to the wenches of Tortuga. The music of Hans Zimmer and Klaus Badelt eloquently set the mood and savvy through out the movies.<br/><br/>OK, now that Disney has set us up with big expectations for ""At World's End"", we counted down the days, for almost 1 year, until World's End hit the box office. Wait! Didn't the writers of ""At Worlds End"" even watch the first two movies, specifically the second? Of course they did, they wrote them too. (Well then how come so many things were not resolved and the ones that were ""resolved"", were resolved so weakly?) Must be a case of amnesia. <br/><br/>Examples: - The romantic tension between Elizabeth and Jack wasn't addressed. - What are the details behind Tia Dalma's resurrection of Barbossa? - The Kraken is dead on the beach, was this explained? - Who made the rule about whoever stabs Davy Jones' heart takes Jones' place? This was CLEARLY not the case in Dead Man's; remember Will almost stabbing it. - I may be mistaken but wasn't that Barbossa lying down in the background at Tia's shack (you can see his boot when Jack and the gang delivered the undead monkey to Tia Dalma)? If so, this wasn't revealed. - Not enough solidification for the East India Trading Co. - Even the dog magically appeared like Davy Jones would.<br/><br/>No apples for Barbossa, no mill wheel sword fights, no bone cages, no clever scenes like stealing the Interceptor (""that's got to be the best pirate I've ever seen"" from Black Pearl). Where did all the rum go? Oh that's right, Elizabeth torched it in Black Pearl. Where was all the slick and witty lines from Jack? No, I don't savvy.<br/><br/>Too much studio shooting, too much dependence on computer generated effects. I had to remind myself more than once this is a pirate movie. Even the rope swings between ships were awkward and fake looking. I miss the dazzling Caribbean ""on location"" scenes, what's with all this gray gloom?<br/><br/>I won't say I dislike the movie, however I was enormously disappointed. Disney escalated the expectations but didn't delivery. This movie was supposed to have been greatmaybe even brilliant like the first two. Maybe I will feel better once I watch it with captions."

","In the much awaited appearance by Keith Richards as Jack Sparrow's father Captain Teague, he says to Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), ""It's not about living forever that's the problem, Jacky. It's about living with yourselfforever."" That is an awesome line and a touching moment, but like much of ""Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End"" it is woefully out of context. Context is not the strong suit of Director's Gore Verbinski's ""Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End"". Admittedly, I did not see ""Pirates 2"", and ""Pirates 3"" is a mess. Granted it is visually spectacular and state-of-the-art stunning, but much like the other third legs of the other summer trilogies ""Pirates 3"" is running on vapors. Johnny Depp is great as Captain Jack Sparrow. Perhaps, he is the only reason to endure the movie's 2 hours and 47 minutes. The movie is way too long. Depp is supported by amazing actors in this marathon sequel. Keira Knightley is very strong and beautiful as Elizabeth Swann. I think that it is all right for Knightley to add some carbs back into her diet. She impressively pulls off the action hero role. Academy Award Winner Geoffrey Rush is at his treacherous best as Captain Barbossa. In comparison Orlando Bloom is weak as Will Turner. However, Bloom does muster enough charisma to salvage the love story with Knightley. Much of this shipwreck falls squarely on the army of writers Ted Elliott, Terry Rossio, Stuart Beattie, and Jay Wolpert. The sheer mass of writers points to the lack of a single narrative voice, and patched work storytelling. ""Pirates 3"" will set box office records around the world, but it is disappointing given all the talent involved.<br/><br/>As ""Pirates 3"" resumes from last time, Barbossa, Turner, and Swann are out to rescue Jack Sparrow from Davy Jones Locker at World's End. They must also all face Davy Jones (Bill Nighy) in a showdown, and the Flying Dutchman's armada commanded by Lord Beckett (Tom Hollander). Will Turner (Bloom) also seeks to free his father from Davy Jones. Davy Jones himself seeks justice from his scorned lover Calypso (Naomie Harris). The 9 pirate Captains reluctantly form an alliance to battle Lord Beckett. And finally, will Elizabeth marry Will before all this is done? Who cares? Even piecing storyline together, the movie is a wild ride and almost impossible to follow. ""Pirates 3"" also gets very weird. The whole 'stone crabs' indulgence in Davy Jones Locker is completely bizarre. Amidst all the inept chaos, Johnny Depp remains captivating as Jack. Depp masterfully switches between wacky and aloof to compelling hero. But even this grows weary, because ultimately there is no story to tell.<br/><br/>""Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End"" will do just fine in terms of box office and business. The movie is entertaining and fun, but it is way too long and really runs on fumes after the first half hour. What is disappointing is that ""Pirates 3"" wastes the talents of Johnny Depp and Keira Knightley. The trilogy deserved a better finish. If you don't have a compelling need to see the movie wait for ""Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End"" on DVD when you can view using appropriate refrigerator breaks."

And waited a good twenty minutes to get in, Got my seat and the magic began... At the beginning you immediately recognize the atmosphere, the nooses, the peasants, Port Royal. It makes you literally just want to say ""Aaah... at least I understand this part."" But then, all these peasants are getting hung, and then just burst out into song! I thought this part was interesting, but It really confused me... then everyone goes around screaming 'the song has been sung!!' And we're all just like: What song? huh? I think a lot of scenes in this movie were very well put, and very interesting, but I seriously (not trying to write a spoiler by the way) think they overdid it. After a few minutes in one scene, you're just like ""Ok OK hurry up we don't have all night!"" Another thing I didn't quite get was the scene where they find Jack. It made me cry with laughter, it was hilarious... But the crabs? That was just plain weird. Plus, in that scene, it was almost as if the movie was spoofing nothing other than... itself! If anyone tells you that this movie doesn't have any more humor than the others, they are wrong in my opinion.<br/><br/>This movie was the most epic movie I have ever seen in my life. Even more epic than that movie... what is it called again? Oh right: Epic Movie. There was romance, comedy, stupidity, Violence, horror...etc. But that's not a complaint.<br/><br/>So overall, you walk into the theater expecting something awesome to end the trilogy... but no, all you see is three hours of ... everything! I personally loved this movie, even though it wasn't the best, and what can I say? I saw it a second time in that week.<br/><br/>I personally think that this movie is worth seeing a second time, just for comprehension. Don't judge it by the first time.

","Having just seen Knocked Up and Waitress in another theatre earlier in the day, a friend called me up about 15 minutes later at home and proposed seeing one with him. We went back and forth over some titles when he reluctantly picked Knocked Up (he thought I was at work earlier and I didn't tell him I watched some movies and one of his choices, Delta Farce, was in another theatre that wasn't near him). When we arrived at his neighborhood cinema, however, I asked if he enjoyed Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End the night before with his nephew. He said he did and asked if I was willing to switch to that. I did since I didn't want to see KU again so soon. Now, having not seen the previous two installments and having fallen asleep during some of the movie, I was a little confused at what was going on but by the fight scenes in the final 15 or so minutes, I was genuinely thrilled by many of the action set pieces. As the new pirate king, Keira Knightly delivered a very rousing speech to her new crew. Orlando Bloom certainly proved very sexy and romantic next to her. Seeing multiple Johnny Depps and having a dialogue with his father (and his character's inspiration) Keith Richards provided some of the movie's many amusing moments. I may now have to see the first two POTC films and this one again to really understand what was going on but I must say, I still didn't have a bad time watching this one."

","Pirates of the Caribbean: A World's End is the third and maybe final chapter of the Pirates of the Caribbean series. The first movie of course was the best of the entire series because it was something different and well Johnny Depp's character Captain Jack Sparrow pretty much stole the entire movie. Then the sequel which wasn't as good since it was way to long and lost the same magic of the first one despite the fact that Sparrow again was the lone spark that drove the movie. Now let's get to the World's End which continues off after Sparrow's character dies and focuses on the same characters Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann trying to bring back Sparrow from the dead. After spending around 20 minutes finding him, Sparrow makes his grand entrance and the movie falls into complete absurdity and instead of being the main character of the story Jack Sparrow falls into a secondary role which just completely makes the story bland. I mean he's the rock-star of the film! Why would you make him a supporting star for the movie that he made into a multi-billion dollar empire. Overall not that good a film, there are to many alliances made and broken throughout the film and at times it is to long and despite Depp this is probably the worse of all the Pirates films."

It would have been nice of them to make some sort of an introduction to remind the viewer who the new characters were and what they all were doing there. But maybe it's a good thing? Makes you watch the movie with attention, trying to figure it all out :) But towards the end of that first our I, for one, stopped trying and just watched.<br/><br/>The humor is still there. On-going gag with the monkey, the two dumb pirate friends, the fake eye, the two dumb soldier friends. Jack Sparrow is of course priceless, though at times just a wee bit overacting. My favorite moment was when he and Barbossa argue who's the captain. Will Turner is totally in the background. I feels like he said just a couple of words over the whole movie, mostly just hovering in the background looking pretty. Much attention is given to Elizabeth Swann whose beauty is, in my humble opinion, grossly overrated.<br/><br/>The movie is very dynamic, it's never boring and pleasantly unusual, with all the twists and turns. Interesting twist with Elizabeth and Will's relationship."

","By the time I climbed aboard, this movie had already broken the record for worldwide box office takings in the first six days ($401M), ensuring that the huge expense (a reputed $200M) is going to be more than recouped as the treasure chest overflows for Walt Disney Productions. But: is it any good? In truth, it has all the strengths - wonderful entertainment, stunning visuals, clever effects, constant action, visual and verbal jokes, and above all Johnny Depp - and all the weaknesses - a confused narrative, poor dialogue, some wooden acting - of the earlier two sailings in the franchise, but with a few extra little nuggets and problems.<br/><br/>On the plus side, we get to see some multiple versions of Jack Sparrow in a series of surreal sequences, there's a cameo appearance from Jack's dad, and the final exciting battle sequence in a swirling vortex has everything from mayhem to matrimony. On the other hand, there is no synopsis of what has gone before, there are many more pirate leaders than before, there are more double-crosses and betrayals than one can mentally accommodate, and the whole thing is so incredibly long (168 minutes) that in my local cinema they introduced an intermission at an utterly random point. If after this interminable voyage, one sits through an endless stream of credits, there is an extra little clip that takes us 10 years on - leading the way to yet another sequel?"

","Pirates Of The Caribbean: At World's End was all in all a highly entertaining film. From the beginning we are thrown into interesting confrontions, progressing to some decent early battle scenes'. Also, from the outset we had elements of humour put into the film, which I thought made it all the more entertaining. As the film progressed though, I found that it was ultimately covering a lot of the same ground that the two previous films had.<br/><br/>I would definitely say that this part of the Pirates saga was, overall, a success (I enjoyed this more than Dead Man's Chest but not as much as the original, as I feel that the Curse Of The Black Pearl is still by far the most superior of the three). There also looks like there will be another which I will most probably go and see, and hope to be up to the standard of this one.<br/><br/>However, for me these sequels have lost the depth to be called 'great films'. On the surface they are entertaining, funny, and can be watched across the board by almost anyone. But when I finished watching this film it didn't leave me with any lasting feeling. These types' of films are what I like to call 'Fast Food Films'. What I mean by this is that when you go to a film like this you know exactly what your getting. It stays with you whilst your watching it and then as soon as you've finished it you don't think about it again, because ultimately there's nothing really to think about. Very similar to a fast food restaurant, you eat, your fairly satisfied and then you leave.<br/><br/>To conclude, I have given this a 7/10. It was entertaining and I will go and see the next installment of Pirates, this is not that great a film."

","Pirates works best by putting the characters into random set pieces which are extremely fun to watch. Plot is strictly secondary to showcasing the talents of Johnny Depp and the rest of the cast. In this film the creators seemed to have lost sight of the main strength of their franchise, namely,it is fun to watch. They have attempted to create a mythology and give texture and history to their franchise. Unfortunately for them they are not dealing with Lord of the Rings but a film created from a theme park ride. Too much of the film is wasted by trying to give what is and should be a popcorn film depth through an intricate plot. I would much have preferred a few more cheap laughs rather than being insulted with such a ludicrous plot. In the rare moments when Pirates is allowed to be Pirates in the movie it still puts a smile on my face. However, in my opinion this film is not effective as the two earlier installments because it is strangled by an overcomplicated plot which is out of place for such a film."

(It lost me after they came back from Davy Jones' locker). Davy Jones and Captain Barbossa are given larger roles, which showcase the acting abilities of Bill Nighy and Geoffery Rush. However, Jack Sparrow is in the movie half of the time, at most, which is absurd. Keira Knightley is a brilliant actress, but her character is in the movie FAR too much. Orlando Bloom fans won't be too happy, as Will Turner is shoved aside as a minor character. The problem with this movie is that it had FAR too many subplots to follow. It's incredibly confusing. So confusing, in fact, that I couldn't summarize it if I WANTED to. The bottom line? Although visually stunning, with good acting, it makes NO sense.

This movie was insanely too long and they had too many story lines going. I thought Rush should have gotten top billing but his name doesn't fill seats so I understand why they went with Depp. I am praying they leave this series at three and don't come back with a 4th one. I thought the whole proposal and wedding thing was corny, but the movie was beyond saving at that point already so it didn't ruin it anymore. The effects were good however.

","I guess for all you mindless movie goers out there, this is your favorite movie of the summer. But for the film lovers that actually know what there talking about, which i am one of them, this was one of the worst movies i have seen this summer. The story (script) was horrible. The gigantic Calypso, god awful. The whole movie was build up to the final showdown with EIT and the pirates, which did not happen, and the ""Braveheart"" speech by Knightly at the end was the worst piece of dialog in the whole movie. She should stick to movies where all she does is look good, and leave the other cast members to act. The best actor in this whole film was Rush, who gets overshadowed by Fat and Depp, which by the way (Fat) met and untimely demise, which was, what a shock, anti-climatic. The whole film was so anti-climatic, like when Jones gets ""Killed"". (Verbinski) "" Uh just stab the heart and you fall off the ship and thats all you have to do, and everyone thats watching will forget that you were a main character, so we don't have to follow up any story on you."" The whole movie was meant for money, and 2 hours in the movie i forgot what the motive of the EIT was. And isn't there anyone higher up in rank than the lord? Too much information not enough explanation, this movie was a huge disappointment. I feel bad for all the independent movies out there who deserve to make 200 million and the box office and don't. Johhny Depp needs to hang up the pirate hat, and concentrate on doing movies that actually involve a good story, and a maximum of 2 plot lines, not 10. So for everyone out there that agrees with me, you will forever be my friends, and to the sheep who look at a pirate and point with awe, shame on you. And for those who think I'm totally off my rocker, just remember the opening music video where all the pirates dance and sing in unison. Terrible, just Terrible."

I don't really like him. On the contrary Keira Knightley is fantastic, she will have a great future in this job. The nice thing of the third movie is that there is actually every member of the cast!!

","The third installment of the ""Pirates"" series was quite a disappointment. Just like in ""Dead Man's Chest"" it fails to capture the enthusiasm and warmth the first movie provided so easily. <br/><br/>The writers clearly tried to put a bunch of plots and subplots, but failed to let things blend together smoothly enough, making the story difficult to follow at some times. The jokes are often the kind of jokes you would expect on the back of your calendar (referring especially to the poor humor of pirate-buddies Pintel and Ragetti). Fortunatley, there are a few nice comedic relieves as well -- I enjoyed the multiple Jack Sparrows -- but they were very hard to find.

"jman11257","6","0","2","30 May 2007"," The Worst of the Three (spoiler)
","My problem did not lie with supposedly confusing plot lines, I didn't think the 2nd or the third was hard to follow, but the way the handled certain things. The first was clearly the best in the series, but I did enjoy the 2nd film because I found the whole Davy Jones thing to be very interesting and cool. The ""Kraken"" was awesome in the second one and they just killed it off for the third, why. <br/><br/>The problem with the third was mainly how they dealt with what they portrayed in the previews to be very evil and scary, ""Worlds End"", but was just a really nice beach with helpful rock crabs. To me the place should have been scary and evil because it was supposed to be a punishment to Jack Sparrow, but instead it was like an acid trip. Jack Sparrow had weird ass hallucinations and then all of sudden rocks turned into crabs and they helped him, what the hell. What I would have done with Sparrow would be have it start out him just chilling in the ""Karine's"" stomach and then a dead guy slides by him with a bottle of rum. He takes the rum from the dead guy and says something like ""oh thanks chum."" What would be cool would be if Davy Jones' locker was in the stomach of the ""Karine"" and thats where they rescue him from. To me when someone is punished in the afterlife they are supposed to go to some kind of hell it wouldn't be a nice sandy beach, that doesn't make any sense.<br/><br/>Another part I would have done differently was Calypso. What should have happened was she should have turned into some kind of giant crazy crab or sea monster when she was released and messed up the other useless pirate vessels up because didn't it say that she wanted revenge in the movie. That could've been really cool as apposed to her just causing bad weather like in the movie, that was pretty lame. And it was really retarded when she was giant and started having exorcist convulsions. Sometimes I do not understand what filmmakers are thinking. I can't believe that someone thought that was cool.<br/><br/>The movie was OK, but they did a lot of bizarre things, which could have been done differently making it a much cooler movie. I have to say my favorite part of the movie was Geoffrey Rush being one of the main stars again because he was really good in this film."

","This is not it.<br/><br/>I walked home from seeing this with friends at the cinema and tried to think of the positives of this film, and it took me the entire twenty five minute walk. The one positive was, that it ended. And even that took about five minutes as they finished the film just like the final LOTR film did, stop start and generally frustrating.<br/><br/>The writers of this film seemed more determined too make the plot as hard to follow as possible, with people continually betraying one another, people dying and re-appearing etc etc. There were also moments of 'comedy' scattered throughout the film, as if they were trying to re-create the perfect mix of drama and comedy they got so right in the first one. Sadly, in this one, they failed badly. These moments were often cringe-worthy and would seem out of place with the scene itself, as if they were desperately trying to appeal to a younger audience who would already no doubt have been lost after 10 minutes. I did happen to notice for example, that at the intermission (thats right, its so long Odeon put an intermission half way through it) the whole front row, who were young kids about the age of 10-11 who loved the first one so much, looked around to the adults, who were equally confused, for some confirmation that they had missed something. They wern't back for the second half.<br/><br/>All of the actor performances also let this down, I feel. Depp seemed tired of his role as Sparrow, and despite having some very good one liners he failed to have the same affect as he did in the first two films. Bloom was as one dimensional as ever, and Turner and Swanns love affair was so poorly written that it also made me cringe: (a marriage aboard a ship, in the middle of fighting, which is also sinking into an abyss). The saving grace of this film was Nighy, who was superb compared to the rest in the film. However, even his performance seemed fatigued as the others did.<br/><br/>On the whole, I thought it was poor. I gave it a five as it was entertaining, but most films are now adays with these spectacular battle scenes and what-not. A massive let down, for me, and I really enjoyed the first film, in fact its one of my favourites. I really hope the rumours are false that they are thinking of making another one :("

It's a plot that shouldn't be too too complicated, but boy it endeavors to make your head spin. I loved the first two Pirates films and pretty much knew the characters and plot lines, but I still couldn't fathom some character's motivations or why some things were happening. It felt at times like the directors were putting the movie together by way of a jigsaw puzzle.<br/><br/>I found no fault in the acting. Depp was great as usual, but being that these films are more or less him, it is questionable as to why he's given so little to do. Geoffrey Rush is great though tame this time. Knightly is fine, though I don't know who thought it was a good idea to rip off Braveheart. Bloom, funny enough, gives his best performance in any of the trilogy. Bill Nighy turns in a better performance than last time as Davy Jones.<br/><br/>There's no fault in the acting or special effects, though there's little notable action and nothing that approaches the brilliance of the three way swordfight in #2. This movie hinted at a sort of mad brilliance on ocassion, but like Spider-man 3, just seemed to be too high on it's own popularity. <br/><br/>The script by far carries the brunt of the fault here. There were far too many ridiculous plot-holes and vague explanations. Also like SM3 there were too many unnecessary plot lines. Why the hell was Tia Dalma given so much (and yet so little) to do? Her plot-line was pointless. Why was Chow Yun Fat in this movie if he had nothing to do? How did the main cast get to Singapore if they didn't have a crew or a ship? The film is too long and overdrawn. You could have cut about an hour from this film and it probably would've been better. There's fun to be had, but the lasting feeling is irritation.<br/><br/>This was one of those movies that I really wanted to like and for the critics to be wrong about. But they're right. The movie is mediocre, and that's a shame. I hope one of the ""Third"" movies this summer will break the curse, one even more horrible than that caused by cursed Aztec gold. My favorite films are being tarnished by these lackluster sequels. Screw the horror re-makes. In 10-15 years time, I know what we'll be remaking.<br/><br/>This gets a C"

Secondly, for being a ""swasbuckling"" movie there wasn't enough action to keep me enthralled with too many plot twists and extended and hard to understand dialog moments. Regardless, I figured I 'd attempt to see the 3rd installment to see if I have been missing something. Once again, I feel the same but I'll try to keep my opinion as unbiased as possible.<br/><br/>The plot was just as confusing to me as the first two. This time Jack is rescued from the land of the dead, in attempt to gain his alliance to form a rebellion against Davey Jones and Beckett who is attempting to wipe out all Pirate Lords. I think.<br/><br/>Just like the prequels, I had trouble understanding what was happening, what needed to happen and what just happened. From something simple like how most of dialog is spoken in Old English, to the fact the movie uses artsy, obscure scenes to explain a plot portion. For example, the rescue attempt on Jack. I had no idea where Jack was, how the crew got there and how they left until after all was said and done. This has been my biggest problem with the entire trilogy. I realize the that director wanted to avoid clichés as most as possible and thought that this would increase the quality, but sometimes simplicity is just as good.<br/><br/>No knock on the acting or special effects here. Johnny Depp once again shows that why he's once of the greatest actors of our generations...he makes this film and without him this trilogy would not have survived. Knightly and company provide a nice supporting cast and even cover up Orlando Bloom's bumbling. And for the most part it's another visual masterpiece.<br/><br/>So basically, if you enjoyed or even understood the first two you'll enjoy this one as well.

","I don't dislike Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End so much as I don't think the filmmakers bothered even trying to make a good movie. Instead, they were content to deliver the same formulaic entertainment that the first two movies had. And although they succeed in this, the result is missing the charm of the original and to a lesser degree of the first sequel.<br/><br/>I think At World's End's most significant weakness is its script. It moves very slowly at times, it's often confusing and it's afraid to try anything new for fear that the audience won't like it. With a movie this silly it's disappointing that it doesn't explore some of the crazier ideas a bit further. Calypso was a bore compared to the Kraken from the previous film. Johnny Depp was wasted as his character ends up in situations we've already seen him in and his reactions are predictable.<br/><br/>If it wasn't for the mediocre script, At World's End could have been excellent. The special effects are great, most of the acting is top-notch (except for Bloom and Knightley - I think their inexperience shows), the action is well-choreographed, the directing is decent, but it's all wasted.<br/><br/>Another problem was that At World's End seemed to be going for a serious tone at times even though I found the drama laughable. If it had embraced its silliness rather than pretending to be a well made multi-genre movie, it might have worked. As it is, it's big loud predictable entertainment with nothing new to offer."

Black Pearl was still my favorite of the three, but Worlds End and Dead Man's Chest were fitting sequels in their own right.<br/><br/>Both Will and Elizabeth, with the help of Barbarossa from the first film, must travel to the ends of the world to release Jack Sparrow from his death and captivity in Davey Jones Locker. They must do this so they can bring Jack back because he holds one of the pieces of eight of the pirate kings. This is needed in order for the pirates to convene to a meeting in which they will decide if they should go to battle with Lord Beckett who has taken control of Davey Jones and the Flying Dutchmen. You see Lord Beckett wants to rule the seas, and in order to do this he must wipe out all the pirates. Of course the pirates don't want this, but they must find a way to get past all their backstabbing and work together. They must also decide if they want to release the water goddess Calypso from her human bonds and hope she helps them with beating Lord Beckett and Davey Jones. Of course the pirates have betrayed her just as Davey Jones has. So will she help them or just let them all try and kill each other?<br/><br/>Confusing isn't it. I know, but Dead Mans Chest was pretty convoluted as well. There are so many plots and subplots with this third film, that it is hard to see everything clearly. Still the acting by the cast was well done, and the story, as confusing as it was, was still interesting for summer action fare. Add to this top notch special effects, and a final battle scene that was incredible, and you get a decent third film to one of the most famous trilogies ever.<br/><br/>I must also remind you to stay after the credits have rolled because like the second film, this movie has a final scene which is a lot more interesting, and this one scene may just lead to a new chapter in the Pirate series.

Unfortunately, the third (and no doubt final) chapter in this trilogy has been written... and is to be found lacking. Ponderous in the beginning (so much so that I found myself drifting off- and pirate stories were a staple of my childhood, and among the kind of stories I enjoy to this day), PIRATES III manages to confound the viewer (at least, this one) by bogging down in too much piratical patter. Action speaks louder than words- especially in a pirate movie, made with sound... The long, drawn out hallucinatory sequence with Johnny Depp had my eyes rolling back in my head. Alfred Hitchcock once ventured that he should've left a scene out of a movie he'd made when he came to understand that the audience saw something happen in the scene that hadn't actually happened in the movie proper (the scene recounted was a lie).

They almost need to do another movie just to finalize the lives of those characters. I left the movie depressed knowing how the characters were left. To me leaving with that feeling doesn't make for a good movie. If you were left wanting more after the second movie you will be left wanting even more after this one.

","As I watched this movie, I couldn't help but feel even more strongly what I felt in the second one...the first one should've been left alone. I mean, sure, everybody loves a little swashbuckling action, wisecracks, and stunning special effects...but neither the second nor the third had nearly as much character development, plot material, or ingenuity as the first one.<br/><br/>Now, granted, it was decent. Notice the 7 I gave it despite what it falls short of. But even then, I can't help but feel that this film is overrated. The action sequences were amazing, and yet tiresome at the same time. The first one kept you on the edge of your seat to see who would fall off of a wooden cart...and the third one had me yawning through exploding ships twirling down a maelstrom during a storm.<br/><br/>It's almost as if the director and producers played with action figures to plot the entire course of the film. Watch it again and you'll notice how things fly freely to and fro without much thought. Granted, certain areas of the scenes are quite eye-popping. But it still seems somewhat...tasteless.<br/><br/>Then there's the ridiculous way the characters bounce about and crack half-witted jokes (most of the time, some had me laughing). I noticed this beginning in the second one too. In the first one, people were dramatic and focused. The shots and angles were nothing short of poetic. In this one, it almost looks like a bunch of circus clowns (dressed up as pirates, of course) swinging across ropes and acting like eight-year-olds.<br/><br/>Long review, eh? Well, long movie. Peter Jackson's King Kong was about as long as this, yet it held my interest until credits rolled. This was a tedious voyage with some interesting elements, but over all poorly executed. And you have to admit, the voodoo woman was nothing short of ridiculous. I've never heard a less convincing accent in my entire life. The Pillsbury Doughboy can be more ominous than her.<br/><br/>So drink up, me hearties, yo ho! And hope to God there isn't a fourth one..."

","""I don't get it."" Johnny Depp's Capt. Jack Sparrow about the tradition of throwing hats in celebration <br/><br/>I don't get it either, the hysteria about the Pirates of the Caribbean trilogyit's old hat by now. The computer graphics have always been eye-catching, the makeup charmingly realistic, and the actors about as good as you get in film. I just tire of Johnny Depp imitating Johnny Depp playing Captain Jack Sparrow, a gender bending hero for our summers.<br/><br/>In Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End, everyone, including Elizabeth (Kira Knightly) is headed for Pirate Brethren Court in Singapore, where they must prepare for a great battle with the evil British empire or become extinct, not a possibility as long as a lucrative film empire can continue steal admissions from a willing audience.<br/><br/>Although I think of the franchise as child's fare, the opening sequence of a child being hanged with a bunch of greasy street characters singing a dirge on an elaborate gallows makes me realize this film is not easy to categorize. It can be creative, albeit macabre. But that is the opening sequence; thereafter the film stretches for freshness.<br/><br/>That lack of definition carries for me right from Dead Man's Chest, where the only consistency is Depp's Sparrow. His erratically fey swishbuckler is old hat by now, his speech so eccentric that subtitles might not be a bad idea, exceeded only by Naomie Harris as a garbling, black-toothed oracle, who might as well be talking to the wind for all she can be understood. The cameo by Keith Richard as Jack's dissolute dad (it doesn't fall far from the tree) just isn't the kick I had hoped, and not just because he can't be understood.<br/><br/>Kira Knightly's Elizabeth remains the only character with good teeth, and Orlando Bloom's Will Turner, her main man, is more mature and more likeably able than ever. Bill Nighy's Davy Jones, still breathing through his spore and badly in need of a facial, has nothing new to add to the fun except as the jailer of Sparrow and ruler of a most chaotic kingdom under the sea.<br/><br/>Jack Sparrow may next travel to the fountain of youth, where I hope he'll pick up some aqua vitae for the franchise."

","Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End/2007/**<br/><br/>Main Stars: Jack Sparrow: Johnny Depp Will Turner: Orlando Bloom Barbossa: Geoffrey Rush Elizabeth Swann: Keira Knightley Davy Jones: Bill Nighy Lord Cutler Beckett: Tom Hollander<br/><br/>Better than the first? No way!! Better than the second? Nope. As good as either? Sorry. The third installment in the POTC adventures is a drone. Too long and too much. The too much part of it is all the insignificant characters involved. We don't care about them or what they do. Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) I would say was interesting. Davy Jones (Bill Nighy) was also interesting. All others didn't do enough for us to say, ""They acted well, etc."" Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) disappointed me. He wasn't near as funny as he was in the first installment. This time he was there... He had one funny moment toward the end. That was it. As for Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley), there was nothing to them! They just stood and talked. In the first two films, we saw them as good, interesting characters. In this one, completely the opposite. Plus, they have a predictable moment together at the end that got me fed up. I truly think this 168 minute long film could have been sliced in half or at least a quarter. I honestly think the film would have been more enjoyable if it had been shorter. Some films are made to be long. This one was not. The second was exactly 150 minutes long or two and a half hours long. That's a tolerable running time. This one was pushing it with practically three hours. No need for that. The story wasn't bad. The screenplay was. The effects were fantastic. So were the costumes and makeup. But what really matters? The story AND screenplay, direction, acting, blahbbity-blooh Those things really didn't show up except for those two characters I mentioned earlier. The only good MINOR character was Joshamee Gibbs (Kevin R. McNally). He's always fun to listen to. The last MAJOR character to be mentioned is Lord Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander). He was the most annoying and the least important. Sure, he wanted to wipe out all pirates. But he wasn't the only one. Norrington (Jack Davenport) shows up for a brief, also unnecessary role and so does Governor Swann (Elizabeth's father played by Jonathan Pryce). You see the film has so much potential. The fact that writers Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio wrote such a great film like POTC 1 and a good POTC 2, don't forget Aladdin, and wrote the masterpiece Shrek, means they have enough skill to write a full screen story and screenplay for the LAST installment of the POTC adventures. Of all POTC films, the last one SHOULD be the best in THEIR eyes. I predicted this to not be as good as the first and second and I was right. They tried TOO HARD to make it the best and it turned out they failed to impress. I gave it two stars for the fact that they tried as hard as they possibly could and for all the junk I mentioned earlier. As for the story, it is all mixed around. Chow Yun-Fat/Yun-Fat Chow as Captain Sao Feng shows up for a brief moment. He wasn't really entertaining but he wasn't annoying either. He was the minor part who was there as another plot device; otherwise, fluff. He started the film. Then the film finally went to what it was all about. Turner, Barbossa, Swann, etc. are on a mission to rescue Sparrow from the depths of Davy Jones' locker. But before that, they have to encounter treachery and deceit from opponents and even allies. More treachery and deceit than needed!! First, someone deceives another. Then that person deceives that person who's friends with another person that has just been killed but then that dead person happens to be another plot device just put there for fun. Then all the people that had just betrayed each other hug and do it again. What I just wrote wasn't completely accurate but that sure was what the film felt like. And what was also ridiculous was the decision of who will be the king/leader/captain of this adventure. First it was this then this but then a that comes in and intrudes but what about these and the thoses. A who shows up but then is killed by a what. The what is killed by the who's friend, sir. A ma'am shows up and it turns out she is going to be the captain. Again, that wasn't completely accurate. But what fun! It was almost like a game! But it was as aggravating as Aggravation! So, what about Davy Jones? Well, he has something happen to him at the end of the film. It was sooooo surprising You know what? I think the film deceived the audience a bit and even gave them some treachery by making them sit through a three hour film. That wasn't very nice. And by the time the last part of the film showed up- the final titanic battle- I think most of the audience was asleep by then. But they shouldn't fret because they really didn't miss anything. Movie directed by Gore Verbinski."

","Greetings again from the darkness. Sure, the movie is probably 45 minutes longer than it should have been. And yes, there are a multitude of details that don't add up or are just left dangling. And granted, the franchise drifted away from the stellar humor on display in the classic first installment. But, if you see a lot of movies, you have to admit that the visual feast provided here by director Gore Verbinski is a fitting send off (hopefully) for these beloved Pirates! <br/><br/>The usual suspects are all back ... Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow, Geoffrey Rush as Barbossa, Orlando Bloom as Will Turner, Keira Knightley as Elizabeth Swann and Bill Nighy as Davy Jones. For some reason, Depp's screen time is again limited and Knightley's is expanded. She doesn't have the chops to pull off ""King of the Pirates"", but Verbinski obviously enjoys seeing her face (and weak voice) on screen. Rush sparkles as Barbossa and Bill Nighy actually gets to show a glimpse of the face behind the tentacles! <br/><br/>Naomie Harris has much more to do in this one as the pivotal Calypso character ... with some spectacular powers. And the always excellent Stellan Skaarsgard provides a touch of class as Bootstrap Bill. Joining the cast are Chow Yun-Fat as a powerful Singapore pirate and, of course, the much anticipated appearance of Keith Richards as Jack Sparrow's dad.<br/><br/>The story itself is a bit messy and convoluted, but again, this is about the visuals. The battle scenes are overwhelming and the ships are very impressive. For special effects, few, if any, have ever been better. The disappointment stems from what is a near waste of one of the most interesting and entertaining characters in film history, Jack Sparrow. The second and third films just didn't allow Depp to do much with Sparrow. When he does have screen time, the theatre comes alive with anticipation. Sparrow is who most of us have come to see. It could have been so much more."

","After the first movie, I was completely charmed and had a great time watching the movie. I couldn't wait to see the second installment and I enjoyed the over the top cartoon like plot line and action. I was expecting more of the same in the third... I was wrong! <br/><br/>The third movie spends the first hour with his crew 'rescuing' Cap'n Jack Sparrow from the other world and he has further lost what's left of his mind. Johnny Depp is, as always, entertaining in this character, but playing off himself, literally, is something to watch! <br/><br/>The movie had great fight scenes and a strange wandering plot line that ends with the open ended possibility that there will be a fourth installment!! Too many loose ends left dangling to just let this movie franchise keep us wondering!!! <br/><br/>I suppose that if the movie makes a billion dollars, then they could possibly finish it up and really give us a closure movie that will tie it all together!

","just saw this movie yesterday. visually it's outstanding, amazing, exciting...but i lack's a heart, despite there's one character that looks for one inside a chest. since 45 character were not enough, they brought 86 more... figuratively speaking (merchandising?). the second part was just a excuse to make money and to put our patience to the test (like Matrix reloaded), just a bridge between the first and third part. the problem here i think is that too much happens in too much time! almost 3 hours! with the theater crowded, sometimes it was hard to breath and keep you eyes in the screen. Johnny Depp does a good job as the Rastafarian pirate with mascara. Kiera Knightley looks childish all through the movie and i did not believe she could be the ""king"" of the Pirates. Orlando Bloom ...was he in the movie? his character did something just in the last minutes. have to confess i didn't expect him to do what he did to save his beloved one. Geoffrey Rush was pretty convincing in his love/hate relationship with Sparrow. Bill Nighy really good as the octopus-faced pirate. One of the funniest members of the crew was Jack, the monkey. he delivers some of the best laughs in the movie...funnier than many of his coworkers in fact. The best? the sea battle on the storm. no discussion about it. POTC3 is just a fun movie to watch. i guess the 4th part will be upon us soon, so get a backpack with food, water, a pillow and your mp3 player fully charged, for it's gonna be more than 4 hours long to introduce us the new 87 characters and 23 new plots and 34 minutes of ending credits and......."

","After the first two films which are in my top twenty films, I was expecting and looking forward to a really good conclusion to the franchise, however was not expecting such a poor disappointing film The film started off very slowly and as it progressed it got worse; there was only a skeleton of a plot, with captain Barbosa's return only kind of explained at the end with Calypso's return. Still not sure of the point of Calypso! Davy Jones, who was a brilliant, funny Ironic character from the second film, was made to utter his line 'do you fear death' for no apparent reason, other than it sounds good. Lots of holes in the what was the plot; looks like they didn't have time to write a decent script and wanted to film the movie back to back with the second to cash in on the money.<br/><br/>The ending looks they may be other films in the franchise, but if they happen, I will wait to see what the other reviewers say, before watching it.<br/><br/>To be honest I could write a lot more, but just can't be bothered to; if you haven't seen the first two films, then perhaps you might enjoy this; if you have seen the first two, then don't expect much and then you want be too disappointed."
"michaeljaeproject","5","0","2","28 May 2007"," Letters From A Critic
","Dear Gore Verbinski, Ahoy matey, your movie is about pirates and pirates could be considered thieves, and your pirates stole 2 and half hours of my life, which I will never get back. I can't go in a ship and fall over the waterfall into Davy Jones locker to find it. I can't turn myself upside down to find it as well. But what I can do it let you know that you sir have ruined the Pirates franchise for life.<br/><br/>So our story begins in Singapore when Elizabeth Swan (Keira Knightley) and Captain Barbossa (Geoffery Rush) are looking for a ship an allies because Lord Beckett and Davy Jones have teamed up to conquer the pirate world I guess. From this point on it is a half an hour of bullshit that doesn't even pertain to the movie. It was a neat fight scene, but how many neat fight scenes can one put in a movie, much less, a trio of movies with neat fight scenes already.<br/><br/>So what do you do? You try to give a blockbuster movie an elaborate storyline. Let's be honest here sir, blockbusters don't have elaborate story lines. They have lots of action, great effects, impressive sets, and a story line that isn't hard to follow. The only people who will get the movie are the faithful followers of the pirates. The ones that come to the theater dressed like them. I haven't seen that yet but I am sure it has happened.<br/><br/>The movie was 2 ½ hours. Was that really necessary? To add all the extra dialogue that had nothing to do with the movie was point less. Then you have everyone in the movie making shrewd back room deals. It gets to a point you feel like a stockbroker in his first day standing in the pit watching everyone do crazy hand signals.<br/><br/>Here's another question, what the hell happened between William (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth? They don't love each other, and they don't trust each other. They feel their ""burdens are theirs to bare."" And then all of a sudden, during the final fight, they want to get married and ask Barbossa to marry them. Barbossa? What did he go to Sunday School while gone for Dead Man's Chest? There was no chemistry at all between them. In fact, I didn't get William Turner at all. I think Bloom was phoning in his performance. He sucked! There was a spark between Jack and Elizabeth, and it would have been funny if he popped in during that wedding scene on the ship.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp did an amazing job as usual, and I think you do a very great job of manipulating the camera. There is no question that this was a well-shot movie. It would have been even better shot if we could have done away with the multiple Jack sequences as well. Sure it was funny the first time but it got quite old quite fast. I think we get the point, he's conflicted. He has been conflicted since Pearl. That is one of the things you have to like about him. He is unpredictable and you never know what he is going to do.<br/><br/>The bottom line Gore is that this movie was way too much of the logic and not enough of the fantastic. You only had one scene in the movie that was fun when Calypso turned into the giant woman and exploded. You try to develop a relationship between her and Jones but fail as they have one time together in the movie where she turned him into a normal man before he revamps into squid face. A movie like this needs to be quick, fun, and thrilling. Not boring, trite, and following a storyline like the pirates following the code presented by Keith Richards, nice marketing move there people.<br/><br/>This movie was a little fun, but not as much fun as the first two and unfortunately it looks like there's room for a sequel, and I can tell you will after the paycheck you will receive, make that. I wonder if your actors are up to the task for that as well. You had only four five fight scenes and too much craziness to deal with for a simple summer blockbuster. When I watch Pirates, I want it to be simple, fast, furious, and fun.<br/><br/>Your movie was 2 ½ hours, so I will give you 2 ½ shots of Seagrams.<br/><br/>JAE"

","A disappointment, although definitely pretty good. Certainly better than Spider-Man 3. But that ain't saying much, now is it? Basically, At World's End carries over Dead Man's Chest's major problem of too much plot, but loses its virtue of breathless pacing. At World's End is far too slow at times, and it can be easy to get bored between setpieces. Which aren't, I should say, as good as those in either of the first two films. But, all in all, it isn't bad and it's still a lot of fun. Johnny Depp is as great as ever, and he, Geoffrey Rush, Naomie Harris and Bill Nighy's CGI face take part in an enormous ham-off. Personally, I think Rush won. As for the setpieces, the surreal, Being John Malkovich-inspired sequence in Davy Jones's locker is a lot of fun, and the climactic battle aboard the Flying Dutchman, though definitely a little too busy, is cracking."
"ccasey-1","5","0","2","27 May 2007"," somewhat disappointing
","It would have been refreshing to see more female roles. The greatest Chinese pirate of all time was not a man! It was a woman, Ching Shih. In this movie, she is relegated to one of the supporting 9 pirate brethren roles. She she should have had the lead.<br/><br/>The Calypso was pretty cool, but a little too much like out of Zena, Warrior Princess (a great show, but not appropriate in the POTC setting, IMHO).<br/><br/>We didn't see much of Tia Dalma in POTC 2, and only a little more in POTC 3. According to the storyline, her character plays a central role throughout all 3 movies. So why not give her more face time? Her compelling relationship with Davy Jones could have been explored more, which would have re-enforced what we learned in the first two movies. The movie alludes to Dalma's and Jones' pain, but we don't witness it. That could have been very powerful.<br/><br/>The writers had a great opportunity to play off the ancient seafaring myth of a flat world, a place that ancient mariners truly dreaded, to the extent that it halted westward expansion for a millennium. How many times in the history books have you seen those images of great sea monsters lurking at the edge of the earth, where any ship foolish enough to travel was doomed - to either those monsters or an eternal abyss? It could have (and should have) been an allegorical high point, ala Moby Dick. It could have had the Kraken (or a bunch of baby Krakens) writhing in a bubbling sea of despair, warning the mariners to turn back, but they press on through that adversity. Unfortunately, that drama was very much underplayed and, hence, a disappointment.<br/><br/>Another disappointment was in the lack of creative fortitude of the first two movies. As posted elsewhere on this site, POTC 1 was fresh (skeletons walking the ocean floor), POTC 2 introduced new creative drama and fun(the Kraken!, headhunters, Jack's lizard walk), but POTC 3 just seems to lack that creative genius.<br/><br/>One emotional high would have to be Boostrap's mid-movie behavior. Anybody who has watched a loved one waste away with Alzheimer's will certainly be touched by that scene. And Jack's internal dialogue was interesting, but could have been a little more ethereal, perhaps like some of those dark scenes from What Dreams May Come (but with the POTC aesthetic).<br/><br/>Overall, POTC doesn't hold a candle to LOTR, but then its not supposed to. I view POTC sort of like the ride: it should be fun, a little scary, and a little wet. Unfortunately, most of the fun is missing from POTC 3; what fun is there is misplaced, and there isn't enough emotional dark drama to offset it(perhaps aside from Bootstrap)."
"Buddy-51","6","0","2","27 May 2007"," take a plot synopsis with you
","At this point in the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" series, the plot lines have become so convoluted and twisted around each other that it is no longer possible to tell the players without a program - or at least without having done some serious boning up beforehand on all that transpired in the two previous entries. That is probably the strongest criticism one can level against ""At World's End,"" an otherwise reasonably entertaining addition to the phenomenally lucrative ""Pirates"" franchise.<br/><br/>Written by Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio and directed by Gore Verbinski, ""At World's End"" picks up where ""Dead Man's Chest"" left off, with Elizabeth, Will and the recently resurrected Barbossa going in search of Jack Sparrow, who has been consigned to a watery grave courtesy of the Kraken, a sea creature who serves at the behest of the notorious Davy Jones. In this episode, Beckett, the Chairman of the East India Trading Company, has begun to hang any individual even remotely suspected of partaking in piracy, forcing the nine Pirate Lords - including Barbossa and the re-resurrected Sparrow - to band together in armed opposition to Beckett's forces.<br/><br/>Like the previous two ""Pirates"" films, ""At World's End"" is immensely entertaining for the first forty-five minutes or so until the seemingly inevitable tedium begins to set in, caused in large part by the fact that we tend to get lost in the mind-boggling shuffling of characters and plot points. It gets so bad at times that we often aren't entirely sure who's aligned with whom, whose ship we're on, which characters are alive or dead at any given moment, and what ""being dead"" actually means in a scenario where the rules on that score seem as variable as a gentle sea breeze on a balmy summer afternoon. Moreover, any action film that runs an exhausting two hours and forty-eight minutes is bound to falter in its pacing and to sag in places, and ""At World's End"" is no exception in that respect. Doesn't anyone toiling in the blockbuster-producing factories of Hollywood know how to use an editing machine anymore? <br/><br/>Nevertheless, this latest episode does a nice job keeping all its main characters together in the same geographical locale for the most part, so that the actors don't get as lost on the vast narrative canvas as they did in the previous versions. As a result, even the usually bland Keira Knightely manages to step out of the shadows and deliver something of an actual performance in this film. The movie also gives an impressive amount of screen time to the marvelous Geoffrey Rush as the scalawag Barbossa. But the best news is that Johnny Depp returns to the glorious form he displayed in ""Curse of the Black Pearl,"" which, for some reason, got a bit tamped down in the second installment The only real disappointment on the acting front is the much ballyhooed appearance of Keith Richards in the cameo role of Jack Sparrow's dad (Depp has confessed to modeling his original performance on Richards). Although the casting of Richards is rife with possibilities, for some reason the performer has chosen to underplay the part rather than to go wild with it. It would have been so much fun to see him hamming it up alongside Depp; instead, Richards drains the life out of the father/son encounter, utterly muffing this golden opportunity for a truly classic scene.<br/><br/>The special effects and makeup are typically spectacular, and the director keeps the action percolating along at a reasonably ramped-up pace, give or take the yawn-inducing longueur or two that occasionally come our way.<br/><br/>This particular pirate's tale has probably run its course at this point, but ""At World's End"" isn't a bad way for it to go out."

","Where does one begin in describing this film? With Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow, one had to leave the theater feeling they had been entertained. Now, other than the lovable Captain Jack, what else warranted 7 out of 10 stars? (Actually, 7 out of 10 is probably being very generous.) POTC III has beautiful scenery and a tremendous amount of CGI special effects. Little Jack, the monkey is such a scene stealer. You have to love the monkey! The appearance of Keith Richards as Sparrow's father was long anticipated, and though his screen time was short, it was good. I enjoyed Geoffrey Rush as Barbossa in POTC I & was pleased to see him once again in POTC III. The ending leaves you with the feeling that if so inclined, there might be future POTC films. I couldn't rate this film higher than 7 out 10 stars because it is much too lengthy, the plot is sometimes beyond comprehension, the scenes sometimes much too frantic and the fight scene marriage ridiculous. Everyone knows Elizabeth & Will are in love, but being married aboard ship while in the midst of a battle? Please..... If you don't feel the need to rush out to the theater, I'd wait for the DVD on this one. At least you won't be sitting for 2 hours and 48 minutes without a break.

","Have you ever noticed how both good and bad things are said to come in three's? The month of May at the movies this year does nothing to answer that question but it does take the entire superstition that much further, by making it so when things, good or bad, come in three's, nothing else comes at all. The big commercial theatre where I saw PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: AT WORLD'S END was playing only three films on its dozen or so screens. This summer's other high profile third chapters, SPIDERMAN 3 and SHREK 3, joined it. With these three films monopolizing every screen, how can any other film come to matter or register a dent in the consciousness of filmgoers? One could conclude that the theatre is just giving the people what they want but how accurate is that? By the time the third part in a series rolls around, people seem to be tired of the whole thing and just ready for it to be over. Given how much bile has been spilled over all three of the aforementioned films, it appears as though it has become cool to turn on those that have provided so much entertainment in the past. Luckily for Hollywood, the trend has done nothing to stop the money from rolling in.<br/><br/>I didn't care for PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: DEAD MAN'S CHEST. I found it to have had its comic moments but to be overdrawn and tedious at times, lacking the spontaneity and energy of the first film, THE CURSE OF THE BLACK PEARL. As a result, I didn't have much of an interest in AT WORLD'S END. The PIRATES series falls into a category of trilogy where the second and third installments were not specifically intended when the first was conceived. What was once a complete story must be expanded into a longer series. Some story lines are given back-story while others are stretched so thin that it becomes distracting to actually grasp how everything is connected. In AT WORLD'S END, Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) needs to be brought back from the dead, known here as Davy Jones' Locker. With a variety of selfish motivations, Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) make the dangerous journey along with their regular crew. Once back, Jack and company must defeat Lord Beckett (Tom Hollander) and his fleet, who intend to rid the world of all pirates. Along the way, a number of other sub plots find some screen time but find themselves ultimately left ashore. Having already seen the first two films, I found it somewhat difficult to piece the muddled puzzle together at times so I can only imagine how lost one would be coming into this film without any previous pirate experience. Overly complex stories are almost inevitable though when you expand a story that was never intended to be expanded to begin with.<br/><br/>The PIRATES series has relied increasingly on visual effects as the series has progressed. While the transitions between pirates and the undead in the first film were sleek and engrossing, the film itself struck with viewers thanks primarily to the wild and unpredictable performance of Johnny Depp. Depp has been just as consistent at being inconsistent in the two latter films but there's only so much further the character can go. Subsequently, the visual aspects needed to step it up to deliver that which a summer blockbuster is expected to deliver. Back for a third time is director Gore Verbinski, taking a decidedly darker, more surreal approach to the pirates he made famous. When a film opens with mass hangings and the announcement that a number of citizens are being robbed of their fundamental rights, you know that fluff is not about to follow. Only here, it does. What ensues is a ride that bounces back and forth between varying visual motifs that leave the viewer lost at sea. That being said, I don't think I will forget that close-up of Depp's nose traveling along the screen, sniffing for a peanut, for a very long time.<br/><br/>It's hard to say goodbye to anything that has been with you for so long. It's even harder for studios to imagine never seeing the size of treasure that Jack and crew haul in with each of their adventures. Hence, even as this trilogy comes to its intended close, further pirate plots are being cooked up by studio heads that will likely plow ahead with them with or without their regular cast. That doesn't stop AT WORLD'S END from ensuring that every possible audience satisfaction is met before the credits role. Characters say their goodbye's almost as if they were the actors themselves saddened by the end of their own experiences together. The film suddenly seems to be fully aware of its own significance in the pop culture fabric. The problem here is the film is giving itself more credit than it likely deserves as it seems these days that more people flock to trilogy closers out of obligation and not anticipation."
"lambiepie-2","7","0","2","27 May 2007"," Well...the Special Effects are Top Notch!
","Everyone working on Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End in the Visual, Sound, Cinematic and Special Effects departments should be very proud. This film is by far the best of those categories of the year - so far (and an excellent front runner for all of those Oscar awards by year end). If you see the film for nothing else, that will astound you and more than pay for your price of admission. See it on the big screen.<br/><br/>Now the story - here's where my disappointment lied. While many say it tied up loose ends, it did - minimally. The story could have been a bit more tighter meaning a few obviously elongated/scenes could have been left on the cutting room floor to make it flow better.<br/><br/>The acting? Everyone in ans surrounding the supporting characters roles did well and in a few cases - more - than the script called for.<br/><br/>The featured characters - Chow Yung Fat who is an excellent intense actor was wasted in this script BUT did a heck of a job for what he was given. I can say that about many of the actors here - Geffrey Rush, always fun as Cpt. Barbosa was not as wild as he could have been (okay, I'll say it - to coin a running joke from his first performance, he needed more hats!). The assorted 'gathering' of Pirates was wasted - they could have done more; Bill Nighy was ab fab as Davy Jones but the Calyspo thing was a wasted, wasted, wasted opportunity. That surely could have been better flushed out towards its end (See the old 'Jason and the Argonauts' for details!). Then there is Elizabeth (Kiera) and Will (Orlando). Interesting is all I can determine for I could have done without them and their antics for the most part, but in other pivotal parts, these two were fine.<br/><br/>Then...there's Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow. I did miss much of him throughout this film and a great deal of him was so 'abstract', it took away from what we all love about the character and his ""wanton, sexy, gypsy, pirate"" role.<br/><br/>This is an entertaining film, contains much to keep you on the edge of your seat in special effects, thrills and action, especially the last forty minutes which takes you back to what this is all about.<br/><br/>This was an almost three hour movie and I had no problem with that - if it all was interesting as the last forty minutes. And for those who stay at the end of the credits? I did. No big deal really. You can stay...or you can or you can wait for the DVD to see it. To me, it was no big deal but sweet."
"frankgames61","6","0","2","27 May 2007"," oh dear!
","I had looked forward this this movie for sometime but found that despite a number of good performances from all concerned, the plot left the movie for long periods 'rudderless'. Depp, Bloom etc all played along and the action scenes when they came were very good especially the final battle, but there was too much dialogue, too many double crossing and double double crossing that I got confused who was on whose side, as a result I lost concentration and therefore enjoyment in what had been a enjoyable series of movies up until this film. Special mention should go to Keith Richards for his cameo and Tom Hollander for his British stiff upper lip when his world fell apart and in terms of all of the cast they didn't let the movie down nor the special effects but script writers should keep the story simple. if there is to a fourth lets hope that the story is kept simple."
"JG_MovieCritic","4","0","2","27 May 2007"," Pirates of the Caribbean: The Worst End
","Will Turner, Elizabeth Swan and Captain Jack Sparrow are all back for their third movie, the aptly named Pirates of the Caribbean: at World's End, so called because half an hour in I was praying for nuclear holocaust. I exaggerate but I really do believe this could have been a hundred times better.<br/><br/>Continuing the proud tradition of the POTC movies, this one has more story lines than characters. This is a great achievement because the movie isn't lacking in characters as they keep coming back to life. The laws of quantum physics are bent, broken and sold for spare parts at various points resulting in numerous WTF moments including a woman who consists entirely of crabs, a regenerating fire monkey and ships armed with what I can only assume are homing cannonballs.<br/><br/>Aside from the obvious flaws of characters, plot, dialogue etc the film does have some saving graces. The first is the special effects which are, as expected, very impressive and, where permitted, realistic. The acting by and large is fairly good, apart from knightly who couldn't act her way out of a wet paper bag. Another positive is Capt. Jack Sparrow. Depp again pulls off a slick brand of sickly charm held only by Sparrow and Russell Brand. Sparrow furthers his charm with the acquisition of additional personalities (all Jack Sparrow) and Depp's portrayal of these schizophrenic episodes provide some much needed comic relief in a sea of drab characters.<br/><br/>I would say that loyal fans of the Pirate series will enjoy this one. If you are not and especially if you missed number 1 or 2 you will be lost in the constant stream of dramatic betrayals and bizarre swashbuckling. I give Pirates of the Caribbean 3 a generous 4 fish monsters out of 10."

","OK, I'm going get this comment out of the way first.<br/><br/>This film is far too long. By about 30 minutes. Several shots that lingered on one thing where nothing was happening several times could have been cut short (saving about 10 minutes right there) and the scene where Jack goes mad in the locker could have been cut completely as could the scene aboard the Dutchman where he's talking to his multiple selves and that would have made the movie half an hour shorter with no ill effects.<br/><br/>The plot is pretty complicated, there's lots of betrayals and confusion and misdirection - all of which are resolved during the course of the overly long film. Keith Richard's cameo isn't all bad and quite fun in itself.<br/><br/>I think the kids will fidget during the almost 3 hours of the film and you DO have to sit through the end credits to see the little bit of information at the end of the film.<br/><br/>I do assume they'll make Pirates 4 where they are looking for the Fountain Of Youth with Jack and Barbossa."
"decan0505","6","0","2","27 May 2007"," very unfortunate
","I went into this movie expecting not much better than the second film, and I got exactly that.<br/><br/>Like most comments have stated already, the visuals were absolutely stunning and obviously were carefully executed into production. Also, the cinematography offered a variety of angles which truly showed off the artistic value of the film.<br/><br/>Although I loved the music in the first film it seems they repeated most of the soundtrack in the third pirates. I understand theme songs for characters but it simply got repetitive.<br/><br/>In addition, it is obvious that the writers were pushed for a story that was getting thin quickly in a very short amount of time. This combination is very unhealthy for an already diseased plot from the second pirates. A lot of unnecessary scenes were written into the storyline for the sake of humor which made them awkward (not to say that i did not laugh at some of them). Unlike the first pirates which was so well integrated with humor and action and story, At World's End gave the same humor repeated without the seamlessness.<br/><br/>Even a few characters (which i will not mention to avoid spoiling) were given scenes (and a place in the movie) which was completely pointless and led to nothing but a dead end.<br/><br/>Conclusion: Fantastic visuals, like always good acting, <br/><br/>Same soundtrack, same humor,most importantly--thin and unenlightening plot. (something i do not think Hollywood should get away with too often)"
"MoneyMagnet","6","0","2","27 May 2007"," Not so hot, but not bad enough to make me angry
","I had to laugh when going to see this. It seemed like nobody was having much fun or anticipation going in to the theater. It was like people were going to see it out of some sort of duty. It had some good moments and bad moments and was wayyyy too long but at the end it was just like ""Ehh"" (shrug) and I couldn't even work up much feeling about it negative or positive. It's a Pirates movie. I do commend the filmmakers for being able to squeeze three reasonably (mildly?) entertaining movies out of the pirate genre. I thought they would be repeating themselves endlessly with old jokes but they managed to come up with cool pirate-y ideas they hadn't done before (Calypso goddess of the sea, a big whirlpool, the pirates' parliament, the swashbuckling wedding ceremony, etc) I give them some points for that. And every penny of the movie's undoubtedly obscene budget is clearly all up on the screen, with the sets, costumes and ships as elaborate as ever. Also, was that monkey CGI? If not, that has to go down as the Best Acting by a Monkey in the history of Hollywood. Loved the monkey.<br/><br/>But I really, really hate that they killed off some of the characters. It wasn't necessary. I liked these characters more than some of the others we were expected to care about (ie, Will and Bootstrap - who gives a crap?? And why did they introduce a new evil sidekick for the evil East India guy -- neither of whom are particularly interesting or really all that evil? Why was Norrington given a 2-second death scene while East India Guy got some ludicrously overblown slow-motion exit that went on forever?) I certainly don't want to see any more Pirates movies unless the ENTIRE cast returns. So Tia Dalma/Calypso better get cracking on a couple more miraculous resurrections of dead characters. Plus, Jack was just annoying in this movie. I guess they figured that if one Jack wasn't doing it any more, 20 Jacks would be better. And Keith Richards? HUGE disappointment. I thought he was going to be Jack on Steroids, not a barely recognizable guy who said very little.<br/><br/>The funny thing is that when I reviewed Dead Man's Chest I said I thought I might like 3 hours of it... well, I was wrong. 2 hours 45 minutes is just butt numbing torture and they only JUST provided enough interest this time around to keep me from walking out. It wasn't all that fast-paced a movie. They seemed very stingy with the actual thrills and action this time around. And the opening scenes in Sao Feng's lair are just flat and boring and talky... not a good way to start the movie."

When i got back to my house my mom asked me what happened and i couldn't tell her cause i had no idea what happened. They shouldn't have set this movie up for a fourth one if they keep making more i don't now how much better they will get cause the first one was the best and the third has been the worst yet in my opinion.

"hera_tsohandaris","5","0","2","27 May 2007"," Fan service rocks!
","Mediocre movie. Relies too much on Depp's performance, which, albeit very pleasant, becomes repetitive when framed by a non-existent storyline.<br/><br/>Most people who found this movie 'awesome' will also say they found the prequels 'excellent'. However, there is no question that this movie is very weak as compared to the first of the trilogy. Where the first had a compact, entertaining storyline and polished characters, ""At world's end"" flounders ineffectively, ultimately failing in terms of good storytelling.<br/><br/>There are excellent visual effects - some truly glorious artistic moments. This goes to prove that a lot of work and devotion was given to the making of this movie - it's not a 'cheap sequel'. But it's entirely disappointing to see that all this work has gone mostly to waste. Like 'Spiderman 3"" it's long, it's tedious and it's trying to be something it's not.<br/><br/>The repetitive jokes (which originate from the first movie), the effort to give the film an epic atmosphere...it all falls flat. If it weren't for the visual effects and the excellent soundtrack (from the first movie), I'd rate the quality much lower than I already have. Despite Depp's and Rush's professional efforts, the fact that the movie barely contains a concrete plot cannot be overlooked.<br/><br/>The reason why you see people unquestionably adorning the movie with 10 stars is because they liked the prequels. They would have been happy with anything, as long as it contained the name 'Jack Sparrow'. And, of course, that seems to be the ultimate purpose of the scenario of this movie: Depp fan service, Kira fan service, and Bloom fan service...oh, and 'insert character' fan service.<br/><br/>The first movie, in my opinion, is at a completely different level from the sequels. I didn't find this movie very entertaining, only vaguely redundant.<br/><br/>Completely disappointed. Not up to par."
"Ian_Spencer","3","0","2","27 May 2007"," Dull, dull dull, so desperately dull
","If you went off to sleep at the end of PotC II then you will fare no better in this film.<br/><br/>Fundamentally, the problem is that it is very poorly edited and far too many extra characters and sub-plots which end up creating an overly long drawn out shambles. Various ""asides"" in the plot rely on you remembering what happened in the previous episode, but they were referenced so briefly, it was difficult to get your bearings. It desperately needed an hour cutting out of it. There was a brilliant film hiding in there. In fact, the first film was excellent and there is a single excellent second film to be made out of the footage of the second and third films.<br/><br/>A good example of the confused complexity was the introduction of several other pirate captains - each used stereotypes to establish their character and at various points the film stalled to ensure that each one was allowed their reaction: yet in the end they contributed nothing to moving the story along. In fact, so many other characters were allowed their little cameo that the key characters were reduced to bit parts along their way. Surely the ambiguous relationship between Elizabeth and Norrington needed more than a couple of snatched sentences to resolve? Similarly, Calypso is a critical plot device, but she is used as a tool to stage a major battle, yet simply vanishes from the plot without a proper resolution once that device is used. Keith Richards again puts in a cameo appearance, but you are left asking why bother? <br/><br/>Special effects so good you don't even consider them, but all in all an insubstantial and disappointing film."

"thebengalimafia-1","4","0","2","27 May 2007"," A Sub-par finale for the Pirates Franchise
","Another outing in the Pirates franchise, this time it's At world's End. This particular pirates movie was undoubtedly the more highly anticipated of the 2 sequels, with Pirates 2 being WAY too much of a cliff hanger ( I personally didn't like it). Here goes nothing.<br/><br/>One of the biggest draw backs of the film (apart from the fact that it was three hours long) is that there doesn't seem to be any one conflict that it focuses on. Conflict is what makes a movie a movie, IMO. But the film jumps from one to another and back, and the characters allegiances never seem to be consistent. I can't begin to tell you how many mutinies there were on screen and how many times I ""someone's"" men sneak up behind someone else and put the pistol to their neck. With a plot this convoluted, it's was quite difficult to keep up.<br/><br/>Probably what the film off was its length. As I said, three hours is a bit much for any movie, let alone a pirates movie. It seems that what we are told in the beginning of the film is the conflict or the meat of the plot is completely forgotten by the end of the film because of the mish-mash of things that happened in the second act. The film's very weak attempts at comedy don't help much. There WERE some funny moments, but nothing that could salvage the script.<br/><br/>Now, on to the pros of the film. AMAZING special effects. ILM has out done itself this time around, especially with the final battle scene that takes place within a maelstrom. The action is top notch and it always seems to carry the flare of what you would expect from pirates. Gorgeous locations and stellar performances from the entire cast just make me think that this film could have been so much more. And it was better than the second one, no doubt.<br/><br/>You know you didn't; enjoy a film when you're sitting there and you can't wait for the movie to be over. All in all, this movie will probably a favorite for kids and parents alike as it holds the spirit of summer escapist cinema. The studio should make loads of money from this blockbuster, but overall, this was a sub-par finale for the Pirates franchise."

The first two movies were great and i was expecting to have a great time watching the third movie. But i was very much let down. I sat in the theater the whole time asking myself when this was going to end. Usually when i see a good movie i will go see it again, and for pirates 3 not so much. There were too many things in the movie that seemed like they just couldn't take place. Disney ran out of ideas in the first two movies. Honestly how much can you do with pirates. They did everything in the first 2 and there was nothing left. They threw random things together in an attempt to make a movie. Overall i was let down."
"helmutty","7","0","1","26 May 2007"," Pirates of the Caribbean 3
","I have to admit that the movie blew me off with action and realistic monsters, mostly on the perils. It is slightly confusing on which side they chose, they seem to be cheating each other or either feel that the side is bad, they chose another. Basically the sides are will's, Davy Jones' and Lord Cutler Beckett's. I have to admit that it is fun to watch the three sides clash together and you get a pretty intense war. The story is Elizabeth Swann and Barbossa going to Singapore to get Will and get help from captain Sao feng to get Jack sparrow back. It continues from where it last stop in Pirates of the Caribbean 2. You get more answers to your questions like the curse gold. With special effects that are realistic, what could go wrong. The director had the story entertaining as to keep people glued to the screen, making it suspense at times. They went to islands with perils, they sail in the sea with perils, everywhere they go, there is perils, that is why it is entertaining. Yes, it is long but it has cool action to keep you entertain, the last battle will blow you off.<br/><br/>It is packed with action with loud music blaring in your ears, it has humour too. I can probably say that this is the best of Pirates of the Caribbean movies. You want cool action together with loud music, catch this. The price of the ticket is worth. I like it, may be one of the best part 3 movies, but this ending is somehow disappointing. Never mind that, you watch for the action or for the funny jack sparrow."

"Sweet_Ophelia","6","0","2","26 May 2007"," So long, farewell, it could have been better....
","Pirates of the Caribbean 'At World's End' is the final installment of Gore Verbinski's Pirates films  wrapping up the story of Jack Sparrow, Elizabeth Swann, Will Turner, Captain Barbosa and Davy Jones. <br/><br/>The film picks up pretty much where 'Dead Man's Chest' finished off. Jack is lost to Davy Jones's locker. Will still assumes that Elizabeth wants to rescue Jack because she loves him. Will is still determined to save his father, Boot-strap Bill, from spending an eternity as apart of Jones's ship. Cutler Beckett has plans to blow all pirates out of the seven seas for good. Barbosa wants the black pearl back. And this is where 'At World's End' begins... well actually the journey starts off in Singapore, with the crew meeting pirate King Sao Feng (Yun-Fat Chow) and asking for his help in defeating Beckett....<br/><br/>The beginning of the film is somewhat Sparrow-free, and therefore lacking. In fact, the first 2 hours are pretty lacking as there is a concentration on uninteresting subplots that have nothing to do with Jack Sparrow and everything to do with making the first half of the film a wee bit tedious. The first 2 hours covers a very complex sub-plot about Davy Jones and Calypso (Naomie Harris) that is very predictable and very badly wrapped up in the end, making the whole thing a bit pointless really. Then there is the other plot about the brethren of pirate lords who have to join forces to defeat Beckett, unleash Calypso..... and yeah, I really cant explain what those 2 sub-plots were about because I have positively no idea. You really get the sense that the writers were extremely rushed in churning out this final pirates (written, I assume, simultaneously with 'Dead Man's Chest') and as a result the first 2 hours are a convoluted mix-match of stories thrown together to thicken out the film. Let's be honest, the Pirates films are so beloved because of one man, Johnny Depp. This is no secret. When Jack Sparrow isn't on the screen you are wondering ""when is Jack coming back? Is he coming back soon?"". So it's a fair sure thing that any Pirates plot that isn't centered around Sparrow is not going to hold audience interest for too long. Essentially it is the last hour of the film that is really important. Forget the rest, sneak in after 2 hours and you are good to go. This is when all the action takes place, and it is brilliant. Verbinski is in his directorial element in the ship scenes; and the third installment does not leave the audience wanting in that department. A Western style show-down on the seven seas between Davy Jones's the flying Dutchman, Sparrow's Black Pearl and Beckett's Endeavor is brilliant, large-scale mastery. Boom goes the dynamite.<br/><br/>The other big story that is wrapped up is that of Elizabeth Swann and Will Turner. Personally, a little too cheesy for my liking, made even cornier by the soap-opera acting style of Orlando Bloom, the quintessential buccaneer. Be sure to stay for the end credits, as there is a bonus scene tucked in for the Elizabeth/Will shippers. <br/><br/>The Pirates movies have become to this Generation Y of movie-goers what 'The Godfather' trilogy was to Generation X  something we hold very close to our hearts. Repeating the lines again and again, 'Savvy' has pretty much become the 'I made him an offer he couldn't refuse' quint-essential quote. Johnny Depp's iconic Jack Sparrow sway is Marlon Brando's cotton-mouthed jowls  and everyone has an impersonation up their sleeve. So of course, the finale to the Pirates phenomenon is going to be a big deal. Unfortunately, the final installment doesn't really deliver the goods. Jack Sparrow has more slap-stick comedy moments than brilliant one-liners and Johnny Depp isn't really able to work any physical comedy routines, which is a shame, his human skewer in 'Dead Man's Chest' was brilliant. Clearly the third film is skating on thin ice, ideas are being stretched and the third script is no match for 'Curse of the Black Pearl's' concise story-telling, witty brilliance; 'At World's End' is far more convoluted and sloppy. Regardless, the Pirates films have become a real phenomenon; they will be on many people's 'favorite films of all time' list and there is no excuse if you have seen and enjoyed the first two to not see how it all ends in 'At World's End'. You just have to, savvy?"

","*MASSIVE PLOT SPOILERS BELOW!* After squealing in anticipation at seeing this movie for almost an entire year, I found this movie was a massive disappointment. Now, I can agree that it DOES have its merits, like when Norrington (*sniffles*) set free Elizabeth and the crew from the Dutchman's prison, however overall too many things happened that made this movie completely...awful.<br/><br/>Let us examine this claim for a moment. While the first two movies were a huge success, this one isn't doing so well. Why? Too many overused, overacted, unimportant plot lines.<br/><br/>The scene at World's End with Jack and...himself was bizarre. As was the thing with the crab/rock thing. And the scene in the prison when imaginary Jack talks to himself. I found the scene with Norrington and Elizabeth heart-wrenching, as well as the scene that followed- *sobs*- his character in this movie was definitely stronger, and many of us wish he was around more.<br/><br/>Chow Yun-Fat's character does basically nothing, as does Governor Swann, Mr. Mercer and many others.<br/><br/>The ending (after the credits roll) was disappointing. Why, I found myself asking furiously, doesn't Elizabeth stay with Will? WHY? It's ridiculous. They spent the entire trilogy attempting to be together, only to live separate lives in the end.<br/><br/>So, all in all, PLEASE do not go see this movie. Or if you do, be warned."
"jemicron-1","6","0","1","26 May 2007"," More Action, Less Humor
","This film seemed like a muddled mess of action sequences with less of Jack Sparrow and less of the madcap humor that made the first two such fun. In general this is a lot darker and more dreary composition. The opening sequence consists of a mass execution that has little meaning to the plot overall. In general the plot meanders. Even though I've seen the first two, I had trouble following the plot at times. There is certainly a lot of action with bloodless stabbings, piercing, explosions and general mayhem but gone are any of the zany chases that left me in stitches in the first two. I found myself laughing very little in this one. While there are some good bits here and there, I'd recommend that unless you really have to see the action on a big screen that you save your money and wait for the DVD which will no doubt be out before Christmas."

","it seems to me that these movies got progressively worse. they got longer, more confusing, and ridiculously fantastic. i know its cool to have everyone back-stabbing each other but to a point. it started getting so confusing that it felt like homework. like i need to take notes just to keep track of who's on who's side. then things just go too unrealistic. i know that undead skeletons aren't the most realistic thing, but that whole thing with Jack and those rock crabs, or the boat flipping over, or the dead people going to the other world in those little boats were just too much. it went from action/adventure to fantasy/nonsense. and i don't know what it is with directors today but im tired of this over 2 hrs crap. this movie could've been shorter and not lost a thing. so many sense i found myself saying ""ok i got it""...but they had to keep going with the same thing, just from a different angle. i got that the boat was flipped over. i didn't need to see everyone face after it happened. i didn't need to see that view from far away with the water line thing. and for gods sake did the drag out that fight between the pearl and the dutchman. that was almost a movie within itself...and i do admit that i had a tooth ache while i was watching this so i did have an outside reason for wanting to leave....but it was like for the last half hour i kept thinking that each scene was the last scene. it was agony...but regardless of everything i just said, i did like the movie. i just wouldn't suggest watching it in theaters..and in comparison, to the 1st and 2nd its last."

","Having just returned from watching the third installment in The Pirates of the Caribbean, I was a bit disappointed with it. Now, don't get me wrong, it was a great movie, but it was a bit lacking.<br/><br/>The characters were brilliant. Bloom and Knightley were, as usual, perfect in the portrayal of Will and Elizabeth. And Jack, well, he was Jack. Perfect portrayal. Although I would have liked to see much more of Norringtin, personally.<br/><br/>The CGI was even better then Dead Man's Chest. The computer-generated objects look very realistic.<br/><br/>The storyline is where the real lack comes in. Although it was overall well done, I wish they had not killed off the Kraken. It would also have been much better if a huge Tia Dalma/Calypso Had done something other than stand there and yell. Would have been fun to see her and the Kraken involved in a giant monster fight.... But thats just me and my teenage addiction to giant monster fights. I did rather enjoy Will and Elizabeth's ""Wedding Ceremony."" Once again, the movie could have been better, but it was Very good anyways. Definitely worth buying on DVD."

(i was hoping 2 c that)instead, they started with wtf is going on!!?? when Cap. Jack appears, unlike the 2nd 1 (i watched the 2nd and the 3rd in the same theater) no one was that excited.. which is a shame.... wut they should do is (as i said before, start with the endin from the 2nd 1); start with the battle between jack and that weird-ugly-disgusting-monster. so everything would make much more sense. 3rd .. the part just surprised, when the flying Dutchman and the black pearl were firing at the British battleship,.. the British commander did NOT do anything!!?? wow.. and a huge, over reacted explosion appears on the screen.. WTF!!?? its over, the battle is over... sigh>>>> however, the movie is pretty funny, i enjoyed it (besides those 3 parts), a 7 out of 10 would b a score i give to the movie..

"erlaharalds","7","0","1","26 May 2007"," Not bad, but could have been better
","The first Pirates of the Caribbean was a great hit. No argue with that. But why? Was it because it had great battle scenes with massive and expensive computer generated elements. No. Apart from Barbossa's crew the whole film is generally computer free (compared to many other films). Then was it because it had incredibly complicated story lines with many entwined fates and characters? No. It was all rather simple. So why was it that Pirates 1 became a hit? Comedy. It's because Captain Jack Sparrow is a spontaneous drunken comedian.<br/><br/>The second installment didn't play to much on this bit, so I hoped that the third would see where the second went wrong and correct that. It is such a shame it didn't.<br/><br/>I'm not saying that ""Witty Jack"" didn't have any funny or clever lines. He had some good bits in both the second and third movies, but never enough. It's like he's grown away from the silliness and spontaneity. Not entirely of course, but enough to make you miss it. Pirates 3 left me hungry for more, but knowing that there wasn't anything more.<br/><br/>7 out of 10"
"ippongirl1982","7","0","1","26 May 2007"," Too much of some things, not enough of others
","Before I start I have to admit two things; I have a childhood fondness for Pirate movies, I've always liked them, even the bad ones and I have a not so childhood fondness for Johnny Depp, so I was probably going to like this movie no matter what. And I did, but it was by no means flawless.<br/><br/>At the end of the second movie Elizabeth Swann, played by Keira Knightley, sacrificed Jack Sparrow, played by Johnny Depp, to the Kraken in order to save the crew and ship. Will Turner, played by Orlando Bloom, had promised his father he would rescue him from the clutches of Davey Jones, played by Bill Nighy. Tia Dalma had somehow brought Barbossa, played by Geoffrey Rush, back to life and the crew were going in search of Jack.<br/><br/>That's pretty much where the third movie starts, the bid to rescue Jack. The gang recruit Captian Sao Feng, played by Chow Yun-Fat, from Singapore to help them, and also Barbossa is calling him out to convene a meeting with the 9 pirate lords, and sort of court or parliament. Jack Sparrow doesn't appear until about half an hour into the movie, and when he does he's doing things which are rather strange, which amounts to him talking to himself after spending so long alone, which he keeps up throughout, and some of it gets really silly.<br/><br/>Once they've rescued him the rest of the movie is basically the war between Lord Beckett, played by Tom Hollander and the pirates. Beckett has Davey Jones' heart which he is using to control him, making his army more or less unbeatable so the pirate lords meet to work out what to do, and that's the basic plot. There are a few twists and turns I won't go into for fear of spoiling the movie but I don't think the plot is as complicated as has been made out. The main thing about this movie is that everyone is going for their own agenda this time, it's not one cause and everyone else joins in so once you work out who wants what it's not too difficult to follow. There are a few totally unnecessary sub plots such as the aforementioned Jack Sparrow talking to himself, but if you don't try to think about it too much it's not too bad, and let's face it, movies like this are not supposed to be big thinkers, they're movies where you just accept what's going on and go with it.<br/><br/>As before the host of support characters was brilliant, I've always liked how they manage to keep more or less the same crew, and even the same two guards who were distracted in the first movie so Jack could steal a ship were back, I've gotten fond of those two, and their equivalents in the pirate crew, the two who had to dress up as girls in the first one, one of which has a wooden eye.<br/><br/>The action and some of the visual effects were absolutely brilliant, I thought, and there are plenty of laughs in it, although probably less than the first two movies. As always in the scenes with Jack Sparrow everyone pretty much lets him be whatever he is and don't try to out act Johnny Depp. But it's not flawless.<br/><br/>My first gripe is the length. At just shy of 3 hours it is a bit long, especially if the seats in your cinema aren't too cushioned!! For me it dragged at the start, for about the first hour or so, which is where most of the plot was mapped out. Once it got going and everyone knew where they were heading it was fantastic but getting there dragged on a bit.<br/><br/>My second gripe, and the main one, was actually Elizabeth Swann. These movies have always really been about Jack and Will and Elizabeth's romance has been in the background but this movie tries to turn it around. I'm not the biggest fan of either Keira or Orlando and Orlando wasn't bad, but Keira was just in it too much. She somehow ended up the main hero, which I felt should never have happened. I'm not saying that only because I like Johnny Depp more than Keira Knightley or Jack more than Elizabeth, I just thought the character didn't work. The idea was probably to show how she'd grown and now fits in perfectly with the pirates, even leaving Will Turner in her shadow, but instead of Jack Sparrow leading the way and the other two doing what they could to be with him, it seemed like Elizabeth was the leader and everyone else followed her, and I don't think it really worked. All in all it was great fun. Dragged a bit to start and yes the plot was more complicated that it had to be including some downright unnecessary sub plots, but I managed to follow it fairly easily. Too much Elizabeth, not enough of the others. An unexpected ending too, but a good one.<br/><br/>One warning about this though, I'd think twice about taking young children to see it. Although the violence isn't in any way graphic I think it could be upsetting for young children with scenes like mass hangings right at the start and people having swords stuck all the way through them. No blood, or very little but might be too much for children, I'd certainly not take anyone less than 10 or 11 to see it and only then if I knew it wouldn't bother them."
"kinsho","6","0","1","26 May 2007"," Bit ludicrous, but entertaining
","To start out negatively, Pirates of the Caribbean 3 tragically follows in the footsteps of its recent predecessor in making the story as convoluted as possible. Every character has their own agenda to carry out. Worse yet, most of their agendas are 'hidden' in the sense that their true motives only become known through minor plot twists. Eventually, there comes a point when the viewer simply stops caring.<br/><br/>On a more positive note, though, once one stops caring about the loosely-threaded narrative, one can truly enjoy the movie. Even if you stop listening to any of the babble that relates to the plot, the movie 's still fun to watch, what with all the pirates, the sword fighting, the ship battles, etc. With the exception of a few characters, the cast proves to be very entertaining, especially Depp's wonderfully acted Jack Sparrow, of course. Orlando Bloom's Turner and Keira Knightly's Elizabeth Swann felt, more or less, thrown into the story more as eye candy rather than genuine plot elements. Both of them did serve a purpose in that mess of a plot, but neither were the least bit memorable. Perhaps that was more thanks to their acting rather than their characters. Arguably, had the two been taken out, the movie would have been much better.<br/><br/>Lastly, the visual effects are top-notch. The phrase 'very damn impressive' sums up my thoughts on the special effects.<br/><br/>Part of me wants to delve deeper into the film and discuss some of its finer details, but honestly, I would recommend not expecting much out of the movie upon paying for a ticket. As long as you go into the film without having any lofty expectations, you'll enjoy the experience."
"saraka-1","4","0","1","26 May 2007"," Entertaining but nothing special.
","It was more special effects, more plot, more characters, more time, more everything, but for the most part it didn't work out. They stuffed in more plot but then ironically enough spent way too much time on pointless bits. The end result was that even though the movie was way too long the plot still seemed rushed. They try to reuse many jokes here, and only a few of them actually made me laugh. If it weren't for the breathtaking special effects, the only thing this movie would have accomplished would have been to tire me out. I think the idea might have stayed fresh if they stuck to the basics a bit more and not tried to overcomplicate the story. Also, the ending, which is a little unconventional (usually I like unconventional), didn't work for me. If there is a fourth you won't see me there."

I wish I would have known the movie was just like a Disney ride and waited to see it until one of friends bought it. I wouldn't recommend it for someone that appreciates good story and good plot. Jack Sparrow and his crew (oh and the monkey) were really funny but didn't get nearly enough screen time. You can take your kids to watch for sure though, they'll love HORRIBLE dialog and the MISSING plot. Other than that it had fun fighting scenes and funny scenes. Maybe the DVD will have the plot deleted scenes. Spoiler Bonus: You get to see Keira Knightley's legs a lot so that was a plus."

","I loved the first movie and I felt that the second movie was decent. I honestly wasn't sure what to expect going into this movie, but I was hoping that all the questions would be answered.<br/><br/>In all honesty, the movie's biggest fault is the fact that it is almost three hours long. I found myself sitting there bored waiting for the movie to end because things just continued to go on and on. The acting was probably the highlight of the film. Again, solid performances by Depp and Rush and they really carry the movie to the end. I was disappointed with the fact that I felt Orlando Bloom did not seem to have a big part in the film except at the end.<br/><br/>All in all, I felt the laughs in the movie were suitable for 12 year olds and the plot had too much of a sci-fi twist. And I found myself very confused throughout the entire film, despite having some pretty entertaining action sequences. At the end of the movie, I felt that they left it open to make a fourth movie (which they have pretty much agreed to do) where they create more questions than those that got answered.<br/><br/>The bottom line is if you are a fan of the series, check the movie out, but I think unless you are a die-hard fan, you will be quite disappointed. Lets hope that part four will be better (and shorter) than this mishmash of a movie."
"JakeLarkin","3","0","2","26 May 2007"," Pirates 3 is a real heart breaker
","I will stick to the positives of the movie first. The action sequences, even though there was literally only about twenty minutes of them, were really good. The special effects were amazing, and the cinematography was great too. Johnny Depp's performance as Jack Sparrow was excellent.....accepting the fact that he did what he could with the script. However, that is all that I believed to be worth seeing in this movie. They introduce far too many characters in the movie, who are very minor parts that simply distract you from the main plot, which is very poor to begin with. There is far too much violence to allow this to be good for all the seven year olds, who so loved this series. However, there is far too much MORE juvenile humor for anyone over thirteen to enjoy. Also, not to spoil too much of the movie (should you choose not too follow my advice and go see the movie) Jack Sparrow hallucinates far too much in this movie. As far as I can tell, the writers decided to use this idea for cheap laughs. Their idea did not work. It is confusing, unnecessary, and unwanted. All in all, if you are really a die hard fan of the series and simply must see this movie.....wait until you can rent it at Blockbuster for four bucks. You really do not want to spend ten dollars to see this movie in theaters."

","Having seen the previous two movies (and the first one being the best), this movie disappointed me, as well as the ""Dead Man's Chest"". Looks that the writers and Johnny Depp do not know what else to do with the plot and the conversations, and also his funny remarks (which are no longer funny). A tour-de-force of special effects, but it goes awry - being the purpose of itself. The story gets ridiculous at moments (most notably the ""wedding"" - completely and utterly wasted scene), fighting scenes are too long, even boring and completely unbelievable...

"mrband99","7","0","1","26 May 2007"," I can't remember what happened in the middle
","The 3rd and supposedly final installment in the successful Pirates series opened last night. Last year, the 2nd movie broke the record for the all time biggest opening ever. That record was just broken again by Spider-man 3 a few weeks ago. For the 3rd Pirates to break it yet again would be a very tall order, especially given its 3 hour running time.<br/><br/>This movie is not bad. Well, at least not as bad as Spider-man 3. But once again, as with Shrek 3 and Spider-man 3, it does not live up to its first two installments. Its one major flaw is that it is just too darn long. Shave about an hour off of it, and it would have been pretty good. But then again, who wouldn't want to watch Keira Knightley for 3 hours? Mmmmm, Keira Knightley.... Could there be anyone more hot? Well, maybe Jonny Depp or Orlando Bloom if you're into that kinda thing. Good news, you get to watch them for 3 hours too!<br/><br/>Jonny Depp actually pretty much saves this movie. Watching him shamble around like a drunkard and say witty and/or unintelligible things is actually pretty entertaining. And there's a few scenes of him basically hallucinating, seeing dozens of copies of himself around him, which are hilarious.<br/><br/>Then there's the story. Oh, the story! What were they thinking? There basically is none! Well, I think there's some attempt at one, but it is so nonsensical, convoluted, and uninteresting that we just content ourselves with watching Jonny and Keira and a few Pirate battles, and we're happy. The beginning starts out okay. A bunch of the good ole Pirates are in Singapore trying to get help from Chow Yun Fat. Then they set off to rescue Cap'n Jack from World's End - basically hell, since he's dead. That's all quite interesting and full of some good special effects. And of course the end of the movie has some grandiose pirate sea battles, so that's cool. But the middle? I don't even know if I can explain it. Something about a bunch of Pirate Chiefs meeting together to decide about releasing a captured goddess so she can help them defeat Davy Jones's ship which is under the control of an evil British Tea Company. Uh, yeah. That's actually fairly succinct. The movie wasn't nearly that clear in explaining it. So... let's just remove that hour from the middle, and we'll stick with rescuing Jack and then having a pirate battle. Hey, now it's a great movie! Just go use the restroom in the middle. Then buy some snacks. Then go to the arcade for a while. Then go home and feed your dog and come back. You'll be just in time for the good part!<br/><br/>But hey, what can we expect? It's a summer popcorn movie. They're not usually big on story. This movie actually does entertain and keep your interest fairly well. I just didn't really like the story. But just keep watching Keira and Jonny and you can't go wrong. Geoffrey Rush too, as Captain Barbossa, is also great. He's got the quintessential pirate voice down. Also, don't miss the one and only Keith Richards of the Rolling Stones (Jonny Depp's inspiration for his character's mannerisms) in a great cameo as Cap'n Jack's father.<br/><br/>I will say that there is a fairly unexpected twist at the end, which takes it in a slightly different direction. It actually leaves you with a yearning in your heart, because not everything turns out happy and neat like you expect. And of course, they leave it open for more possible sequels - which could actually be quite different spinoffs, given what happens to one of the characters at the end. Maybe they had to add that twist to make up for the lame rest of the story. <br/><br/>It's not Oscar material, but it gives you pretty much what you're looking for in this type of film. If you liked the other Pirates movies, you'll probably enjoy this one too, even if not as much. But if you didn't like the other Pirates movies, well, then there's not much hope for this one."

In this installment of ""Pirates of the Caribbean"", all the chaos from the second film unfurls and the gang gets Captain Jack Sparrow back. If you thought Johnny Depp was strange in the first film, you should see him here playing numerous hallucinations of himself. The main problem with this movie was it didn't quite know what it was. One second it was slapstick comedy, where next it was drama. For the most part they switched back and forth pretty well, but sometimes it just felt odd. Another problem was too much fantasy and unexplained pirate lore, like tipping the ship to make them get to where they were before. But for the most part, this was not a letdown and Prates fans will be pleased.<br/><br/>My rating: ** 1/2 out of ****. 164 mins. PG-13 for strong violence."

","Like its predecessor films, ""Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End"" is meant to be, in large part, a comedy. But the only laughs at the press screening (We movie reviewers get to see this early) were afforded in retrospect, when reviewers recalled the plea of the studio that they not reveal details of the plot's twists and resolutions in writing about it.<br/><br/>Reveal 'em? I'd bet a wooden eye that there wasn't anyone in the room who could understand 'em! Unless you watch the first two ""Pirates"" movies in the hours before you see this one, unless you have a Ph.D. in ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" studies, you will have no idea what in blazes is going on nor, I reckon, will you give an undead monkey's patootie.<br/><br/>In what's shaping up to be a summer of deflating third-films-in-the-series, ""At World's End"" is the loudest, dumbest, slowest, least entertaining and most annoying by a very comfortable margin. The second ""Pirates"" film did quite a bit to erase the good will created by the first. This one makes matters worse, leaving you feeling angry, cheap and suckered -- after the coma lifts and the raging headache subsides, that is.<br/><br/>Director Gore Verbinski and a team of writers who should wear masks when picking up their checks have turned their serendipitous blend of comedy and action into a grotesque special effects franchise laden with jokes that were already tired when the first film dragged to its conclusion. They have let the tail grow so big that it not only wags the dog but dashes its brains out against a mast.<br/><br/>The ineptitude of ""At World's End"" is evinced in its hoohah about the goddess Calypso, the mythological sea nymph who, here, has been trapped in human form by a cabal of pirates. For reasons too complex to explain (wouldn't want to spoil those precious plot twists!), she is released from her fleshy bonds, morphs with unintentional hilarity into a giantess and . . . disappears from the film without rhyme, reason, explanation or purpose. A good 15 minutes has been spent fussing about nothing. Add 21/2 hours to that and you pretty much sum up the whole ordeal.<br/><br/>For the record, a crew led by Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) sets off to free Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) from Davy Jones' Locker, a spectral underworld comically filled with multiple Captain Jacks, so that he can join a council of pirate bigwigs assembling against the British; Jones himself (Bill Nighy) is in the thrall of the evil capitalist Beckett (Tom Hollander), who controls his heart and thus his invincible ship; Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) struggles to free his dad, Bootstrap Bill (Stellan Skarsgard), from Jones' crew; and Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) pursues both Will and Captain Jack, unsure whom she truly loves.<br/><br/>Throw in several more plot lines, a few new characters, the icky romance of moony Bloom and knock-kneed Knightley, lots of computerized fighting and sailing, and painfully tiresome comic relief involving Mackenzie Crook and Lee Arenberg, and it amounts to nearly three hours of slow misery, none of which rises to the level of a ""surprise"" or ""twist"" that can be spoiled for anyone.<br/><br/>Grudging credit is due to some of the special effects and, especially, to Keith Richards, the only one among all this prattling mob who knows that less is more. Of course, he's granted a mere 90 seconds of screen time before the film succumbs once again to its congenital pointlessness. The pang of regret you feel at his departure is the sole emotion this mess ever manages to stir."

","I want to establish something: I LOVE the first two ""Pirates"" films. They're two of the best, most perfectly executed movies ever made(or at least of this generation). I went into this one with high expectations....<br/><br/>...but it really just wasn't that good.<br/><br/>It just.... it's like they forgot what made the first two films so special: the tongue-in-cheek, the wit, the charm, the stunts-that-no-one's-ever-done-before. Stuff like the pole vaulting scene, the duel in the barn, the three-way swordfight with the water-wheel and all that.<br/><br/>And the plot..... blistering BARNACLES that was nuts! I was one of the few people I know who actually didn't have trouble following the plot of the second one.... but with this one, I just gave up halfway through. It was like they took the script of the ""The Big Lebowski"", replaced the characters and sets, added about 20 new plot lines and diversions, and then deliberately put it all together out-of-order.<br/><br/>The was almost nothing new, and when there was, it was almost never that interesting, and when it was, I could almost never tell why it was happening and what it meant.<br/><br/>So, it disappoints me to say....6/10. And if it hadn't been for Geoffrey Rush, who kicked absolute ass, it would've been a 3 or 4."
"jewberg","7","0","1","25 May 2007"," A Good Movie, but lacks the strong storyline of the First Pirates
","A lot of people have said the movie is good for obvious reasons, the typical humor of Pirates is there, the acting is fairly good, the action scenes are reason enough to watch this movie alone. However, others have criticized the movie for its jumbled nature, and lack of plot. Both accounts are right in their own regard.<br/><br/>The movie begins with the hanging of all pirates by the Eastern Trading Company. The British have called a state emergency declaring the right to assembly, a trial by jury, the right to habeas corpus etc (think the Bill of the Right) in attempts to rid the land of pirates quicker. As a result, the remaining pirates (and this is where the Pirates cast comes in) must come up with a survival strategy. Without ruining any details, the explanation of this strategy, the history, the legacy, is not explained in the movie very well, some parts are revealed as you go along, but after you watch the movie, you'll have lots of questions of ""well, what was this for?""<br/><br/>In that same regard, the poor explanation of the plot doesn't destroy the movie, it only detracts from the movie depending on your taste. If you have liked the humor in previous Pirates movies, then you will love this one. Many of the people in the theater were laughing numerous times. Likewise, the movie succeeds in its usual fashion in keeping the viewer guessing who is on whose side. And of course Pirates has great action sequences.<br/><br/>I liked the movie because I never really watched Pirates for the plot. It was for the humor and action sequences. The first movie was great because the plot supported it. Make no mistake if Pirates I wasn't as great as it was, this movie wouldn't be rated as highly as it is. But the producers did well on expanding on the things that made Pirates I good. The only problem with this movie, is that this movie's magic doesn't sustain itself and depends on the first one."

","I was almost dreading this film, because I was afraid that they would screw it up. Unfortunately, I was right.<br/><br/>Loved the first movie, thought the second was so-so. I didn't care for this one at all. This was a typical case of Hollywood trying to do too much of a good thing: over the top action, silly, displaced love scenes, and plot lines that could've easily been edited out. People were so busy switching sides that it was hard to keep straight, there were new characters that no one cared about and others (Keith Richards' character) that would've been fun to expound upon.<br/><br/>I wish they would've left Tia Dalma's character alone -- I enjoyed her so much in the second film, and through 2/3 of this one. Then they took her on a silly twist and ruined her. Johnny Depp was brilliant, as usual, but the multiple Jacks was overwhelming and beneath him. Will's puppy dog love for Elizabeth was endearing in the first movie, but they never gave them the chance to show the relationship really maturing into something.<br/><br/>And I thought they'd have Will's dad stab Davy's heart -- was he not capable of it, cause that's the only reason I can think of not to follow his character through like that. They added characters that we were never given a chance to invest in. And the improbable ending of the Endeavor seemed like a total waste of time.<br/><br/>What a disappointment."

","I guess you already know, that this is Hollywood's version of Singapore in the 1720s. In that period, Singapore is known as Temasek. It's only known as Singapore in 1819 when Sir Stamford Raffles set foot on it.<br/><br/>More Chinese from China only start coming to Singapore then. <br/><br/>It is very well known in that period (1720s), the Bugis people (from South Sulawesi, Indonesia) were the most feared pirates in Temasek and The Straits before the British came. The island of Sentosa in Singapore was back then known as ""Pulau Blakang Mati"" (Behind the Dead Island) because of its history as a haunt and refuge for Bugis pirates.<br/><br/>So historically speaking, there weren't any Chinese pirates in that period (1720's) in Temasek like what has been visualized in the movie."

","The POTC franchise reminds me a lot of the Matrix, and POTC 3 reminded me in many ways of the final Matrix film. Those of you who can remember my lengthy rant/essay about the Matrix films on GD will know that's an ominous sign. The chief similarity is that the first film was essentially stand-alone (and also the best), while the second and third films were essentially one large plot-arc chopped in two, complete with tantalising cliff-hanger ending. Both also involved characters returning from the dead, new villains being introduced, an avalanche of special-effects, and... importantly... a ridiculously large amount of plot, none of it particularly sophisticated.<br/><br/>The Pirates films are not subtle in how they appeal to their core demographic. Unfortunately, when you make sequels you need to keep upping the ante, and when your product isn't subtle or intricate that seems to involve making everything ridiculously excessive. At least in Hollywood it does. The excess is everywhere: the film is ridiculously long, with many completely needless sections; there's a huge roster of characters, including endless side-kicks and sub-plots; the star cameos are endless and the plot is needlessly convoluted and over-cooked, with a seemingly endless series of betrayals as everyone double-crosses everyone else, and then reverts back again. We're not talking about Where Eagles Dare (surely the daddy of ridiculous double-cross plot lines) either, as few of the double-crosses seem necessary. I'm not even sure why half of the plot was needed at all beyond providing an excuse for the set-pieces. There are also countless moments where plausibility is bent to fracture-point in order to make sure the good guys won through.<br/><br/>Of course, when you cut past all that, there's a lot of fun to be had in the film. What particularly struck me is how it provided such a sharp contrast between humour and darkness, with both pervading every scene in an almost Oscar Wildean absurdist inversion of values. Comic interludes were often jet-black in their humour: the frost-bite scene is the kind of visual gag you'd expect from George Romero, not a Disney film. Meanwhile, moments of life and death and key plot progression are shot through with tongue-in-cheek comic touches, even when you'd expect all emphasis to be on the plot. There were also moments of gruesome brutality that made this film dark enough to separate it from the saccharine fluff you associate with family films.<br/><br/>And really, it's the humour that carries the film, far more than the action, which is as frequently as over-cooked as the film's plot. Johnny Depp chews up the scenery as much as he ever did as Jack Sparrow, while his motley crew also chip in lots of good laughs. The film was also capable of being at its most clever with the humour: the post-modernism that was evident in POTC2 gets stronger than ever here. Keith Richards' cameo was a good moment of self-awareness, while I appreciated the running sea-turtles gag, which is thinly-veiled metafiction at its daftest.<br/><br/>Oh, and the music. Hans Zimmer is rapidly elbowing in on John Williams' territory as Hollywood's premier composer of crowd friendly and versatile scores. The main themes are as epic as ever, while this time round there's an infusion of Oriental influences and some more modern touches. It also, bizarrely, channels Ennio Morricone in Spaghetti Western mode at several moments: the parlay scene's music was surely a homage to Once Upon A Time In The West. Good stuff.<br/><br/>So it's far from perfect and no classic, but it's still worth seeing, particularly if you're a fan of the series."

This story even confused things more. some of the deaths were just pointless, absolutely pointless. They offed one of the most solid characters, and not even in a grand way.

","I must say, I honestly can not figure out my feelings about the movie. After seeing it, I go back and forth as to whether or not I like it. I feel like the plot could have been way different. Completely not what I was expecting. I think the ending definitely leaves room for a fourth one, but from what I've heard, a fourth film is possible, but unlikely. If there isn't a fourth movie, they should have at least done me the gratitude of killing Orlando Bloom's character. Even if there was a fourth one,I do not know how in the world they could stick him into the plot, now that he is gone for 10 years? So what is to become of Mrs. Turner? Secondly, I could hardly understand some of the more important scenes because it seemed like mumble to me, but perhaps it is because I wasn't completely clued into the 2nd one. Lastly, I thought the screenwriters missed a wonderful opportunity to make the movie a tad bit better. (Remember that scene where Calypso told the pirates there would be a rough journey home from the underworld, well, it wasn't as rough as I was expecting it to be. They could have added a more thrill factor to it.) Other than some parts in the plot, I felt the film was quite good.

","Despite the extremely generous ratings scores, this movie is extremely average. Keep in mind the even JACKASS had a 8+ rating the first week on IMDb.

I thoroughly enjoyed part I, very entertaining. I waited for Part II to come out to video and it took me 4 nights to finish it  it was way too long and I had a hard time staying awake. Hollywood has a history of making Part III+ movies simply to make $$ but they are rarely intriguing endeavors (already we have seen mediocrity in Shrek III and Spiderman III). So I wasn't expecting much and that's exactly what I got with Pirates III. It was just 'OK'. The special effects were quite amazing, saving a limited storyline and lack of originality. I predict the IMDb score will settle just below 8 in the next several months."

It's not that it was actually bad, just incredibly boring.

"yavennie","7","0","1","26 May 2007"," Pirates of the Caribbean 3: At World's End Review
","The movie begins with a hanging. The sky is black and the scene is ominous. People cryingbrought to the gallows, in rows. The executioner is relentless, pulling the lever. Moviegoers get a view of the rows of feet hanging limply after the life has been strangled out of them. And a little boy, not older than ten, is brought to the gallows. He sings. He dies. And the signal to call the Brethren Court has happened.<br/><br/>So starts director Gore Verbinsky's third installment in the Pirates trilogy. With loads of amusing humor from old friends Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) and enemiesCaptain ""Hector"" Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush), this movie was sure to prove an exciting end to the series.<br/><br/>Pirates had its moments, to be sure. Jack Sparrow and his ridiculous stand-up comedy lines, bickering pirate friends. The list goes on. Unfortunately, so did the movie. After a whopping 2 hours, 39 minutes (not counting the 9 minute credits), I left the film with more questions than answers. First, after such a well-crafted and dark entrance, the movie was sure to be good. Perhaps Gore Verbinsky has never heard the statement beforeI found it once on a fortune cookie: It is good to begin well, but better to end well. Yet I will not even venture to say that if you enjoyed the first two movies you'll enjoy this one. Because after watching and having fun with the first two installments, this one did not ring true for me. Secondly, the film was just too long. I found myself shifty in my seat occasionally, wiping my buttery hands on the coldness of the metal panels on the sides of the seat. It is disappointing that I can remember the many distractions of my experiencea good movie should wipe those from the mind.<br/><br/>The action was brilliantly done. The fight scenes were also very realistic, with the camera swerving in and out at hundreds of different angles. Nevertheless, for such realism (disregarding the fact that supernatural individuals were crossing swords and any other item they happened to have to fling at one another), there is a cost. These said scenes were confusing to view, and occasionally dizzying to my mind. It is very difficult to distinguish what is happening, besides the occasional pan-shot. At these rare moments, I found myself finally swallowing the whole pictureonly two seconds later it's again jolted from my view. Overall, I found this to be irritating and dissatisfying.<br/><br/>If you could pin a theme to this movie, it would be: ""Take what you cangive nothing back."" It seems to be the theme and code of what the pirates govern themselves with. However, another as a general rule (and theme, as so to provide a tie-in) to directors trying to break tradition: do not end a trilogy with more questions. It's a bad idea and really annoys film-goers.<br/><br/>Since I've been dwelling on mainly negative aspects of the film, stay for the credits if you wish to see a two minute scene. I will not disclose the content of it here. Also, Han Zimmer's score was fantastic. The man is a genius, and is almost god-status to me now. I stayed for the credits expecting a scene at the end, but the real reason that kept me glued to my seat (or bouncing in it, whichever you prefer to partake in) was the incredible, powerful and awe-inspiring music of Mr. Zimmer.<br/><br/>To sum things up, this movie has an identity crisisit gets lost in the glorification of action and adventure, and loses sight of what made the first two truly enjoyable. Verbinsky combined a little action, love, humor, suspense, plot-twists, supernatural curses, gold, dialogue, and rum to make the moviegoer leave the theater laughing and talking. Pirates 3 had major imbalances of many of these, and the combinations proved fatal to the life of the movie."

"frankwhat","7","0","1","25 May 2007"," ""Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End""  If Only That Were True
","The third installment of the ""Pirates"" saga kicked off and I got to screen it a day early. I really enjoyed the first entry and thought the second one was over-budgeted and ended up taking the series in a direction that I didn't like. ""At World's End"" wouldn't be much different. It ironically turned out to be similar in structure to the third ""Spider-Man"" movie which opened up only a couple weeks earlier being that it was a little too long, had corny love scenes, and was extremely confusing to a majority of the viewers. However I think that ""Spider-Man 3"" was the better film as this one exceeded to excess on all those factors. While there was action aplenty and even scenes I liked, when I left the theater I harbored an empty feeling.<br/><br/>It was evident that while the action was there, a really satisfying concrete story wasn't. For example a new type of all-powerful character was introduced and built up for the first two-thirds of the movie, but when they finally do come to fruition it's an extreme letdown. In fact many new elements were introduced that weren't fully explained that just left me wondering why they even needed to throw these in the script in the first place. It was if they were more concerned about creating a long running time than an understandable story.<br/><br/>The swashbuckling was decent and there were many fights, however not as many important ones as there were in the first twowhere it had more one-on-one duels. Here there were many every person for themselves free for all's. Another problem was the blur of succeeding betrayals. This made it hard to distinguish who was who. I like knowing whom to root for, or at least thinking I know who to root for. The special effects were amazing and the actual production itself was pretty flawless but it was a clear case of all style and no substance. Well maybe not no substance, but very little.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp while having some funny moments didn't build on his character whatsoever and didn't even have the most comical parts this time around. They seemed to have gone to the parrot and the monkey. At least half of Sparrow's humor fell flat, as they were just rehashed jokes and retorts that I heard back in elementary school. Orlando Bloom's acting was safely bad as usual in his case. Keira Knightley was okay, but she's more there as a pretty face than a legitimate thespian. The supporting cast was exceptional though just as they had been in the first two movies, and luckily for the ticket buyer they had a lot of screen time. So between the good and the bad here it about evened out.<br/><br/>At least all the open-ended conflicts were resolved at the end and there weren't anymore real cliffhangers. However it's appearing pretty favorable that there's going to be another trilogy on top of this which I'm not looking forward to as the series quality has declined steadily with each film. It's basically one big money making scheme now by just throwing a bunch of special effects on the screen along with a few cute people and have the young masses come teeming in spending their parents not so hard-earned dough. This is why I wish they just ended everything here while there was still a shred of dignity left, but Hollywood can't seem to let anything be if there's a shred of money to be made lately.<br/><br/>Even though this was a long movie it actually goes by somewhat quickly which was especially surprisingly given how slow moving some of the scenes are and the fact that a lot of inane dialog is thrown into the mix. It actually is worth watching and is probably even above average but falls far short of what it could've been. I also predict that this will break box office records without a doubt, as a film doesn't have to be good to achieve that anymore. ""Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End"" was decent but didn't live up to the anticipation that was generated and if these epics are continued to be made like this I'll certainly be at wit's end!"

The ending solves most of the crisis evoked by the second film, though not in a ""Dizney"" sort of way. It ends cruelly in my opinion. Why is the acting, apart from Johnny Depp, Orlando's father, Barbosa, and Davy Jones, terrible? It is borderline Star Wars Episode II terrible.<br/><br/>It is a decent film, and I gave it a decent rating. Other than for the few laughs and amazing special effects, it was a weak film overall."

","I personally think that people are blinded by good filming. That's about the only compliment i can give it other than a couple good one liners. It was filmed very well, as were its precedes.<br/><br/>But this movie has absolutely no meaning behind its actions, no clear plot or story line, and a lot of the same cliché ""adventurous"" acts as most sword fighting movies have. One example would be that, like in the other two Pirate movies, there was a sword fight between two people while they were balancing on something. It's been done a hundred times before; not exciting.<br/><br/>The only consistent character throughout the three movies was Jack. Johnny Depp is a brilliant actor and plays his role very well as usual. But his co-cast members cannot seem to get a grasp on their character. For one, I thought Davey Jones was almost a completely different person from who he was in the second Pirates movie. That's just one example but there are others as you will see in the movie.<br/><br/>And also, the level of humor was extremely juvenile for the audience the movie seemed to attract. With all the violence and situations that are not so appropriate for children, the humor was that of a five year old's, with the exception of a couple one liners made by Johnny Depp.<br/><br/>So with a dry and meaningless plot, bad character consistency, AND clichés, this movie was one that I feel I've lost some brain cells and wasted dear moments of my life.<br/><br/>Also i spent $9.75 to go see it so i hope you don't make the same mistake as I did.<br/><br/>If you must see it, please i beg of you to wait until it reaches DVD so you don't waste so much money and you'll have the option to turn it off whenever desired."

","I loved the first Pirates film,it still ranks as one of my favorite films of all-time which is why it makes me so mad that they made these lackluster sequels.Pirates of the Caribbean:At World's End was a decent movie,but seemed to miss the mark even more than the second one did.<br/><br/>The film starts with Will(Bloom),Elizabeth(Knightley),and Barbossa(Rush) traveling to Singapore to request the aid of the pirate lord Sao Fang(Chow Yun Fat) to go to Davy Jone's Locker and rescue Jack(Depp).<br/><br/>My first big problem with this film was that they finally 'jumped the shark'.They went too big,and handled it in the entirely wrong way.Secondly they tried putting humor in the entirely wrong moments.There were many dark moments in this film and to try and lighten them up they threw in jokes that felt out of place.Because of these two points they destroyed parts of the movie that had potential to be cool,but just came out cheesy and annoying.Another complaint with it was the lack of action,there was very little action in the whole movie,and the little you got wasn't very gripping.Another small complaint was the choppy editing and hard to understand accents.Because of these two reasons I was lost throughout much of the movie not knowing what they were doing and why they were doing it.My last complaint is that the tone of the first film seems to have been completely lost.By the time this film ends it feels like you were watching a completely different franchise just with similar characters.The filmmakers seem to have completely forgotten what made the original so great and entertaining.<br/><br/>Now I know I have many complaints with it,but that isn't to say all was bad.Although he was working with a poorly written script director Gore Verbinski did an outstanding job,and the actors as well,although most of them had hard to understand accents.The real highlight of the film was the marvelous special effects and the superb cinematography.The creative cinematography was definitely the highlight of the film.<br/><br/>All in all it was a very disappointing end to what started out as a great franchise and has ended up as this bizarre,and lackluster film that seems to be in an identity crisis.With a hard to follow story,very little and poor action,and the sheer bizarreness of it all made this film a very bad conclusion.Now it's decent enough to see maybe 1 or 2 times,but after that there is no real lasting impact.<br/><br/>I give Pirates of the Caribbean:At World's a disappointing: 6 out of 10!"
"cmkeenan","5","0","2","25 May 2007"," Who wrote this script?
","This film was a disappointment to me. In my opinion, the first Pirates movie was magnificently done. It was entertaining, the characters were lovable (although somewhat cliché), there was humor at the right times, and the special effects were pretty good. Oh, and the story line was very easy to follow.<br/><br/>The second film was just OK. The plot got a little too crazy for my tastes- in the first film, the only unrealistic components were the whole crew of the damned. I didn't mind it too much, one completely unreal event in a movie isn't bad. In the second film, they just went overboard. A monster that can swallow ships whole, Davy Jones' locker... at least get the story behind the flying dutchman correct!<br/><br/>This film's plot was just bad. There is no other way to put it. Isn't this series called Pirates of the Caribbean? Then why start out in Asia? It really didn't add anything to the plot to start out there, just made it more confusing. And I don't confuse easily! In addition, the first two hours of the movie were riddled with unbelievable/unrealistic events. A great over use of deus ex machina in my opinion. I'm still wondering why Calypso and Keith Richards were in this movie... they didn't add anything to this film (except another 15 minutes). The plot was utterly useless and detracted from what was actually done well in the movie.<br/><br/>The most redeeming quality of this movie would probably be the camera work/special effects. These were top-notch, with the scenes being beautifully detailed and rich in color, with great CGI effects.<br/><br/>If you want to see this in the theater, go right ahead. I personally feel that my $9.25 could have been much better spent, and I would have rather waited for it to come out on DVD so I could openly talk about what the heck was going on with my friends."

","THis was very disappointing. Jack was saved too quickly and there wasn't enough of him in the movie. I don't care about the Turners or Davy Jones' love life. Give us Jack.<br/><br/>The movie was fun to watch if you just go for the action and special effects but with the attention going to the secondary characters of Will, Elizabeth, Davy, and Calipso we're stuck wanting to know more about Jack. At the end we see Will return 10 years later and who cares? Where is Jack? I want to know what happens to him in this movie. Not part 4.<br/><br/>Overall I didn't like it and the more I think about it the worse it gets."

","At World's End was an astounding disappointment.<br/><br/>2 1/2 hours into the movie and I was deciding whether I should fall asleep or just leave. There was hardly any substance and it's only redeeming moments were the last twenty minutes of the movie. There are tons of pointless scenes and fights. After awhile I was getting ready to pull my hair out from boredom. The movie lost the weight of the first movie, nothing seemed as dire as it had in the first.<br/><br/>*spoiler alert* More than one character cheats death, making it seem as death is nothing which in turn makes us, the viewers, care less for the people who could die. Funny scenes are great in any movie, and even though they made me laugh, at world's end had so many it didn't even feel like a drama anymore just a funny, pointless action movie, making it hokey/fruity, something Disney is good at(animated films excluded). The movie could have easily been two hours instead of three by cutting out all the ridiculous battles. The part that annoyed me the most is that it wasn't really a movie within itself, it was just a continuation of the second, they could have just combined the second and third movie which would have made it a lot better.<br/><br/>*spoiler Alert* Jack's multiple personalities were random and over the top, we already know Jack is pretty crazy, we don't need to see him talk to himself for forty minutes of the movie. Also Calypso turning into a giant, dissolving into crabs then having a whirlpool created..what the heck, you'd think they would have more of a purpose for her. The only reason I give it a 7/10 is for the special effects, the fact that it still shows what happens to the characters we all know and love, and the numerous funny moments, even though there were too many, they were still funny.<br/><br/>Not worth seeing at the movies though, wait until the DVD is my advice."
"empressphoenix3","5","0","2","25 May 2007"," A Roller-coaster Drop in Quality - PotC: At World's End
","(This does contain spoilers)<br/><br/>Members of the audience have been battling over whether or not there were plot holes in this third installment of the Pirates' franchise. I suspect the title of this review will let people know where I stand. Pirates, which I have loved since I first set foot on the ride as a little girl over ten years ago, has always been filled with exciting possibilities. It is not hard to believe then that I would have so easily fallen for Curse of the Black Pearl with its smarmy dialogue, rum jokes, and of course the fantastic way in which scenes from the ride were incorporated into the movie.<br/><br/>At World's End, however, was incredibly disappointing. I am amazed that this film was made back to back with Dead Man's Chest, because the quality is completely different. I will say that - fair enough - the second film was not as witty as the first, but the time it took to the release the film much shorter than the first. Nevertheless, Dead Man's Chest was still fun. I walked out of the theatre feeling excited for this next installment.<br/><br/>At World's End introduces characters played by wonderful actors, only to waste their talent and toss them aside in the storyline like dried apple cores. The death of Davy Jones is surprisingly quick and anti-climatic, and his heartache or love story is never resolved. Calypso is introduced only to turn into an avalanche of crabs. Norrington, who was seemingly minor in the first film and a turning point in the second as he delivered the heart to the villain, is stabbed quickly on deck by the suddenly disoriented Bootstrap Bill Turner. Why is Bootstrap suffering from some sort of Alzheimer's? This is never explained, the viewer is to simply accept that becoming a part of the ship causes one's memory to dwindle, even though it is clearly not the case in Pirates 2 with the clearly cognizant ship member who has become a part of the ship and reveals the presence of the key on the Dutchman.<br/><br/>I also must ask the purpose of twisting the love story so that both the main characters are wholly miserable and separated. Disney in the past has gone through painstaking measures to warp classic fairy tales and give audiences a happy ending. Was the breaking apart of this epic love story a way of saying 'Up yours!'? It's true that it was unexpected, and while unexpected may sometimes be fresh, it is not always good. <br/><br/>Overall, I feel that the movie rushed through many aspects which could have been more interesting - the terrible beastie, the Kraken, is suddenly removed though it was a huge force in the second film, Jack's obsession with his own boat is absent as well. Instead it focused too much on over-dramatic and fairly boring scenes: the splintering of the ship before the death of the villain, and the acid trip that led to the direction of Jack's time spent in Davy Jones' Locker. Jack's illusions weren't funny; they were at best irritating. <br/><br/>This film seemed self-indulgent on the part of the actors, producers and directors: too many special effects used in all the wrong areas, a rushed plot and boring dialogue, and a waste of amazing talent. Thankfully, the action scenes are entertaining enough to make any Pirates fan feel as though they can own the movie, but it really did feel quite degrading to those lovable characters developed in the first two movies."
"AlexLacourse","7","0","1","25 May 2007"," A tired trilogy
","I must say, I didn't go into the theater expecting much. After the mild disappointment I was left with after Dead Man's Chest, I was willing to accept that this trilogy was going the way of the Matrix films, an incredible first film, and then two rather bland sequels. And I was partially right.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp seems to be back at the forefront of this film, and the camera is focused on his antics throughout. Although, in my opinion, they're starting to become a bit...repetitive? Although he shows a few scenes of compassion, he's still the same bumbling pirate we've watched for 6 hours prior, and the current 3 hours start to leave him a bit stale.<br/><br/>Many of the action sequences feel very sloppy. You can never really tell what's going on. If a group of pirates board a ship, the camera is either so far pulled out, or so zoomed in that you can't really tell who's whooping up on who. You just kind of assume. The fight sequences in general are just sort of sloppy.<br/><br/>The story lines are all tied up in a nice little bow by the end, and for that I commend Gore Verbinski. Every character's story follows it's course, and we get to see where everyone winds up, and why. My only problem with the plot would have to go to a scene involving a lot of crabs and an intense storm, but these scenes take place near the end of the movie, when the viewer is too busy trying to piece together the action to be distracted.<br/><br/>Oh, and Johnny Depp's trippy hallucinations are pretty awesome."
"us3","6","0","2","25 May 2007"," Pirates of the Carriboring: When will it end?
","You know when a film has the potential of being awesome, but it gets so caught up in its epic existence that it forgets that it's a movie. That's POTC 3 in a nutshell.<br/><br/>The film is not bad, but it really doesn't hold a candle to the first film, or even the second. It is extremely confusing and convoluted. At some points I wondered whether the scriptwriters even had a clue what was going on. The dialogue is self-referential garbage most of the time, playing up the first film's catch phrases etc. POTC 3 indulges itself so much in how great it thinks it is, that eventually one lands up getting bored. The mere scale of the film is enormous, so the plot and one-liners fall flat in the midst of some of the most amazing CGI sequences you will ever see.<br/><br/>See the film if only for the final 45 minute battle. It's an amazing achievement in special effects, highly entertaining and almost redeems the film for the first 2 dreary, empty hours of thinking ""What the hell is going on?"" The film is much more surreal than the first two and you often think to yourself, ""Is this really happening?"". Jack's schizophrenia is elaborated on to the point where it is way to obvious to be entertaining.<br/><br/>Ultimately, the characters seem less complex then we originally thought, and the plot is to complex to keep up with, as very little is explained.<br/><br/>168 minutes is long, and you do feel it, but do stay around for the last hour. It's spectacular, surreal and spellbinding.<br/><br/>All in all, POTC 3 is a satisfying film which eventually does messily manage to draw conclusions, even though you really don't know how the film arrived at them. It's not brilliant, it's no ""Return Of the King"" finisher (although no one thought it would), but at least it's satisfying enough, if a little forgettable. Just thank goodness they didn't mess it up as badly as ""The Matrix Revolutions"".<br/><br/>6/10"

","The Good: Great CGI, Good looking cast, one or two jokes that work, Jack Sparrow The Bad: The script: Crap excuse for romance, nonsensical battle tactics, lame jokes, too much Jack Sparrow (you'll see what I mean) If you are thinking At World's End is going to be as good as if not better than the previous 2, think again. Firstly, they came up with the idea based on a ride in a theme park... There wasn't much material to begin with, so they padded it, and then the scriptwriters got confused. Secondly, they've been stretching the length of the movies, now it's almost 3 hours long. This leads me to my advice on the show: Don't drink too much water before viewing (for obvious reasons) and get plenty of rest the night before. I say that because the guy next to me actually fell asleep and started to snore midway through the movie.<br/><br/>It starts with a bang, slows in the middle and gets ridiculous at the end. If you like your movies without a shred of realism, watch this. If you look for plot, look elsewhere. Part 1 was good, 2 left me wanting more, 3 killed the franchise for me. Let's just hope Disney doesn't produce Part 4. I didn't hate it because on the whole it is still an average movie, just that with all the other choices around, you may want to rent the DVD instead."

","With the second installment leaving viewers disappointed, many would expect Verbinski to finish off the trilogy with a solid patch up, that would complete the series with stellar recognition. Unfortunately At Worlds end tends to be more incoherent than the sequel, and even more pedantic, that it concludes to be a waste of talent.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp was sublimely memorable as Jack Sparrow in ""The Curse of the Black Pearl"", however with this installment he has turned a once named icon to a schizophrenic idiot, whose aimless adventure exacerbates the dull plot line to one similar to a Farelly Brothers script. Offcourse there needs to be humor, however since the adventure itself is disoriented, the humor surfaces as purely lame and unfunny. Keira Knightley has much better movies in her resume, that she does not need Elizabeth Swann as a driving force for her career, as God only knows that she may end up capitalizing on this mundane and overdone character over some of the other major projects, that could turn her into a highly acclaimed actress. Finally there's Orlando Bloom who may provide eye candy to many teenage girls but his acting skills needs such an uplifting as much as Gore Verbinski's directing.The only positive aspect was seeing the once villainous Captain Barbosa returning to his conniving and shrewd role BUT Geoffrey Rush wasn't powerful enough to patch up the loop holes in the movie.<br/><br/>At the end all what remains is sheer confusion, plenty of yawns and watch staring. At worlds end is a disappointment and 2 hrs:48 mins of a persons life, one cant take back."

","Ever since South Park started to parody actions films, I have not been able to take any of them seriously. I laugh every time I see something being blown up on screen for no real reason but to fill out a weak storyline. Tray and Mat perfected this with Team American, World Police, within the opening scenes blowing up most of Paris.<br/><br/>They came to this by thinking, "" What would Jerry Bruckheimer do?"". Now you might be wondering what this has to do with Pirates of the Caribbean: At Worlds End?. Well this film has the mark of Jerry Bruckheimer all over it and its not something to be proud of.<br/><br/>This film has a very weak story and tries to make up for it with silly drawn out action scenes. It can be very confusing at times as there are too many sub plots going on in the background. I started to lose interest and my mind wondered while watching. Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley are both still blocks of wood without any real emotion on screen. I suppose its not all their fault as they had some very dodgy dialogue to deliver on screen. Geoffrey Rush and Bill Nighy give the best performances stealing a lot of scenes they shared with Johnny Depp.<br/><br/>I never liked the first film and found it to be bland, yet Johnny Depp's original performance made me sit all the way through it. I thought to myself this is another great role that Johnny can put under his belt. By the second film though his character was starting to annoy me and by this film I was just so tired with him that I hardly noticed him on screen.<br/><br/>The opening scene of the film reminded me of Return of the Jedi when Luke and friends go to free Han Solo from the evil clutches of Jabba the hut. There were other scenes in the film that also reminded me of other films which are too numerous to mention here.<br/><br/>Now I know that lots of people will disagree with me and love this film after all I have just given you my opinion and thats all it is. I know that different things appeal to different people. These days I like to get something more from a film than what I got when I watched At Worlds end. But hey if you want to see Johnny Depp running around as a camper Keith Richards and lots of silliness then this is the film for you.<br/><br/>But if you are like me and you think that action films with weak plots and dodgy dialogue should have remained in the cocaine fuelled 80's, where they belonged, then this is not the film for you."
"juliebug04","7","0","1","25 May 2007"," Not what I was expecting
","First of all, let me say that this film moves VERY quickly. There are many plot points and many new characters. These new characters are trying to find room on the screen amidst all of the returning old characters. Take a bathroom break before the film, and don't blink for the rest of it, or you will miss something. ;o) Seriously though, it does move very quickly.<br/><br/>I think this film would have been better if they had trimmed some of the unnecessary stuff. There were more than a couple of occasions where I distinctly said, ""EWWWW! That was SO totally unnecessary!"" Most of you will know one of these scenes as soon as you see it.<br/><br/>I really missed Jack's quirky lines in this one. There weren't as many as I have come to expect. Some of the special effects were unbelievable...absolutely amazing! Then again, some were incredibly cheesy. One in particular, when one character's size increased dramatically in a short span of time, looked like it had been created in the 70's rather than with today's amazing technology.<br/><br/>My main complaint though was that this was a long film, and there were parts that could have been cut or edited that would have helped the film along.<br/><br/>On the other hand though, there were many parts that were what we have come to love about these films. There was a lot of humor, there were some excellent action sequences and some of the visuals were awesome. The music, as always, was phenomenal.<br/><br/>I think I would like to see it again so that I can watch for little things that I missed. The film moved so fast that it was difficult to focus on small details...I was afraid that I would miss something.<br/><br/>I actually was not expecting that ending at all. I may be in the minority, but I was really surprised. They did leave an opening for another, and from what I have read, Johnny Depp is not ruling out another one.<br/><br/>All in all, it was good, but not fabulous. My husband didn't like it that much. Some people, like my hubby, will think that there is too much going on and not enough time devoted to getting to know any of the new characters.<br/><br/>It's definitely an escape from reality. Enjoy that, if nothing else. :o)"
"joshuaohl","4","0","2","25 May 2007"," Long and disappointing.
","I know many will disagree, but I was not happy with this movie. The first two hours drug on and on. The early action scenes did not seem to me to be filmed very well; far too many 1/2 second blurred shots in the first fight scene, and too many characters in them that I didn't care about. When they were not showing off poor direction in those early fights, they were showing off poor acting. I knew coming in that Orlando Bloom couldn't act his way out of a wet paper bag, but Keira Knightly's character was both written and acted poorly. While I could never say that Johnny Depp's acting was anything less than superb, what was with the Army of Darkness rip-off? It looked as though they even used the same 20-year-old technology! It just did not fit with the rest of the CGI, which was spectacular. Yet another knock was the predictability. Who didn't know coming in that Tia Dalma was Davey Jones' love interest? Aside from that predictable outcome, the writers seemed to try really hard to confuse with multiple twists and back-stabbings that all ended up unnecessary and led to the predictable outcome that could have just as easily been reached in two hours.<br/><br/>But then the story ramped up, and the action came in hand over fist. The movie finally had a chance to redeem itself! And it almost did, but then it got stupid. The wedding scene in the battle was a bit over the top. It was cute, but not even in the same league as the ending of the first movie. Then, once again, it had a chance for redemption, when Turner was stabbed and became the new captain of the Dutchman. But they blew the whole premise of why Davey Jones had his heart ripped out in the first place! The story had shown that he had it ripped out and kept far from him so he didn't have to feel anymore. So why then, did Turner continue to feel for Elizabeth when his heart was far away? I would have been much happier to see Turner come back with a barnacle attached to his face, and hatred in his eyes than to see such a contradictory ending. I was happy that they left the ending open for more from Jack and Barbossa, the fountain of youth would be an excellent premise. But then, after waiting through 10 minutes of credits (like it wasn't long enough to begin with), the final scene finished the story for Will and Elisabeth. The only other option for them is what happens when she gets old and dies, and he is still conscripted to the Dutchman. Not such a happy ending after all, is it? I would be happy to see more Pirates movies, with the storyline between Jack and Barbossa carrying the movie, but Elizabeth and Will are pretty well dead to me."

","At World's End starts up right away, no real reminders as to what came before, so be sure to be up on Dead Man's Chest before viewing. And do view, At World's End is slightly less silly and slightly more cohesive than Dead Man's Chest, though still not nearly as enjoyable as Curse of the Black Pearl, nor as satisfying overall (story and characters and visuals.) If you haven't see Pirates 1 or 2, don't bother with 3. The thin plot of At World's End will still leave you confused.<br/><br/>The special effects are highly detailed and make for some impressive scenes, though some of the fighting is too improbable and so more like a cartoon than live action (a pet peeve of mine.) Regardless, worthy of the theater's big screen, or a really impressive television. Good fun and humor with Jack Sparrow (and a touch of Keith Richards) oddness, but for my audience it was the Jack the monkey (and the midget) who stole the laughter.

I'm not saying it was a bad flick, but compared to its predecessors, it's weak. The characters are hard to follow sometimes, and sometimes easy to predict. I can honestly say I was bored in the theater until the end battle scenes, but even the way they did it was kind of puzzling. The CGI effects were incredible and probably rival lord of the ring's, but the fact that they have huge breaks in-between fights confused me. Still, a must see movie because of the cliffhangers from POTC 2, and a better summer flick than Spider-man 3, but if you are expecting what the first two had, don't! You will be disappointed."
"teh_mode","5","0","2","25 May 2007"," Overlong, over-hyped, overblown, undisciplined mess of a movie. I have never got the Pirates Of The Caribbean phenomenon and I never will
","Whip out your cutlass, put on your eye-patches, feed your parrots and fetch up a bottle of Malibu or two. Yes it is that time of year again, the time when I say ""Oh god, not this tripe again"" and stomach another movie featuring a cesspool of floundering talent awash in the midst of a franchise vehemently sailing way out of control. It is Pirates Of The Caribbean, the most overrated, overlong, over-hyped and damn well irritating movie trilogy since the Star Wars prequels. A throwback to the late 1950s style of TV-counter cinema that said to hell with logic, convention or narrative cohesion, films need to be really long, really grandiose and utterly overblown. And this time, it is the dark side of those pesky pirate dwellers, as the opening scenes of serf hangings suggests a much more mephitic aura to the film. That is, until a certain Johnny Depp turns up.<br/><br/>Continuing much in the same vein as the second instalment of the POTC franchise, At World's End has no plot. Or rather it has 28 different plots, all of which are almost entirely incomprehensible. The first quest of note is the one to rescue Captain Jack Sparrow, last seen tickling the throat of that huge great Kraken at the end of Dead Man's Chest. After they have done that, they must call the Pirate lords from all four corners of the globe, including Captain Barbossa (Rush), Davy Jones (Bill Nighy), Sao Feng (Yun-Fat) and a whole host of culture-clashing pirates. Meanwhile, Lord Cutler Beckett is still searching for Will Turner, Elizabeth Swan and Captain Jack Sparrow, in the hope that he will be able to execute them all himself.<br/><br/>The first Pirates Of The Caribbean was an entertaining mess, the second film was a sporadically enjoyable mess. Third time around it is just a mess. After the film's opening we are introduced to the new bad guy, Sao Fen, played by Chow Yun-Fat. Chow made his name with ultra-violent John Woo actioners, and as he rambles this boring Singapore bad-guy drivel, all I could think was how I wished he would just whip out a Beretta, an Uzi and a pump-handle shotgun and just shoot the hell out of absolutely everything that moves. This is a movie in desperate need of some John Woo-style mayhem. We are then re-acquainted with Captain Jack Sparrow, who appears to have gone bonkers by himself in the land of the dead. We are now treated to the sight of multiple Jack Sparrows all vying for position as the Captain of the black pearl. All the worst since Depp's space jockeying has become completely absurd. Then there's the drawn out love between Elizabeth Swan and Orlando. In fairness to Keira Knightley, she does her best under the circumstances, but Orlando Bloom is just not good enough for a romantic lead. His version of acting is, if you are a bit angry, turn the volume up. If you are a bit said, turn the volume down. But under no circumstances will you stretch your precious face beyond its lovely unwrinkled borders. He is almost transparent for this movie, as the huge concoction of ""stuff"" that happens all over the screen never allows his weak talents to shine through.<br/><br/>If, like me, you are thoroughly bored with Johnny Depp's gravitationally challenged pirate shtick, the film's only saving grace is the fairly spectacular final ship battle. There are cannons blazing, swords clashing, rain raging down and explosions galore. Yet even this is spoilt by a ridiculous moment of infancy, when Will Turner decides to pop the question to Ms Swan in the middle of a huge sword fight. It is this moment that sums the film up for me. It is too grizzly for young kids, but too infantile for gown-ups. It is almost the money-stroking filmmakers way of saying ""to hell with logic, we think its funny, so what?"" I have never gotten the fascination the Pirates Of The Caribbean franchise. It is ridiculously overlong, woefully directed, badly acted and spectacularly undisciplined. I don't get people's fascination with Johnny Depp's one-joke note performance, made even more insufferable by a self-knowing cameo by Keith Richards as the old drunk's father. I really don't get how Gore Verbinski has become the single most profitable director of our generation grossing well over a billion dollars with his films. I don't doubt that, like the first two, At World's End will take a ridiculous amount of money, and cause a huge wave of Jack Sparrow hysteria. Nor do I doubt that the very same people that were bowled over by the first two movies will embrace At World's End in much the same vein. But as far as I am concerned, this is just not good enough. Not for my summer blockbusters, and not for my pockets. And if people continue to humour Jerry Bruckheimer, by giving him the box office figures he is more than used to, you will not only encourage him to do it again, but you will damage the reputation of all those involved with this mess, but you will encourage them all to do it again. Hollywood will only work as hard as they need to, and a profitable movie is more important to them than art, entertainment, or the movie industry as a whole."

","As a pirate fan myself, i can't say i wasn't disappointed with the 3rd movie. There have been much worse trilogies that have ended far more disappointing.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp, as usual, played his character well. However, i thought that he had perhaps lost a lot of his charm from the original two movies. He is not focus of this last one. I also feel some of the main characters contradict themselves from the development of the first two. But there is also more screen time for secondary characters, and they are the ones cracking a lot of the jokes. Elizabeth's character is lot more darker, and more in charge of her decisions now, and is now learning sacrifices must come. Orlando Bloom has less screen time, but whenever he's on, he's usually angry at Elizabeth. While many were thrilled with Barbosa's return, I think that may have been where we lost the real charm of Jack Sparrow. He is crazier than ever in this movie, but more towards the end, with Elizabeth's line to him, ""It never would have worked out between us,"" not only did i feel this line was out of place, but when she goes to kiss him *and it seems she is kissing every guy in the movie* he pulls away. That's not what his character would do. I also just don't see the point of that line in the plot.<br/><br/>The plot itself is confusing and trying to keep up just won't work. Halfway through movie, you'll be wondering which side is Will Turner on, and what is going on between Will and Elizabeth. As you arrive towards the end, many questions go unanswered. Must Elizabeth stay on the island forever?<br/><br/>Also, stay for an extra clip at the end of the credits.<br/><br/>Overall, though I thoroughly enjoyed the movie, its very long, and much more humorous it seems than the others. The crowd went crazy, but while many people didn't like the 2nd movie *which in my opinion, may have been about the same as this last one* they ate the 3rd one right up. Is this the last we are going to see of Captain Jack Sparrow?"

","It's a long film. This would ordinarily be GREAT, but it isn't. There is not enough of Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), and some parts that he is in are too weird, although he acts wonderfully throughout. Jack action starts to kick in, but then the movie ends.<br/><br/>Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) is hilarious, and a true pirate. Loved him in this! Liz (Kiera Knightely) and Will (Orlando Bloom) both need to take a chill pill. They are corny and boring. I was embarrassed when Liz spoke to her pirate crew before the epic battle at the end.<br/><br/>Ultimately, this movie is a dog's breakfast. There are too many plots. There are lines and scenes that will make you laugh out loud (really funny bits), but too much trimming is needed (too many pieces to put together). People walked out of the theatre and I'm not surprised with the mass confusion that reigned throughout!"

","Why does pressure spoil the pleasure? This movie seemed like it took itself way too seriously.<br/><br/>Much like towards Spiderman 3, my expectations were out of the roof on this one. And much like after Spiderman 3, I walked out of the theater wondering what went wrong.<br/><br/>But as Spiderman managed to stay much like the first two parts, this one lost its thouch.<br/><br/>There was too much stuff, all the good things from the first two movies were hiding somewhere under the very dark cloud.<br/><br/>I laughed a few times, but after 30 minutes of watching, I couldn't help but thinking ""when does this movie actually start?"" Where was the light take on things, why Jack was like the guy in the red shirt in every other scene looking like his mother just died, and the next scene he talks like never before..deep and serious, why? Where was the sexual tension between Jack and Elizabeth...you do remember that from the second one, right? Why was the storyline more important than the story itself? Now if there's a fourth one, I REALLY hope it's going to go back to its roots and be that genuinely funny and light adventure-filled entertainment flick."

","Man, was that movie long.<br/><br/>About 1 hour too long in its 2 hour, 45 minute running time.<br/><br/>By far, one of the most graphic Disney movies ever. It had a very dark tone, while surprisingly bordering on ""R"" with its violent nature, yet paradoxically juvenile with its slapstick comedy, (even some sex was thrown in for good measure *GASP*.) The plot was ridiculous, muddled, convoluted and all other synonyms. And not much really happened that couldn't have finished up in 2 hours.<br/><br/>The Ennio Morricone (Spaghetti Western) music in a few scenes was also really odd.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, the movie will make heaps of cash and continue to drive the Disney machine.<br/><br/>Sadly it leaves open a fourth film :( So basically, it was everything I expected."

","The cast and crew of the Pirates franchise have done something right. they have created a movie franchise with insanely loyal fans, myself included. It is due to this loyalty that i will never be able to say a pirates film is bad. Against my better judgement, I enjoyed Pirates 3. I laughed, I shook with nerves, I felt a stab in the gut when certain things happened. I hated all of the characters at certain points, and loved them all at others. However, though I enjoyed this movie and the 2nd, I will forever think of those two as taking place in an alternate universe. In my mind, I choose to believe that the things in the Pirates universe are exactly as CotP left them, and the 2nd and 3rd movies are a ""what if"" sort of world. All in all, go see Pirates 3 if you are a fan, otherwise, you'll probably want to stab yourself with Will's beautifully made sword from the first film."

","Overall is a good movie. The turn from middle to the end is very disappointing. Seems like writers didn't have enough time to finish the script or just didn't have an idea about an ending. I was in the first screening and I remember that many people around me were saying that they didn't get the storyline, I was one of them. Why Becket didn't shoot? They let him die so easy. There are too many confusing scenes in the film, which tells about some problems with script. A little bit more about photography; it was not colorfull enough, just blanc and dark sides. I think adventure films have to be more colorfull. Directing was good, Verbinski did a good work. A lots of unexpected scenes in the middle part. Audience likes to see something surprised."
"hassdossa","5","0","2","24 May 2007"," No More Pirates...PLEASE!!!
","Although, I was very much involved with a female companion when I saw the first one...and walked out of absolute boredom through 45 minutes of the second installment...I still managed to catch this finale cause my friends are die hard fans of the series.<br/><br/>Despite me not knowing the complete outline of the first 2. At World's End was not that bad of a film...but still BAD.<br/><br/>The major flaw in this movie (and any movie if it doesn't live up to par) is the plot. It's just way too long and overdone with so many subplots in between which diffuses some of the intensity in the film and almost loses the overview. Anytime something big is about to happen, something else intervenes to confuse the whole drama. I'm guessing the reason for this is to bring closure in account for the first 2 films. But Whether you're a die hard fan or even a pirate, 2 hours and 48 minutes is way too long for anyone.<br/><br/>I can now see why editing is so essential in movie-making. But when you have such an over-budgeted film, like this one, where your lead actor is claiming almost 40% of the profits, I guess you have to leave out somebody? <br/><br/>Ironically speaking, even though the movie seemed never-ending there was still ROOM left for a sequel. With Capt. Jack Sparrow on a mission with his map, and Capt. Barbossa on a mission to get the map back, and the newlywed Capt. Swann's 10 year survival of loneliness on the beach awaiting the arrival of her hubby and the new Capt. of the Flying Dutchman, Will Turner. Yeah...isn't it exciting? But don't worry, for all you pirate haters out there, there will not be another one. And for all you crazy fans, suck on my black pearl cause they ain't coming back.<br/><br/>Though, despite all the insults I have to admit that I was slightly entertained. I mean I was impressed by the hanging, the stabbing, and the range of violence considering it was a Disney movie. The overall direction, photography, sets, and special effects were quite superb unlike any other film. As well as a few good laughs since Capt. Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) never seizes to amaze me. He wasn't as funny as he was in the first but still a riot. The man's a brilliant actor, what else can I say? But great acting doesn't necessarily mean a great movie and I think that's where most people get confused.<br/><br/>Sao Feng's (Chow-Yun fat) which seemed raw and dynamic at first but later failed to bring it home and his character was cut way too short. I mean his crew got more screen time than he did.<br/><br/>I think the audience all awaited the great Goddess, Calypso to unleash her super powers. And when that time had arrived she turns into an 80-foot Tina Turner which then turns into 500,000 shellfish crabs which flees the scene for good.<br/><br/>But didn't you feel so bad, so sorry for Davy Jones, the man with 500 Octopus tentacles squirming out of his face, when he shed a tear for his heart not being in place. Wasn't that so sad? It was so sad that it freaking made me sick.<br/><br/>Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightely) is indeed a hottie, and her role was quite suitable but her emotional, ""Braveheart"" like speech towards the end to all the pirates failed to impress and was a complete turn off.<br/><br/>Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) was a real tough one for me... cause' I'm still trying to decide whether he was more pathetic in this or in ""Troy"". It's a hard call when you have to determine which garbage was better. I'm not sure if it's him or his characters but they almost always seem to lack conviction and class... Mr. Bloom, you might be good-looking, but you can't act mate, go back to theater! <br/><br/>Capt. Barbossa on the other hand was terrific! I loved his attitude and his style. He's in my good books.<br/><br/>The scenes for which I just did not appreciate in the film was towards the end which were either cheesy or just made no sense. I couldn't believe that during one of the most intense battles of movie history (Disney movie history) there was a marriage...seriously a marriage. On the ship during all the sword-fighting, canons blasting under an intense storm we had Capt. (Priest) Barbossa reading out the vows. Isn't that sweet? Isn't that so romantic....awwwwwwww! Last but not least. It's just plain stupid that the Head Ship, with the governor aboard, sailed directly in between the two ships loaded with pirates writing his own death sentence. Which then caused the WHOLE armada to turn back and flee. I don't get it.<br/><br/>All in all, I was slightly entertained but majorly disappointed.<br/><br/>A must see for any abnormal Lord Of The Rings fan, any pirate or anybody who thinks that they are a pirate...Enjoy!!!"
"wsandin","4","0","2","24 May 2007"," Too Long and Too Complicated
","First, I want to preface my ""review"" by saying that I loved the first movie and I thought that it was a great mix of action/adventure, humor, romance, supernatural, etc. I liked the second one okay - I found it funnier overall than the first one, but I thought that the plot went much too into the supernatural realm. That may sound strange, seeing as the first movie had an undead skeleton crew, but it worked for me. The second movie cared too much about the supernatural, and Davy Jones was too over the top and the subplot with Will and his father was unnecessary. So, now you can see where I fall with the first two movies, so you can understand better my thoughts on the third.<br/><br/>I was very excited about the movie - I went to the midnight showing of the second one, and I saw this one at the 8:00 showing with my sister and friends. I must say that I was very disappointed in it. For one thing, it was badly paced. The action scenes were far and few between and surrounding them were boring, stilted speeches by the many characters. The famous cameo was badly used, which is just sad. The concept of the character is funny enough - not much work is needed to make it a hilarious appearance. Instead, it was played largely straight, which I thought was a mistake.<br/><br/>It was very confusing. I'm not stupid and I was paying attention and yet I was still confused about who was betraying who and who was on whose side. Even at the end, I was still unclear about what had happened in order to get them to that point. ""Minor"" characters like Norrington were sadly underused. The plot was padded out with the ridiculous imaginings of Jack Sparrow in which he talked to incarnations of himself. This may have been fine if it had appeared even once in the two earlier movies, but it did not and thus seemed out of the blue and merely an attempt to capitalize on Johnny Depp's comedic talents at the expense of about twenty minutes.<br/><br/>The jokes fell flat much of the time, and if I heard one more rum joke, I was ready to throw my popcorn at the screen. Even by the second movie, the rum jokes were starting to get old, by the fifteenth time there was one in the third it became just pathetic.<br/><br/>Finally, the end - MILD SPOILER: The tone of the ending was WAY out of place. The movies are largely light-hearted adventure movies. They're fun. The rather depressing ending was disappointing and, in my opinion, too much of a downer. It may have been brave to end it such, but it is not the type of ending that, I believe, one expects or wants to see. Of course, some may disagree, but I think that it should have ended with the type - and tone - of ending with which the first one finished. Okay, enough with the negatives.<br/><br/>I did enjoy some of the things. The call backs to the first movie - the dog with the key, ""poppet"", the two arguing ship men, ""parlay"", and some others - were fun to find. I also thought that the actors did an awesome job. Johnny Depp did his usual great job as Captain Jack Sparrow, Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley were fun as Will and Elizabeth, and all the other actors were fine as well. The special effects were as well done as before, and the last fight scene was awesome.<br/><br/>Overall, I enjoyed the movie, but it was not as good as I thought it would be, which may be why I pointed out so much of the negative. It needed better editing and better jokes. The third movie should be better than the second for sure, and action packed. This one had dialogue where there should have been sword fighting. Anyway, it was fun to see once, but unlike the first one - which I saw three times in the theater because I kept making my friends go see it - once was enough for this one."

","So like many people I raced out to see POTC 3 on opening night, a big fan of the first two films. I braced myself for the 3 hour running time and got excited...<br/><br/>First of all the introduction of Chow Yun Fat as the Singapore Pirate lord, he was great although I would of loved to of seen him do more fighting as he was very cool. Captain Jack was fantastic as always, although a smaller role I feel. (I could watch Captain Jack all day and be entertained!) Also the appearance of Jack's dad (Keith Richards) was very funny. And Geoffrey Rush's Captain Barrbosa was simply superb.<br/><br/>Both Orlando and Kiera should have had smaller roles, it seemed like Capt. Jack was playing second to them. Their love story was the usual ""love story's don't belong in action movies"" rubbish. (I personally feel their characters should have been left behind at the end of the first film.) Orlando Bloom as 'Will' was the worst part for me. I couldn't keep up with whose side he was on, and his storyline at the end was the biggest pile of c*** I've ever seen, it really put a downer on the whole film for me. But I see why it was done to finish their two's story. So in a sense if there was more POTC Orlando & Kiera wouldn't be in it. (I hope!) <br/><br/>Basically there was too much cramming of story trying to finish everyone's personal journeys, some characters just seemed to disappear at the end. I also wished Jack Davenport as 'Norrington' had been given the staring role he had in the second film, as I think he's fantastic. Plus the whole Pirates of the Caribbean thing, I don't think we even visited the Caribbean for more then 5 minutes! <br/><br/>The films feet weren't that firmly planted in anything or anywhere.<br/><br/>The first film was the best, second one was pure popcorn fun and I loved it, the thirdÂ… fun, entertaining, great action but just a little weak for me. I will go see it again, I really did enjoy it, just the few bits that let it down were dreadfully obvious!<br/><br/>Go see it, Enjoy!<br/><br/>Captain Jack rocks!"

","When I went to Pirates 3, I expected to have fun, but I didn't think this one would be as good as the other two, especially since I thought 2 was inferior to 1. However, I was very pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>The acting was as excellent as always, but the script was stunning. It definitely exceeded the second film and equaled the first in cleverness and humor. The score, always a strong element of the franchise, was complementary without being distracting.<br/><br/>While long, the movie doesn't lag. The large cast of major characters makes it necessary for the story to have a very wide scope; it does so capably and satisfactorily.<br/><br/>The only possible criticism I can think of is that it's a little bit difficult to tell what is going on at times. The action flits from one perspective to another extremely rapidly. However, it didn't impair my enjoyment at all and will, I am sure, be clearer after seeing the film again."

I just can't say enough good things about it without spoiling for people and I am glad no one spoiled it for me. I really did not know too much about the plot and I like it that way.

","Let's start off with this. It's not that bad. There's the basic summary. Now for the long version....<br/><br/>I walked into this film worried about it. Would it sink to the unbelievable low of 'Spider-Man 3', or would it be a fine, flavorful piece of entertainemnt, ala 'Shrek the Third'? It turns out this threequel winds up somewhere in between those two films on my list. 'At World's End' is not nearly as cringeworthy as Spidey, but it lacks the special sauce that make the Shrek threequel such a great summer surprise. The main problem is the plot. This film picks up where the last one left off, with the crew of the Black Pearl hunting for Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp, carrying the film as usual), who is trapped in a strange purgatory full of crabs (hey, I don't make this stuff up). It's an interesting idea that gives FX greats ILM plenty opportunity to dream up plenty of eye candy, but the fact that Depp doesn't appear for the entire first quarter of the film hurts the story's momentum greatly. Instead, we are treated to more of the semi-romance between Keira Knightley and Orblando-scuse me, Orlando Bloom, and the introduction of a disappointing new baddie, Sao Feng (Chow-Yun Fat, whose spiritual demeanor does not lend itself to roles of mustache twirling villainy). When we finally do pick up with Captain Jack, it's a breath of cinematic fresh air, and, for a while, the film returns to the anything-goes, tossed-in-the-air style that made parts 1 and 2 of the series great marvels of escapism. But than, as the film reaches its final stages, it becomes a cluttered, dull heap of subplots. So much time is spent on the needless backstories of characters like Tia Dalma (an obnoxious role played with Rasta-esquire fervor by Naomi Harris) and James Norrington (Jack Davenport does what he can), that the script begins to kill of characters at random in a sloppy attempt to divert back to the main plot without leaving the many smaller stories open-ended. But for all it's storyline complexities, the film's ending practically screams ""Pirates 4!"". If one can ignore the story long enough to appreciate the other aspects of the film, they will find imaginative visuals, some strong performances, and a final action setpiece among the best ever committed to celluloid. But in a film that is part of a trilogy promising escapism, a convoluted plot shouldn't be a problem. A solid film, though the worst in the 'Pirates' trilogy."

It gets off to a shaky start, but jumps into the action quickly after Jack rejoins and climbs to an epic climax of Pearl vs. Dutchman around a gigantic whirlpool.<br/><br/>So many loose ends are tied up, and at times it seems cluttered, but if you pay attention you won't get lost. The loose ends are tied up with style and humor, and only the mysterious ""mark"" Jack left on Beckett is never explained. And some others like the Kraken, Governor Swan, and Sao Feng, are tied up too fast and could have been carried out a little longer.<br/><br/>I only have one real gripe, with Will and Elizabeth's marriage. Did it really have to be during the fight? It was corny, really, and annoying. It also seemed squeezed in, and I fail to see why as it only detracted from the battle.

Expectations for the third were astronomical to say the least.<br/><br/>All the gang is back this time, loose ends are tied up only to be loosened again at the end. The movie takes on a grander scale and its all about the big things, but the creators have continually put in the humorous dialogue, and lots of Jack Sparrow to lighten the mood.<br/><br/>I've read many reviews from critics saying the movie was extremely confusing. I'm not a blatant fanboy - I went to this movie with a relaxed demeanour and I was able to understand everything. I mean, a lot of things happen but in no way are you scratching your head going ""I don't get it."" The movie is filled with twists and plot turns, secret plans, treachery, heroism and most of all, good ole Pirates. This one is unmissable, you will end up in the theatre or renting on DVD and loving every moment of it. The crowd cheered in the beginning (as they had in Spiderman-3) but the difference was, when the credits appeared, they gave the movie a standing ovation. All I remember at Spiderman-3 was a mob of people, rushing to get back to their cars and forget what a waste of $350 million that film was.<br/><br/>And to cap it all off, Jack is back where he started, a familiar setting and perhaps a premise for a fourth film.

","I like the first movie a lot. It was fun and different. The second movie I hated. It was dull and confusing. This third movie I went to because I had nothing else to do on a Friday afternoon and I thought I would hate it. I didn't. I didn't love it, but I didn't hate it. It's hard not to write spoilers but I won't I will just say that I really hated Keirra's character in the second movie, in the first movie she made sense but in the second she didn't and in the third she doesn't until almost the end. If this movie is trying to show women in power, I say we just keep the men if Elizabeth Swann in the best we can do. Jack Sparrow continues to be Jack Sparrow just nuttier and the plots and double crosses just keep getting more stupid and confusing. In the end the plot itself only makes sense for Will and Boot strap Bill. Chow Yun-Fat and Keith Richards are wasted. Only Barbossa's characterization is worth watching, he and Jack Sparrow together are fun. Poor Norington, unlike in the second film, is also wasted. The Jamaican accented Naomi Harris' character is interesting for most of the film and then wasted in the end, as is Davey Jones. I did say I liked this film didn't I. The CGI got to be too much but the end was sweet and noble so 7/10 for that."
"moviedoors","4","0","2","25 May 2007"," Disappointing
","I really wanted to like this movie. Really, I did. I thought the first two Pirates films were fun but very flawed movies. I was hoping that this would be the film to really rap it all up and give new life to those first two films. Sadly, it just didn't do that for me.<br/><br/>Personally, Jack Sparrow has never been more interesting than as he was in Curse of the Black Pearl. Depp's performance made that movie and he deserved his Oscar nomination. But in these sequels, something's missing from Jack and I'm having real trouble figuring out what it is. Depp plays him well enough in At World's End and they take the character to some bizarre new places, but I actually found myself not rooting for Jack in this film. I was rooting for Davey Jones.<br/><br/>Speaking of Davey Jones, there is just not enough of him in this movie. He and his crew were by far the highlight of Dead Man's Chest. The rap up to his story is very disappointing. He has abilities in this movie that seem inconsistent, and the way he gets around not being able to set foot on land in one particular scene is quite honestly just lame. More of his history is explained, but it goes absolutely nowhere and amounts to nothing, as does a subplot involving Calisto that is truly and aggravatingly underwhelming.<br/><br/>Some of the recurring characters just feel tacked on. The bumbling pair of British soldiers really didn't need to be here and they provide for a very weak plot resolution in the film's third act.<br/><br/>Bloom does the best he can I suppose, but let's face it, Will Turner is just not a very interesting character. Kiera Knightley has improved, though I still don't completely like the way she plays angry, what with all the jutting out of the lower jaw. The return of Geoffrey Rush is glorious however. I found Captain Barbossa to be a much more compelling character than Sparrow in this film. Playing a pirate is a role that can easily lead to overacting, and Rush masterfully knows when to go full throttle or apply the breaks a bit. Stellan Skarsgard's role is so small it's barely worth mentioning. Chow Yun-Fat was good, but I wanted more. the real revelation here however is Keith Richard's small role. I was dreading his cameo, but his character completely steals the show and his line delivery is wonderful.<br/><br/>The special effects are amazing, despite a few unconvincing shots of multiple Sparrows in act II (it's too complicated to explain). The final action scene is an absolute marvel of technical wizardry. I'm gonna go ahead and call this as next year's Academy Award winner for Best Visual Effects. The only problem is, the final battle is underwhelming. Without getting into spoilers, this scene could have been far more epic. While I was amazed with the visuals, I just couldn't bring myself to get excited as I did in say the Mumakil stampede in Return of the King.<br/><br/>I'm sure this film will make gobs of money, and many people might still love it. I never understood what people found so great about the other two, so I'm not going to try to predict how die hard fan's of the series will react. All I can say it left me empty and longing for the great adventure epic it could have been."

","Gorgeously shot, great dialog, wonderful acting... but I have no idea what happened. This is 50 minutes of story crammed into 3 hours of movie. Seriously. Usually I'll check the spoiler box up there but I couldn't ruin this story for you if I wanted to. I DO know that there isn't enough Johnny Depp and easily too much of everything else by at least half. It's as if Verbinski and his people had gone over every scene and figured out how to complicate and over-blow it. That kind of stuff worked in the first two because they confined themselves more to stage-bound set pieces like that sword fight in the waterwheel, but since they felt that had to top themselves this time there was no where to go but beyond physical reality. (By the way, that sword fight appears quaint next to the big one here. The swamp sorceress from the end of part 2 though? Still here, and still smokin' hot. Anyway, not enough charm and too much noise for my taste, but quite accomplished in movie- movie terms."

","There is some criticism out there that this film is slightly too long, that some scenes are a little bit too different (and drawn out), and that the plot line can be too involving sometimes. These are all true, and it is commonly the case when a director has a billion dollar grossing film under his belt which then allows him or her more creative freedom from their commercially minded producers and studios (remember PJs King Kong?). We all know when watching it that there will be that great action sequence at the end, and it is great, yes, but the potentially confusing, backstabbing and treacherous plot line preceding it, in my mind could have been toned down a notch so more epic-like action could be fitted in earlier on in the film as well as at the end.<br/><br/>However, with all this in mind, the film still manages, somehow, to keep your attention for its nearly 3 hour entirety. And its a keen, engrossed and excited attention that it gets from its audience, too. One of its greatest appeals is its unique and appealing style which we are rarely given the pleasure to witness. The style arises out of that largely unexplored area somewhere between 'artsy' films, fantasy films, commercial films and of course, comedies. You can't help but think that in 20 years time, people will watch this again for the first time since when they were kids and revere in the nostalgia (and finally get the story line), like we did with Indiana Jones and Star Wars amongst others.<br/><br/>It will be very interesting to see if this film, with its Luke warm reception from critics and its massive momentum from 'Pirates 2', will beat out the Spidey to regain its opening weekend records, and whether it can carry through to earn more than 'Pirates 2's $1 billion Worldwide BO taking. If it does, I think we'll be seeing wicked Jack a couple more times."

","Action, Humor, a bit of Drama and Romance, loads of Betrayal, even a death or two, Priates 3 makes good use out of its 2 hour 48 minute time length though it seems they could have extended it more. The opening moves far to fast to make any immediate sense, and though it slowly comes together later for the most part you'll be a bit mystified. But if you ignore the few gaps in the plot, and just sit through Depp and Rush's wonderful banter the movie is nearly up there with the first one. They stick with the main cast, and while they introduced all the pirate lords of the sea they really became the pirates who didn't really do anything. Its not a bad thing, but it was a bit disappointed that they didn't get more air time. The rest of the main cast play out their characters as they have in last two movies, introducing nothing new to the scheme. If you liked the first two movies, there is no reason why you wouldn't like this one. So, Drink up me harties, Yo HO!"

","Picking up right where the last film left off, Elizabeth Swann, Will Turner, and the resurrected Captain Barbossa attempt to enlist the aid of the merciless pirate Sao Feng so they can lead an expedition to the very ends of the Earth and rescue Jack Sparrow. They must also thwart the treacherous Lord Beckett who's using his control over Davy Jones' heart to try and eliminate the remaining Pirate Lords and rule the high seas. Overlong, exposition-heavy script fluctuates between confusion and coherency, but still manages to entertain with spectacular visual effects, rousing action scenes, an exciting, over-the-top climax, and big time laughs thanks to a first-rate cast, especially Depp as the irrepressible, larger-than-life Sparrow. Much rougher and tougher than the previous two installments making it too intense for the youngest audiences, but adults shouldn't have any complaints. Plodding at times, but lots of fun if patient. ***"
"cosmomckinley","6","0","1","24 May 2007"," Good,If not very disappointing finale
","With a very promising swashbuckling start in Singapore the film seems to go on a very fast downward slant of very boring sequences with not a hell of a lot going on!the film relies on its comedic heart with belly laughs through out mainly coming from the fantastic Capt jack sparrow which johnny deep plays fantastically again.but, Davey Jones locker seems far too long drawn out,stupid,kinda confusing with some laughs.everyone really gives it their all and really acts well(especially keira knightly who has to step up to the plate to be the Capitan of the black pearl)but as always in all of the films the worst is Orlando bloom who is so boring and wooden.i still wonder what hes doing here.hes plain old eye-candy for the girls.the films 165 minute running is way too long as it again relies on cheap laughs and really long drawn out boring sequences that sometimes confuse as well and not a lot of relevance to the story line at all.but its saving grace(besides johnny depp)is its absolutely fantastic effects that are so amazing!even Davey Jones still amazes me!again on to the comedy.even though it is very funny it is far too funny for an action adventure(spider-man 3 also suffered from this problem)sometimes i was thinking was i in the wrong film!it seems that the trilogy finales so far this year have been very disappointing AT WORLDS END is no exception and i hope more finales/sequels will be better.i will probably go too see it again next week just to see the fantastic johnny and the amazing effects and that only.this will certainly please die hard fans and disappoint others."
"hkusno","3","0","2","27 May 2007"," NOT the best of the trilogy
","Sorry to say, but for a trilogy, Pirates 3 has been a huge disappointment for me. kinda deja vu like Matrix trilogy. I don't mind that the story got more complex and they put more characters into the movie, but for heavensake, would someone please tell Disney's execs that famous actors & big budget don't necessarily translate into good movie. This movie is so confusing, dialogs sometimes make no sense, plot that contradict the storyline, I just don't know what to follow. And even when I tried to not care about the story line, some of the action and acting are just too much to bear. Kiera and Orlando getting married in the middle of a fight, seems like they're dancing instead of fightng for their life. Beside, in this movie, there's really no chemical between them, suddenly they just decided to get married? Please. Other problem: Old characters lines that get reused over and over, just got boring. This third Pirates is just leaving me with bad taste in my mouth....."

","* * * SPOILER WARNING * * * <br/><br/>I've seen it yesterday and it just had to be said: i'm still shocked. Where's all the fun and laughter? Where's the silly plot? And most importantly: where's the happy ending?<br/><br/>I have to say: till about 30 minutes before the ending, I really liked the movie. Yes, it had way too many characters and yes, again everything was ""darker"" and more twisted than the original and even the second one, but it made me have a good time.<br/><br/>And then: the big finale. Others have said things about the absolute usefulness of Calypso (she grows, she grows, she grows and... becomes thousands of crabs: am I the only one who totally missed the point?) but what nailed me to my seat, was the death of Will. And he doesn't only die: no, he becomes the captain of the Flying Dutchman en leaves his beloved Elizabeth. They have one night (or day, didn't get that so well), and then he sails away not to come back in 10 years! Why does she not come with him? Kills herself, drowns at see, I mean his father could stay on the ship, why can't she? I admit it: i'm a person who likes happy endings. And this, this can't be labelled a happy ending. I give it a seven, because for more than two hours, I've had fun. But the ending has ruined everything for me."

","Ah, what might have been. When I saw the first installment of this series, I thought this franchise definitely has legs. Then ""Dead Man's Chest"" was released and I changed my mind. Still I had hope for ""At World's End"", assuming that Disney and Gore Verbinski would have listened to the multitude of groans that welled up after that nonsensical mess. But alas, no. It appears the plan for the third film was to try and be all things to all people without a care for good storytelling.<br/><br/>The pacing was astonishingly bad and even when an effort was made to pick up the pace you were forced to deal with ridiculous subplot points such as Will and Elizabeth being married by Barbosa during the climactic battle between the Black Pearl and The Flying Dutchman. Cannon balls crashing, swords flailing, but the wedding must take place now! What was that? Quite frankly, I never saw an ounce of chemistry between Will and Elizabeth in the first place, much less enough for them to have this overpowering need to be married in the middle of a sea battle. Utterly ridiculous.<br/><br/>And if you're thinking that Johnny Depp as Jack Sparrow will save the day, guess again. Smiling Jack doesn't even show up until 40 minutes into this 3 hour bore fest and is used sparingly throughout. While Depp's character appears in several scenes, he rarely drives the action. Instead his trademark ""sheepishly confused"" facial expressions seem to be his most frequent contribution. That, or him quarreling with other incarnations of himself for no reason whatsoever. This happens twice by the way. Why?<br/><br/>As with most tent-pole summer flicks these days, this movie ultimately comes to rely on eye-popping CGI and cute furry animals to win over the audience. And I don't doubt that's all it takes if you're under 17 or share Paris Hiltons' IQ score, but some of us want more. <br/><br/>How about giving us some characters to actually care about. Other than Depp's ""Smiling Jack"", I couldn't care less about the rest of this massive ensemble. And although this storyline was easier to follow than the last, it was constantly polluted with plot point roadblocks. It seemed as if the Disney Marketing department wrote this script. I can almost hear those guys working it out... <br/><br/>""Okay, we have to have a bunch of CGI for the teens."" Check.<br/><br/>""We'll need a cute furry animal for the preteens."" Check. <br/><br/>""We need to somehow make Elizabeth ""the pirate king"" so women see a strong female character."" ""But won't that seem a little implausible?"" ""Nah, we'll just distract the audience by putting Steven Tyler in the scene for no logical reason."" ""Good idea."" Check<br/><br/>The list goes on, but I fear this review is getting just as long and boring as the movie. This isn't a terrible flick and I'm sure everyone will get something out of it, but it just seems to me that if you have that much money and that much talent to spend it on, the final result should measure up. Unfortunately ""At Worlds's End"" doesn't."
