"margielord","Null","222","269","16 December 2005"," This Movie Is Great For Special Olympic Athletes!
","As Head of Delegation for a Special Olympic Texas team who has athletes featured in this movie, I have to take exception with the concept of assuming the athletes are being teased and made fun of in this movie. I spent most of 3 months on the set watching the filming 2 years ago and I know how very carefully Special Olympics International has watched the development of this movie. They have been involved in every aspect of this movie, from script development to final product. I also know how very careful Special Olympics is with putting their seal of approval on projects. They simply do not endorse ANYTHING, yet they are completely and 100% behind this movie.<br/><br/>I have seen the movie and can't wait to take every member of my team. Many of them have seen the movie and indeed are in it. At the premiere in Austin December 6 my athletes were howling with laughter and having a great time. While I will admit that Johnny Knoxville, the Farrelly Brothers and Special Olympics do not seem to make the best mix in the world, this works. And it is a beautiful movie. There are a few dirty words (like Forrest Gump) and a few tasteless jokes, but it is screamingly funny and has worlds of heart. The athletes are always, ALWAYS treated with the utmost respect. Unlike most movies about the mentally handicapped, there are major parts in this movie played by genuine special Olympic athletes, and they used some 200 special Olympic extra's. This was a labor of love, on both sides of the camera. It deserves to be viewed and respected. The producers had a vision of bringing to life and light the fact that mentally challenged people are well rounded and enjoyable people. They did it beautifully. Go see the movie and laugh with all your heart."
"MovieManMenzel","8","70","85","3 January 2006"," Wow this movie is really underrated!
","A long time ago when I first saw the trailer for ""The Ringer"" my reaction to it was what the hell? Why would someone make a whole movie based on a ""South Park"" episode? Then the trailer for ""The Ringer"" disappeared for a while and then resurfaced completely re-edited. The new trailer for the film didn't really increase my interest in the film but out of curiosity (and the fact there really isn't much out I haven't seen) I decided to give the movie a chance and did so this afternoon.<br/><br/>""The Ringer"" is about a guy named Steve (Johnny Knoxville) who has just gotten himself in a little bit of trouble and is in a bit of debt because he owes $25,000 to the local hospital. With no where else to go Steve turns to his uncle Gary (Brian Cox), who is also in debt because of a bad gambling problem. Gary soon comes up with the solution to both their problems, Gary wants to fix the Special Olympics and enter Steve as the special athlete in order to win the money to pay off both their debts. Funny and touching moments ensueÂ… <br/><br/>Wow!!!! That's all I can say when I walked out of the theater this afternoon! This movie is probably one of the most poorly marketed and underrated films ever. The movie from its marketing makes you feel ashamed to even want to see it because it looks like it's about making fun of people who are ""special"" but guess what? The movie doesn't give off that vibe at all. In fact, it makes you actually view the mentally challenged as normal people. The movie is never mean when it comes to dealing with that topic in fact it's almost uplifting and inspirational. Holy crap! Who the heck would think that would be possible from looking at the trailer or reading the plot outline? <br/><br/>""The Ringer"" is one of these movies that received mediocre reviews which I don't understand. Roger Ebert of all critics actually admitted to liking this movie which means the movie has to be pretty darn good because he's a very harsh critic. I don't understand how anyone can hate this movie. While it does contain some of Hollywood's most typical scenes, the movie has a ton of heart, a decent amount of laughs, and overall good performances especially for a comedy. This is one of those hidden surprises that we rarely get from Hollywood. Also a little side note, this movie was made with the help of the real Special Olympics so it's nice to know there is some reality that helps fuel the film.<br/><br/>The acting all around is really good. Johnny Knoxville plays his character Jeffy perfectly. Katherine Heigl plays Lynn the adorable counselor in charge of watching over the special athletes and her and Knoxville both have nice on screen chemistry. The best characters though are the mentally challenged athletes themselves especially Glen (Jed Rees) and Thomas (Bill Chott). Everyone did a fine job in making the film's performances funny and believable.<br/><br/>The screenwriter Ricky Blitt is best known for writing several episodes of one of my favorite TV shows ""Family Guy."" Who would have thought that someone who had such a creative mind to create crude and original jokes for an animated TV series would be able to create such a touching and funny script? Director Barry W. Blaustein did a good job capturing the heart felt moments and comedy. The whole ""When did we get ice cream"" scene was a classic among others. I think both guys did a good job with the film and I feel bad for both that this movie is doing better at the box office because this movie really does have potential.<br/><br/>In the end, ""The Ringer"" is a very enjoyable and unique comedy, one that makes you laugh with the characters and not at them. The writer and director as well as everyone involved make you look and think of mentally challenged people as normal people. When the movie tries to exhibit typical jokes like every time Steve falls down it fails as a comedy but when it's not trying so hard to be funny it really is and luckily that's the majority of the film. When you leave the theater after watching this film, you leave with a big smile on your face and almost feel a bit inspired. This film is sure to win the hearts of most and is truly a victim of bad marketing. I for one loved ""The Ringer"" and will be sure to buy it when it comes to DVD.<br/><br/>MovieManMenzel's final rating for ""The Ringer"" is an 8/10. Ignore the trailers and check it out!"
"ccthemovieman-1","9","27","31","22 March 2007"," Underneath, This Has A Sweet Tone To It
","A typical modern-day comedy so some of its crudeness with sexual innuendos or remarks, but overall this is a full notch or two above most because underneath it is a soft, good- hearted feel to it. It's also a nice vehicle for a positive image to be presented for mentally- challenged people (formerl called ""retards""). Those guys are as much of stars in this film as actors Johnny Knoxville and Katherine Heigl. <br/><br/>Knoxville plays the main character, ""Steve Barker,"" a guy for (for good reasons, if that's possible) fakes being ""handicapped"" and enters The Special Olympics. He is hoping to win a big monetary prize to help pay for a friend's surgery and to help out his degenerate uncle who could be killed if he doesn't pay gamblers what he owes. Brian Cox plays ""Uncle Gary."" Both the man who needs the surgery (""Stavi,"" played by Luis Avalos) and Cox are hilarious in their roles, one being sympathetic and the other sleazy.<br/><br/>Along the way, Knoxville falls in love with Special Olympics worker ""Lynn Sheridan"" (Heigl). Hey, who wouldn't? This woman is unbelievably attractive and plays a good-hearted character.<br/><br/>Most of the funny lines in the movie are delivered by the Special Olympics athletes. Unrealistic? Yes, credibility is not high in that regard as as 99.9 percent of all the world's population would't be clever enough to deliver some of these lines but they are a hoot to hear. The fact you hear them uttered by ""mentally-challenged"" folks makes it even more outrageous and funny, of course. I can't remember how many times I just laughed out loud at something being said.<br/><br/>And, the film ends on a nigh note despite our hero being discovered as a fraud. The whole story is just a lot of a fun and is truly a feel-good film when it's all over. Highly recommended, but not for small kids because of the language."
"Sportscam20-1","9","29","34","4 January 2006"," ""The Ringer"", True Equality for All or a Step Backwards?
","What would you say if a person would try to enter the Special Olympics and make people think he was actually Developmentally Disabled? Horrible Right? Well, this is what happens in the new film ""The Ringer."" Steve Barker (Johnny Knoxville) is an average office worker looking for some new challenges to his job. Barker must fire a janitor of long-time status to the company, but he feels sorry for him and rehires him for a new job. In the process the janitor, Stavi, is hurt and must be taken to the hospital. Now Steve Barker must find a way to earn a huge sum of money in one week! Gary (Brian Cox), Steve's uncle, tells him that he should ""rig the Special Olympics"" by pretending to be a Special Olympics athlete.<br/><br/>But, as Steve enters into the Special Olympics as his alter ego, Jeffy, the athletes quickly realize that he is not like one of them. Now he is in trouble, if the athletes tell their coaches he is not developmentally disabled, then his uncle may lose a bet that he put on him to beat the reigning champion, 6-time Gold Medalist, Jimmy, in order to help Stavi. As kind as the Special Olympians are known to be, they reach an agreement that they will not squeal on Steve if he can beat Jimmy. They are tired of Jimmy taking the glory all the time. They train Steve to be able to run faster, jump higher, and toss further than Jimmy.<br/><br/>Special Olympics, a very proud organization that was created by Eunice Kennedy Shriver, endorsed this film with the hopes that it will be the beginning of equality for all people, disabled and non-disabled. Tim Shriver, now head of the Special Olympics Board, Peter and Bobby Farrelly, known for such movies as ""Dumb and Dumber,"" ""There's Something About Mary,"" and ""Stuck On You,"" are the producers that had worked on making this film so all people could laugh with the athletes, rather than at the athletes. Special Olympians will enjoy this movie with others because it has plenty of humor for all to understand. There are even Special Olympic athletes who are some of the main characters and plenty of athletes as the extras. Written by Ricky Blitt, writer of ""Family Guy"" on Fox, and directed by Barry Blaustein, writer for ""The Nutty Professor"" and ""The Honey Mooners,"" this movie is a feel-good, light-hearted comedy. People will be entertained as well as learning these individuals are more than they are perceived to be by many people.<br/><br/>There are many different views to this movie, some good and not so good, but Special Olympics and the National Downs Syndrome Society both back the film because it sends a good message. Audiences learn, just like Steve, that the athletes are fun to hang out with and they can do nearly as much as anyone else can. To be fair, there are a few words that may have people nervous the first 15 minutes of the film, but it is quickly found that it teaches the lesson the word ""retard"" is a term that people with intellectual disabilities find hurtful. The Farrelly brothers would like to see a positive spotlight shown on ""The Ringer"" because it could help begin to change stereotypes about people with disabilities before they talk with them and get to know them. The main idea was if Johnny Knoxville is in the movie, he could attract the audience from his show ""Jack Ass"", the people who are normally mean towards kids in the schoolyard and say the word every person hates to hear ""Retard."" By attracting these people, he says in the movie ""don't make fun of my friends!"" then his followers will start doing the same. As the Farrelly's explained in an interview with ""ABC News"" on December 26th, ""Every time you see a movie about people with intellectual disabilities, they're portrayed Â— it's a tear-jerker, it's sad. It's depressing. We wanted to throw something out there that was uplifting."" ""The Ringer"" is a light-hearted comedy that will open your mind and your heart to intellectually disabled individuals."
"elf_107","9","98","134","20 December 2005"," This movie has so much heart!
","I got 2 free passes to see this film... I had very low expectations since it starred Johnny Knoxville who I, until today, only associated with really grotesque behavior on Jackass. The combination of that and Special Olympics smelled like it could be a cheap joke at the expense of Special Olympians but in fact it turned out to be just the opposite! It totally surpassed my expectations! It was a truly sweet, laugh out loud funny feel-good movie with big big heart. It portrayed the Olympians in a really caring way and those characters totally made the movie. I didn't have any trouble swallowing Johnny as a naive guy with a big heart, but people who've seen him in Jackass might find the contrast startling at first. It might be too sweet, or too predictably Hollywood for some people... But the physical comedy and naive sweetness really won me over in the end. I look forward to watching this film again."
"Sprstrddawg","10","44","65","1 January 2006"," A Really Great Movie
","The Ringer, a story about a man who rigs the Special Olympics to gain money for him and his uncle, is a surprisingly good movie. Reading the premise and seeing the commercials for this movie probably won't give you much reason to see it. It comes across as an insensitive, politically incorrect film that degrades mentally challenged people and pokes fun at the Special Olymics when it is actually not like that at all. There is a great message behind the film. Johnny Knoxville as Jeffy is great, not the insensitive jerk he may seem to be from Jackass. Brian Cox plays a great Uncle Gary, and Katherine Heigl is wonderfully sweet as Lynn. Besides a little language, this is a film for all ages. This New Year, check out The Ringer if you want a laugh and a heartwarming story."
"pamela-98","9","73","114","26 December 2005"," I saw The Ringer last night
","There are so many people who have a difficult time with the holiday season, and I guess I'm one of them. I was able to take my family to see The Ringer last night and I'm SO glad I did. I had reservations, once the movie started. I knew very little about it, and, certainly was not aware of the Special Olympics endorsement. I wasn't sure how they were going to portray the special people. However, as the characters were developed, this movie became so heartwarming and genuine that I left with tears because it blessed me so. Maybe I'm the one who is screwed up, and I'm certainly no professional when dealing with handicaps, but I am a substitute teacher and have often been blessed to be assigned to the special needs classes, so I have been around many special students. I loved this movie. It helped me to get some issues of my own in perspective and gave my whole family a real feel-good experience. I have read the comments of others, and it appears to me, the people who were most critical hadn't even seen the film."
"klchamp","10","27","39","13 July 2006"," Give this movie a chance!!!
","When thinking about the Special Olympics, you normally would not think of comedy. Yet the Farrelly Bros. strike again. A goof-ball with a heart of gold is helped by a group of S.O. athletes, only to overcome odds, help a friend get his fingers back, and open himself up to vulnerability and attacks. Excellent performances by Knoxville, Heigl, and especially Jed Rees and Bill Chott for their unforgettable performances as Glen and Thomas (both from Galaxy Quest) . ANYONE who thought this movie to be politically incorrect...don't knock it until you have seen it! They hired mentally challenged performers for various roles, and rather than be the butt of the jokes, they are the ones making those jokes. WATCH THIS MOVIE AND ENJOY IT FOR WHAT IT IS...a good film, an excellent cast, and the brand of comedy one can only expect from the Farrelly Bros. Have fun and laugh!!!"
"killergoomba","10","54","85","3 January 2006"," Edgy Material pulled off in the finest form.
","Johnny Knoxville? Special Olympics? When I first saw the movie poster to 'The Ringer', I was thinking ""tasteless""? But when I found out that the movie had the approval of the Special Olympics itself, I decided to see this movie. I like Johnny Knoxville. I think he is funny, even though he has been quite the Jackass. 'Dukes Of Hazzard' was a hoot... 'Walking Tall' was another good Knoxville flick. 'The Ringer' is perhaps his finest. I have to say that, I don't think that anyone who left the theatre tonight went away without learning something. Johnny Knoxville? The Special Olympics? Who else could have pulled this one off? Carrey? Ferell? Stiller? Nope. Knoxville. Well Done!"
"pamela2406-1","8","52","84","20 December 2005"," Great Movie
","The Special Olympics gave their blessings to the makers of this movie. I saw it at a special preview. I was worried that the movie was based on making fun of handicapped individuals, it was not. I was impressed by this movie. It shows the behind the scenes of the Special Olympics and the people that help. I spoke with a few people after the movie and asked what they thought and 60% of them mentioned that they personally would like to help out at the next Special Olympics. They said they never knew what it was like to be around special people and were sometimes scared. But seeing this movie made them understand how some of them are and it made them want to help. Most of the jokes were directed towards the Jeffy character played by Johnny Knoxville. I would recommend this movie to everyone. It was a good movie."
"cosmorados","8","4","4","18 June 2007"," what a shame for those who didn't get it
","I like many people saw the trailer for this film and instantly felt angry at the Farrelly's for crossing the line and taking the rip out of the disabled, after seeing it the only person having the rip taken out of him was johnny Knoxville who is brilliantly cast as the stooge of his addicted gambler uncle, Brian Cox.<br/><br/>The story of a man who fakes mental disability in order to compete in the special Olympics and win money in a betting scandal seems like it would be just too awful to be believed. But after demanding to be considered for a management condition and given the job of firing Stavi the cleaner, Johnny Knoxville's nice guy character decides to hire him as a gardener, only for him to chop his fingers off. Needing several thousand dollars to pay his hospital bills, he takes the advice of his twisted uncle, played superbly by Brian Cox, to fake disability and rig the special Olympics.<br/><br/>To those who doubt the quality of the film, I say trust the highest raters, this is a very funny film! Don't get me wrong film fans, if you want to see a classic comedy try Duck Soup and Annie Hall, but this is really funny and not only that but the film does have it's heart firmly in the right place.<br/><br/>Like Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey this is one of the best underrated comedies and a true hidden gem."
"sheiss321","10","84","145","25 December 2005"," Worth it, but not for laughs
","You walk into the theater thinking you will laugh your butt off, but I came out judging my own moral values strongly(whether the director planned for that or not). The characters in the movie are stressed to breaking points over character strength and ethical moral values. It teaches(and shows) a side we rarely see in today's rude and unethical world(take the plot of this movie for example). I walked out and thought: Are mentally disabled any different than the rest of us? Since everyone is different, how can we call a select few...special? My friend walked out of the movie saying: One of the best comedies I've ever seen. Now, me, I'm trying to pretend I liked it for laughs, but I didn't. I sit here typing away my thoughts this movie made me think. I sit here thinking of the people I've hurt, the friends I've lost, and realize that there are just not enough good people in the world. This movie, whether you think it or not, has given me a whole new outlooks towards the disabled, a new outlook on virtues and a new outlook on my own character. I am very amazed of how I walked out of the theater and frankly I'm proud of myself. I hope that this movie helps you reflect yourself."
"asam3122","10","36","59","24 December 2005"," ""When did we get ice cream?""
","""The Ringer"" is the story of Steve Barker, who, one day, is sent to fire his friend, the janitor, Stavi. When Stavi explains that he has five kids and that his wife died, Steve decides not to fire him, and to give him a job at his apartment complex mowing the lawn. When the mower malfunctions, Stavi loses some fingers. The surgery to give him his fingers back costs 28,000 dollars. Steve doesn't have that kind of money, and there's no way he can get it on time.<br/><br/>Then, we meet Uncle Gary, an insensitive jerk who is down 40,000 dollars. He, like Steve, doesn't have any money. When he hears his loan shark talk about an inspirational handicapped man named Jimmy Washington, Uncle Gary thinks he can get his ex-high school drama nephew (Steve) to act mentally handicapped for the Special Olympics, which are coming to town.<br/><br/>While at the Special Olympics under the false name Jeffy Dahmor, Steve meets Lynn. Lynn is a sweet lady, who is helping out with the mentally handicapped individuals.<br/><br/>Despite a few opening incidents with the other handicapped people, they discover Steve is a fake. But they refuse to turn him in because they want someone to beat Jimmy Washington, who turns out to be a jerk.<br/><br/>My review reflects, in my opinion, one of the funniest lines in the movie. Steve and the others find Lynn's boyfriend at a movie theater with another girl. When he is found by Lynn with the others, he explains that he took them to the mall and then out for ice cream.<br/><br/>""When did we get ice cream?!"" Rated PG-13 for Language, Crude Humor, Drug References, and Sexual Humor, ""The Ringer"" gets a 10/10 in my book. It's got a good message in it. You just have to look."
"mayofam-1","10","3","3","3 June 2006"," This Movie Is Terrific Fun With a Great Heart
","As the mom of a real Special Olympian, it is great to see S.O. treated as an integral part of a big picture like this. I am sorry other people did not enjoy it as much as I did. Having a special child is something most people think is a tragedy; we parents of Special Olympians know that in many ways it is a great gift. It does make many people uncomfortable as a topic, but this film handles all these issues beautifully and was made with the support and guidance of Special Olympics with real mentally challenged athletes in pivotal roles. NOT a ""heavy"" message film at all, just a comedy for everyone who loves to laugh, regardless of their abilities. Give it a chance and you will love it! A+"
"barbers00","10","50","100","13 April 2005"," Special Olympics movie that is the ""Feel good movie"" of the year.
","Special Olympics is such a magnificent organization. The work they do for the mentally challenged is far more than I can begin to tell. No one can doubt the works they do, but many who have not worked with these people do not understand how wonderful the athletes are.<br/><br/>I saw this movie at a premier viewing in Texas in the fall, and honestly wondered how such a movie would be possible without putting the athletes back in the shadows that they have tried for so many years to come out of. Since seeing the movie and meeting the athletes, I have been waiting with ""Baited breath"" for it to release so I can take my students to see it. It does so much to help others see the real persons behind the Special Olympics logo. <br/><br/>I loved it and am hoping to bring everybody I know to watch it also. It shows the athletes just as they really are, fun-loving young adults who can get into trouble, get out of trouble, play with each other, and play against each other. It shows the athletes in competition and in relaxation, just being people, and it is delightful."
"inthecompanyofAandR","8","8","12","30 December 2005"," A Well Directed Movie That Is Also Disarmingly Sweet
","This is the best movie from the Farrelly brothers in quite some time. Movie has plenty of heart. Tough subject that many could beef about is well handled by director Blaustein and a cast that moves right along. Favorite is Geoffrey Arend who delivers the funniest line in the movie about ice cream. Arend is a deft and supple actor who is classically trained including The Royal Shakespeare in London who is used for some reason here just in the picture almost all through the movie. But he is electric funny with a screen presence that demands attention. You cannot take your eyes off him as he performs which usually is a problem if the producers or somebody else is pushing another star.<br/><br/>I recall his lines at the beginning of Super Trouper the cop movie ""I'm freaking' out"" as being the highlight of that film too.<br/><br/>Geoffrey Arend should get a vehicle of his own. Good ensemble work here. Knoxville who is not a favorite is even palatable too."

","Johnny Knoxville and Brian Cox are spectacular! Hilarious while being entirely calming and at the same time quite awkward. I've known a lot of unique beings and been through a lot so I have a lot of sympathy for people that are different. Also this is my 480th review which I am very proud of, my passion is films and to be famous so maybe someone important could see my opinions.

The idea is that he'll pretend to be mentally handicapped so money can be won to help a friend with no insurance and his dad who's in debt to the mob.<br/><br/>Clever offbeat the film just sort of misses despite being funny and touching. What can I say Johnny Knoxville has made a film that would seem to be his typical offensive material however it's so much better than you think it is.

"jotix100","7","2","2","29 May 2008"," A day at the races
","We watched this film with trepidation. The Farrelly brothers don't actually believe in subtlety. ""The Ringer"" has a cast of mentally challenged players; frankly one feared the worst. Well, as it turned out, this is not your typical movie by the masters of grossness. The direction was entrusted to Barry Blaustein and the writing to Ricky Blitt. While there is some grossness, as was perhaps expected, the makers are actually quite respectful of the people involved in the Special Olympics.<br/><br/>Don't get confused, this is a formula movie, or at least this is what the finished product feels like. The idea of Johnny Knoxville passing as one of the handicapped youths, sounded preposterous. Yet, Mr. Knoxville's performance is one of the reasons for watching it. The great Brian Cox is a hilarious presence as the uncle from hell. Lovely Katherine Heigl adds charm to the proceedings.<br/><br/>This is a fun film because it celebrates people that are less fortunate than the rest of us. They are all portrayed in a dignified manner."

I'll simplify the basic plot: a man needs to make some money and so joins the special Olympics and eventually tries to go out with one of the trainers.<br/><br/>This movie was funny, and its morality is good. It doesn't mock the mentally delayed for very long. It only does so for the first fifteen minutes or so they are introduced, then shows them as people, which is very good.<br/><br/>I didn't give this movie a ten because it wasn't extremely entertaining (I'd still recommend renting it, though). Also there wasn't a lot of depth in the characters. They were pretty basic. You'll still have a good time watching it, though."

","I bought it on box office in the face of stiff competition- Date Movie no less - and expected a poor taste, cheap comedy, right up my street. My partner however, was a little concerned about this prognosis. As a former carer to young disabled people she can be more sensitive about it than I. As I hoped, the film scored full marks for funnies. But not in the form of cheap jibes at disabled people. There was some clever writing (not genius but sharp), Johnny Knoxville had some cracking lines, the accusation directed at the leading ladies boyfriend of 'he poked me in the chest and called me stupid'(sic) was a cracker. Don't watch it if you're a bleeding heart liberal who can see the wrong in everything. If that's you you'll miss the stunning performance put on by all the competitors of the Special Olympics. Don't anyone say this film is in poor taste. If you say that you're belittling the efforts, and successes, of all the cast, in what's a dicey subject. Watch it. Don't expect 'The Godfather' or 'High Fidelity' with regards depth, nor 'Dumb & Dumber' for cult status, just a nice film you can watch with your girlfriend. There's something for everyone."
"chirdon","9","2","2","5 October 2006"," Surprisingly Excellent - Surpassed Expectations
","I heard of this movie when it first came out. I figured on seeing a jackass-ian treatment of the mentally challenged and avoided it like the plague - I shouldn't have.<br/><br/>After reliable friends assured me that THEY TOO expected nothing from this film, but were pleasantly surprised when it was a gem, I nabbed it from the local library.<br/><br/>The comedy is where it should be - Knoxville's's character is the reluctant participant in his situation. His special olympian cohorts are outstanding. Sure, these are all high-functioning individuals, but they are only very mildly characiturized -and- are in ways that unfold neatly capable of much more than ""Jeffy"" (Knoxville's character) gives them credit for.<br/><br/>Thus, this flick is a comedic treatment that at no point belittles or unfairly mocks the challenged, adds in a cute love story (it's no Moonstruck, but hey), that carries a message -lightly-; the 'message' one might come away with would be personal, and not everyone would take away the same one. (The one I got was not a cheezey ""be nice to the mentally challenged"") Grab it on DVD; it's a worthwhile watch that will give some perspective."
"Ivykins","8","2","2","13 June 2006"," actually a really sweet movie!
","My business partner's 13-year-old son kept telling me to watch this movie, so I didn't really expect much out of it. Was I surprised! Not knowing much about it, I initially groaned when I discovered it was about the Special Olympics. I was waiting to be utterly horrified, but realized fairly quickly that it was taking a completely different turn that I had expected. Johnny Knoxville actually comes across as a decent human being with real emotions and compassion for people who are ""different."" Not only is he NOT making fun of developmentally disabled people, he actually makes fun of those who do taunt them! Many of the actors are developmentally disabled in real life, making it an even better movie. The Special Olympics Committee approved everything in the film, so you know they're not upset about it. I highly recommend this movie to anyone, but especially younger people who have prejudices!"
"jcwash22","8","2","2","16 May 2006"," This was a decent movie...
","But, nothing to pee your pants over. This movie had a fair mount of funny parts, but it wasn't like it had me rolling on the floor the entire time. The only time I had seen Knoxville ""act"" was on the hit show/movie Jackass... so I came into the theater expecting nothing more than a mediocre comedy based on the Special Olympics. And to be perfectly honest that's what I got. I think that Johnny Knoxville is actually a pretty good actor, something that I did not expect to see. I thought that the movie was going to be disgusting and crude, but surprised to see something pretty family-oriented. For the record, this should have gotten a PG. This was a good movie, to sum up. To go into further discussion, which you may pass on as it is irrelevant to the overall review of the movie. My favorite character is Glen/n and I think that Knoxville did a great job.<br/><br/>So, should I see it? Yes, and I think it's okay to take the kids."
"punkrock-6","7","2","2","15 January 2006"," A very solid movie
","This in my opinion may be Johnny Knoxville's finest acted movie. He acts his role as Steve barker very well, and the leading actress Katherine Heigl who plays Lynn Sheridan is very solid as well. This movie is funny without being offensive, and it makes a good point. The only negative thing i have to say about the movie is when Knoxville's character reveals he's been pretending to be mentally challenged and Lynn gets up and slaps him. I did not like towards the end how easily Lynn forgave Steve barker. It seemed a little too easy to me for her to forgive him, but other than that it is a very solid movie and i would highly recommend seeing it."

","This movie was hilarious! There were many extremely funny lines, and the overall story is very inspirational. The movie makes you care for the specially challenged, and practically makes you wet yourself at the same time. This film is full of humor aimed at Johnny Knoxville, as well as some of the participants. I highly recommend you see this movie, if you can get past the whole rigging the Special Olympics thing! I believe it is fine to show this movie to the specially challenged, as most comments are aimed at Johnny Knoxville, and not at the real specially challenged participants. This is film has a great combination of comedy and a love story, and the blending of the two genres works magnificently. If you liked Forest Gump, this movie is definitely for you."

","This is one of the funniest movies that I have ever seen. Johnny Knoxville did an amazing job and was the least offensive person in this movie despite the fact that he was imitating someone mentally challenged. There were clever lines that were written and delivered by all the cast members and some of the scenes just absolutely blew me away. Aside from the occasional disturbing and overly offensive comments from ""UNCLE GARY"" this movie had me laughing from beginning to end. I know that it was a south park ""rip-off"" but this was a much classier movie and showed both the ups and downs of the special Olympics and the people competing in it. Great cast, Great jokes, great movie. Would recommend this movie to anybody over 14 and not offended by the term retard"

John Knoxville was likable and, although I expected more antics (and foul humor, which there was none) appeared clumsy like his character.<br/><br/>this is not a grab you by the face movie, the actors are not strung out on Hollywood puppet strings. It felt more natural, more at ease.<br/><br/>Nothing was overdone in this movie, and I am glad for it. Like another comment I read, I wanted Jimmy to be exposed as a fraud, and thought it very likely. And ""Jeffy"" would come out the exposer of fraud, and not get in trouble. I'm actually glad that did not happen. That's too Hollywood. The actual ending was much better. A community of people.<br/><br/>Don't go if you are only entertained by Hollywood glitz and glamour...and overdone special effects.<br/><br/>Do not NOT see it if you expect the movie to be offensive or to have foul humor.<br/><br/>There are good messages in the movie.

","""Son, there are two types of people in this world - those who think quotes like 'I can count to potato' are funny, and those who don't."" OK, so maybe those weren't the exact words of wisdom my grandfather once shared with me, but the meaning is the same. Some people just don't laugh at stupidity, and if you fall in this group then ""The Ringer"" probably isn't your wisest choice of investment this Christmas season.<br/><br/>That's not to say that ""The Ringer"" is nothing more than a stupid comedy. There are a handful of genuine laugh-out-loud moments, and surprisingly, there's a whole lot of sentiment. Unfortunately, and I hate to say this, but that's ultimately what drags it down.<br/><br/>Think about it. Johnny Knoxville rigs the Special Olympics in order to make some money. The Farrelly Brothers are producers. The screenplay is written by Ricky Blitt, one of the writers on ""Family Guy."" Should be knock-down, drag-out, envelope-pushing political incorrectness that dares to offend anybody who is brave enough to buy a ticket and watch it, right? Wrong. In fact, the movie goes out of its way to make sure the audience knows Johnny Knoxville is a good guy.<br/><br/>You see, he needs the money to help a guy have surgery who he couldn't bear to fire at work in the first place. And of course, he's reluctant to go along with his uncle's plan. And you know he's going to become best friends with all of the other Special Olympians. Knoxville spends so much of his time performing knightly actions that the movie essentially becomes a 90-minute infomercial for the real Special Olympics.<br/><br/>That is certainly something I don't want to knock because it does make the film likable. Many moviegoers will have their hearts warmed over the relationships Knoxville develops with the Special Olympians (even though the majority are portrayed by real actors with no real disabilities). Knoxville's soft heart leads to something that I thought was kind of weird - the movie is designed for you to actually root for him to win, despite the fact that he's a fraud.<br/><br/>The reason is reigning champion, Jimmy, is a jerk who you'll feel no sympathy for. Like my grandfather used to say, ""Just because you're handicapped doesn't give you the right to be a jerk."" He offered this nugget of wisdom once when a guy in a handicap parking spot flipped us off because we were walking too slowly behind his car.<br/><br/>So as an after school special this works well. But as a comedy? Well, it just wasn't as funny as I wanted it to be. Oh, I laughed, and I smiled, and I drooled over Katherine Heigl, but I never had to catch my breath or tend to a busted gut, nor did I ever miss dialogue because of overwhelming audience laughter.<br/><br/>So is it worth your hard-earned money? I honestly can't see a necessity to pay to see it on the big screen. Besides, it won't make a ton of money at the box office, so it'll be on DVD soon. Wait and make it a rental. It's not the comedy it should have been, but it has good intentions. And like granddad always said, ""You can't always be the best at everything you do, but you can always be likable. It's not as easy for people to be hard on you when they see that your heart's in the right place."""
"maggot_brain","6","8","19","28 April 2006"," Predictable
","Other reviews here have been praising this movie but it's average score of 5.4 is more indicative of its quality, as a very predictable comedy that turns sentimental towards the end.<br/><br/>All the ingredients are here: the far-fetched plot device needed to set up the scenario (which in this case is particularly stupid), the love interest, the evil love interest's boyfriend, the funny and/or weird sidekicks (in this case a group of mentally retarded people) and the sentimental ending.<br/><br/>Frankly, this movie does nothing new and most of the time it's not funny. Most of the laughs my friends got from this movie was one of them laughing inappropriately at the mentally retarded people. However, a lot of the time the laughs were intended and I find this to be a bit worrying. To its credit, despite some tasteless laughs the movie does do a fairly good job of treading a line between being too tame and too offensive, but still doesn't manage to be quite funny enough. Its message was predictable and poorly done. The ending was too felt like a quick-fix solution and feels tacked-on.<br/><br/>Overall, I find this to be a fairly entertaining movie with some good laughs, but they are rather sporadic, and the movie itself in terms of its plot is very predictable and not very memorable. Judging from other reviews, people have found a great message in this movie, but I am not among them unfortunately so I find it difficult to recommend this movie as much more than a by-the-numbers comedy."

","I may be one of the most critical movie critics on the internet. I can find fault with almost any movie. Between going to the movies, watching them on the Dish, and getting deluged with movies from Netflix, I was fast getting tired of the same violent, mindless, terrorist plots, Las Vegas robberies, meet the parents nonsense, boring boy meets boring girl fluff, and kissing cowboys movies. So when I saw the trailer for The Ringer, I thought, ""This one looks different and original"". And BOY was I correct. The Ringer may be one of the best and funniest movies nobody ever heard of. It's a shame that some people and advertisers probably shied away from it because it sounded too controversial and politically incorrect, but it wasn't at all. Not only was the movie funny, but the acting was terrific. Some of the lines were very clever and knocked me off my feet. <br/><br/>I had never heard of Johnny Knoxville. I thought he was some kind of country western singer. Never saw Jackasss and have no desire to. But Johnny was superb as ""Jeffy. So much so that I no longer do ""Rainman"" impersonations. Now I go around doing a ""Jeffy"" routine. Kathrine Heigl was excellent as Jeffy's love interest. She was perky and sexy and I was rooting for her and Jeffy to fall in love. Brian Cox as Jeffy's uncle was very realistic as a con man/loser who manipulated his nephew ""Steve"", into trying to fix the Special Olympics. What a novel idea, and the director and cast pulled it off perfectly. Nobody can get offended by this movie since the Special kids were so lovable and showed how much they CAN do instead of what they CAN'T do. So go see this heartwarming little film at least once. It will be a Special treat for you."

","As a comedy movie, 'The Ringer' is fairly average. It has a few good laughs, some funny characters and an entertaining plot, but nothing that hasn't already been done before. It's the sort of film you stick on when you need to pass a couple of hours, a film that you can follow without paying any real attention.<br/><br/>'The Ringer' won't be for everyone though, Johnny Knoxville's acting as a handicapped person does come across a bit awkward at times, though I guess such a role can't be easy to play. Overall, this is a decent comedy with some likable characters. An easy-to-follow, entertaining story with a few decent laughs."
"nmholland","5","1","1","8 May 2016"," Contained Some Good Laughs, But Was Pretty Bad Overall
","The Ringer is directed by Barry W. Blaustein and is the story of a man named Stevie who, when his friend Stavvi loses some fingers, is pressured by his gambling uncle to enter the Special Olympics as a mentally slow man in order to earn a lot of money. After wrongly entering the Special Olympics, Stevie poses as a man named Jeffie, and runs across multiple conflicts throughout his time at the event. That's pretty much the entire movie.<br/><br/>I was actually expecting a complete pile of trash prior to watching The Ringer, but it wasn't completely awful. It had some good comedy throughout parts, and most of the acting was decent. Although The Ringer had some poor direction and a lazy script, it wasn't fully horrible. It had some good aspects.<br/><br/>The best thing for The Ringer was the acting. Johnny Knoxville was pretty good, as both of his characters. He technically was acting as a guy who was acting as another guy, which is somewhat confusing, but he played both Stevie and Jeffie pretty well. Brian Cox, who played Stevie's uncle, was the highlight of this movie for me, due to his good acting. He played a gambling man who was in deep with the wrong people, so he bet on Stevie winning the Special Olympics, and did it well. All of the other acting was fine. Nobody else did great, but there wasn't any bad acting either.<br/><br/>Some of the comedy was pulled off decently well. Although the film was making fun of mentally challenged people, it was supported by the actual Special Olympics, so I guess nobody can really defend them. A few lines that were written for laughs didn't receive any, and some of the jokes were pretty stale. However, a few lines did have me laughing, and laughing hard. Not all of the comedy is bad, just some of it.<br/><br/>The worst thing I found in The Ringer was the direction. It wasn't completely awful, but it was horribly bland and boring. Most of the time, I felt as if I were watching a cheap Lifetime movie, and I shouldn't have felt that way. Most of the shots were very boring, and the direction didn't do anything good for the film at all.<br/><br/>The script was also quite lazy. For example, a specific person's opinion on a subject will change from scene to scene, even though the subject may be a bit touchy. The script quickly brushed over these types of scenarios, and it felt very lazy and rushed. Most of the dialogue was somewhat clichÃƒÂ©, and a lot of it was surprisingly flat. Not many lines had me asking questions, or even wanting to see more of the film. That's not a good thing.<br/><br/>Overall, The Ringer wasn't awful, but it most definitely wasn't good. Although it did contain some good acting and some funny comedy, those couldn't save The Ringer from a bad script and poor direction."

","Can I have a hug, one of the best lines from the movie. What is meant to be a simple gesture backed by a not so simple motive. This also displays the well thought out script in and behind the acting of the movie. I really think that script was written excellently in every little detail about it from Stavi to Uncle Gary, to Thomas and Glen, every actor perfectly played out and the interaction of the cast as a whole really amplifies the movie. The plot however unrealistic it might be is a great story line that can be spun in any direction and you never know where the movie is going to go, just when you think Steve is going to get caught he doesn't, and instead of turning him in the athletes help him. The special effects and background music, as minute as they are really add pizazz. The music that plays in the background fits extremely well with the scenarios they actors find themselves in. It's hard to say that a movie about rigging the Special Olympics is actually a great movie and has a good message behind it but it does. The ringer is a great movie that shows what true friends are for, and how when a group of people pulls together any and everything can be accomplished. Through many funny jokes and one-liners the audience is always engaged and there's never a dull moment when watching."

"BrandtSponseller","7","1","1","13 July 2006"," Understanding the Farrelly Brothers
","The most important thing to remember about The Ringer is that it's a Farrelly Brothers production, after they've done films like Stuck on You (2003) and Fever Pitch (2005). Largely because of films like Dumb & Dumber (1994) and There's Something About Mary (1998), which were fairly outrageous comedies for mainstream films in the mid-1990s, the Farrelly Brothers developed a reputation for daring films where the jokes kept arriving one after the other. Because of that, some people have been disappointed with their more recent films, which are just as concerned with being sweet and romantic as they are with being funny. But the truth is that their films have always been sweet, romantic comedies. They've just mellowed a bit over the years. They're not quite as frantic as they used to be, the jokes are not non-stop (or meant to be), we've gotten more used to their sensibility, and others have focused on making comedies even more outrageous.<br/><br/>Even thought the Farrelly Brothers didn't write or direct The Ringer, their stamp is all over the film, and it should be thought of as much or more as a Farrelly Brothers film than a Johnny Knoxville vehicle, and certainly it seems more like a Farrelly Brothers film than a Barry W. Blaustein film. This is only Blaustein's second turn in the director's chair, and with his first film a wrestling documentary from 1999, Blaustein is more well known at this point as a writer of several Eddie Murphy films. The Ringer scripter Ricky Blitt has mostly worked in television, on shows such as ""Family Guy"" and ""The Jeff Foxworthy Show"".<br/><br/>Like most of the Farrelly Brothers' films, The Ringer focuses on people who are outcasts for some reason--people who don't fit into social norms. But despite misconceptions to the contrary (and other filmmakers actually doing this), the Farrelly Brothers have never really ridiculed those people. Their concern is instead to show how people and things that are different are valuable in ways that mainstream society might not expect; to show how people who are different have universal human characteristics, but at the same time, not to underplay their differences. They sincerely love their characters. So expecting The Ringer to approach its subject matter in a way that would make fun of it or ridicule it would be off-base--not because they're being politically correct, but because it's not consistent with the Farrelly Brothers' world-view (and thus to take The Ringer as offensive is particularly bizarre). Maybe that's why, over the years, they've shifted slightly away from outrageous comedy as a focus--they may have felt that that genre contributed to audiences misreading them. So you shouldn't expect The Ringer to be primarily concerned with getting big laughs, either. It's more just quirky.<br/><br/>Of course Knoxville gets to do some of the physical stunts that made him famous, and The Ringer is funny at times, but the humor arrives more strongly in the second half, and rather than laughing at the Special Olympics, with the audience members belonging to the mainstream, the humor here obtains by inducting you (just like Knoxville) into the Special Olympics fold so that you can laugh at the mainstream (and maybe that's more what people are finding offensive--not everyone embraces the different like the Farrelly Brothers do). At the same time, The Ringer develops a romance subplot that shouldn't be unexpected.<br/><br/>However, that Knoxville does a bit of his usual shtick may be one of the small flaws here. More than likely he took this role in an attempt to stretch his range a bit, which he does well, but the Jackass-styled stunts, as entertaining and funny as they are at times, probably contribute to some viewers misreading the film and taking it for a failure because it's not making them laugh enough, or it isn't outrageous enough. Another slight flaw might be that the first half lingers a bit too long--The Ringer comes to a boil very slowly, but it's an enjoyable film if you take it for what it is rather than trying to force it into a narrow genre compartment."

","I can only highly recommend this film. I first heard about it last year because one of our friends is in the movie. The only thing I didn't like was one word that I thought was totally inappropriate. My family watched the movie and we were so pleased to see people with developmental delays in major parts. The movie was funny and heartwarming. It was great to see the Kids of Widney High doing their thing too. My favorite line was when Steve tells his uncle not to talk about his friends that way, (calling them names). Edward Barbanell was exceptionally wonderful in his role. I also really enjoyed Bill Chotts interpretation of his character. Jed Rees was good, but his rendering seemed more of a caricature than a character. I hope lots of people will see this great movie and understand that people with developmental delays are real people too. They have feelings and emotions and make wonderful actors!"

Elizabeth Stuart Phelps <br/><br/>The Ringer is worth seeing just to figure out how a comedy centered on The Special Olympics could even be made, much less supported by the organization. I was pleasantly surprisedÂ—there are some laughs and muchrespect where condescension could have been the comic device.<br/><br/>Johnny Knoxville's Steve is in a nowhere job, when he gets into a situation that demands a considerable sum of money. His shady uncle Brian Cox devises a plan to have Steve enter the Olympics as a special needs person in order to throw over the reigning champ and thereby cause considerable gambling winnings. The situation requires Knoxville's Steve to become ""Jeffy"" and walk carefully between humor and extreme political incorrectness. He succeeds by underplaying gags and lightly sprinkling the sweetness.<br/><br/>Of course, there's Steve's love interest, Lynn (Katherine Heigl), with whom the scenes sometimes stretch too long. But the moments with his handicapped buddies are alive with warmth, self effacement, and wisdom enhanced by the problematic notion that special people shouldn't be smart but are. Herein lies the essential irony of the premise: The humor is too often grounded on our preconceived notion that disabled people can barely utter a sentence. Does the humor of their actually uttering bright thoughts come from that prejudice? In order to accept the premise that special people can be funny because of their disabilities, I had to suspend an automatic reaction against the inherent incorrectness.<br/><br/>A moment showing how truly inspired this comedy could have been occurs when Steve trains to become ""Jeffy."" He's watching videos that include Rain Man, I am Sam, and The Best of Chevy Chase. The last video raises the immortal observation that the inmates are sometimes saner than their captors."

But it's all over the place. Up and down. Not quite uneven, but not quite con-jointed either. I'm not going over the story again, many others have already done that, but the gist of it is that an office worker gets talked into entering the special Olympics to pay off debts associated with him, and one incurred by a gambling family member.<br/><br/>I guess if you're going to do a film with a theme of a healthy person trying to win a Special Olympics you only have two choices: raunchy, side splitting comedy or all heart.

"soriano329","6","6","16","23 December 2006"," The Most Politically Incorrect Movie of Our Time
","There are some things you need to know when watching ""The Ringer."" First off, it is the most politically incorrect movie you'll ever see. The movie makes fun of the mentally challenged and the Special Olympics as a whole. But it also is very sensitive to certain aspects, and doesn't cross the line from good fun into absolute evil; although it gets very close. Another thing, don't go into this movie expecting The Godfather, because you'll only be disappointed. And if you're a die hard South Park fan, you probably know what's coming. But on with the review.<br/><br/>Johnny Knoxville, known primarily for his role in the teenage cult classic Jackass movies, plays Steve Barker, a debt ridden worker in desperate need of some cash. His insolvent uncle (Brian Cox) is also in need of quick money, so he comes up with the ""brilliant"" idea of entering Steve in the Special Olympics. Steve hopes to defeat the six time champ Jimmy, in order to pay off his debts. It's an easy win, right? But he finds the road to success a little harder than he expected, and also finds love along the way.<br/><br/>This movie is so wrong I'm surprised it was made. What surprised me even more was that the Special Olympics gave their blessings to the makers of this film. But this movie was full of surprises. It shone a light on the Special Olympics, and shows you how hard these athletes work, and the obstacles they overcome. It does more good than bad for the Special Olympics, and from the look of the trailer, that's all you can ask from this movie.<br/><br/>Well, what did you expect going into this movie, Citizen Kane? The movie isn't very well written, it isn't well directed, and the acting isn't particularly good. But what the hell, it's a Johnny Knoxville movie. Just sit back and enjoy it, you're guaranteed to laugh a bit. I was taken aback at how funny a movie can be when you're not worried about society."

","Wow! I was actually struck dumb at several points throughout this film, so bewildered was I that something this awful could even get made, let alone distributed. By far the worst movie I have seen since Little Nicky. Filled with horribly uncomfortable, wildly implausible moments, completely lacking in any character worth rooting for, and with a plot whose sole purpose seemed to be to set up the longest one-joke movie since the dark days of the Saturday Night Live ""one sort-of funny 3 minute sketch will make a great 90 minute movie!"" era. Every person involved in the making, marketing, and distribution of this film should be ashamed of themselves."
"bernie-122","1","5","14","10 May 2006"," shamefully awful
","First of all, I do not want to take anything away from handicapped people; they have my full support. This piece of garbage movie doesn't. It's not even funny, as was the South Park episode the plot was ripped from. It is shallow, clichÃ©, predictable and full of tiresome performances. I'm just amazed that so many reviewers here raved about it.<br/><br/>There are so many ways this topic could have been given the treatment it deserves, but the makers obviously took the ""safe"" way out: make a bowl of mush that would attract enough non-thinking, clichÃ©-loving fans to make it a hit at the box office. After that, who cares? How bad is it? Well, I sat down and got through half of it before I was seething so much I had to turn it off. I wasn't going to bother with the rest, but in fairness I couldn't write this without having seen the whole thing, so I forced myself to sit through the rest. Wouldn't have made any difference.<br/><br/>All in all, I think this movie is an affront to ""mentally challenged"" people, and history and hindsight will serve to ultimately embarrass the people behind this turkey. It's sad to see that even those who should know better were taken in by it, e.g. the first reviewer.<br/><br/>I'm not going to spoil anything by giving away any plot details, but I will say to anybody who hasn't seen this piece of trash yet: don't waste your time and money."

Then there were a few regular actors pretending to be special needs and going overboard with acting retarded, it down right made me uncomfortable.<br/><br/>How in the world did the director think anyone would find scenes with special needs being made fun of humorous? I guess the costume people thought the only way to make a regular person look like they are special needs to make them wear a pair of glasses that will magnify their eyes.

The movie makers want the viewers to laugh when they see a retarded person slap himself in the chest or say something stupid or do something stupid, and that is wrong on so man different levels. I am not a ""worried mother"". I am a 16 year old boy, who this movie is targeted to and even I can see how mean spirited it is. The makers think they can make jokes about retarded people, claim it was in good fun and think they can get away with it. Wrong. But, even once you look beyond this despicable aspect, the movie still isn't funny. There are a few small good jokes they make, but that is the extent to which this movie has any enjoyable aspects. Avoid at all costs."

If they had guts, the film makers would have put a mentally disabled Jewish homosexual in the movie and ridiculed him mercilessly.<br/><br/>Instead the movie is full of lame jokes that don't offend anyone. They then try to make up for the lack of humor by portraying the mentally disabled ""positively"". Their positive message seems to be that the mentally disabled don't have any real disability -- that they are just normal people with a few quirky mannerisms, like foreigners who talk with a funny accent.<br/><br/>A worthwhile film would have shown them as they are, disability and all, and found what positive message it could in the truth.

","Rating-6/10<br/><br/>The Ringer is a comedy movie about a guy who wants to rig the Special Olympics to pay for his gardeners needed surgery, yes it is pretty crazy. Starring Johnny Knoxville, Katherine Heigl and a huge cast behind them, this movie is positively brimming with life, and the occasional laugh from them. You may think a movie about a man pretending to have learning difficulties is offensive and that casting people with similar conditions is too, but the true warm feel of this movie makes them not a thing to laugh at, they are good actors and can make some good jokes of their own. <br/><br/>The story is pretty basic there's no doubt but it is still unique and with the kind of comedy that can at times be silly, mixed with genuine emotion too, this is one movie that can have you laughing on moments and stirring your heart the next. That said this film is far from perfect, some jokes aren't too great and with a film that as said is kind of silly, you get some hit and miss moments but all in all it is OK for me.<br/><br/>Knoxville plays Steve(or Jeffy as he becomes known when pretending), and he acts it out well enough, not great all the way through but a good choice nevertheless. Katherine Heigl you may feel wastes her talent with a comedy like this but it's far from it, she is probably the most serious character but for me she is finest when being kind, it makes Heigl come off very well as an actor. The film uses a lot of people with learning disabilities, and they are great and as I said, they bring warmth to this and they are not to laugh at, you laugh with them.<br/><br/>Director Barry Blaustein I felt does this very well, he works with the comedy duo the Farrelly Brothers who produced this and together they just seem to make this work, whether it's the story or the humour I'll never know. This movies writing isn't exactly spot on, Blaustein seems to direct the bad parts of the script well enough not to be a disaster but then again the script isn't all bad, just not great. <br/><br/>Overall this movie really isn't for everybody, I expect mixed reviews and also mixed reactions as this could stir up an argument or two. In the end it is a sweet movie I felt and one that although I wouldn't be bursting to see again, is still worth another watch and for me that is all that counts. Oh and one more thing to mention, if you like the Farrelly brothers style of comedy seen in such films as ""There's Something about Mary"" and ""Dumb and Dumber"" among many others, then you should love this as this is just like the brand of comedy they represent."

THE RINGER is often laugh-out-loud hilarious (as when Knoxville discovers that his undercover name will henceforth be ""Jeffy Dahmer""), but it's also a nice little love story and- most important of all- a reaffirmation of the Human Spirit. I LOVE the fact that the guys with whom ""Jeffy"" is rooming not only find him out (when he lets his guard down and ""acts different""), but also agree to help him perpetrate his fraud because they can't stand the star of the Special Olympics, Jimmy (who arrives in a limo with a gaggle of publicity people), who is favored to win again this year. On a personal note, I can sympathize with people who might be offended by some of the humor in THE RINGER, but it's actually relatively mild when compared to the kind of hurtful, humiliating humor that one encounters out in The Real World.

The movie takes a turn from the silly and stupid, to being a humorous but respectful treatment of the participants in the Special Olympics. The humor is not particularly heavy-handed, even if it isn't particularly intellectual, but the subject matter is very well handled, and the movie is uplifting, if a little predictable and maudlin. I'd still recommend it, if only for the joy of seeing the actors succeed in creating a movie that must have made participating in the Special Olympics seem a walk in the park.

","OK so Johnny Knoxville may not be the best of actors. What made this movie for me were the special actors. They were great. They new they were not being made fun of and were very funny. I am in a wheelchair and am especially sensitive to discrimination, being made fun of exploitation etc. This did not happen in this movie. What did take place was a chance for special people to laugh with them selves. The scene where Knoxville's character is outed by the rest of the group kind of drives home my point. If you were in any way offended by this movie you very much need to lighten up and you probably haven't laughed in 20 years, I feel sorry for you not the special actors. BTW the Special Olympics endorsed this movie. 8 fingers up ;)."

","Yes, this movie's plot is sadly predictable, and yes, it's too mushy in places, but I found it hilarious throughout. Like many people, I expected cruel humor, and was pleasantly surprised to find the opposite. A lot of people completely missed the parts of this movie that I found the funniest. One of these is Knoxville's acting as ""Jeffy."" It was funny not because it makes fun of people with handicaps, but because it is so far off the mark. I laughed as the volunteers where fooled by his act, because it was so unbelievable. As someone who regularly works with handicapped people, I guarantee that those volunteers would never have fallen for such a poor imitation. The other thing that's funny that many people miss, is that the movie plays off of the stereotypes of handicapped people, by making fun of the stereotypes, instead of the people. Many people where offended by these stereotypes, and others where disappointed that they weren't used to mock the people. The laughs are there, if you just know where to look."

I only heard of it from my brother, who has a generally low standard in movies anyways. So, since I had nothing else to do, I watched the movie with him.<br/><br/>It's not that this doesn't have any funny moments (because it actually does), but it doesn't have the classic humor like The Producers. The story is pretty simple, a guy needs to raise money for a friend by posing as a mentally challenged man in the Special Olympics. The acting varies at most parts. Johnny does only an okay job, while Cox is much better as a sleaze ball character. The real standouts in this are the people playing the retards, with Glen, Billy, and Thomas as my favorites.<br/><br/>The best thing about this movie is that it doesn't try to insult mentally challenged people. In a way, it gives us a reason why they should be more loved, since some can be funny and nice.<br/><br/>Overall, it's not great, but it is enjoyable if you can like the silly behavior of the retards."

","The Ringer seemed like a good idea when South Park did the episode about Cartman trying to rig the special Olympics. That was pretty funny, but that lacked the heart and respect for the actual athletes in the special Olympics. The Ringer does exactly what South Park left out. The Movie shows that the athletes in the special Olympics are actually good athletes and aren't any less of human beings. It teaches some good morals of how to respect our mentally challenged people in our society. It also brings some pretty decent Jackass style laughs with Johnny Knoxville. Knoxville does a good job as being an everyday, all around nice guy. He portrays Steve who then turns into mentally challenged Jeffy in order to help his uncle win a bet so that Steve can get money to help his friend get his fingers attached. I will say no more because the ending is really abrupt and I don't know if I have caused a spoiler yet. Over all the laughs were few, but the heart was there in this decent movie. It's a good movie to rent, don't spend a lot of money on it."

","Steve Barker works in a stable office job, though lacks a lot of confidence, wanting to boost his career. When his boss tells Steve to fire Stavi the janitor, he hasn't the heart; giving Stavi a job of moving his lawn. Stavi accidentally cuts his fingers off with the lawnmower, but doesn't have the health care cover to fit the bill, ending in Steve's head. His Uncle also in financial debt with betting, comes to the idea of Steve entering the Special Olmypics. Unwillingly Steve enters and the con is on.<br/><br/>When a film maker tries to tackle a touchy subject such as the Special Olympics, you can either call them brave or stupid. With the Farrelly brothers as producers, the mentality that you are in capable hands shows; as they have tackled touchy subject matter of late; conjoined twins and obesity. Screen Writer Ricky Blitt and Director Barry W. Blaustein tread the area lightly, keeping it safe and P.C. as possible; this is it's major flaw.<br/><br/>The dark humour in The Ringer is touched upon lightly, not sending out the punches it needed. The subversive humour needed to bring it head out more often, as The Ringer lacks a lot of jokes, constantly pulling the same strings; if your going to take this subject on, go for broke. Though Barry W. Blaustein has done a great job, at no point does this feel condescending. The Ringer draws out its message genuinely about the handicapped; 'normal' people placing them in a world of can't and not treating them as equals.<br/><br/>But the ultimate problem is that The Ringer is to predictable. Steve falling for Lynn, one of the volunteers. When Steve's cover is blow his room mates help him to win the competition. The Ringer drowns itself in to much sentimentality. The romance between Steve and Lynn is hammy and not really believable.<br/><br/>Use to acting in stupid manners in Jackass, Johnny Knoxville actual looks uncomfortable, bringing a bland performance. Brian Cox over blows as Uncle Gary. The real stars are the people playing the special performers. They comprise of people with actual disabilities and actors, and they just steal the show every moment they're on.<br/><br/>The Ringer could have been a lot more, but it was hard not to walk away with some guilty laughs."

He still does a good job as the main character Steve Barker. The rest of the cast were good as well especially the real handicapped people who were acting.<br/><br/>There are plenty of funny parts of course. Mainly making fun of the contestants in the Special Olympics although I wouldn't think it would offend anybody. <br/><br/>Overall The Ringer is a great feel good comedy that doesn't go out of it's way in making fun of handicapped people, but really shows that they are just the same as any other person."

"etsm92","Null","0","0","2 April 2006"," Funny film from the farrellys
","The Ringer/2005/***<br/><br/>Main Stars: Johnny Knoxville Brian Cox<br/><br/>Well this film was another enjoyable, successful ""Farrelly Brothers"" type film (like ""Stuck On You"", ""Fever Pitch"", ""Dumb and Dumber"" and others). You see, they didn't direct or write the film. They merely produced it but the film was definitely there type of one. You see, the Farrelly Brothers are known to have mentally challenged people in their films. And in this one they had quite a few because (of course) the storyline consists of a Special Olympics season and tournament at the end of the season. Steve Barker (Johnny Knoxville's character) competes in this as a ""fake"" mentally challenged person with the name of Jeffy Dahmor. His uncle, Gary (Brian Cox, who really wants Steve (as Jeffy) to win the Special Olympics tournament), named him that because Steve needed help so his uncle butts in to tell him to fix the Special Olympics and gives him a name upon the name of a past serial killer with the name of Jeffrey Dahmer. His uncle had to have gotten the idea from him. I mean what else would have convinced him. Basically Steve (as Jeffy Dahmor) is competing in this because he's a good athlete and wants money to help a guy named Stavi (Luis Avalos, who always refers to himself in the third person) get his fingers sewed back on. It might sound stupid but really it is quite funny with the mentally challenged people actually coming back with great comebacks to Steve (as Jeffy) and other people. But yet Steve has to face an impressively good disabled athlete named Jimmy (Leonard Flowers) and doesn't do so bad. But how hard can it be to keep the identity of a mentally challenged person? Not the easiest thing in the world. And that was another funny thing to watch in this film. Steve (as Jeffy) would change voices, would only tell a few people he wasn't disabled in a way, and would be recognized by an old high school friend that was normal and asked how he was doing. But the bad thing is, there was a Special Olympics supervisor with him (a girl Steve liked named Lynn (Katherine Heigl) and he had to act mental or else the supervisor would know he was a fraud. Hee hee. It truly is a funny film but with a heart like the Farrelly films are always like (except for the older ones like ""Kingpin"" which was waaaaay over the top). Movie directed by (not the Farrelly Brothers but) Barry W. Blaustein."

","I've just got in from watching The Ringer and I must say I was impressed beyond my original expectations by the character development. It would have been incredibly easy to make a ""lets all laugh at the handicapped"" film with cheap laughs and no message. The slapstick moments you'd expect from Knoxville were present and effective too.<br/><br/>The film did suffer from the odd bit of glurge and moral over-redemption but on the whole it worked quite well (bar some glaring continuity that even I spotted after a pint). I'd recommend it to most people, though I don't think it'd benefit from a second viewing. I don't know if it was predominantly a British thing however, but it did feel like a lot of people in the cinema were afraid to laugh initially due to the subject matter. The way the characters were developed did ease this a little as the film went on though."

The movie was quite clean considering what it could have been, so if you base movies off of that its pretty good. 2-3 times you'll definitely hear a swearword... overall there's probably a total of 8-10 (but minor ones that slip in without too much notice). There is also a good moral at the end of the movie and overall, throughout the movie... If you don't want to think then the moral is as follows: Teamwork/Cooperation as well as Tell the Truth... and of course my personal favorite: there is only black and white, there is no gray area.

","I must admit to being a little set off by the plot in the beginning. My mother has been working with people with mental disabilities for as long as I can remember, and I have built up a lot of respect for the challenges they face.

The cast was amazing, including Knoxville. I never expected a man like him would be able to pull off a character like this. The humor was also superb. Though you admittedly feel bad laughing at a few parts, the best laughs are at no one's expense. When I saw it last night, it seemed that the theater never fell silent. As soon as the noise started to die out from the last joke, a new one came right along and everyone was laughing again.<br/><br/>I strongly recommend seeing this movie. Bring a few friends along and you will have a GREAT time. Chances are I will only see this movie once in theaters (I still need to see Hostel!), but I will be anxiously waiting for the DVD release.

Those handicapped characters have great lines demonstrating there mental aptitude. They understand life and people and have witty comments to add some extra laughs. Those people involved in the movie did a great job creating scenes where you laugh with the mentally handicapped characters rather than laugh at them.

He's out to win the Special Olympics, although he's not ""Special"". His intent is good-natured (really-he's very likable and sincere) He learns about humanity and the capacity for love and friendship. The ""Special"" athletes catch on to his ""fake"" disability, and the athletes become empowered - above and beyond hold their own in this movie. You don't walk away feeling bad for the ""Special"" athletes, that they were taken advantage of or anything. This shines that they are just as witty, creative and resourceful as the next person.

Johnny Knoxville plays nice-guy Steve who is in a ba-a-a-d situation and is in need of cash. his uncle Gary gets a far-fetched idea of rigging the special olympics. although he is reluctant, Knoxville decides to take on the job, donning the persona of Jeffy Dohmer (pronounced da-mur).

Seeing Knoxville bonding with the mentally challenged was actually very nice at the end, because throughout the movie, he beings to respect them.

I'm guessing the writer started on the middle of the movie and when finished, decided to throw in a 5 min opening and closing. The movie was only 94 minutes, I think there could have been another 5-10 minutes dedicated to the ending at the very least.<br/><br/>And something I wasn't prepared for - Johnny Knoxville actually plays the (fairly) good guy trying to do the right thing, he just happens to be misled by his Uncle.<br/><br/>His acting ability was awesome, he played a ""special"" person extremely well. As did Geoffrey Arend who was in Super Troopers. And who knew Johnny Knoxville could play a guy with a conscience! Overall my expectations were low because I know who Johnny Knoxville is. But I was pleasantly surprised, great movie, highly recommended."

","I cannot believe that writers, producers, actors, directors, etc. could get together and decide to make this movie.

Are there no other topics out there that all of the talent in Hollywood could focus on besides this? WOW!<br/><br/>To treat mentally challenged people and the Special Olympics in this fashion is awful. I am not surprised that the lead actor was Mr. Knoxville.

","As my friend above said, The Ringer is not a great comedy but what it does do is make you question your outlook on people with impairments. The director didn't mean for this to happen, I honestly think that he thought he was making a great comedy, but what he has made is a social commentary that lacks any grace or real wit. If you come away from this movie with one thing it is not going to be laughter or happiness, well, it certainly wasn't for me.... I can only judge the film by the (lack of) laughter factor from the assembled audience, if one person laughed out loud the whole cinema was turning around to see who it was, which was funny in itself. The characters are dishevelled and poorly acted, the plot is meaningless and the dialogue is so poor that I was tempted to ask the sound guy to turn it down so that I could do my own lines over the top (although the cinema audience might not of found that very funny either!). All In all The Ringer should be going straight to DVD hell, it is not worthy of your ten bucks (or seven pounds) and neither is it worthy of your four bucks DVD rental charge. I can imagine the bargain bucket bins at Blockbuster being full of this film when it is sent to video and hopefully there it shall lay to rest for all of eternity!"

Between scenes of laughing at the mental incapacity that was portrayed by those attending the special Olympics I attempted to entertain myself by locking lips with my lady friend. She refused, backed me off and told me she was watching the movie, an unfortunate turn of events. I had no other choice but to continue watching this movie. The story did begin to lead to a moral.

And the cast of primarily non-challenged actors force-acting like ""tards"" is an insult, not to the handicapped, but to human beings in general. I was thinking that the reason for using unchallenged actors is probably... Nope... can't even think of one, except that perhaps any self-respecting person with ""a condition"" would find the outcome of the film too preposterous, too PAINFUL to handle.

","The Ringer (2005): Dir: Barry W. Blaustein / Cast: Johnny Knoxville, Brian Cox, Katherine Heigl, Jed Rees, Edward Barbanell: Stupid and drab would be the most appropriate words to describe this so-called comedy about wits. Johnny Knoxville is talked into rigging the Special Olympics. Not a bad start but screenplay veers into predictable formula until it arrives at a conclusion where one must wonder whether the six year champion should have remained as so. Directed by Barry W. Blaustein who previously made an excellent wrestling documentary called Beyond the Mat. As a followup, The Ringer just looks and feels cheap. Knoxville is hardly sympathetic and this role seems hardly a stretch for him. Does he right things and end up with the girl? Do pigs fly? Are we really suppose to care about this pathetic charade? Brian Cox could have used more scenes as the scheming uncle who talks Knoxville into this scam. Katherine Heigl is the desire of Knoxville's heart and she has my sympathy. She gets to be fooled by him while he sabotages her current bad relationship. No worries though. She gets mad then as predictable stories go, she hooks up with him. This film is a pathetic vile piece of trash. Rather than addressing mentally challenged individuals the film becomes more mentally challenging than anything they do in the Olympics. Score: 2 / 10"

I don't think this movie ever gets to be offensive, it's just not funny. Johnny Knoxville is no actor and Katherine Heigl is certainly not going to be remembered for her dramatic skills either. The plot is no shakespearean drama either. If you are looking to kill some time maybe this could be a good choice but it doesn't go beyond that. The jokes are rather repetitive and all circle around the same issue. And finally, if you have ever met a mentally challenged person and saw this movie you would get rather angry that they just portrayed them in such a simplistic manner."

","Pretty awful movie about a young man (Johnny Knoxville of ""Jackass"" ""fame"") who needs to make big cash to help a friend who lost his fingers in a lawn mowing accident.

Truthfully though, I was hoping it would be at least funny in the daring way a film like BORAT had been, and it's not very. Among the cast are some mentally challenged actors. Edward Barbanell, an actor with Down Syndrome, is quite good in his part. A couple of the other performers struck me as ordinary people pretending to be handicapped, but I could be mistaken. I couldn't take my eyes off that adorable Katherine Heigl, who I fell in love with recently after seeing KNOCKED UP, and who plays a counselor here working with the ""special people"".

","Johnny Knoxville. Why don't some people understand he's not an actor? He's a guy who was made famous by torturing himself on a childish MTV show Jackass. His acting abilities are extremely limited at best and while he could play some roles in certain films, he is definitely not cut out for a lead role of any kind. That's this film's biggest mistake.<br/><br/>The premise for this movie is actually mildly intriguing. With a different leading actor and a tighter written plot, this movie actually had some potential. Sure, there are a few laughs here and there, but they're mostly of the physical variety. Crotch shots, or Knoxville falling down, etc. And for some reason the director attempted to have Knoxville act in a dramatic fashion. Not his cup 'o tea at all which made the last 20 minutes very corny and hard to watch.<br/><br/>This is an average film, but the reason I gave it a bit of a bumped rating is because it really does raise awareness of how The Special Olympics works and the type of people that are involved in it. It shows their human sides as well. I would say The Ringer is probably worth a rental, but be prepared for extreme stupidity...and NOT from the mentally challenged characters."
"bob the moo","Null","1","2","18 December 2006"," More sensitive than I expected but as a genre film it is not funny or interesting enough
","Unable to fire a janitor, Steve Barker gives Stavi a job as gardener at his apartment complex. However when the man loses his fingers in an industrial accident Steve is faced with paying for the surgery. Coincidently Gary Barker is a gambler with large debts and no hope of getting himself out of trouble. Lacking any sort of moral scruples, Gary comes up with the idea of entering Steve into the Special Olympics and betting on him as a sure fire winner ahead of all the other ""retards"". A group of his fellow competitors spot him a mile off but when he explains what he is trying to do they agree to help him as long as he can beat cocky regular winner Jimmy.<br/><br/>OK, so I sat down to this film knowing that basically this is a comedy about a man who pretends to have a mental disability to cheat at the Special Olympics, features the word ""tard"" used loads in the first ten minutes and stars the man behind Jackass. So at no point was I expecting this to be sensitive or PC at all, but I figured it might provide some basic laughs and be worth a look. Surprisingly the film is not as insensitive as the opening ten or so minutes would suggest. This is not say that the film gets into the characters of the mentally challenged characters because it is not some deep film, but rather than it doesn't mock them for being what they are. What the film is is a sports genre comedy with basic characters Â– it just happens to be set in the world of Special Olympics.<br/><br/>However, reviewing it as a genre movie I must admit that it is only an average one at best. It isn't very funny and the plot just moves along with no real inner logic or desire to do anything clever or interesting. The plot is nonsense, with the dumbest people in the world not spotting Steve's ruse. The romance subplot is clunky and drags the film down somewhat. The ""PC"" issue is a little bit obvious as the film tries to walk the thin line between respectful and offensive but generally it doesn't let it be a big issue and simply lets it be. Knoxville is pretty poor as ""Jeffy"" because he can't really act that well. He does a good job though of preventing Jeffy being a terrible stereotype and, although he's not great, he walks a difficult line well; I'm not sure if he is really going to be able to be a ""real"" actor outside of this sort of thing but he was OK. Cox must have been paid lots and I hope he invested it well. Heigl is good looking but that's about it. The support cast are good and the material treats them well. Of course nobody is brilliant but within the context of the genre Rees, Barbanell, Howze, Arend and others are pretty good.<br/><br/>I'm not sure who the film is aiming for though. Those coming to the film ready for non-PC laughs will be disappointed while those who would appreciate the fact that the film tries not to make a big deal out of disability will probably not have bothered to watch it anyway. Overall then an average genre movie that does what sports comedies do with the twist but not many laughs and not much plot to sustain it. Kudos for not being really insensitive but that alone does not make for a good film."
"JimD73","6","1","2","4 July 2006"," The Ringer a decent diversion, but not very funny nor memorable
","When I first heard of a movie about fixing the Special Olympics, the first thought that came to mind was how tasteless the movie would be. Sure, South Park got away with having an episode about the Special Olympics, but we've come to expect the most blatantly offensive stuff possible from South Park. Then, when the name Johnny Knoxville was associated with the film, it all made sense. Who else can do the outrageously offensive like Johnny Knoxville? Surprisingly, the movie isn't really offensive at all. Also surprisingly, the movie isn't very funny at all either.<br/><br/>What starts this whole need for this retarded scheme seems a little overly complicated, but it serves its purpose. Steve Barker (Knoxville) is facing a small crises. After getting a promotion, his first task is to fire kindly old janitor Stavi. He can't bring himself to do it, so he has Stavi mow lawns at his apartment building. This plan works alright until Stavi loses his fingers in a lawnmower. Steve, without any medical insurance for Stavi, now must come up with $25,000 in two weeks or Stavi will lose his fingers.<br/><br/>Enter Steve's Uncle Gary (Cox), who is having problems of his own with his bookies. He then comes up with the idea to have Steve, who was a track star and drama star in high school, to enter the Special Olympics, presumably being able to wipe the floor with the disabled and allowing huge winnings if Gary bets on Steve over the favourite, Jimmy (Flowers). After much argument, Steve agrees to go along with the scheme to help Stavi.<br/><br/>Everything else that happens in the movie follows the path that anyone would expect. Steve (now known as Jeffy) passes himself off as 'special', but finds that the actual Special Olympians are talented enough to basically wipe the floor with him. He falls for cute counsellor Lynn (Heigl), but obviously doesn't have a chance with her since she knows him as Jeffy. He also manages to befriend that actual disabled athletes and essentially become one of them. The movie doesn't try to deviate from the formula for something of its type, even if it does have an interesting twist by making it about the Special Olympics.<br/><br/>A plot that lacks in substance or creativity is pretty well a staple of comedies with the likes of Johnny Knoxville, so that would be entirely forgivable if the movie managed to still be funny. This is, of course, the main problem with the movie. It simply isn't all that funny. Sure, there is the occasional chuckle from the behaviour of the 'special' athletes, but other than that, the movie has almost zero laughs.<br/><br/>It would be easy to blame Knoxville for this, but he is definitely trying. He does a good job overall with his impersonation, but his character is never really written anything funny. He is made to be pathetic, but not laughably so. We all know that Johnny Knoxville can be funny, but in this movie, he is just made to be warm and fuzzy, and never funny like he should have been.<br/><br/>The one surprising thing about this movie is just how light-hearted it is. Seeing as it stars Johnny Knoxville, I was expecting a crass and crude comedy that consisted mainly of fart jokes and slaps in the face towards the disabled. The movie is actually hardly offensive at all, portraying the athletes as real people rather than children, just with certain problems. They aren't walking around wearing helmets or falling down randomly or anything else you would expect from the likes of Knoxville.<br/><br/>The fact that it is inoffensive definitely makes The Ringer tolerable, but it still doesn't stop the fact that the movie just isn't that funny. While it is a decent nothing-better-to-do rental, there is no way to recommend this whole-heartedly. There was potential, but the movie wastes it all. Perhaps a better writer could have made the movie more than just a pleasant deviation into something a little more memorable.<br/><br/>56%"

","There are a number of things that makes this movie quite frankly; CRAP! 1) It's never funny. Sure there are a few scenes where Johnny Knoxville gets a ball in the face or crotch, but if you've ever seen Jackass, your over this sort of humor by far. And in the scenes where it happens, it's not really clever, it's just slightly stupid. 2) It's not really romantic. Johnny Knoxville plays a character who fakes his way into the Special Olympics, as he is not 'special' at all. While at Special Olympics camp, he falls in love with one of the volunteers. The only romantic bits around the developing relationship are some few lines where Johnny tells the girl how she should find someone that truly appreciates her. Because surprise, surprise, -she's got a boyfriend who's not doing that already. 3) Johnny Knoxville is not a very good actor. And that goes for the rest of the cast too. 4) There are no surprises what so ever in this movie. The story follows the classic romantic comedy set up, from start to end.<br/><br/>The sort of move to see when it's raining so badly outside that renting a movie is out of the question, and when there's nothing else on TV. Or if you have a child that is 'special', as this movie is as politically correct as possible when it concerns that topic."

I did not see anything offensive against or from the real mentally challenged actors; the problems came from the ""acting-challenged"" actors. Johnny Knoxville was great with the slapstick comedy, but bad in the more involved comedy.Katherine Heigl was totally miscast and got pretty annoying with the BS smiles. The odd ""Jesus"" comments randomly inserted in parts just made me feel uncomfortable and aware of how little material they had to work with. The bit at the end was also very cringe-worthy. Although the movie was approved by the Special Olympics, it seems like they also wrote this dry script.<br/><br/>I don't want to get into the tiny details, so I'll just stop here.

After his gardener has his fingers lopped off on the job, Knoxville is handed a $28,000 bill to have them re-attached. He can't pay, so while the severed digits sit on ice, our ""hero"" puts on a ""retard"" act and enters the Special Olympics.

It feels demeaning and fake. Unless they are trying to be Dustin Hoffman doing Rain Man, this was never going to work. They are better off simply getting real handicap actors to do the roles.

The mentally challenged identity he chooses is ""Jeffy"" who likes apples, and one of the managers, Karen (Janna Ambort) believes it till the end. He manages to fool everyone till about the middle when all the other competitors, besides the main winner, find out his lie.

Which is amusing most of the time, but more often than not seems to only secure my seat on the bus ride to hell.<br/><br/>There is nothing new in this film. The clichÃ© of a man entering a group he finds inferior only to discover they are no less human? It's here. The man who falls in love with a woman but is lying to her about his identity the whole time? Oh yeah, that, too. I could parallel this film with about a dozen off the top of my head, so whoever wrote this certainly was not trying to break any new ground. (Even the premise - rigging the Olympics - had been a South Park episode.) For what it's worth, Johnny Knoxville did a fine job. Trying to imagine him being retarded is not much of a stretch, though he certainly is very good at physical comedy and has no reservations in injuring himself for a laugh. The female lead (Katherine Heigl?) seems to serve no other purpose than to be attractive and not overly bright prospect of the main character.

Knoxville pulls it off for the most part, but his base character is so dull and lifeless that his alter ego, Jeffey Dahmor, a mentally challenged adult who's decided to try and best the current champion at the special Olympics, really doesn't seem like much of a departure.<br/><br/>His motives are noble; scam a local gambling ring to vote for the champ, and try at all costs to win the gold, all so he can help out a friend who needs medical attention. Not life threatening mind you; if the poor guy had a brain tumor or AIDS, God knows what Knoxville would be up to. So I was intrigued by the situation at hand, and wondered how they might pull off such a funny idea, when it's really not funny to laugh at ""special"" people.<br/><br/>Of course the comedy is there, but it's flaccid for the most part. As it turns out, the hero's are definitely the mentally challenged, and their abuse of Knoxville is the punchline. So instead of picking on the underdogs, we get water fights and athletic slapstick, in addition to sophomoric situations involving Knoxville's guilt over the deception at hand, and a love interest and her cheating boyfriend. <br/><br/>All in all it's a movie best viewed half drunk on late night cable. That or a free DVD on Pizza Night. Either way, I hope Knoxville makes another film with John Waters. They seem to work well together. I loved a Dirty Shame."

"adamcohen-esq","7","1","3","27 December 2005"," It's just so WRONG, but it feels so right...
","This is the type of movie where you can picture the Hollywood pitch session where this film came up. ""A guy, who is desperate for money, fakes being retarded so he can rig the Special Olympics!"" It's mostly a one-joke movie, but the joke comes out in several very funny scenes that did make me laugh out-loud. The supporting cast, especially Katherine Heigl and Jed Rees (Anson from ""The Chris Isaak Show"") are very worthwhile. The comedy is pretty natural, which makes this a less offensive movie than if the filmmakers decided to push the laughs at the expense of the ""Special Olympians."" And one thing I did appreciate is that there was no sanctimonious message that said ""Handicapped people are people too."" That message was clear just through the fine acting and honest laughs these actors put forth in their roles. It's a fun movie, definitely for the ""Sarah Silverman"" lovers of our society, who have thick-skins and can laugh at just about anything along the way. Enjoy!"

","I have to say after seeing this film I was more than disappointed. I knew going in that it was going to be a little off, considering Johnny Knocksville was the star, but even he and the production company have sunk to new lows with this one. The idea seemed to be funny, I mean fixing the special Olympics, but after seeing his portrayal of a slightly handicapped man cheating to win this event even I was bit offended. The only redeeming part of this movie to me was that he at least came clean and told on himself. Before the film ends he realizes that the special people in those Olympics were indeed just that, Special."

I sincerely regret the time I spent on this mess.<br/><br/>For full disclosure, I have to state that I work every day helping those with developmental disabilities improve their lives. I know these individuals intimately and see the daily struggle just to work, have relationships and lead lives that we take for granted. To see them mocked by this film was painful.<br/><br/>No, I did not laugh once. Was this supposed to be a comedy? I didn't even crack a smile. There is nothing funny about pretending to have a developmental disability no matter what the motivations are. And, apologizing or making up for your sin is not enough. The only satisfying response to what was done was by the Priest who kicked Knoxville's ass down the Church steps. That should be a punishment for the Farrelly brothers as well."

Katherine Heigl was incredible and saved some scenes from the cutting room floor but it was still boring most of the time. The idea for the movie is intriguing and the story could have been polished up a bit. Top that off with a real actor in the lead role and you've got a decent movie. If you have 90 minutes to kill, and maybe a 6-pack of cheap malt liquor, this is worth renting once it gets to the ""Dollar Shelf"". Believe meÂ… that's where it's heading.

"coldstick","4","1","4","14 January 2006"," Below average comedy
","The Ringer's laugh ratio, for me, was very similar to the one I experienced during Scary Movie 3. It's the kind of comedy that has an occasional loud chuckle, but between the occasional chuckles is a chore to watch. The story is so predictable that even the dumbest viewer will know it after watching the first fifteen minutes. Johnny Knoxville has the potential to make a great comedy some day, but this isn't it. Despite its subject matter, the film also plays it annoyingly safe, keeping it at a lame, watered-down PG-13 level throughout. It has some funny lines (""When the *bleep* did we get ice cream?""), but overall you should just stick to the South Park episode, which accomplished all of the same things and more, with bigger laughs, in only 25 minutes or so."
"careyzur","4","1","4","28 December 2005"," Casting disappoints
","Not too many authentically 'challenged' actors here with lines. Like watching an ape movie with actors in gorilla suits. What's to watch? Then there was the Ringer's greasy, gambling addicted uncle trying to hide his UK accent biting on a 1 inch stogy. Again with the outsourcing of supporting roles to Britain? One good actor with one good line turns up by the end of the first 20 pages. Knoxville's Special Olympics roommate (Billy) blasts him for scratching his CD ""in clear daylight"". Even Anchorman got off the ground sooner than that. There was a good deal more commitment from the actors in Stuck On You. Was it really necessary to go with so many 'union' comedic actors? It would have been much more enjoyable if a few more Edward Barbanelli's had been cast."
"Krustofski","4","1","5","29 December 2005"," Wrong? Yes. Offensive? Depends on who you are. Funny?...
","The ringer sounds like a perfectly teenage comedy. A bum (Johhny Knoxville) bets that he can win the special Olympics by acting retarded, in order to pay for a surgery of his dear beloved friend. ALong the way, not only does he learn a lesson, but he makes new friends, and falls in love. Doesn't that just wanna make you go 'Awwwwwww'? Well, Barry W. Blaustein thought it would, so here we are to another flick by the man that released his last halfway-decent movie (Beyond the Mat) over six years ago. How does is stack up to the other flicks in the theaters? Should you really go see King Kong? Is Narnia really that great? Is it worth it to see Harry Potter? The answer is no, it doesn't come even close. Now to start off this review, I'm going to explain a few of the cons of the movie, simply because I'd be here all day if I tried to accomplish the vice versa. For one, Johhny Knoxville delivers a righteous performance that at times makes you believe that he really is retarded. Being one of the creators of Jackass, that might not be too far off the mark, but let's get back to the movie. Another plus to this joyous stereotype of what retards are actually like, is that the movie has actual mentally challenged actors. No, I'm not talking about Knoxville, I'm talking about real-blooded actors here. The final, and probably most noticeable positive aspect of this movie, is that Brian Cox delivers a few punchlines that make you wanna chuckle, forgetting the fact that he was involved with three other films while this one was being shot and that he was obviously in for the money. Now let's take a preview of the bad-comings. First of all, the movie is just plain stale, stealing-- er-- ""borrowing"" aspects from nearly every other movie of its kind. You have to numb your brain down way past the standards of those in the actual special Olympics to not see whats coming next. Heck, ten minutes into the flick I'd mapped out exactly how'd it come to a close. Another flaw of the film is how unbelievably unfunny it is. Simply put, most of the jokes are either half-assed, unoriginal, or torn from the scripts of other movies word-by-word. Now, before we all start growing gray hairs, let me mention the final and most annoying con of the entire movie: the fact that it not only tries to be a retarded (literally) comedy, but that it makes the effort to try and become a romance. Yes, you heard me, a romance. I'm not talking about a little bit of lovin on the sides, I mean that halfway through the movie it becomes something you'd swear you'd seen on the Lifetime channel, which the writer of this flick called lifetime television for idiots (on his former project, Family guy). So now as this review comes to a close, lemme say one thing: if you really don't wish to see a three-hour-long movie in theaters thats actually good, then skip over to Blockbuster and rent 'Pieces of April'. It's not like anyone actually watched it. Otherwise, stay far away from The Ringer, and spend that seven-dollar price of admission on things more useful, like say, a book (things that you read), or maybe even a used copy of the Jackass movie: its the same exact movie, only without a script."

","I recently saw the ringer. It was horrible. I am a comedy fan and can handle humor. However, my family is a big supporter of the special Olympics and programs that help people who have mental and physical disabilities- this was disgusting. The idea of somebody rigging the special Olympics is disturbing. It is insulting and rude to play on the true hardship and struggles of these people for humor. I am not saying for anyone to not see the movie but if you are going to support this film in making it a success you are simply encouraging people to continue this harassment and you are encouraging people to try and pull off this stunt. So please before you see this movie remember that one of those Olympians could be one of your kin and if you are willing to support this I sincerely hope that you feel like dirt afterwards and I hope you have the opportunity to experience the challenges of being mentally handicapped or have this sort of thing brought so close into your life and into your family."

","equals a terrible film. And that is what the Ringer is. I never laughed once. I did give it a rating of 2 because it was not the worst movie of the year, but it certainly wasn't funny. And I'm someone who likes shows like South Park and does not get offended with politically incorrect material. But this just wasn't funny. The only scene I liked was when the priest, after hearing Steve's confession, bets money on him to win the special Olympics. It is just hard to get over what Steve does because it was so low, even if it was for a good cause. And I didn't like how he gets the girl in the end because I don't think anyone girl would forgive a guy for what he did. I was rooting for Lynn's slap because Steve so deserved it.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: I don't recommend it because I didn't think it was funny. Johnny Knoxville's Jack Ass films and TV show is what you should watch if you want some laughs."

","This was a terrible movie. Firstly, the plot is inane and a stretch. Knoxville agrees to throw the special olympics in order to raise money to pay for an operation to sew a friends fingers back on after a lawn mowing accident. Severed fingers lasting 2 weeks on ice? I don't think so.<br/><br/>The acting in this movie is downright awful. The only decent performance comes from Jed, who played Glen, who did a decent job. The rest of the acting was so bad that they were outdone by the unexperience ""challanged/special"" performers. Knoxville's character is not nearly as funny as you would think and the script is anything that a 13 yr old could draw up with his friends (albeit not as funny most likely). I really expected more from the production companies that did happy gilmore, but this was downright awful, and the last 30 minutes really want to make one puke, not to mention the plethora of plot holes. I give this a 3, mainly for the acting of the special guys and Jed."

","I saw this movie unwillingly, and think my misgivings were well-placed. The movie is funny, and if for a moment you can forget about its subject matter, you may find yourself laughing. There is a weak attempt in the end to salvage the theme that mentally challenged people are just like us, but the movie is carried by the antics of the people competing in the Special Olympics and those of Johnny Knoxville's character as he tries to act mentally challenged. The humor in this movie is completely unacceptable- despite its attempts to show things in a good light, it all plays on existing stereotypes of mentally challenged people. For example Johnny Knoxville's character loses control if he thinks he may be discovered as a fake; he throws pickle jars, tries to hit people and starts yelling ""Jeffy likes apples!"" His actions may save his character, but they do nothing but provide the audience a reason to laugh at people who really do act like this. I have a cousin who is mentally challenged, and I have volunteered working with mentally challenged youth- this movie disgusts me, and does not do justice to the mentally challenged anywhere. The only aspect I was pleased with is the positive light that volunteering at the Special Olympics is shown in- perhaps it will inspire others to volunteer, and appreciate the program not for its humor, but what it does for mentally challenged people."

","I just watched this movie for the first time today, and I had very low expectations. In fact I really had a guilty feeling that I might be about to watch and enjoy something that goes against everything I believe in when it comes to the passionate human decency that one should have towards persons with developmental disabilities. I worked in that field for a Great non for profit agency that serves people with developmental disabilities for 7 years as a supervisor in an ISO certified pallet and crate building factory. I developed the most awesome friendships with the people I trained, worked side by side with, and served. I can not even begin to explain how it changed my life, and my priorities. I always wanted to be there and join in all of the after work activities as well. This movie made me realize how much I miss them all! I had to leave and go to work elsewhere because I couldn't pay my bills working there anymore, and that's just not fair! Fact is there is very little funding to keep these non for profit agencies up and running these days. The people who work at a lot of these places serving clients struggle from paycheck to paycheck, and they are the hardest working, caring, unselfish, and most dedicated people I know. They sacrifice their entire life, to help insure that clients have as normal and happy life as possible. I can not give them enough praise for their dedication.

Everything about this so called comedy wasn't funny and was just predictable. All the funny parts are in the trailer and the trailer wasn't even funny. This film had some good idea, but it turned into more of a romance movie than a crude outrageous humor movie that I was expecting it to be. It also follows the clichÃ© of the protagonist going with the flow and realize he made a mistake and tries to correct that mistake and show some morals near the end. And despite Johnny Knoxville being pretty good at acting retarded, this film had hardly to do with the special Olympic. The romance in it isn't even good and is a pretty bad date movie as well. So not a good comedy or a date movie, so just pass on this one. There is just way better comedies out there.<br/><br/>3.8/10"
"MikeK1987","4","0","2","2 July 2010"," A comment on both this film and the Farrelly Brothers in general...
","While this isn't a horrible movie, it's certainly not good. After the bombs that were ""Say It Isn't So"", ""Shallow Hal"", & ""Stuck On You"", I was hoping that this would be something of a comeback for the Farrelly Brothers. Little did I know, that this would be nothing more than a predictable rip-off of a South Park episode.<br/><br/>Also, it seems to me that the Farelly Brothers are fixated with using the mentally handicapped in their films, usually for comedic purposes (a good example is the character Warren from ""There's Something About Mary""). This film seems to be the ultimate payoff of that fixation, with the main plot being all about the handicapped, and some of the main actors either acting handicapped or really being handicapped! I know that the brothers do good things. But do they do it out of guilt for their use of handicapped people as the butt of jokes? Seems like it to me.<br/><br/>However, despite this film being sub-par, the acting is actually surprisingly well done. I think that Johnny Knoxville is actually a decent actor. The material here is hardly worthwhile, but he does breathes some life into the script. I'd recommend watching ""Grand Theft Parsons"" and/or ""Daltrey Calhoun"" if you really wanna see Knoxville's acting chops put to work.<br/><br/>This film is also known as the film that jump-started the career of the vexatious Katherine Heigl. I can only tolerate this woman for her... um... how can I put this?... her... um... Nevermind. Anyway, I thought she was good in ""Knocked Up"", at first, but on repeated viewings, I realized that it was just her... um... ya know... the... ah, forget it. I stopped caring about her when she had the audacity to go out and trash ""Knocked Up"". She's completely full of herself (wait... could that be a double entendre?), and has not a shred of acting chops whatsoever. She's just eye candy. Hey, Heigl! Fulfill your role as eye candy, and do all of us guys a favor, and take your top off or pose for Playboy already! <br/><br/>There I said it! <br/><br/>Happy? <br/><br/>Anyway, back to ""The Ringer""...<br/><br/>It's definitely not on par with what I believe to be their masterworks; ""Dumb & Dumber"", ""Kingpin"", and ""Outside Providence"". However, I've seen some WAY worse films. This is just mildly average. Not bad, but not good either. I'd recommend seeing the South Park episode, ""Up The Down Steroid"" instead. That episode is only 22 minutes, has a more engaging storyline that's better written and better acted, and best of all, no Katherine Heigl (unless you can stand watching anything that she's in for her... um... ah... man this is tough to say over IMDb... Alright... Her large pendulous breasts!!!! There I finally said it! I'm a sick, sick pervert who likes large-breasted women! Happy?)."

Eventually he understands that you shouldn't judge people by yadda yadda yadda, now let's beat some kind of villain. Oh, and there you have the love interest with the asshole boyfriend, right on cue. Perhaps our hero should catch him cheat on her. What do you know, he does. This movie is almost shockingly formulaic, and virtually no effort is made to bring in anything creative. Some people find this movie offensive, but this movie is just way too lame for someone to be offended by. Besides, it's not like the mentally handicapped are actually mocked, at least not enough for one to care. I liked Johnny Knoxville in this movie, but he can't save the bad screenplay like he could in say, ""Walking Tall"". He's still pretty good, but his comedy talent is wasted here.

","A nice comedy that takes a potentially home wrecking scenario and classes it up the best it can. While surely prompting offenses from the few bitter scabs that project their political correctness unto everything they cannot equate, The Ringer somehow manages to make a laugh out loud comedy, whose principle character mimics and exploits mental retardation, into a heartfelt, feel good process. Knoxville, following a predictable script, proves he has the chops to be a decent leading man in his natural performance, replacing his physical pranks of testicle smashing with more seasoned acts of subtlety. Knoxville fans needn't worry though, this film does a great job at showcasing the man's more traditional approach of goofiness and his new more refined delivery. I always knew that he was far more talented then that group of likable morons from the Jackass crew, and for all the massive beatings he's had to take to get to where he is, I wish him a successful career."

","I think Johnny Knoxville was a great choice for this role being someone who many associate with the sub-juvenile antics of Jackass. It wouldn't be a stretch to picture him making fun of mentally challenged people. I just don't think he was really allowed to go the full distance with it.<br/><br/>His character is never really established as someone who is insensitive or crass, but rather a hopelessly nice person. The result is that there is minimal payoff when he realizes that his fellow Special Olympians are a lot more capable than he'd given them credit for. Instead his uncle, played by Brian Cox, is set up as the lout with no scruples when it comes to making a quick buck. The problem is that we never see how his attitude toward the mentally challenged is changed at the end of the film.<br/><br/>It's not a surprise that both my viewing partner and I left the theater a bit confused as to how we were supposed to feel about the mentally challenged characters in this movie."
