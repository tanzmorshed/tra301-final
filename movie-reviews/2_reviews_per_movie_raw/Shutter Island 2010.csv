","I know there is already a spoiler warning up top but I am going to warn you again. Don't read this because I am going to give everything away.<br/><br/>I had this movie all wrong I will admit at the start I didn't get it and I was angry but after having a chat with my friend who went with me we both gasped when we realised what happened. The twist wasn't that he was the inpatient (seriously I think everyone saw that coming from a mile away!) the twist was the intervention actually worked. He was cured, he deliberately made it look like he relapsed because he did not want to live with the memory of what happened to his family. He blamed himself for ignoring that his wife was clearly unstable. The line ""would you rather die as a good man or live as a monster"" Depicted he wanted to die as a good man (lobotomized) then live with the memory of what happened. Also the symbolism of fire and water tells you when he is hallucinating (fire) and when he is lucid (water trickling through.) The delusion he concocts to save himself from accepting the truth is that his wife died in a fire. All the people he talks to surrounded by fire is a hallucination – the woman in the cave, the patient in the cell, the scarred faced man who he thinks killed his wife, the car blowing up – all a delusion. The water symbolizes reality trying to break through. He is afraid of water – ( and rightly so!His kids were drowned, they all died in front of the lake.) Also at the start he says he gets 'sea sick' – he is mortally afraid of water. He has to swim to get to the lighthouse.<br/><br/>To truly get the best affect of this movie you have to see it more than once. (I have only seen this once but I promise you I will see it again)<br/><br/>I think John Anderson from the Wall Street Journal got it right when he says the film - <br/><br/>""requires multiple viewings to be fully realized as a work of art. Its process is more important than its story, its structure more important than the almost perfunctory plot twists it perpetrates. It's a thriller, a crime story and a tortured psychological parable about collective guilt."""

","Shutter Island is the story of Teddy Daniels, A U.S. federal marshal sent to the island with his partner Chuck Aule to search for the disappearance of a patient. Each scene provides a turn against their leads and compels them to look for more whilst searching in places we couldn't comprehend, including their minds. Leonardo DiCaprio and Mark Ruffalo feed off each other and supply great performances for their characters as expected, but some of the other characters whose names are riveted on the posters or marquees are sensational as well. The two that stuck out to me most were Ben Kingsley (Dr. Cawley) and Michelle Williams (Dolores, Teddy's wife), each of whom brought so much dramatics and new questions to the movie, developing plot twists and controversy. I don't think this film would be the same without them.<br/><br/>This is also a film I would recommend seeing a second time. In fact, it is even better the second time. All those pieces of that puzzle you didn't catch the first time, you will the second. You see, we as the audience are first put in the shoes of Teddy. The second? Well, without giving too much away, lets just say you are put in someones else's shoes entirely during the second viewing. <br/><br/>Shutter Island.

","Shutter Island. A film that will divide the film community. A film that will leave many upset, and hating it. A film that has already completely split the critics. A movie that messes with you. And no one likes to be messed with. And that is exactly where it exceeds. Think I'm contradicting myself? <br/><br/>Shutter Island is one of the most well crafted psychological thrillers to come by since Silence Of The Lambs. And it is no coincidence both were brilliantly written novels. Shutter Island is adapted by a book written by Dennis Lehane (wrote gone baby, gone and mystic river). It is a book filled with twists and turns, that will leave the reader dizzy. And, that is what it's film counterpart does to the fullest. Martin Scorsese helms the director chair, in a movie where he is more free than any before. This is Scorsese at his most unrestrained. <br/><br/>Marty takes what he has learned from the great films of the past and puts it into his. The master of suspense Alfred Hitchcock's influence is everywhere you look in this film. And it is no wonder, considering Scorsese even showed one of his greatest works to the crew: Vertigo. And many of those ideas are present in Shutter Island; the cliff scenes scream Hitchcock. This is a film that creeps and crawls, and is filled with dark corners. And it is all heightened by the coming storm that looms over the island. This is classic film noir. <br/><br/>The story follows Teddy, a federal Marshall, and his partner Chuck (Played by DiCaprio and Ruffulo). They go to this mysterious island enveloped in fog to investigate an escape. From these opening scenes, Marty has set up a dark and creepy premise. <br/><br/>Almost the whole movie incorporates this story as Teddy desperately tries to find the truths he seeks. Teddy is shown as a scared man; a man of war and violence as portrayed in various flashbacks. These will go on to be increasingly important as the story progresses. We follow Teddy on his quest, through every dark corridor and perilous confrontations. Slowly, we are given pieces to the puzzle, but the audience does not even realize it. For we, like Teddy, are blind. For the moment at least. It is because of this that the thrilling conclusion will leave many blindsided. But, you see, that is where this thriller becomes something more. We as the audience are put in Teddy's shoes, and we feel all the things he feels. It is a complete assault on the senses, and it works beautifully. <br/><br/>This is a film you must watch carefully. That is another thing that sets this apart, it is a horror film that makes you actually think. In this day and age, I'm not surprised some found it terrible esp. after their brains have been turned to mush by these new gore filled horror films. Scorsese's ultimate goal here is to wake you up. And trust me, you probably wont like it. <br/><br/>This is also a film I would recommend seeing a second time. In fact, it is even better the second time. All those pieces of that puzzle you didn't catch the first time, you will the second. You see, we as the audience are first put in the shoes of Teddy. The second? Well, without giving too much away, lets just say you are put in someones else's shoes entirely during the second viewing. <br/><br/>Shutter Island.

"NpMoviez","10","166","192","29 July 2018"," Movie of the decade.
","It is one of the best movies made by director Martin Scorsese. It is perhaps the best movie starring Leonardo DiCaprio. Honestly speaking, it is one of the greatest films of the decade. DiCaprio featured in two movies in 2010, the other one being ""Inception"". Both were excellent. To this day, they are some of the best cinematic experience I have ever had. That being said, I found ""Shutter Island"" to be much more superior, as ""Inception"" feels a little bit of a mumbo jumbo many times.<br/><br/>Good.
""Shutter Island"" is simply a masterpiece. The beginning of the movie suggests a very basic plot of a detective story, possibly a thriller. As the movie progresses, the plot becomes bigger and bigger with more and more complexity added to it. The way this happens is incredible. The pacing is really good. That is what makes the movie so interesting. And, even though the movie gets more complex, it is not difficult to keep up with the major plot points. And, the final twist is one of the best plot twists I have ever seen. I did not expect it at all. And, like the main character portrayed by DiCaprio, we are not ready to believe what is being told until a lot of reveals finally convince us. There are a lot of many things that might seem to be pointless before the final twist which are totally relevant with the story that is actually being told. The character of Edward Daniels is superbly written. We get to know where the character is coming from and we can get behind the character - yet another excellent thing about this movie. There are some dream sequences that seems like a filler, but is a major indication to the reveal. There are quite many ""illusions"" which feel very real, but carry no real meaning in the end. There are many additional things which may seem like a diversion from the story being told, but are actually enhancing it. Some dialogues between the main character and an imprisoned character get a very different interpretation after it's all set and done. So much of a complex story, yet no giant inconsistencies at all. It's just superbly written and directed and acted. It's totally different from ""Memento"" (2000) but still, has a lot of similarities. We get into the main character's head and we just get his interpretations, different types though. Towards the end, we don't want to step fully outside his head, but when we finally do, it's mind blowing. The ending moments were conceived by many to be confusing. But, if you keep up with the entire story, it's meaning is quite obvious. The movie is dark and psychologically engrossing. Yet it does have a short lived and very brief happy moment with the tiny plotline involving Dr. Cawley's motives. That's all I can say without getting into complete spoilers. Leonardo DiCaprio, Mark Ruffalo and Ben Kingsly have given some of the great performances till date. I don't have anything that bugged me. So no mixed or bad aspects of the film.<br/><br/>Conclusion.
On the whole, for me, it's the movie of the decade. The decade is almost over, and still I have not got any movie in the league of ""Shutter Island"". It's a very engaging and thrilling movie. It's one of those films I consider to be an all time great.<br/><br/>Rating.
Score : absolute 10/10
Grade : A+"
"TheDeadMayTasteBad","9","647","812","23 February 2010"," All it Takes is One Line of Dialogue to Make an Impact...
","There is one line of dialogue, right at the end of Shutter Island before the credits roll, that elevates the emotion of the film and makes it much more powerful. For those of you, like me, who read and enjoyed the novel before seeing the film and felt that the trailers and advertisements for this film were leading you to believe there wouldn't be any narrative surprises in store, think again! Scorsese's film features that one brief piece of dialogue at the films conclusion that results in an entirely different perception of the final act. The rest of the film, however, is very faithful to Dennis Lehane's already great story.<br/><br/>Shutter Island represents exactly what one should hope for when seeing a novel being interpreted to film. While it certainly does the source material justice, it also adds small changes that make for a distinctive experience. Even if you've read the novel multiple times, you'll feel like you're reading the book for the first time again while watching. Scorsese perfectly recreates the menacing atmosphere of the island on film. Every location is foreboding and drenched with hints of unseen danger in dark corners. The lighthouse, the caves, the civil war fort housing ""the most dangerous patients,"" and the island itself--every locale seems large yet claustrophobic and isolated at the same time.<br/><br/>I often experience claustrophobia myself and there are certain films that really capitalize on that personal fear and make it more relevant and eerie to me. Neil Marshall's The Descent was one such picture, and this is another. An confined island is a terrific horror location and it comes with its own type of fear. The utter desperation to escape from a persistent and confined nightmare is something Teddy (Dicaprio) is receiving in high doses, and so does the audience.<br/><br/>As with Scorsese and DiCaprio's previous collaborations, this is a movie that must be seen. Here they explore the horror/thriller genre with gravitas, with no small part played by Laeta Kalogridis in supplying the screenplay. While most modern pictures of its kind lack character or any real sense of suspense, Shutter Island doesn't go for cheap gags. I concur with Ebert when he says one of the key elements to this film is that it releases its tension through suspense instead of mindless action sequences. That's not to knock a well-deserved frenetic scene of violence every once in awhile--it works to the advantage of some films like Evil Dead II and Planet Terror--but had Teddy and Chuck gone running and gunning through the facility's faculty, the mood this movie keeps in check so well would have been lost.<br/><br/>However, that mood isn't sacrificed and ""spooky"" is punched up to full force. A considerable amount of that spooky is generated by a ""best of"" collection of actors that have mastered the art of creepy: Ben Kingsley, Jackie Earle Haley, Ted Levine, and Max Von Sydow just to name a few. Had Tom Noonan been thrown in the cast as well, my ""Top Five People I Would Not Want to Be Left in the Dark with, Especially in a Room with No Doors or Windows"" list would have been completely exhausted. On that note, is it just me or has Sydow mysteriously not aged since The Exorcist? Was there a secret pact made between Lucifer and Father Merrin? Whether he sold his soul or not, he's quite ominous in every single scene he is present in. All of this great talent in front of the camera doesn't mean anything though if you don't have a faithful orchestrator behind it. Luckily you have Scorsese leading the lens and he points the movie in the right direction, even if this isn't among his very best works. His style works amazingly with suspense laden projects and at times he even seems to channel Hitchcock and Kubrick, though there's always something distinctively Scorsese about the presentation. I found the editing in the opening scene, with Chuck and Teddy approaching Shutter Island, to be very odd and frantic, though I think the audience will know why Scorsese displayed the scene the way he did after completing the film.<br/><br/>With a body of work so impressive, Shutter Island is among captivating company. The good news is that Shutter Island carves out a place of its own in his resume. While no Goodfellas or Raging Bull or Taxi Driver, I have no problem placing Shutter side by side The Last Temptation of Christ and Bringing Out the Dead. The cinematography is bright and gorgeous. Scorsese doesn't rely on the over-grainy, ugly presentation that most modern horror or suspense-riddled thrillers rely on. He uses lush, bright color during daytime and dream sequences to flush out a distinct feeling of terror.<br/><br/>Shutter Island isn't just a pretty face, its also got a great story to boot and this is why I've been anticipating the film for so long. As mentioned earlier, I've been exposed and digested the source material myself before seeing the movie. I was worried the trailers for the film were giving away too much through their spots on television and on the silver screen, but Scorsese has added enough to the film for the story to feel fresh even for those ""in the know."" You are transferred in the films paranoia and phobia once the camera pans through the mental facilities open doors. Lehane is one of the luckiest authors on the planet to have his work adapted to the big screen by talents such as Eastwood and Scorsese, but his work is brilliant and deserving of such treatment.<br/><br/>At the risk of spoiling plot points for potential viewers who have not read the book, I'll leave a Related Recommendations section concealed in ""Spoiler"" tags. Discussing this story at any length can be quite revealing."
"napierslogs","9","158","199","22 May 2010"," Shutter Island is at the top of its genre
","Martin Scorsese has done it again. He pays attention to every detail in this film, making ""Shutter Island"" one of the best suspense thrillers of all time.<br/><br/>Visually intriguing, simplistic and absolutely phenomenal. The story is kept simplistic enough so it doesn't get absurd, but allows for an ending which you probably won't see coming. The film doesn't go for cheap thrills, so although you will be on the edge of your seat you won't get needlessly scared.<br/><br/>The film uses everything at its disposal from breathtaking scenery, to detailed laid-out shots, and to actors at their finest to completely engross you in the film. I loved every minute of it and highly recommend it to everyone. Even if you're not a usual fan of the genre, this film has so much more to it."
"jackgdemoss","9","32","37","22 July 2019"," One of the most memorable plot twists of this decade
","I originally saw this film when it came out but couldn't remember it well enough to give it a rating or write a review, so a rewatch was in order. I viewed the film through the lens of already knowing the plot twist, which made it a whole different experience. The ending will be remembered throughout film history as one that showed just how viciously a well written script can flip an audience over. This really is a film you should see twice."

","Finally, a horror/thriller that actually, genuinely scares the crap out of you. Not because it has fancy villains in masks or sadistic buckets of gore throughout. No, it scares you because it messes with your mind. Most will hate this movie, they don't like their brains being tampered with. I loved it. It's what we needed after all those gory R-rated and sometimes lame-duck PG-13 horror crap-fests.<br/><br/>The horror/thriller genre has been raped lately, with gore and scantily clad- women replacing the noir and terror that Alfred Hitchcock perfected in the '50s and '60's. Here director Martin Scorsese delivers in full blast, crafting a thriller in his own unique vision. The atmosphere throughout the movie is tense and unsettling. Slow as it may be, but it is crucial to the movie and it's genuinely gripping. Your attention WILL not be lost. The scenery is beautiful and finely done with no excessive lighting, grain or darkness. The editing by Thelma Schoonmaker is fluid and pitch-perfect, and never makes the film lose focus. The movie is based on a book by Dennis Lehane and is packed with twists and turns that will leave you breathless and uneasy. The movie cranks the breathlessness and uneasiness up to the power of 5. The music is also perfectly suited with the scenes. There is sometimes no music during suspenseful moments, and sometimes the music makes the scene even more disturbing and memorable. Alfred Hitchcock's noirish thriller style is back with a vengeance, here to teach today's moviegoers the REAL meaning of suspense and horror.<br/><br/>All the actors in the movie are in top-form. Once again, you can't go wrong with a Leonardo DiCaprio/Martin Scorsese collaboration. As the protagonist, we the audience are thrust into his shoes and we are about as confused and scared as his character is, we feel what he feels. It becomes a psychological trip that poses many, many questions about oneself, that to discuss them here would spoil the entire movie. There are some flashbacks in the movie, but all of them are important clues to DiCaprio's character. DiCaprio gives a stunning performance, once again tempting the Academy to give him another Best Actor nomination. DiCaprio gives a vivid portrayal of a vulnerable, haunted and ultimately terrified man. Apart from DiCaprio there's really not much I can say about the supporting cast, because they are all also terrific. Ben Kingsley; Mark Ruffalo; Michelle Williams; Max Von Sydow; Jackie Earle Haley; Emily Mortimer; Patricia Clarkson; Ted Levine; Elias Koteas; John Carroll Lynch. All of them.<br/><br/>In short, this is a psychological and frightening masterpiece that will make you scared, will make you think, and will make you seek psychological help. This is one of the best films of the year. See it, go in with an open mind and prepare to be blown away.<br/><br/>Overall value: 9/10."
"slothhead54","9","513","745","17 February 2010"," Of all the movies in theatres to see, this is worth your time
","I just saw Shutter Island this evening, just prior to its American release. I have to say this film was full of intrigue. Prior to viewing this film I had built a preconceived notion of what this thriller was going to be like because I was fooled yet again by good marketing when watching the trailer. This is probably not the movie for your average film-goer who wants an easy plot line to follow and little thought required. This movie does challenge the viewer physchologically and definitely holds your attention all the way through. For someone who was never much of a Leonardo fan, his performance is brilliant, so much range to his character. In fact all of the acting in this film is excellent. The directing is probably the best quality to this film. I always enjoy watching a film that is as unpredicatable as this film and where the director has turned the plot line on to his viewer."
"bain0038","10","376","563","19 February 2010"," Don't miss this one - review from a skeptic.
","From the look of the trailer, Martin Scorsese's ""Shutter Island"" looks more like a horror film This is a dangerous place where isolation rules under fascist control. A U.S Marshall is sent to an asylum to investigate a missing patient but discovers so much more. A demon? A ghost? Something more? Is this going to be as disappointing as I think it is?<br/><br/>I was skeptical walking into the theater, wondering if this twist could hold water. The film starts with Teddy Daniels and his new partner, Chuck, standing on a ferry. They talk about their assignment. What's suspect here is that there is no additional development. We are bam, smack right into the story without so much as an opening montage. All that we see is the men smoking a couple cigarettes. Though this is what begins as momentous development. As our hero smokes we that this isn't the glorified top lit smoking of a beauty or that of a sophisticated and confident gangster. We see that this is a harsher character with poor posture, someone who doesn't sleep well, someone with a deep past<br/><br/>They are greeted at the gate by guards whose attitudes' seem immediately suspect. Soon we meet Dr Crawley, a seemingly complex and modern man who runs the asylum. However, he soon turns uncooperative with the investigation. Inmates and staff are hiding something but what? Everyone here seems off. Evidence and clues begin to appear but not before our hero seems riddled by psychosis himself. ""You act like all this madness is contagious."" Daniels says to the guard. Is it? Soon we begin to wonder, too, but not before he uncovers the tip of the iceberg and it's not only painfully intimate with his own past but also a mass conspiracy. The Nazis had concentration camps and the Americans have Shutter Island.<br/><br/>Though, it doesn't stop here, but to say anything else would do the story injustice Kingsley is in his finest role in years. Similarly, DiCaprio reaches new levels. Amongst others Elias Koteas, Ted Levine, Michelle Williams, all play small but wonderful roles. Robert Richardson captures a world all of its own.<br/><br/>While Scorsese is a master of film I'd say that his specialty has been more character than story. This is a fresh balance of both. It's a mix of noir and thriller. It's only sort of a horror movie and could be compared to ""The Shining"" but it makes it look like it's a one trick pony. <br/><br/>All this praise being said it's not for everyone. The story is complex. It takes some attention. At times it's a bit bleak and dire. Of course it all makes a little less sense when you actually think about it but then again that's film. There are a couple of moments where the story gets lost within itself. Things become a bit too complicated. At this point you might begin to lose faith in its viscosity, but don't worry because the story has you right where its put you."
"czavaleta73","9","213","315","23 February 2010"," Great a must watch !!
","I saw this and I knew what to expect going in to the film as I had already read about half of the book but never got the chance to finish it. But I was surprised at how faithful the film was to the original material.The directing was also masterfully done and pretty cool I saw some cool camera tricks I hadn't seen since Martin Scorsese directed Bringing Out The Dead, Martin Scorsese did one great job and everyone was top notch especially Ben Kingsley and DiCaprio and I never though I would jump out of fright especially in a Scorsese film but I did. All in all a solid thriller with a good story and some great performances and for me it's the best film I've seen in 2010 so far."
"tsquared226","10","487","754","16 February 2010"," Another Excellent Film by Scorsese...
","Really, Scorsese should just give it away for anyone. The man is one of the most brilliant directors of our time. Anyway, let me get to the actual movie; I just saw it at a early screening and have to write this while I'm thinking about how stunning it was. Shutter Island is certainly not a typical film, not even for Scorsese. It is a different take for the director, and he does it, as he does every film, perfectly, so much as to be in his own league of film-making. I don't want to give anything away, but I will say this: Shutter Island was completely unexpected, and a great start to 2010. It had all the components of a great film, and then some. The acting is spot on from every character; none of it seems forged or out of place. The script is fantastic; it has one of the most intriguing plots I have seen in a while (exception being Tarantino's Basterds). Everything, down to the set's lighting, was perfectly executed. I will say that not everyone will like this; Shutter Island, again, isn't your typical movie. To those, though, who do choose to see this film, be ready for a compelling, gripping, thought-provoking experience, so much so that you might think to see it again for further clarity (I know I will; it was so entertaining and my mind was blown!). Don't be surprised if you see this at the next Oscars..."
"LeoCrow2002","10","51","72","10 April 2010"," Which Would Be Worse, To Live As A Monster Or To Die As A Good Man?
","If Paramount Pictures had released Martin Scorsese's Shutter Island last year – the original release date was October 2nd, 2009 – I would have considered the film the best movie of the year. As it stands, the rest of 2010 has a long way to go in terms of matching the quality and effectiveness of Scorsese's new picture. It's a fascinating character drama, an exciting and almost experimental exploration of the human mind, a reinvention of the horror genre and a dynamic acting showcase for its star, the incredible and still very underrated Leonardo DiCaprio.<br/><br/>Shutter Island is also an incredibly appropriate entry in the Scorsese canon – it's a film about an alienated man haunted by his past. Add Teddy Daniels to the list of Scorsese's tragic and multilayered antiheroes – Jake La Motta, Travis Bickle, Henry Hill, Howard Hughes, Billy Costigan, Rupert Pupkin, Jesus Christ. The film also continues Scorsese's fascination with our understanding of violence (it should be noted that our perception of the lead character's violent actions changes dramatically when watching the film for a second time).<br/><br/>Shutter Island is eerie from the very beginning. U.S. Marshal Teddy Daniels (DiCaprio) and his newly assigned partner Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo) steadily approach an island off the coast of Massachusetts known as Shutter Island, a mental hospital for the criminally insane. The year is 1954, and Scorsese and music supervisor Robbie Robertson subtly incorporate vintage (and sometimes downright disturbing) 1950s music into the sound mix. Once on the island, Daniels and his partner meet with Dr. Cawley (Ben Kingsley), who explains to the Marshals that one of the island's patients has mysteriously disappeared overnight. The investigation that ensues is a fascinating exploration of insanity.<br/><br/>Hovering over every scene is a paranoid, post-war anxiety shared explicitly by our protagonist and thoroughly felt and realized by Scorsese. Tensions rise as Teddy recalls horrific memories from liberating a concentration camp during the war, and his suspicions of Nazism and conspiracy by the House of Un-American Activities on the island become our suspicions. The best Scorsese films force the audience to live inside the minds of moderately-to-severely delusional characters weighed down by an enormous and overwhelming guilt. Shutter Island does just that. There is an unease throughout the entire film, deliberate disturbances in continuity that some audiences might mistake for sloppy editing. That's simply Oscar-winning editor Thelma Schoonmaker toying with the audience, making us question the reality we're watching and the reliability of our protagonist. <br/><br/>The film is a brilliant melding of film noir, detective mystery and psychological horror, at its very core an exploration of an emotionally disturbed human psyche, disguised as a Hitchcockian thriller that works as both a homage to Scorsese's favorite psychological thrillers from the 1940s and 1950s while simultaneously elevating itself into something larger and more complicated. When you watch Shutter Island, you're not just watching Scorsese's film – you're watching thousands of classic movies at once, assembled together in a picture conceived by a filmmaker whose encyclopedic knowledge of film history pours into every detail of every frame, so much so that an already-genuinely suspenseful scene of DiCaprio racing up a flight of winding stairs simultaneously serves as a homage to Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger's The Red Shoes (1948).<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Shutter Island has come under attack from, as my good friend calls them, the pseudo-intellectual crowd. From what I can gather, the general complaint is that the movie takes itself too seriously dramatically, and that some of the dramatic shifts in the film are laughable. Perhaps this is because Scorsese refuses to compromise his vision by winking at the audience. When discussing The Best Films of the 1990s with Martin Scorsese in early 2000, film critic Roger Ebert notes that at some point in the 1990s, existentialism, ""the idea of what we do with our lives,"" was ""replaced by irony, so that everything has quotation marks around it."" He then adds, however, that Scorsese's ""films are not in quotation marks...they are meant.""<br/><br/>And he's absolutely right. Scorsese can't make an ironic film - a film too afraid to deal head- on with real, palpable human emotion, therefore putting the actions of its characters in huge quotation marks. My favorite films of the past few years don't have ironic quotation marks around their characters, either. I don't buy movies that do that – it's a cheap way of pleasing the cynical, highbrow crowd who only accept genuine human emotion in films if it comes from Pixar Animation or a foreign-language film. I love those movies, too, but I haven't given up on serious American films that aim for high character drama and succeed. I'm talking about Clint Eastwood's Mystic River (2003), Scorsese's The Aviator (2004), Ang Lee's Brokeback Mountain (2005) and now, Shutter Island. These are films that take their characters and their plights seriously.<br/><br/>Every negative review I've read doesn't seem to consider how effective the film is on a visceral level, how strong and forceful the performances are from top to bottom and the powerful manner in which screenwriter Laeta Kalogridis keeps the story grounded in the deep emotional turmoil of its characters. Shutter Island is a real film, the kind they don't make anymore, exceeding the supposed limitations of its genre and offering its audience something challenging and psychologically fascinating. Scorsese doesn't have to make movies anymore - he's already made more masterpieces than any other living filmmaker - but we're lucky that he's still exploring his obsessions in new and inventive ways. Shutter Island should be met with applause, not simply because the film marks the latest work from our finest living filmmaker, but because it's also the best damn movie you'll see this year."
"IamtheRegalTreatment","9","195","325","19 February 2010"," Counting down the days until I can add this to my DVD collection...
","Similar to my rating for this film, you can argue that 9 out of 10 people who watch this movie, it will not be their first Scorsese film. Most of us know the genius that he is and coming into this showing we should expect brilliance, and gladly he delivers a captivating storyline driven by great acting. Unfortunately with the release of Shutter Island was also a press release that Taxi Driver may be remade, so that news made me hesitant to care, but I'm glad I was wrong.<br/><br/>Shutter Island is the story of Teddy Daniels, A U.S. federal marshall sent to the island with his partner Chuck Aule to search for the disappearance of a patient. Each scene provides a turn against their leads and compels them to look for more whilst searching in places we couldn't comprehend, including their minds. Leonardo DiCaprio and Mark Ruffalo feed off each other and supply great performances for their characters as expected, but some of the other characters whose names are riveted on the posters or marquees are sensational as well. The two that stuck out to me most were Ben Kingsley (Dr. Cawley) and Michelle Williams (Dolores, Teddy's wife), each of whom brought so much dramatics and new questions to the movie, developing plot twists and controversy. I don't think this film would be the same without them.<br/><br/>Even to begin explaining details of the plot and how everything comes to fruition causes me to feel migraines alike the ones Teddy gets in the movie, therefore I won't ruin anything for you now. Take my honest word that if you enjoyed any Scorsese movie in the past or have enjoyed movies that include surrealism, Shutter Island combines the two into an intense thriller that boggles the mind and possibly even ""corrode it, rusts it"". Also, if you are hesitant to watch this film because the trailer perceives it as a horror film with a lot of ""jumpy"" scenes, ignore that. I had the same feeling entering it, and there was only one towards the very end, but it was worth the shock. You will miss so much detail trying to cover your eyes for a few minutes sporadically throughout that it's not worth it. Take the risk of jumping out of your seat for once, because it was the best scare I could ask for.<br/><br/>9/10. Not Martin's best work, but come on, could you make a better movie than him?"

","Shutter Island centers around two U.S. Marshalls who must search for a missing patient on said island, which has a large complex specifically designed for harboring the most violent and disturbed mental patients. Agent Teddy Daniels and his partner must try to understand the mysteries of Shutter Island while attempting to unearth a plot that may go all the way up to the men who run it.<br/><br/>Shutter Island is a very unique and interesting movie. The acting, directing, and the script are all excellent as can be expected in a Scorsese movie. But the quality that sets this apart from most of his previous works is the tone and genre. Scorsese does an amazing job of creating a haunting and dark tone that fits such a suspenseful movie very well.<br/><br/>The twist is also very good, even though it was given away by the trailers. At the end of the movie it is revealed that Leonardo DiCaprio is a patient on Shutter Island and everything that has happened has been an attempt to allow him to live out his delusion of a missing patient and two U.S. Marshalls investigating a secret plot. This idea is a bit far fetched, but that is easily forgivable when you consider how well it was interwoven into the plot.<br/><br/>Upon watching it a second time I noticed all the subtle hints that were placed throughout the movie. That is another quality of Shutter Island that I admire; it's re-watchability. After you know what Leonardo DiCaprio is, it makes the second viewing an entirely different and highly enjoyable experience. You can find all the things you missed the first time and understand all the things that seemed vague and confusing when you didn't know where it was going. <br/><br/>The only real gripe I have would be that Scorsese never really captures true emotion here. The scenes that are supposed to resonate don't really pull you in like they should, specifically the scene by the lake with his wife and kids. Not to say that you don't care about the characters just that it misses the mark somewhat in the drama department. <br/><br/>Shutter Island is a very underrated movie and ranks with some of Scorsese's best. His trip into suspense/mystery actually works very well and he captures a tone that I've never seen before. Somewhere between horror and suspense he finds a gray area that gives Shutter Island a feeling all it's own. Certainly worth watching and re-watching again and again."

","Martin Scorsese returns to film making after winning the academy award for The Departed with his fav star Leonardo DiCaprio.. This time he move to a completely different script which keeps the audience humored and thrilled from the first scene till the last!

The supremely talented actor has once again showed that why Martin casts him in his every movie as he is simply superb! He not only fits into the role smoothly but delivers a terrific performance every time! Sir Kingsley being the head psychiatrist of the asylum has also done a marvelous job!<br/><br/>The film is full of flashbacks and haunting dream sequences that range in location from the island itself to the concentration camp at Dachau. The audience is constantly trapped in a world where one questions what is reality and what is dream. Don't miss this one!"
"blackmambamark","8","128","222","16 February 2010"," Once again, Scorsese has helped redefine a genre'
","Sure everyone knows the typical Scorsese film. Normally there is a mob present, or in most cases, a tough brute who loves to flash the ""F"" bomb in almost every sentence. But what about a thriller? I mean sure, we have seen it in ""Cape Fear"", probably one of my personal favorite remakes. But what about a top notch mind bending thriller that really makes you think. Something the likes of which we have never seen Mr. Scorsese do. But given his previous works of art, its really hard to doubt that he cannot pull this off.<br/><br/>Grasping the concept of this movie is a no brainer. There is a mystery on this island filled with crazy people, but you can tell that there is a lot more under the surface. Yeah, it doesn't sound that original........but my oh my, you just wait until Scorsese begins to pick at your brain. Not since ""Taxi Driver"" have i seen Scorsese really make a valiant attempt at a character study of someone going insane. In ""Taxi Driver"", its like your in the back seat......watching as Robert Deniro slowing progresses into his insanity. With Shutter Island, its like your inside the mind of Dicaprio, and everything is starting to crumble. Scorsese really does a fantastic job of toying with your mind. You cannot help but second guess everything your thinking, but then again, i think that was the ultimate goal.......and yes, that was hint towards the end, which i think will raise a lot of debate. Now i always hear the phrase ""Twist and Turns"" when someone describes a decent thriller. Then i see the movie, and i say to myself........""That was a Twist and Turn? It felt more like a road bump."" But in this case, Scorsese really does re-define the term. Because in this film, you really have a hard time judging what is actually real, and what is not.......and what you think is happening, is actually not happening at all..........that is a twist and turn people. Not you finally figuring out who the masked killer is at the end.......okay, im sorry that all thriller movies are not like a Scooby Doo episode. <br/><br/>And since we are on the subject of crappy thrillers......i am so glad that Scorsese chose not to use elevated music in some of scenes. For example, someone jump out of a dark corner......in most cases, the music is raised and the audience jumps.......but in this movie, Scorsese doesn't add any music at all......he just uses the fear of an eerie set to make your skin crawl. Much like an old Hitchcock movie. However, there is music in this, and let me tell you, it is so very fitting. You can tell Scorsese has been down this path before, so he sort of used the same style that he did in ""Cape Fear"", with Benard Herman's deep, dark, and haunting tones that just pull you in more and more. Honestly, there is not one bad aspect of this movie. The acting, the directing, the score, the cinematography.....all pieced together with one hell of a script.<br/><br/>Bottom Line........people, this is what a thriller is suppose to be. Especially a psychological thriller. I thank god for directors like Scorsese.....because this movie really isn't his type of film. My guess is he saw enough crap in this genre' and had enough.......so he threw his hat into the ring and gave a rebirth to the classic Hithcock type thriller.......not only that, i really think that he redefined it in a way. Now i know that it is really early in the year, but i can easily see this movie staying in my top 10 of this year. Absolutely fantastic film, best i have seen so far."
"Irishchatter","9","10","13","29 December 2015"," A fantastic film with DiCapro
","I thought this film was fantastic, i wouldn't call it scary or easily frightening, I would call it a mystery thriller masterpiece. As usual with Leonardo DiCapro, he was always excellent at playing the right roles. Gee, he had to play two characters - Ted and Andrew which could make you confused to which one is he really acting as. That must be really challenging but i say Leonardo is well able to do any role at the same time!<br/><br/>I liked the fact this was based on a mental asylum on an island because it just gives you the curious feeling of what will happen next. You really don't to skip a minute or two to not see the full movie since you just gotta find out what really is going on. Although be warned, you will just get one jump-scare. Its the scene where Andrew shot his wife after she killed their three children and you wouldn't have expected it since it was so fast!<br/><br/>This is a really great masterpiece of DiCapro's work, I give this movie 9/10 :)"
"brahmjeetsinghnagpal","10","8","10","17 October 2019"," THE BEST PSYCHOLOGICAL THRILLER
","'Shutter Island' is perhaps one of the best, if not the best, movies ever directed by Martin Scorsese. One cannot comprehend the experience in one-go. You will have to watch it twice or thrice to understand it enough, which is why Scorsese himself said back in 2010 that the movie would earn double profits because of people going to watch the movie twice.<br/><br/>The movie stars Leonardo DiCaprio, Mark Ruffalo, Ben Kingsley and Max Von Sydow. They have, without doubt, given an excellent performance. And since it is directed by Martin Scorsese, you will of course be appealed by the cinematography and direction. But what's the most striking feature of this movie, the thing that makes this movie a real success is it's plot. The movie is an adaptation of the 2003 novel 'Shutter Island' by Dennis Lehane. The first half of the movie is calm and steady, but it is only a setting up for the terrific, unexpected ending which is absolutely shocking and jaw-dropping. There are several clues and intentional continuing errors that foreshadow the twist ending. The film is also filled with anagrams reminding me of which, did you know that the title 'Shutter Island' is actually an anagram for 'Truth and Lies'.<br/><br/>The background score is also amazing, especially the one by Gustav Mahler. The background score maintains the rythm of the movie.<br/><br/>There is only one inclusion by Martin Scorsese in the film which was not originally in the novel, the dialogue ""Which would be worse - to live as a monster, or to die as a good man?"", which happens to be one of the most famous quotes in cinema.<br/><br/>Overall, 'Shutter Island' is completely watchable and enjoyable. There is a lot to learn in this film while it intensifies you. Personally for me, it is the best psychological thriller."
"davidhusainow","9","8","10","10 February 2016"," The beautiful film
","This is my first film directed by Martin Scorsese. And I am amazed at the script, the actors play, storyline. Undoubtedly, this is one of the best movies I have ever watched. Why I was interested in?<br/><br/>Firstly, it is the atmosphere of the film. 1954. Many people watch films like this because they want to plunge into the atmosphere of antiquity. So, the spirit of antiquity is shown dynamically. Since the beginning of the film the contrast between the island and the outside world emphasize very clearly. And when the story starts to develop in a bad condition for Marshall, you begin to understand the hopelessness of the situation - and this ending seems really confusing and intriguing.<br/><br/>Secondly, it is an actor's game. DiCaprio. And that's all. Wonderful play, emotions, story comprehension. Mark Ruffalo is able to create a perfect image of partner. I especially want to mention the scene in the room when Rachel called her husband Marshall.<br/><br/>Thirdly, it is a plot. In my opinion, the further the film, the more puzzles which keep us in the entire movie screen. And all of the solution - at the end, though all at once. The plot is the most important. That's why you must to see the movie. You never know what it will end.<br/><br/>Fourth, this is the place. The island with all its old buildings is perfectly suited to the scenario. Weather, fortress, mysterious hundreds of rats, ominous cliff ferry with shackles and horror picture, lighthouse are created for the brilliant creations Scorsese. I was surprised by the memories of the main hero. Camp Dachau, wind, dead bodies, burning by hate DiCaprio or the burning house with his wife. Everything is shown to stop the viewer's heart. I recommend this film."
"politically_incorrect204","6","168","326","20 February 2010"," Disappointing Ending
","I hate to say this as much anyone else but for me this film had a horribly disappoint ending. First before I delve into that I'd like to say that the acting, the writing, the shooting, the film in general as far as quality goes was very good. But the ending was very disappointing. And no I am no idiot or newbie when it comes to film. But I thought the was very much a cop out. Now granted I know this is based off of a novel, hence there are certain restraints to adhering to this novel somewhat. That being said I found the idea of the medical experimentation, mental hospital, nazi experiments, and astray patients much more tantalizing, realistic, and more full of potential. The trick ending where its all in someone's head is done far too often sadly. I was hoping that while it dragged one there at the end it would ultimately reveal he was playing them or that he would stay true and not give in. But that didn't happen. I guess for me I was just expecting something not so cliché for an ending from the likes of Scorsese's genius mind. But all things said and done I definitely can't give this movie all negative remarks, wonderfully acted and scripted. Great atmosphere, shooting, photography, etc. But I feel the ending should have been less cliché or not as cheap I guess. Felt like it was just an easy way out and not fully developing the tension and intrigue that they had built throughout. But either way its each to their own, so maybe you will appreciate the ending more than I. FYI - I do understand the undertones of the ending and the ambiguity, but I don't think that saves the ending or does the film justice in it's entirety."
"meftsimmons","1","298","595","21 February 2010"," The Cabinet of Dr. Shutter Island - spoiler alert
","First, I know many who read this will not take the time to research what I'm saying to see that it is true and further, many won't have the ability to see it even if they did. So, I know this review will be thumbed down by those who don't like the hard truths in life but this movie (or should I say novel by Dennis Lehane) was a nice piece of plagiarism based upon a 1920 silent film called The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari.<br/><br/>The same basic plot exists in both as well as the exact same twist ending. The lead character investigates an insane asylum and tries to put clues together to figure out the mystery surrounding the place but as we near the end, we learn that the lead character isn't there to investigate anything. He's an inmate there who has invented much of what he was investigating as part of his coping mechanism.<br/><br/>Shutter Island would have been a good movie if it hadn't ripped off The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari so blatantly. Lehane obviously knew that the old movie was in the public domain but instead of telling the viewers that it was based on that movie, they just pass it off as his (and/or Scorseesi's idea). That, my friends, is the definition of plagiarism.<br/><br/>I don't recommend this whatsoever for this reason. It is a shame and Lehane should be called on it but who will do it? Too much $ to be made reheating the old dishes and calling them made from scratch.<br/><br/>Watch The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (it's on y o u t u b e if you want to compare the two and see that what I'm saying is 100% correct).<br/><br/>I almost never write reviews but this time, I had to."
"gregeichelberger","4","236","469","24 February 2010"," Scorsese throws a curve ball; audience strikes out
","Last year, I lamented the fact that Martin Scorsese's long-await psychological thriller ""Shutter Island"" was relegated to the dead movie month of February, especially when it was receiving serious Oscar buzz at the time.<br/><br/>Rumors floated about that the studio and Scorsese had come to a rift, that Marty wanted too much money, that he was being punished for being the most arrogant yet most talented director in the biz. Yep, as these stories flew, I sided 100 percent with Scorsese and felt he was being persecuted - once again.<br/><br/>Then I saw ""Shutter Island."" Now I know what the fuss wasn't all about.<br/><br/>If ever a motion picture needed to be seen in February this is it. As difficult to watch as it is to review, ""Shutter Island"" is a psychotropic mish-mash of ""Shawshank Redemption"" meets ""Vertigo"" meets ""The Sixth Sense"" meets ""Inglourious Basterds"" meets ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,"" all neatly wrapped up as an ode to Alfred Hitchcock but coming off as simply a nod to Brian DePalma.<br/><br/>Littered with weird visions, wild hallucinations, back-breaking plot twists and - unfortunately - scene after scene of dead children, this movie laps itself in confusion and covers itself with a thick layer of obfuscation leaving one shaking one's head and wondering just what the point of the entire enterprise was.<br/><br/>Now, no doubt, those who love this film will toss about accusations of the stupidity of this scribbler, that he has no clue about the nuances of the Dennis Lehane novel from which it came; or the depth of the emotional screenplay adaptation by Laeta Kalogridis (whose last major screenplay was the wonderful, historically-accurate ""Pathfinder"").<br/><br/>That being written, to me, this movie had so much potential - all of which was smashed to bits by heavy-handed direction, a punch-in-the-face musical score, dead-end plot lines and a mystery that Nancy Drew herself would have found far too easy to solve. Then, after the endless maze of twists and turns we're forced go through, the movie takes a lame swipe at McCarthyism - where was Charlie McCarthy when I needed him? <br/><br/>It's 1954 and U.S. Marshal Teddy Daniels and his new partner, Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo, ""Where the Wild Things Are"") arrive at a creepy federal asylum for the criminally insane off the coast of Massachuttes. Evidently, a young woman prisoner - who drowned her three children - escaped and they have been called in to investigate.<br/><br/>I write ""evidently"" because nothing is as it seems in this picture, but one will get used to that. Treated as intruders by the bellowing guards and like idiots by the high-toned doctors (Ben Kingsley and Max Von Sydow), the two marshals carry on their investigation, even though a ""Jurassic Park""-like hurricane is threatening to overwhelm the entire island.<br/><br/>In the meantime, Teddy is having bizarre hallucinogenic nightmares featuring his wife, Delores (Michelle Williams, Oscar nominee for ""Brokeback Mountain""), who perished in a fire set by a guy who is housed in this very facility. In these dreams, Delores keeps trying to give Teddy clues about the film, but he refuses to listen.<br/><br/>He also relates how, as a U.S. soldier liberating one of the Nazi death camps, he and others lined up German soldiers against the wall and machine-gunned them. I'm not sure why these scenes were in the movie, since they had nothing to do with the plot - then again, NOTHING in this movie had ANYTHING to do with the plot.<br/><br/>Teddy even tracks down an old college friend, George Noy (Jackie Earle Haley, Jr., ""Little Children""), now housed in the dreaded C Ward; and later meets a facility doctor hiding out in a cave raving about the Cold War, mind-control experiments and brainwashing techniques. But like everything else, these story-lines, too, come to dead ends.<br/><br/>We now not only begin to question Teddy's sanity, but our own as the film takes even more hairpin turns until arriving at the single most disappointing conclusion of any Scorsese film ever made, especially in the light of Teddy's last bold declaration, which I was hoping (against all hope) would rectify and redeem his character, as well as the film.<br/><br/>Fans of the director will no doubt appreciate this effort and I do, too, in some respects. The acting, especially DiCaprio, Williams and Kingsley, are without flaw. The newly-hot Haley, Jr. huff and puffs admirably during his two-minute screen time, Von Sydow is appropriately German and Ruffalo basically reacts to Teddy the entire time.<br/><br/>The cinematography of Robert Richardson (""Inglourious Basterds,"" ""The Aviator,"" ""Kill Bill, Volumes 1 and 2"") is always amazing, as well. His gritty, creepy, atmospheric view of the daunting Gothic castle-like structure takes on a life of its own.<br/><br/>It's a shame that Scorsese had to litter it all with dead kids, half-hearted nowhere scenes and incidental characters which turn out to mean absolutely nothing. I'm not an idiot and I don't want my films fed to me like a toddler in a high chair, but it doesn't hurt to walk away from a movie feeling one has gotten SOMETHING out of it.<br/><br/>Is that too much to ask?"

","US Marshal Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) travels to an island asylum facility for the criminally insane with his newly assigned partner Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo). Their reason for being at Ashecliff Hospital is to investigate the mysterious disappearance of murderess Rachel Solando. But Teddy has another issue to deal with at Ashecliff, namely a meeting with Andrew Laeddis (Elias Koteas), the man he believes responsible for the death of his wife (Michelle Williams). Nothing is what it seems at the facility though, and the further Teddy & Chuck investigate, the murkier the truths of Ashecliff become.<br/><br/>Directed by Martin Scorsese, Shutter Island is adapted from the best selling novel of the same name written by Dennis Lehane (""Mystic River/Gone Baby Gone""). It finds the talented director getting closer to horror than at any point in his career, it also finds him arguably over cooking his grits. Lehane's novel is a page turning lesson in thriller writing, there's no need for deep cranial thinking or fill in the blanks like musings. Scorsese has crafted a movie that, whilst both stylish and moody, is far more intricate than it needed to be.<br/><br/>From the off we saw reams of amateur reviewers dissecting the film and searching for other worldly cinematic meanings. The truth is, is that they don't exist, it is just a great story pinging with psychological twisters. Lehane himself said he felt it was a book he kind of knocked out while in his flow (he undersells himself mind). Scorsese, clearly loving the source to be sure, has crammed too much in for the film to be an across the board winner. Technically accomplished? Without doubt. Depth to the story? You bet. But the reality is that the depth isn't enough to sustain all the genre blending atmospherics that is Marty's want. One is inclined to feel that he so aware that he is treading on well worn genre ground (spot the homages to film noir, old time horror and Hitchcockian grandeur), that he's trying to steer the viewers away from the obviousness on offer. The film is further let down by the second half, where it positively crawls along, something not helped by the fact that the first hour bristles with moody excitement and a promise of clinically executed terror. Anticipation can be a real killer at times...<br/><br/>Yet as is normally the way with a professionally assembled Scorsese picture, there's still so much to enjoy and moments that ensure it will always be a divisive film in the New Yorker's cannon. The cast are mostly great, DiCaprio delivers a stunning performance, one that can only be appreciated once the story has reached the climax. Ruffalo (restrained), Ben Kingsley (shifty) & Max Von Sydow (troubling) all do what is needed and in keeping with the tone of the piece. While the girls - Emily Mortimer, Patricia Clarkson & Williams - have small but crucial parts to play.<br/><br/>Then there's the supporting characters played by some quality character actors. Koteas is joined by Jackie Earle Haley, Ted Levein & John Carroll Lynch. How many of you noticed that we here have a roll call of cinematic serial killers? Edgar Reese, Freddy Krueger, Buffalo Bill and Arthur Lee Allen! (OK, Allen was not proved but ""Zodiac"" the movie lends us to believe it was him). The music used is suitably heart pounding and Robert Richardson's photography is on the money, especially within the dimly lit Ashecliff walls (the foreboding Medfield State Hospital for location filming). The costumes also have a nice 50s look to them, our first encounter of Teddy & Chuck sees them splendidly adorned in film noir hats and coats. While Thelma Schoonmaker's editing is up to the usual tight standard.<br/><br/>It's always tricky when great directors are involved, so unsurprisingly we witnessed at the start a difference of opinion with the critics as to how good Shutter Island is? What most agreed on was that the film fluctuates in quality and should have been, given the talent behind and in front of the camera, a much better picture. There's also no getting away from the fact that if you have read the book first the impact of the ending is considerably weakened. Personally I feel Scorsese was the wrong director for this particular source, but that's me, and be that as it may, he still manages to come out of it in credit with his fans - though even if he just passed gas some of them would proclaim it as a masterpiece... 7.5/10"

","An avid movie-goer such as myself always steps into a Scorsese movie expecting benchmark cinema and why not?The man has raised the bar time and again.Having said that,Shutter Island is an exceptionally well-made movie staying true to its plot and premise throughout.But once the credits roll, deep down you will feel, that there is a fine line between ""Good"" and ""Great"" and it is that line which this movie fails to cross.<br/><br/>Scorsese has previously excelled in psychological thrillers when he gave us ""Taxi Driver"" and made Robert DeNiro a legend.Shutter Island, on the other hand is slightly different,closer to Hitchcock and the likes of ""Psycho"" and ""Silence of the Lambs"".<br/><br/>Set in Post WWII America it explores the story of U.S. Marshal Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio), who has been assigned the investigation of the disappearance of a patient on Shutter Island's Ashecliffe Hospital.He is partnered by Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo).The hospital is headed by Dr. John Cawley (Ben Kingsley), who is shown to believe in radical techniques to treat the mental patients instead of adopting the barbaric and sinister practices,namely Lobotomy, which were in practice during that era.From here, weird occurrences in and around the hospital coupled with a peek into Teddy's troubled past slowly blur the line between what's real and what's not and lead towards a gripping finale.<br/><br/>Scorsese gets most of it spot-on.The plot is tight and the casting perfect.Cinematography is top-notch creating a sense of macabre and desolation.The score too,lends to the eerie atmosphere.There are plenty of twists and turns to keep you hooked and confused till the very last piece of the jigsaw is revealed ,rendering the entire movie a worthwhile experience.The movie hits jackpot as far as the performances are concerned.DiCaprio delivers his best performance till date, and yes,I mean better than Inception.The movie revolves around him and its a stellar act from him;perfectly nuanced,subtle and yet very sharp.He portrays contrasting traits,almost contradictory;shrewd yet vulnerable;keen yet hesitant and its in the uneasy gray between black and white where he successfully manages to color himself.Ben Kingsley is a delight to watch.His persona brings to the movie a sense of haunting and foreboding which it would have otherwise lacked.The rest of the supporting cast are fine too,especially Michelle Williams, who,playing a manic depressive, delivers a short yet chilling act.<br/><br/>But then where does Shutter Island fall short?It does actually.In more ways than one.The script,though well-written, has its share of loopholes.DiCaprio's character and the reason for his insanity is never quite established.Neither do we ever come to know why his wife lost it one fine summer morning, and what exactly propelled her to committing murder.Besides, there are numerous sequences,which in hindsight seem unnecessary as their connection to the plot is never fully revealed.Especially the sequences of Teddy's dreams pertaining to his military exploits do not add much to the story except for telling us that he hallucinates about his family a lot!<br/><br/>All of that not withstanding, Shutter Island is an entertaining watch.It is fast,well-acted and well made.Its a handsome tribute to the noirish productions of the 50's and 60's and stands tall and strong among the plethora of the mediocre which we are regularly subjected to.<br/><br/>It does not disappoint.But then Scorsese never does.Does it leave you impressed?Perhaps.Amazed?Maybe. Awed? Not quite."

","Did I end up seeing a different movie than everyone else? I was shocked when I saw that Scorsese had directed this (I was unaware.) I think was by far his worst movie.<br/><br/>The story line had great potential - once you ""know"" what really happened at the end. I thought the execution of the film was poor.<br/><br/>The middle of the movie positively DRAGGED. I felt like I was watching Di Caprio and Winslet in Titanic, escaping from near death as the water rises - FIVE times in a row. I couldn't wait for the end.<br/><br/>The end of the movie was needless to say muddled, which is probably intentional. We're meant to to REALLY know what happened. Was he crazy? Was he not? Was he poisoned and committed to protect the secrets of the island? Was he really an inmate undergoing a radical therapy? I can appreciate the film noir quality of the ending. It's just by that time I didn't care.<br/><br/>There were lots of great clues along the way that don't make any sense at the time. But at the end when you look back they make sense (the blood from his wife's midsection when he's holding her ghost the first time.) And the idea behind a story like this is to make all of those clues fit the ""real"" story. Like explaining why they had to give up their guns at the gate. And why the guards were looking at them so strangely when they first arrived on the island.<br/><br/>What doesn't make sense to me is the opening sequence on the boat. Why is that part of the story? If you're going to try out this radical new theory, and you have to ""start"" Teddy off in his fantasy somewhere (where he departs from the reality of being an inmate and starts the fantasy of being a Marshal investigating the escape), then why not just have him start off on the dock (as if he just arrived.) It has to start somewhere - you can't go back indefinitely. The opening sequence just doesn't fit the ""real"" story - only the ""fantasy."" I was VERY disappointed in the execution of the film as a whole.<br/><br/>I wasn't alone either. Someone behind me muttered ""Scorsese needs a lobotomy"" as the credits rolled.<br/><br/>I couldn't help but laugh and agree."

","I read the novel so I knew the story going in, and I still got chills in several places and really was moved at how incredibly good this movie is. I won't get into the plot, because that could spoil things, but Leonardo DiCaprio investigates a missing patient/inmate in a top-secret island fortress for the criminally insane. He keeps getting frustrated as his interviews with doctors and patients raise more questions than answers. Ben Kingsley, who plays the primary doctor on the island, deserves a Supporting Actor Oscar nomination, and we will see how far the rest of the cast and movie will go into next year's awards.<br/><br/>The best comparisons for me were the Shining, for the psychological horror aspects of both movies. And a little bit of Silence of the Lambs, when the hero goes into a row of cells to talk with one of the inmates/patients. DiCaprio is good, but not up to the level of a younger Jack Nicholson, who would have been absolutely brilliant in this part when he was in his mid-thirties.<br/><br/>I am not sure if someone who hasn't read the book will be confused by some of the story... or simply be blown away at how it unfolds.<br/><br/>I have seen all of Martin Scorsese's movies and this is one of his top 5 or 6, better than Cape Fear, Aviator and the Departed but a hair below Goodfellas, Raging Bull, and Taxi Driver.<br/><br/>This is a very scary movie, the truest horror film Scorsese has ever done. I can't recommend it to my wife or otherwise squeamish viewers, there are too many terrifying moments for them to enjoy it.<br/><br/>What a great movie, I will surely see it again in the theaters. Haven't seen one twice since the Hurt Locker, and before that one it's been 10 years."

","I watched this in the cinema on a Friday night and expected a horror film because it was hyped as a horror film. Make no mistake, this is a chilling psychological thriller and I can quite see why Scorcese likes to work with Leonardo (from 'The Departed') and with Robert Richardson from the cinematography for 'Inglorious Basterds'.<br/><br/>As others have commented, Scorcese has borrowed (but not stolen) from Hitchcock suspense movies and the scary flashbacks remind us of the recent 'Inglorious Basterds' and at times 'Cape Fear'.<br/><br/>There is nothing to laugh or cry about in this movie and there are no really gory scenes, though some scenes (as in Pans Labrynth) I question whether I can expose my 11 year old Son to see.<br/><br/>This is a challenging and intelligent movie although for the first 40 minutes or so, I do wonder if I am watching a comedy as Leonardo as (Teddy) spars with Ben Kingsley (as Dr Cawley) in the 'why am I really here?' stakes.<br/><br/>The film also reminded me 'a touch' of Michael Douglas in'The Game' where you are never sure what is reality and fantasy. As a movie goer, we have the right to expect the unexpected and we got it for sure in this movie.<br/><br/>I am not a Scorcese fan and as much as I like the movie overall, I understand why it is not suitable for Oscar nomination.<br/><br/>I like the ending of the movie personally and I have never read the book. Hands up who has read every book for every movie out at the moment? The final scene between Leonardo (as Teddy) and his Partner Chuck linked with the opening scene on the boat perhaps tells the story we want to know while puzzling throughout on everything which happens in between.<br/><br/>Yes definitely see this movie but no need to take the tissues for this one or hide behind any bedsheets if watching on DVD. Absorbing, interesting and one to reflect upon afterwards."

","The premise of SHUTTER ISLAND was fresh and original...the first dozen or times it was utilized in a story.<br/><br/>MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD.<br/><br/>BE WARNED.<br/><br/>The idea that the main character is really a patient at the mental hospital, not a federal marshal investigating a disappearance there, has been done countless times. Very early in the narrative I figured out that the story was being told from inside Teddy's mind and kept waiting for some reason that this much money was being spent and this talented a group of people working so hard to tell this story. There must be some other twist coming that will make this worthwhile.<br/><br/>Nope. It just gets worse and worse, and sillier and sillier.<br/><br/>This would provide great material for Mystery Science Theater 3000. Tonight people all over the theater were laughing out loud, and not at any points that were supposed to be funny.<br/><br/>The screenplay, to be generous, stinks. Fine actors read dialog that is as stilted as can be. The musical score is equally bad, with shuddering, ominous strings underlying scenes and trying valiantly to drown out the awful lines those poor actors were forced to say.<br/><br/>Because the story is being told through the eyes of an insane characters, the continuity lapses are understandable. A hurricane blows over the island, causing considerable damage. For whatever reason, though, the storm is selective. Huge trees are uprooted in some places but in other places there is no visible damage at all.<br/><br/>In one scene near the end Teddy wakes up to find three supporting characters standing around his bed. It brought to mind the scene at the end of THE WIZARD OF OZ when Dorothy wakes up to find her friends have been watching over her while she sleeps. Did Scorsese not realize the similarity? There was one fascinating mystery that I hoped would be explained but wasn't. Teddy makes his way to a lighthouse and runs up the stairs to find one of the doctors from the mental hospital in a office.<br/><br/>OK. It's a lighthouse. There's a spiral staircase running through the middle of it. How in the world did the doctor manage to get a desk, chairs, file cabinet, lamps, etc., three stories up a spiral staircase? And why? I'd ask the same question of Scorsese. You and some brilliant actors made this turd.<br/><br/>Why?"

","Spoilers ahead, although not really, since none of the movie you watch will be relevant to the ending.<br/><br/>Let's break it down simply. The whole movie is a two hour long, twilight zone style ""and then he woke up."" Everything you watch, all of the characters, all of the story, mean nothing. They are erased at the ending when the protagonist ""comes to"" and realizes that he's just a murderer. But keep in mind, this isn't any normal crime. It is at once as cliché and as over the top as possible.<br/><br/>In the meantime, heir director made no attempt to do any serious research into psychology at all, even its history. At the end you're watching a literal, rational, ""bargain"" being made between the psychologists and the protagonist, despite the fact that at the outset of the film they point out that the insane are not so easily ""reasoned"" with, that they don't respond to stimuli in ""rational"" ways.<br/><br/>In short, the whole movie is a textbook case of failure in the art of story telling. I wish I could be less harsh, but I've been reading IMDb for years now, and this was the first time I felt the need to register to expose a film. If you really liked this film, then you don't understand story telling at all, and you have no taste. You can whine about it all being a matter of opinion if you want, but a story that in its climax obliterates the hour and a half you took to get there is no story at all."

","I usually have nothing against being influenced by a movie if it appeals to me and has a good story. Shutter Island did neither for me.<br/><br/>The music in the opening scene is trying way too hard to create an eerie feeling that Shutter Island is a place of evil. And the music reminded me of Cape Fear. But Shutter Island is far far from the greatness of Cape Fear which is Scorses all time masterpiece in my opinion. This however is his worst movie.<br/><br/>It is not DiCaprio's fault, but the horrible deeply flawed screenplay.<br/><br/>* SPOILER AHEAD * I would have liked to have Leo's character not been insane and developed an alternative reality in order to protect himself from the memory of his drowned children and the wife that he shot.<br/><br/>If the movie had been about him coming to find a missing patient and expose Ben Kingsley and the other doctors as vicious attackers of patients, then it had perhaps been a good movie.<br/><br/>Teddy's memories of WWII is also just boring and have no great importance to the plot. Yes I know that the dead girl in wagons represent his daughter that he could not save. But it's damn uninteresting.<br/><br/>The plot does not make much sense either. Leo is really a patient himself on Shutter Island, and to get him to accept his past, all physicians, psychiatrists, prison guards and patients are acting to support his idea of reality. How likely is it that doctors could get criminally insane to help in this way? It would not be feasible. They are all just as crazy as Teddy. If not more.<br/><br/>How likely is it that a German doctor could get Teddy to wake up when Teddy, because of his past as a soldier, hates Germans and basically sees him as a Nazi? They offer Teddy alcohol. It would probably just be tea they had given him had he said yes but he would probably have noticed it. And then what would they have done? <br/><br/>If the goal is to get Teddy to accept his past and that he is patient, why are the doctors then doing everything they can to act suspicious and untrustworthy? <br/><br/>What if Teddy had bolted when he was aboard the ferry with his partner/psychiatrist? It could not have been prevented.<br/><br/>How likely is it that the U.S. Marshalls are told to hand over their weapons when they are searching for a missing patient in a prison/institution for the criminally insane?<br/><br/>Teddy's gun is a toy gun. How likely is it that Teddy does not until the very end discovers that it is made of plastic, not metal and wood? Especially when he is suppose to be extremely intelligent.<br/><br/>On the whole, they let a seemingly very dangerous patient walk freely around the island for several days. They let him blow up a car and knock a guard out. They would never let it come so far in reality.<br/><br/>What is the meaning of it all? Why put the whole circus together due to one mental patient? Why feed on his delusions, if the goal is to make him accept his past? Why is he more interesting than all the other patients? Why don't they just talk to him and give him medicine that prevents him to invent an alternative reality? Yes it is 1954 and yes the time they knew not what we know today and yes they would probably give him a lobotomy as it is indicated they will at the end of the movie. But still.<br/><br/>There is so much that does not make sense in the movie and when it itself is so cliché-filled, I really can not take it seriously."
"Richard-Nathan","1","91","189","3 March 2010"," A Horrible Movie
","This review contains major spoilers. Please do not read any further if you have not yet seen this film and you have any interest in seeing the film at any time in the future.<br/><br/>This film makes no damned sense, unless the point of the film is supposed to be that the people running the insane asylum are more insane than the inmates.<br/><br/>For this film to make any sense, you have to accept the premise that psychiatrists who actually care about a mentally ill patient would try to cure such patient by doing things that would drive a sane person crazy; that they would play cruel head games that encourage delusional beliefs. How can any sane person believe that giving Teddy/Andrew evidence to support his delusions is going to cure him of delusions? In fact, as the film progresses, we see Teddy/Andrew getting more deluded, more paranoid, more violent. The role-playing is clearly counter-productive. <br/><br/>Giving Teddy/Andrew reasons to believe his delusions would not cure him. This is proved by the fact that there are numerous people on the IMDb boards who believe Teddy was sane all along, throughout the film. If the role-playing can't even convince these viewers of the truth, how is it supposed to convince Teddy/Andrew?<br/><br/>And for this film to make any sense, you also have to believe that these same doctors would give a startling degree of freedom to one of the asylum's most violent killers. Andrew/Teddy attacks a patient and knocks out a guard. He blows up a car, for goodness sake! That alone should prove it was insane to give him any freedom to wander alone, even for a short time. <br/><br/>The movie was set up as a mystery - what is the secret of Shutter Island? But the resolution (that Teddy/Andrew was insane all along, and the doctors were pretending to be evil because they thought that would cure him of his delusions) makes no sense. There is nothing worse than a mystery where the solution breaks all rules of logic. It reminds me of the following joke:<br/><br/>Dennis Lehane: What is furry, has four legs, purrs, and reads the newspaper every day? Richard Nathan: I don't know. Dennis Lehane: A cat. I lied about the newspaper.<br/><br/>I thought that joke was annoying the first time I heard it, and it's annoying as the basis of the mystery in ""Shutter Island.""<br/><br/>Furthermore, the resolution is not the result of any actions taken by the protagonist. The role-playing game doesn't lead Teddy/Andrew to discover the truth himself. He is merely a passive listener as the solution is explained to him. The breaks several major rules of screen writing.<br/><br/>And what about the very end? Most people interpret Teddy/Andrew's last line as meaning Andrew is only faking his regression, so that he can get a lobotomy and avoid facing the truth. But if he were faking it, why would he give this away to the doctor playing Chuck? And why are so many people moved by this act of cowardice? Can there be anything more cowardly than someone choosing to get a lobotomy to avoid facing the truth about himself? Are we supposed to empathize with someone who chooses to destroy his own intellect because he doesn't have the guts to face the truth? <br/><br/>I cannot understand how anyone can think this is an intelligent screenplay."

","From the first note of the score, to the last shot on the screen I was completely enthralled by Martin Scorsese's latest Picture. Shutter Island, the story of two federal marshals investigating a patient escape at a maximum security hospital for the criminally insane, is very simply put: an experience. Shutter Island works because it pulls at all different emotions. An audience is both humored, and on the edge of tears; jumping out of their seat, and sinking deep within it. For 2 hours and 18 minutes, one is completely submerged into a Gothic, noir like world that is intriguing and horrifying at the same time. <br/><br/>Shutter Island is definitely under the genre of thriller, but it is much more than just this. Sir Kingsley said it beautifully the next day at a press conference I attended: ""Though it looks like a thriller, the glue that holds it together is varying levels of tenderness."" The characters are enthralling and real, whether it be the protagonist, Teddy (DiCaprio) or Dr. Cawley, the head psychiatrist of the asylum (Sir Kingsley). From the opening shot to the final scene, the audience is left guessing to the mysteries of this island and its patients, being thrown into a world that is extremely claustrophobic without being tightly spaced. This feeling, and the success of the island's atmosphere, can be credited in many ways to the film's iconic director, Martin Scorsese. <br/><br/>Fresh off his first Oscar ever for Best Director in The Departed, Scorsese takes things to a different gear in Shutter Island. While The Departed was a modern day mob thriller, Shutter Island is set in the 1950's, post WWII and at the start of the Cold War and McCarthyism Era. Paranoia is at an all-time high, many people are on edge, and this story is not only set during this time period, but on a secluded, Gothic island with only one way to leave and at the start of a terrible hurricane. If that doesn't excite an audience, it should simply be Scorsese's style. The film is full of flashbacks and haunting dream sequences that range in location from the island itself to the concentration camp at Dachau. The audience is constantly trapped in a world where one questions what is reality and what is dream. This is already interesting on paper, as seen in the critic's praise of Dennis Lehane's novel which the film is adapted from, but Scorsese absolutely blows the audience out of the water with the visuals; frightening images of pain and anguish, terrifying fears and paranoia, and jarring cuts and sequences that leave the viewer as haunted as the characters themselves. Scorsese truly rolls up his sleeves and produces a powerfully intense film that shakes the viewer until the very end.<br/><br/>Aside from the amazing direction, the acting performances in this film were quite moving as well. Dicaprio, Mark Ruffalo, Sir Ben Kingsley, Michelle Williams, and Emily Mortimer were brilliant in their roles and (with the help of a masterful director's skill) took Shutter Island to a terrifyingly beautiful place that keeps us wanting more and more. From every beautiful crane shot, to each close up, Shutter Island is the latest tour de force in an already astonishing resume for Martin Scorsese. No one ever escapes Shutter Island unscathed, but if you can handle its pure power, it truly is a fantastic cinematic experience."

It was so boring! The scenes were choppy and redundant.

","Martin Scorsese is in my opinion the greatest living movie maker . He started off during the New Hollywood era in the late 1960s and is described as a "" movie brat "" , a film maker who was brought up on a fine diet of cinema during his formative years and it shows . He is very much an aficionado of cinema and this in depth knowledge shows in SHUTTER ISLAND <br/><br/>The story itself is somewhat similar to the works of Val Lewton and Scorsese shows his influences and he builds upon the tension . He's on record as saying he's been a big fan of British cinema and anyone who remembers the opening shot of ALICE DOESN'T LIVE HERE ANYMORE will have noticed a similarity to the great British director Michael Powell . Throughout the running time the cinematography emulates the glorious rich and lurid look of a Powell film whilst Scorsese adds grotesque imagery of his own . Even if you're not overwhelmed by the story there';s still much to admire about the movie <br/><br/>!!!!! SUGGESTIVE SPOILERS !!!!!<br/><br/>Alas the problem with the movie is that it's constructed around a plot involving a twist ending . Scorsese has never been a director who makes plot driven movies , he makes character driven ones but the faults of the film are down to either screenwriter Laeta Kalogridis or even the original source novel by Dennis Lehane . There's two ways the film will end . One that is similar to SHOCK CORRIDOR - the One I was hoping for - or the one we did get which was the one I hoped we wouldn't get . Scorsese deliberately uses unrealistic mis-en-scene on occasions that shows where the movie is heading but even if he didn't you'll still manage to work things out for yourself There is a telling question the film poses at the end if it's better to live as a monster or to die as a good man ? but this isn't enough to rescue the pay off . Worse still the screenplay has an overlong sequence where the plot is spoon-fed to the audience as if they've been in a coma for two hours . INCEPTION is another film that felt the need to explain its plot mechanics . One worries that in the future we'll be seeing a film directed by Michael Bay where characters have to explain what explosions and loud noises are <br/><br/>All in all SHUTTER ISLAND is something of a disappointment as has much of the director's work in the 21st Century . Movies like THE AVIATOR do improve on second viewing since they're character driven . The problem with having a high concept plot is that once the cat is let out of the bag it stays out of the bag . That said it is remains a highly impressive film on a visual level and posing the question of "" Is it better to die as a good man than live as a monster ? "" is consistent in keeping with Scorsese's running theme of existentialist angst in most of his work ."

","Oooo! it's Scorsese! and The Caprio, and Ben ""Gandhi"" Kingsley. Let's start the praise, the ""masterpiece litany""!!!! The film is presented this way (the quote is from a review at IMDb's): SHUTTER ISLAND is the story of two U.S. marshals, Teddy Daniels and Chuck Aule, who are summoned to a remote and barren island off the coast of Massachusetts to investigate the mysterious disappearance of a murderess from the island's fortress-like hospital for the criminally insane. Try now to believe it. As the aim of the movie is to deny what you have just read. So what's the point? I can introduce Alice in wonderland like ""it is the story of a Chinese manufacturer who is hired by a mysterious underground tea dealer. Eventually she has to confront the mischievous queen of Tibet to defend a bunch of rabbits"". Shutter Island is a bad movie. Everything is built on a ""twist"" which is clear since the very beginning. In-depth explanation involving fire and water dichotomy (some review at IMDb's) must come from patient 64. There are a couple of nice shots (nice doesn't necessarily mean ""beautiful""), but there are a lot of flaws in the ""story"", boring clichés, incongruences, unexplainable behaviour even for an asylum... and the more you try to sum up things, the worst it looks."

Teaming up with Leo instead of keeping the franchise going with De Niro (OK, he's old but he can still act) was a major mistake. Gangs of NY? A snoozer except for Bill the Butcher; the Departed, overrated, now this turkey.<br/><br/>My wife and I were laughing out loud at Marty's lame attempts to emulate the master, Alfred Hitchcock, at trying to ramp up the tension. It was embarrassing -- spiral staircases, gleaming knife, rocky cliffs, ad nauseum -- never once creating a genuinely believable moment. It was as though a modern artist was trying to repaint the Mona Lisa. This was all by-the-numbers.<br/><br/>A few minutes into the movie, we need Teddy was nuts and hallucinating, and yet we had to endure two hours of sordid flashbacks, dead concentration camp kids, a dead wife who keeps reappearing throughout the movie saying the same thing over and over, and the usually overacting of De Caprio, who can't seem to utter a line without making a face of some sort. All I can remember is his dancing eyebrows and histrionics through a fake boston accident.<br/><br/>Leo would have been a bit player in One flew over the Cuckoo's Nest, but here he is the big star that somehow the entire island devotes 2 years, entire staff as well, trying to ""cure"" him of his insanity only to resort to lobotomy in the end. Now that's realistic. Certainly, asylums spent two years on each patient trying to reconstruct their personalities by everyone playing a different role to accommodate the needs of the nutcase. It would have been a lot easier to lock him in a padded cell and be done with it, but then there would have been no movie.<br/><br/>Mr. Hitchcock, if he could, would roll over in his grave at this blatant and failed attempt at honorifics.

It's standard stuff for the first 45 minutes or so, with the usual attempt to make the criminally insane look scary. Mood is everything here, but as the movies have been down this path so many times, and as-in my case-I know that the insane are not particularly scary, it's a question of wondering why Scorsese is going down this trite path.<br/><br/>When he shifts the plot to a ""conspiracy"" plot it gets even triter. And then it shifts ponderously to a ""fooled you"" ending. The story tries to confuse with it's shifts, but underneath it all it's all sturm and very little drang. When the ultimate plot line is revealed it's a big let down. It's ""spellbound"" rehashed.<br/><br/>The big problems for me were that it continues to trot out the usual myths about mental illness; it's symptoms, it's causes, and it's cures."

It was a psychological drama without any psychological depth. Leo was again cast in a role that was not right for him. What was needed was someone to physically embody the emotional turmoil the character had endured. And the flashbacks only make the intelligent viewer ask the obvious question, which is, why should we care so much about this one person's troubles when all those people were killed by the Nazis (or survived with their horrible memories)? That was an idiotic thing to include in this film, totally undermining it. Scorsese tried to do way too much here. He could've tried to do a ""modern"" version of ""The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari,"" for example.

The big twist of the story is obvious from the trailer, even from the thirty second TV spot, to anyone over the age of twelve, who has seen a mental hospital movie. In case we needed some exposition Leo meets a women in a cave and he exclaims ""you're the real..."" in case we couldn't figure it out. Add in the concentration camp flash backs that would make Tarantino cringe and fifties paranoia, nothing floats. The movie looks good but Marty get your hearing checked."
"wrbones","5","32","62","28 February 2010"," Strange Film For Someone Like Scorcese
","I'll start by saying that I did enjoy this film overall but there are a lot of really annoying aspects to it. First off is DiCaprio's stubble, which in 1954 would have made him a vagrant, not a US Marshall. Then there was the ridiculous music that accompanied an inconsequential scene of the marshals entering the asylum gates for the first time. It built up and built up, then nothing happened. That kind of thing is really annoying. The score overall veered from terrific to grating and inappropriate in places. I often found it quite distracting. There were many continuity problems throughout. If it was meant to add another dimension to the film, it failed. Instead it was distracting and gave the impression that they ran out of time/budget more than anything else. The plot is largely obvious from early on. If it takes you more than 15 minutes to work out what is going on, there is something wrong with you. OK, the full extent of the revelations at the end is harder to divine before it's revealed but the thrust of it is obvious. The film was, as you'd expect, beautifully shot and the cast was pretty good, although DiCaprio's Boston accent came and went at different times. The setting was also magnificent, which added to the overall effect. As a genre film, Shutter Island doesn't work nearly as well as others. Identity comes to mind as a far better attempt at the same kind of story. It's probable that it's strength is that it is not really a genre film and will, therefore, appeal to a broader audience. However, it is definitely not one of Scorcese's best. If I had to rank it, it would sit somewhere near Bringing Out the Dead."

I scare very easily, I almost contemplated not going because I thought it was going to be so scary. So I went expecting what had been conveyed as a psychologically thriller, yet I was not thrilled at all. Even when you are expecting a cheap scare there was none. Even when you were sat there waiting for a big twist or a scream from the audience or a big thrill from this so called brilliant movie, I was not once scared, not once thrilled and not once satisfied. It could easily have ended half an hour before it did and honestly I wish it had.

"thunderfoot1812","1","60","129","23 February 2010"," Save your money -- a bomb -- Scorsese is not Hitchcock
","Summary: This is bad movie. Don't waste your time or your money on it. There was not a single convincing, or memorable, scene in the whole two-plus hours. There was not a single character to care much about. Most egregious is that this is a suspense film with almost no suspense. The movie was full of clichés -- but virtually every one of them was handled without the grace that made them clichés in the first place. The ending was predictable. The plot was stupid. The music was not the least bit memorable. On the good side? Hmmm, I suppose the cinematography was very nice, and there was a lot of technique (mostly ineffective) with the cameras. Oh, and I liked the double-basses playing the fog-horn motif.<br/><br/>In the elevator in the garage on the way back to my car, a couple was complaining about a movie they had just seen. ""What the h..l was THAT?"" ""I don't know dear. What a stupid movie."" ""I can't believe what a mess it was!"" and so on. I asked them what movie they had just seen: Shutter Island. We agreed with each other as they left the elevator: ""Hitchcock, except without anything good in it."" I will now do my best to pan this movie without producing any spoilers. However if you want to be *absolutely* certain to enjoy the ""suspense"" in all possible aspects then don't read any farther.<br/><br/>Suspense? This movie certainly falls in the category of Suspense. Except, er, the movie has almost no suspense to it. There was no rhythm to the sequencing of shots, no building of tension, no small releases. The whole movie was flat, like watching a collection of skits pasted together. Alas, despite his success with Cape Fear (which was much more literal), Scorsese just seems to have no feel at all for Hitchcock-style suspense.<br/><br/>Plot? The plot for this movie is both trite, and baroque. As narrative fiction goes it is about on the level of movies made from video games, except they don't bother to pretend. (Hey, for that matter, Silent Hill had a better plot than this movie did.) No part of this movie, not even a single one of the scenes, was believable. Most of it was just absurd. In the interest of no spoilers I have to tread lightly here. Scorsese might argue that he was trying to represent a particular plot device, but boy did THAT ever fall flat. Don't expect to make much sense, either, of the bits and pieces snatched from the real story in the original book. Plenty of scenes could have been dropped without the slightest ding to THIS mess of a plot.<br/><br/>How trite? Nazi doctors, concentration camp memories, ""mysterious"" psychiatrists, ghostly presences, all of the most hackneyed and ineffective type. Let's see: the spiral staircase from The Haunting of Hill House, the Boogey-man from Silence of the Lambs, the shower from Psycho... need I go on? And, too bad, the list of trite / iconic references here is more interesting to ponder than the actual boring manifestations of them in the movie.<br/><br/>Horror? I am not sure how, but Scorsese managed to make eerie, dripping, insane-asylum corridors not the least bit eerie or menacing, violent, criminally-insane killers on the loose not the least bit scary, or interesting, menacing psychiatrists with drugs in syringes not the least bit terrifying.<br/><br/>Character? Sorry. Not a single character was convincing or interesting. There was no chemistry between DiCaprio and Ruffalo, no sparks flying between DiCaprio and Kingsly. The great love of DiCaprio for his wife was entirely cardboard. The ooky prison-guards looked great for about five seconds and then went absolutely nowhere. What a disappointment from the guy who brought us all these rich characters in, say, Goodfellas, Cape Fear, and Taxi Driver (""Stop a car at a hundred yards -- put a bullet right through the engine block!""). The actors had nothing to work with in this movie.<br/><br/>Engagement? Hmmm. If you can't manage to involve your audience with Nazi death-camp images, and children being murdered, you've got to admit that is pretty lame. But, this bomb manages to make both of these devices and many others sterile and void of any emotion. You also don't care about the wronged do-gooders locked away in an insane asylum, the hero of the story, or his side-kick...<br/><br/>O.K., so maybe it gets two or three stars out of ten, but the hype is just too annoying for this weak effort from an excellent director.<br/><br/>This movie was just dumb. If you believe the hype and go to see it anyway before word gets around, don't say I didn't warn you."

"bob the moo","Null","9","15","23 January 2011"," Overlong but engaging b-movie psychological thriller
","When a dangerous patient/prisoner manages to escape a secure and remote mental institution, US Marshall Teddy Daniels and his partner are sent to investigate. Arriving on the island they begin their investigation but find oddity and suspicion everywhere. As their investigation stalls and is hampered by those in charge, Daniels starts to realise that not everyone is who they claim to be, and that not even he has been honest about his motivations for leading the investigation.<br/><br/>Shutter Island came and went and it got mixed reviews. My girlfriend watched it on a plane and disliked it, so it took me longer than normal to get around to watching it. What I found was a solidly enjoyable b-movie thriller which treads a familiar path but mostly keeps the viewer guessing right to the end. Those who have seen more than one film involving an investigation in a mental institution will not be surprised to learn that things are not what they seem, and the film does well to buy into this tone and embrace the rather OTT sense of reality or unreality. The soundtrack is full of heavy horns that compliment this atmosphere further. So in terms of what it is doing it all works really quite well but the problem is that it is overly long and needed to be tighter with a shorter running time. By being in excess of two hours, I was still held by it but at the same time it felt that it was a bit excessive and the longer it took to get to its destination, the more likely the audience were to be pulling at it to move faster.<br/><br/>The performances are good. DiCaprio marked quite a 2010 with this and Inception, both roles that are genre films but with which he was able to do a lot more in terms of his character's psyche. Here he keeps the mystery alive and he takes the viewer with him really well. Support is strong from Ruffalo, Sir Kingsley, Levine, Mortimer, Clarkson, Koteas and others – all playing things close to ensure that there is this air of menace and mystery maintained. Scorsese directs with excess in a good way – striking images are used and I liked the way that there are no obvious visual triggers between reality and hallucinations/memories, this works well and I enjoyed the blurring for the viewer.<br/><br/>Shutter Island is not a perfect film by any means; for what it is it is excessively long and takes too much time at the risk of the viewer getting impatient with its pace. However it does engage and it does work well with the material thanks to strong direction and performances. Well worth a look as a b-movie thriller despite the big names involved."

I'm sure there was a story in there somewhere. A story that has been done a million times over and much, much better.<br/><br/>It is impossible to cite specific instances of guffaw-inducing movie-making in Shutter Island--because it was so darn awful THROUGHOUT! The first clue was that inane pounding, silent-film-organ-like music that introduced every scene you in which you were supposed to scream--and not laugh hysterically. If they had cut out all that flashback nonsense, which of course I am sure Scorcese thought was so wonderfully 'artistic', they could have got the film down to about 90 minutes and could have had, well, certainly not a GOOD movie but one that was definitely not as awful as what was produced. Reminded me a lot of Gangs of New York, which also started out very strong but then went on for 100 hours. At least that was an interesting subject and prompted me to buy the book it was based on and read it. I certainly don't feel that way about Shutter Island. And did I see the same movie as the positive reviewers saw? <br/><br/>There's 2-1/2 hours of my life I'll never get back."
"WillWesley","8","20","40","25 February 2010"," Shutter Island - Intrigue and Assumption
","Shutter Island. The story starts you off with a strong suspense of something really wrong in the so called island. It then develops a very subtle intrigue to the story, which keeps us assuming and guessing repeatedly on what the actual truth is. When the story progresses, just when you've received the pieces of the puzzle to actually delve the story, you then realize that you've been working on the right pieces, but in the wrong puzzle.<br/><br/>The acting was very good and well coordinated. You could feel the dramatization of the characters and subtle elements that will keep your mind moving. They also arranged the sound well, with a simple yet chilling heavy bass orchestra to psyche up the moment, and at the same time complete silence to pique in your senses. I was a bit disappointed with some parts of the editing, but these small bricks didn't affect any major enjoyment of the movie.<br/><br/>This movie should be watched with great attention to detail, to give yourself a satisfying outcome once all the mysteries unwind itself, leaving you with a repeating portrait of the story in your mind."

","A 1950s ward for the criminally insane isn't a pleasantry for anyone. The terror behind the walls has a mystique to the public. It's as though unspeakable acts of torture can exist within the confines of padded rooms so long as the public never witnesses first hand. The isolation, or in the case of Martin Scorsese's Shutter Island the possibility of it, could be enough to drive you insane.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio stars as U.S. Marshal Teddy Daniels. Having met up with new partner Chuck (Mark Ruffalo), he's on assignment to investigate the disappearance of Rachel (Emily Mortimer) from the secluded mental hospital on Shutter Island. During his visit, Teddy is plagued by vivid recollections of his days as a soldier liberating a Nazi death camp and visions of Delores, his deceased wife (Michelle Williams). These tie in with Teddy's ulterior motives: investigating rumored inhuman experiments and locating his wife's murderer.<br/><br/>I didn't read the book; get used to it. I watch movies and I review them on their own merit. I'm not one to bicker about the source material being wronged when I know full well that a book typically contains an unfilmable heap of situations that need to be whittled down into entertainment in a convenient sub-three hour block. I care about the movie, and in the case of Shutter Island I speculate that fans of the book will have a far different experience since they should have a very solid notion of what happens. For me, someone new to the material, Shutter Island is captivating.<br/><br/>When it comes to the plot there is a ton that I'd like to discuss, but can't simply because this is a puzzle film and I don't want to ruin it's intricately woven pattern of suspense. I'll say that some elements are very familiar, but that doesn't stop it from being a shocker. Elsewhere I can say that it's a well-crafted film on technical levels. The visions of the dead wife are often complemented with CGI that's used with discretion. Cinematography is strong, showing the colors reminiscent of a similar era prison film, The Shawshank Redemption. Originally I felt that the theatrical score was beating me over the head, but it didn't take long to assist in providing atmosphere. Editing also plays a role as cuts are made in unorthodox fashion, purposely creating misaligned audio, but this pertains mostly to the dream sequences. The cast even excels as each role becomes deeper than speculated. Leo gives another powerful performance now that he's cleared the hurdle of being typecast as ""the kid"".<br/><br/>When it comes to the twisted thrillers, I prefer endings to be less blatant. With Shutter Island the longwinded conclusion spells out every last possibility. I'm not looking for something open to interpretation, but requiring more participation. There's still plenty of evidence to spot that you'd want to view it again for the details or chat with friends. As I think more about it, that's what separates the thrillers from the horrors. The thrillers make you think about outcomes, motives, and twists. Shutter Island doesn't tie itself into a knot, but it gets close. That frustration can polarize an audience, but if you've trusted in me this far then you're ahead of the game.<br/><br/>NOTE: If you are playing the Shutter Island drinking game, be sure to take a shot each and every time Mark Ruffalo says ""boss"". That's the only rule you'll need."

Surely not for long when common sense kicks in and people review it for what it is. A mess.<br/><br/>The movie really is a tram smash of ideas, styles and plotting. There's a neat twist in it but the utterly gratuitous Dachau strand to the movie is verging on the disgraceful. Parts of the film, certainly in the first half flashback to Di Capprio's experiences as an American GI liberating the Dachau concentration camp would be, you'd have thought, central to the plot. Not a bit of it. This strand hangs about meaningfully but without meaning. But that's the issue with this whole movie. It seems to want to inject meaning into a genre that really is just about entertainment. In doing so it lifts ideas from The Shining (some brilliantly), Silence of the Lambs (unconvincingly) and Hitchcock (at his worst) but they go nowhere. The cinematography flits about from the stunning, the scene in which DiCapprio and his young bride embrace during a fire is mesmerising, to the laughable - again DiCapprio is featured driving through a forest as a passenger with the Asylum's head warder in front of a blue-screened background that could have been shot in 1954 (the year the movie is set) - I suspect the latter was deliberate. If so it was another misguided idea.<br/><br/>The grading leaps about from 21st century hi-def to 1950's colour-noir and can't seem to decide what it is that it wants to be.<br/><br/>Dicapprio is unconvincing, so too Rufallo and Sir Ben Kingsley?

I don't need Scorcese to plagiarize that sensation and pretend he's doing anything new.

The previews really made things look exciting, but ten minutes into the movie and anyone could see where it was leading. DiCaprio looked twitchy and unreliable from the start, and Ruffalo's snide tone when addressing him was a dead giveaway.

"robert-temple-1","1","19","40","2 September 2010"," Playing footsie with the dark side
","Martin Scorsese should be ashamed of himself. He is such a brilliant filmmaker, and yet time after time throughout his career he has played footsie with the dark side, and supped with the devil. After all, there are all those gangster movies. What are they, if not glorifications of evil people and evil acts? Here we have Scorsese getting carried away with his own vanity and being 'ever so clever'. He has come up with an ingenious plot twist (although it is not new and has been used in various old movies), which I shall refrain from revealing because it concerns the end of the film, which one is prohibited from discussing on IMDb. But however clever Scorsese is, there is no disguising the fact that this film is dark, sinister, infinitely depressing, and a bad influence. When will vain geniuses like Scorsese exercise a little 'voluntary self-regulation', or indeed just the tiniest bit of self-control? Or are these spoilt brat genius film directors so thrilled by wallowing in their own vanity that they believe anything they do is wonderful and if we don't like it we are stupid? I say this film is bad not because it is badly made, but precisely because it is well made and thereby exerts its insidious influence all the more effectively. Somebody ought to tie Scorsese to an automatic spanking-machine which would wallop some sense back into him. But as long as he is subject to universal adulation, his vanity will swell to inhuman proportions until one day he bursts. And that day cannot be far off. Scorsese has made some wonderful films, such as KUNDUN (1997), MY VOYAGE TO ITALY (1999), and THE AVIATOR (2004). His love of music is very touching, and everyone appreciated his contribution to THE BLUES (2003). But when he tries the horror-thriller medium, as with CAPE FEAR (1991, a really terrible failure of a film, not worth reviewing) and this film, Scorsese descends to the depths of incompetence and uselessness. That is why Scorsese needs to be tied to a spanking-machine, because he is unruly and needs discipline. He needs to be kept away from these dark areas of the evil mind and restrained from manic indulgence, just as young boys used to have their hands tied up at night (see THE WHITE RIBBON) so as not to fiddle with themselves. Leonardo DiCaprio has worked with Scorsese before (superbly, in THE AVIATOR), and when offered this juicy part, where he is allowed to grit his teeth a great deal and show us how grown up he now is by leaping into action at the drop of a hat, squared-jawed and determined (the very essence, he imagines, of a cinema hero, in the hope that one day he might become Harrison Ford), he took it! No surprise! Actors and actresses accept parts! What else is new? Whether they are taking part in a wicked enterprise does not seem to occur to them, which must be why Jodie Foster agreed to do SILENCE OF THE LAMBS. So this dark film about an insane asylum on an island in Boston Harbour does not enhance the value of human existence, but rather adds to the forces of the dark side, and we gain nothing from it but a sterile titillation of the most vacuous kind. And not all the cleverness in the world can disguise the fact that this film is empty."

The term ""unsettling"" was used, and it filled me with hope as it's not a word that I've seen used very often in reviews.<br/><br/>It is an incredibly boring movie with an obvious plot twist. Although, can it really be called a ""plot twist"" when everyone and their mentally ill brother can see it coming from a mile away? DiCaprio is a patient at the hospital, there I said it, but you knew it.<br/><br/>Andrew Laeddis (DiCaprio) killed his wife because she killed their kids. He's been locked up in Ashecliff Hospital on Shutter Island. So, unable to deal with his murdering of his child drowning wife, he creates a new life (now he's named Teddy). Teddy thinks that the doctors are conducting human experiments. He also thinks that Laeddis (that jerk)is in the hospital and must find him because he believes that Laeddis killed his wife. Everyone living and working at the hospital reinforces his delusion so that he will come to accept his past. Read that last sentence again and really let it sink in. So it would seem that the hospital is conducting human experiments, or at least one really dumb one.<br/><br/>The doctors and other staff have given ""Teddy"" free time on the island. He's all over the damned place. He's scaling rock faces like he's Spider-Man. He swims through rough seas, and some how avoids all the jagged rocks, as though he were Michael Phelps. He throttles another inmate. He blows a car to smithereens.<br/><br/>The acting is really awful. The plot is on par with high school English assignments. The production is nothing to write home about either. Shame!"
"spelvini","5","20","43","20 February 2010"," Crazy Story
","There's a certain betrayal that seems to occur between filmmaker and viewer when a psychological thriller on screen is suddenly revealed to be the madness of a character. Movies that trick an audience this way always seem to guarantee a particular anger from the audience for doing so. We only want the truth but when that truth is clouded by insanity, unless we know the rules, we resent being taken for a ride, especially in a film like Shutter Island which is ostensibly a 2-hour character study.<br/><br/>When movies show us reality through a madman's eyes we are bound to follow the gnarly logic of that character, and with some actors this journey can be exciting and fascinating to experience. In Shutter Island however the character is suffering under the burden of personal psychosis and the performance of Leonardo DiCaprio doesn't fully justify the parameters of the characters' mental capabilities. Additionally there is no logical mooring for the story or character and the filmmaker must resort to increasingly shocking images to hold the viewer. This is problematic because we remain outsiders through the course of the story and are never fully able to experience viscerally the characters' needs.<br/><br/>When we see images of a frozen mother and child at Dachau we are certain that director Martin Scorsese will use these dead bodies in a later image of shock for Teddy, and sure enough the dead come alive in a dream for the disturbed character and continue throughout the rest of the film to haunt the viewer as well.<br/><br/>Like Pavlov's dog, Teddy salivates at the idea of getting back at the German nation by inflicting some sort of pain on Dr. Naehring played by Max von Sydow. As striking as many of these images are, they add up to more character definition as if the film was an excuse for the actions of this investigator played by Leo DiCaprio. What we keep wanting, after a good hour into the movie, is some real exposure of injustice that's being foisted on society and watch as Teddy puts the kibosh on those responsible and make the world a happier place.<br/><br/>The world of Martin Scorsese is a darker place. The film is a promotional film for the advances of Psychological Treatment in the 1950s, and Scorsese's aesthetic betrays his own sense of justice, and that of the public at large. There is a concerted effort by Ben Kingsley's Dr. Cawley to voice the heart of the film that good humane treatment of mental patients leads to a better society but if that is the case then why not make the movie about him, and not about a psychotic detective.<br/><br/>Novelist Dennis Lehane loves mystery. His novel ""Mystic River"" was adapted for the screen by Clint Eastwood and achieved blockbuster status due to its powerful psychological overtones. Another one of his books, ""Gone Baby Gone"" was adapted and directed by Ben Affleck as a debut directorial project in 2007 to great success. Both films have a strong connection to psychological motivation and an equally strong objective correlative that defines plot as character goal-fulfillment. Shutter Island as a twisted psychological story with the metaphorical images of insane asylum and derangement are the kinds of things that work in a textual story as a novel but do not translate ideally into a film without some compensation.<br/><br/>Martin Scorsese likes the noir allure of the story as a detective yarn better than the possible alternative, that of a life-affirming tale about advances in psychiatry. The film utilizes all the tropes of film noir- detectives in Fedoras, shadowy hallways, suspicious doctors, mental disorder, dark foreboding stormy weather, but these elements are all supports for the fractured character of Teddy Daniels, and if we identify with him we have to feel that we are controlled by our own demons as he is driven by his demons.<br/><br/>The film does have moments of humor which keep us involved in the character of Teddy Daniels, as in the way DiCaprio shows us how he is affected by the warm memory and sense of loss connected with Michelle Williams' Dolores. Especially affecting is a moment late in the movie when Daniels uses his tie to create a car bomb while apologizing to his wife's' accompanying specter about the ""ugly"" clothing accessory she had given him.<br/><br/>On the TV show ""Dallas"" that aired from 1978 to 1991 an entire season was developed around a series of events that essentially brought an end to all of the characters and the great Ewing Empire. When toward the end of the season viewers were up in arms about the complete erosion of the bond they had developed over the years with the world of JR and all the machinations of the Texas night-time drama, the last episode revealed that the preceding events had all been a bad dream of one of the characters- this allowed the producers a ""get-out-of-jail"" card after being given the death sentence by their viewing public. Shutter Island has a similar effect but no renewed season to win back all those who watch disheartened as the screen fades to black.<br/><br/>Considering the $12-dollar price tag for movie tickets in New York, this film will look better on disc with additional commentary from the director and actors- watch it then."

And frankly, I guessed at the beginning of the movie what the twist was, but would have preferred being wrong. I think it would have been a bigger twist. Max von Sydow is wasted and Ben Kingsley plays Ben Kingsley. The flashbacks/dream sequences/hallucinations are ludicrous, portentous, and pretentious. I hated this movie from beginning to end."
"dave-sturm","5","16","33","21 February 2010"," A dazzling mess
","Acting? Top notch. Cinematography? Perfect. Grotesque images? In spades. Foreboding music? You bet. Gothic atmosphere? Ooo-eee-ooo.<br/><br/>The problem here is the story and the way it is told. I had read Dennis Lehane's novel going in and knew the basic arc of the story and the big reveal at the end, but this version stuffs way too much into a relatively simple mystery story. Shutter Island could be ... THIS! Or it could be ... THAT! Or it could be ... SOME OTHER AWFUL THING! And why do we need World War II flashbacks? What do Nazis and Holocaust victims add to the story, except to give Scorcese a chance to show mournful starving Jews, a pile of bodies topped by a heartbreaking little dead girl clutching at her dead mother and an, admittedly masterful, tracking shot of Nazis being mowed down by righteous GIs. Take that, Quentin.<br/><br/>And here's a small annoyance. As the GIs enter what is clearly stated as Dachau concentration camp, which is in Germany, we see the famous arch that says, ""Arbeit macht frei"" (work sets you free). Trouble is, that arch isn't at Dachau, it's at Auschwitz, which is in Poland. Auschwitz was liberated by the Red Army. Why can't Scorcese leave well enough alone? Things are over amplified. You can't just show a Nazi commandant's office, it has to be full of blowing paper. You can't just have stormy weather, it has to be a raging hurricane. You can't just show a woman living in a cave, you have to be sure we see the canned rations and canteen of water that keep her alive. Things to marvel at, for sure, but ultimately distracting.<br/><br/>After a while, it's hard to tell when U.S. Marshal Teddy Daniels (Leo DiCaprio) is hallucinating and when he is not. In one scene, he wakes up from a bad dream and immediately begins hallucinating ... or is it more of the bad dream? Hmm. One can almost hear Scorcese say, ""Hey, let's not just blow up a car, let's put Teddy's hallucinated wife and daughter into the explosion!"" Taken together, these things cause a lot of suspense to drain out of the movie and it ends up being a gorgeously made creep-out flick."
"btacct","9","16","33","18 February 2010"," Brilliant, brilliant movie full of paranoia in Hitchcock style
","My expectations were a prison movie with US marshals on the rampage story, little knowing that it was a psychological jig-saw puzzle. Often offering horror movie and holocaust atmosphere with lashing of blood rather than logic, you enter an on-screen game that references past glories of cinema (WWII movies, horror classics, concentration camps) and throwing them at you like the ever present debris of a storm raging on the outside walls of the institution and with screams of insanity from within, the movie unravels the mystery in our minds. The movie was truly brilliant.<br/><br/>Filmed on an island off Boston (1954) during a fascinating period in history which has been mostly overlooked by film makers (end of war 1945 to 54), it shows an almost forgotten period in time, rich in costumes making you almost think everyone is dressed and ready for church or a funeral. Post-WWII, pre-Kennedy's, pre-rock'n'roll and the end of the Great American Song Book period with up tempo jazz/crooners, it was a period in history that has been left in the dormitory (or mental institution buildings of the movie) for so many years. The world was recovering from the end of WWII; the baby boomers were learning to walk or starting school; the baby boomers were 5 years from bobby socks. It was a rather sedate world that was awaiting the arrival of Rock n Roll.<br/><br/>While watching it, I was constantly thinking Hitchcock and North By North West where Cary Grant questions his sanity against the background of a story that develops on screen - also similar to Vertigo and other Hitchcock where the main character suffers paranoia. In the background, there was an ever present suspenseful sound track reminiscent of again of Hitchcock and the literal cliff hanging scene.<br/><br/>There were some truly disturbing images contrasted with absolute tenderness. In a few spots, I thought Leonardo was playing a weak role but as it works out, he is playing the character's weaknesses and flaws. For a moment, in one scene I thought he showed the facial expressions and mannerisms of a frustrated Jack Nicholson to brilliant effect.<br/><br/>Great support cast including a few look-a-likes and almost circus caricatures. A prison scene shows a character looking like Robert De Niro in ""Mary Shelley's Frankenstein"" but it is not him. The security guards and hospital staff were perfectly picked looking like main street cops and prison guards from 1950's USA. Hilarious and disturbing selection of extras as patients - they were straight from an old horror movie.<br/><br/>Mark Ruffalo plays a different part as a breakaway from his usual rom-com roles. Great to see the past masters like Max Von Sydow and Ben Kingsley. Patricia Clarkson keeps popping up in movies these days as a careworn eccentric and her old world-style glamour. She usually plays the supportive wife, mainstay or consort of a lead but here plays a gutsy character role.<br/><br/>A dazzlingly and macabre revelation was Michelle William's character (Dawson's Creek and mother of Heath Ledger's child) who was amazing as Leo's wife. A truly magnificent role for our sweet Jen Lindley: I kept looking for Dawson. Joey and Pacey; expecting to spot Jack and the baby - all grown up."

Ben Kingsley is the most entertaining cast member but mainly because he looks amused or perhaps embarrassed to be on the set of this schlock-fest. The screenplay is boring or at best laughable, mostly a stream of lame clichés with little relationship to one another or to a coherent plot line. The computer generated imagery, which makes up most of the backdrop of the film indoors and out, is so badly done it looks like a 1990s video game.<br/><br/>It is as if the director, after force feeding the audience with 100 minutes of manipulative, chaotic, badly shot and badly scripted nonsense, desperately patched together a rather simple minded 'surprise' conclusion to save his picture. Unfortunately, like the rest of this stinker, the attempt to bring things together failed pathetically.<br/><br/>Much of the action seems like it was improvised at the last minute and comes off poorly - scenes meant to induce terror or horror merely make one want to laugh - I am sure all the actors will look back on their decision to take part in this film as an embarrassing lapse of judgement."

","In a book or a film, which is not there in order to instruct, but instead there to enlighten and construct - in such books and films, authority must never be right! In the propaganda-film, authority is always right and something to be trusted, not questioned. Furthermore, a film or book that cannot be generalized as an example for something can be described as a case-study, which, together with many other case-studies, can give rise to an interesting new theory with a possible general usefulness. A single case-study is however only interesting if it overthrows an existing theory and this film does not. On the contrary. This film (case-study) does instead glamorize existing authority.<br/><br/>In the other films by the same author, Gone Baby Gone and Mystic River, we find the same abominable tendencies as in this film. Generalized as propaganda, Gone Baby Gone, leads us to believe that missing children are taken care of by better parents and Mystic River insidiously tries to tell us that we shouldn't feel to bad about doing wrong against the forsaken, since their lives are f-d up anyway (hinting closing-scenes in Mystic River).<br/><br/>Of course, it is not difficult to be published as an author with this kind of content in your writing. Machiavelli managed to let the whole thing go ""over the top"" in his ""The Prince"", so that we today can read his book as a revelation of what power is all about, while he, in his day and with some courage, managed to sell as praise what in fact was its very opposite. This author's work does not go ""over the top"" however and what can be learned from it is only abominable, if you allow such ""learning"" to take place.<br/><br/>The word is again ""fascism"", which is the idea that an elite of humans should be allowed to govern the vast majority as they, the elite, see fit and if you have a lot of money and/or power, you are a member of the club and you then publish whatever enhances your chances to stay in power, like works that defend authority."

The characters can actually be tragic, manipulated by their own world forces, or even uninteresting. But no matter how you slice it, the narrative follows people and the containing world is an annotation, an effect. I believe this is ""Italian"" in film-making and Scorcese was captured by it. Unfortunately for him, the cult of the actor in Hollywood (and associated market forces that support critics) feeds this. So he adopted deNiro and made films that were at least competent. But the camera could only follow bodies.<br/><br/>But all the real juice in cinema is in this idea of noir. It has penetrated everywhere to some extent because it matters. The religious cosmology of noir has a world that exists apart from any humans. It pre-exists, has its own laws and dynamics. Being external to the souls of humans who appear, it blows them around and tinkers with those souls.<br/><br/>It has the advantage that the film's narrative can entangle the existence of the world with the viewers and their needs. It brings the film to the viewers in a sort of contract, a dialog that cannot be refused. It also allows the camera to exist in a world apart from the characters. Thus, the filmmaker can inform us of the situation. Space matters. Texture, color, light all have their own lives.<br/><br/>Scorcese has been bothered by the fact that his films did not do this; could not. Here he was with the craft, the skills, but not the vision. So in one of the most intriguing inner stories in Hollywood, he attempts to escape his own limits.<br/><br/>He shifts from deNiro-like actors to deCaprio style. He tries, really hard to discover. His ""Gangs"" was a noble attempt, but a failure because of problems with funders. ""Aviator"" was his first noir success, helped by the influence of Cate (playing Kate). Check out the story, which mirrors Marty's plight. Marvel in that cool scene where the room is filled with strings.<br/><br/>The rat movie was a retreat. And now this. It is a pure victory, an personal achievement. Some of us have been rooting for the man in his encounter with himself and are doubly rewarded with this film.<br/><br/>There are elements in the story that reflect this quest of the filmmaker. I wouldn't want to focus on them too much here, because the reader may think that the story itself matters more than it should. But see the references to Spielberg's similar quest with ""Close"" and ""List?"" See the imposition of the noir narrator and the notion of slippery trust? See the folds in the anagrams? Look how at the end, we have shifted truths but the ambiguity remains. He could indeed still be the investigating cop, now compromised. In fact, this could be a flashback to the episode we learn happened nine months previously. (Note in particular how the tie changes toward the end.)<br/><br/>Those story elements would have made a good comment. I'll do that elsewhere. Here the point is to look at how Marty has a new eye. Look at how the camera is almost never anchored to a person. Look at how it always — always — starts with some focus on an element of the world then slips to catch a person (always Teddy, then his focus). Look at how well we understand the importance of location, architecture, place, space, situation. <br/><br/>Look at how for the first time ever, Marty shows space: flying paper, ash, dust, hail, leaves, trees. Look at how he even explores the architecture of water a bit. Watch with admiration as he announces his love for Thelma (his editor), and allows her some rubato in how the thing is paced because she owns the clock of the world, now hers.<br/><br/>My immediate context: I saw this in a theater with a pride of chattering young Marines. They could not follow the story and left laughing at themselves.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."

"moonspinner55","6","9","17","15 March 2011"," Artistic curlicues decorate a thin, derivative script...
","Once director Martin Scorsese attained widespread acceptance from moviegoers (and mainstream critics) with the massive commercial success of ""Cape Fear"" in 1991, he quickly turned into a 'blockbuster' filmmaker, one who had his pick of top-rank collaborators. The Scorsese name became a brand--like Spielberg's--however, the movies he has chosen to work on since do not always echo the interests of the young, raw Scorsese. With ""Shutter Island"", an adaptation of a novel by Dennis Lehane, the stamp of Scorsese becomes interchangeable with that of Shyamalan, De Palma, Polanski...even the ghost of Stanley Kubrick, whose ""The Shining"" seems to be an inspirational starting point for this thin, shuddery yarn. Leonard DiCaprio plays a U.S. Federal Marshal in 1954 investigating the disappearance of a female mental patient from a locked-down asylum in the Boston Harbor. Elements of other films keep turning up in Laeta Kalogridis' poor script, which incorporates (at various intervals) concentration camp detail with a triple homicide that is both exploitative and distasteful. The large cast is solid, for the most part--Scorsese has retained his uncanny ability to bring out the best in his actors--though I'm not sure how deeply DiCaprio is feeling his role. His frequent scowl doesn't reveal anything but a petulant nature, which, coupled with his youthful appearance, doesn't lend much conviction to a character who is alternately a soldier, a family man, and a government employee. DiCaprio is making a career out of seeming miscast; since this entire house-of-cards plot rests on the star's shoulders, the final denouement isn't the heart-breaker it should have been. The picture is vividly atmospheric and features excellent technical detail, yet it is a glum undertaking burdened with overwrought profanities ill-suited to the era. This is what Martin Scorsese wants to bide his time with? **1/2 from ****"

No, I was riveted by the atmosphere of this darkened, storm-secluded island, cold and windy and ripe for something suspicious (similar to the Ring's Moesko Island) and Leonardo Dicapro working his crafted Boston accent. Little quirky behaviors and denial to cooperate do well to induce paranoia. <br/><br/>Unfortunately Ben Kingsley has been in so much cheese these days that his appearance gave me a red flag instantly and it's all down-hill shortly thereafter. Sub-plots that are meant to distract you from the truth are poorly written and acted to the point where you really don't believe them anyway. <br/><br/>This movie has too much going on and goes on for so long that by the time you're done putting up with it all ""the truth"" just leaves you feeling cheated.

","US Marshal Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his partner Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo) are dispatched to Shutter Island, a facility that combines mental health treatment and criminal detention. One patient, Rachel Solando, is missing and has slipped through the walls as if through evaporation. Where on the island could she have gone?<br/><br/>DiCaprio and Scorsese are a great team, let's just say that right away. If you've seen ""The Aviator"", ""The Departed"" or -- my favorite -- ""Gangs of New York"", you are aware of the greatness these two can achieve. While I do not feel ""Shutter Island"" is on par with ""Departed"" or ""Gangs"", it can still be counted as a fine film in its own right.<br/><br/>The scenery captures the feel of the 1950s and the dank lonesome feeling that accompanies insane asylums of this period. Much like Arkham Asylum, the very building itself comes off as creepy and disturbing as those it houses. Poorly lit, plenty of stairs and mezzanine, and a feeling of oozing insanity. The inmates here are nasty, not least of which is George Noyce (played by the same man who brought us Rorschach and the upcoming Freddy Krueger). <br/><br/>Michelle Williams, while only seen in dreams and flashbacks, really captures the viewer with her role of Dolores. This is quite possibly her best role yet, overshadowing her work in ""Brokeback Mountain"". Could we see a Best Supporting Actress nod? I freely admit that tears were brought to my eyes by her performance.<br/><br/>I appreciated how closely the film followed the book by Dennis Lehane (author of ""Mystic River""). Unfortunately for those who read it, the twists won't be as shocking, though you might pick up on the clues before your friends do. The film downplays much of the detective aspect, and almost completely removes the code-breaking parts. You could fairly say it has been dumbed-down.<br/><br/>Scorsese, or his screenwriter, have also added in plenty of extra violence to turn this into a bit of an action flick. An extra gun shot here, a needle there, a firing squad sequence... this works well to keep viewers engaged. At the same time, the inclusion of the Dachau flashbacks dragged the pace down, and I think this will not work with some audiences. The biggest complaint I've heard yet was about the film's length.<br/><br/>After seeing what I felt were disappointing previews for ""Shutter Island"", the film comes out well and on par with the book, a rare event. They use every tool at their disposal to amp up the visuals, and while the final twist may have you recalling other films (it's not the most original), all in all it's a fine piece of cinema. Along with ""The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus"" and ""Youth in Revolt"", it is one of the best films of 2010 (so far)."
"Movies505","Null","11","22","24 September 2010"," Are people that simple?
","Question: which stayed longer in your neighborhood movie theatre, Shutter Island, or the half-empty popcorn container you left on the floor by your seat? <br/><br/>Let's start with the beginning of Shutter Island: two U.S. Marshals (DiCaprio and Ruffalo) head to shutter island, a prison for the criminally insane, to find an escaped patient. Hey, Ms. Kalogridis, why do you need two US Marshals to find an escaped prisoner on an island where there is no way on or off except by ferry? And the prison has control of the ferry? This is your setup? You're joking, right? <br/><br/>Ms. Kalogridis is not joking. She's dead serious. She thinks we're going to park our brains at the door and dig into her blunder. Are people that simple? <br/><br/>Come on, movie-goers, let's get real. Shutter Island is an insult to the intelligence of the viewer from beginning to end. Just because Martin Scorsese turned a blind eye to a poorly written, convoluted script with an ending that doesn't deliver, doesn't mean we should be lemmings and follow him off the cliff. Sorry, Marty, all that mood and dreariness and fog may set the tone and theme of the movie, but without a polished script, Shutter Island is a poor collaboration between director and screenwriter.<br/><br/>And do not confuse Shutter Island's ending with The Sixth Sense's ending. The Sixth Sense has an ending that delivers and works. Writer/director M. Night Shyamalan went back and proved to us that we saw what we wanted to see. Shyamalan didn't fool us. We fooled ourselves.<br/><br/>Kalogridis, on the other hand, serves up a gimmick ending that leaves us deflated and unfulfilled.<br/><br/>Shutter Island needed someone who understands adaptation. Clearly, Ms. Kalogridis does not. Sometimes adaptation means tossing away most of the story and creating a new original. There's nothing that says you can't use your imagination. Too bad Marty didn't encourage Kalogridis to use hers."
"ElMaruecan82","5","5","8","14 October 2011"," A savor-less salad of cinematic tricks ...
","Guess who praised Martin Scorsese's ""Shutter Island""? Roger Ebert! The cinematography, the spooky atmosphere, the film noir's overtones, the whole psychological torment, the ""buried trauma"" to quote him, as so many voices speaking in favor of ""Shutter Island"", another great achievement from the greatest director of his generation.<br/><br/>Marty might be the greatest as the most consistent director of the New Hollywood generation but I hate how 'great Marty film' started working like a pleonasm, as to underline a tacit rule that any movie made by a great film-maker automatically deserves the benefit of the doubt, in other words: if you hate it, you didn't get it. I'm sorry again, but the director who committed this cinematic piece of unoriginality is not the passionate artist who enriched cinema with so many masterpieces, like ""Mean Streets"", ""Raging Bull"", ""Goodfellas"" and such delightful little gems like ""The King of Comedy"" or ""After Hours"". I'm sorry but Marty didn't gain in maturity, not even in craftsmanship, he purely and simply  lost his touch.<br/><br/>I have the biggest respect for Scorsese, and also for Ebert, and the reason I mentioned the latter is because he's certainly Scorsese's number one fan, but he's also one of these privileged persons who've seen so many movies in his life that he would be the least likely to get so easily impressed by a film, that blatantly exploits every single cinematic cliché, considering the story's material. The movie is so 'obvious' that it would be tragic if it wasn't so laughable. And it's obvious because it works on that reverse effect, as movie fans, we know that whatever seems obvious in the first act will probably be contradicted. True BUT whatever seems obvious is exactly the opposite of what is shown during that very first act, because we know we're being tricked by the director. In that case, it's like Scorsese was the 'sprinkled sprinkler', and Ebert's implicit denial of the script obviousness says a lot about his recurrent loss of subjectivity whenever it concerns Scorsese.<br/><br/>I don't want to number all the clichés: the two detectives investigating, the entrance in the island with a haunting atmosphere emphasized by an ominous music, begging you to be scared, or impressed, a weird feeling of unrealism in some backgrounds that made me question what the artistic approach was, let's just call it 'homage' to old-school cinema, this one never gets old. But I wouldn't have expected this emphasis on the tone, screaming ""Beware  danger"" not even from old-school directors, and certainly not from Hitchchock. Okay, we got the idea that something will go wrong; it doesn't even trust our patience as Di Caprio acts weirdly from the very first scenes. I was pleased by Ben Kingley's performance as the charming head doctor, but it's getting old since Nurse Ratched and I didn't mention Fritz Lang, because there are less risks that he might be known by the targeted audience.<br/><br/>And I'm not even implying that the movie is not worth watching, but it plays like an overlong build-up for a weak climax, a build-up, during which nothing very pleasing happens. And I mean 'pleasing' in the pleasing meaning of the word, seriously. What happened to Marty's sense of entertainment? Why such a constant need to be dark, Gothic and gloomy? Is that Cinema's new emotional trend? Are we supposed to endure this atmosphere during the whole picture? Can't we have a break? a distracting element, not necessarily a comic relief, but I don't know, a subplot, an interesting character, even Hitchcock did itno, again, the time-filler relied on the guilty trauma, the good old theme so cherished by Marty, and that provides the best alibis to rationalize his films. And we discover his wife played by a beautiful Michelle Thomas, and some horrific flashbacks featuring the Nazi's atrocities, always a good taste to combine the supernatural horror with the real one, that's what the movie needed in case we thought we would cheer up at the end. Or was he just surfing on an opportunistic wave introduced by Tarantino's ""Inglourious Basterds""? <br/><br/>The weaknesses of the plot canceled out all the cinematographic attempts to justify the movie's cinematic merit. Nothing special happens, nothing really happens, and again, it's so damn hard to feel sympathetic toward Leonardo Di Caprio! Yes, I have a big problem with Di Caprio in Scorsese's film, because of that same constipated face he has to display, to remind us that he's playing a tough guy. Did Bogart look tough? Di Caprio is a good actor, even great sometimes, but this is becoming one of his most annoying trademarks. I miss the young, lively Di Caprio with sparkling eyes and youthful look, because tough he isn't, and he doesn't fool anyone, and this is probably why the only Marty's movie I thought he delivered a great and flamboyant performance was ""The Aviator"". The first thing I see in a Di Caprio film now, is the poster, tough-guy-constipated-face? I avoid.<br/><br/>An indigestible film with a risible attempt to scare us, I will stop here because I'm tired of being so critical about the director whom I praised most of his work from the 70's to the 90's. But he just doesn't do justice to his glorious filmography, Scorsese is a man of gripping realism of psychological torture and it doesn't need a supernatural flavor to taste good, it's scarier when real and more than that, Scorsese is a damn entertainer, with a unique talent of storyteller, and not only the story isn't told well, but it's not even a good story, as far as originality is concerned.<br/><br/>And when comes the final scene, with the final line, supposed to summarize the whole message of the film and justify the whole build-up, my only reaction was : ""so, we got from that  to that?!"" and this is my exact feeling when I compare between Marty's earlier and later works."

For the first 15 minutes I thought that the twist ending might end up being that everyone on the island, including Leo, were already dead and ghosts. As bad as that ending sounds, it would have been 100 times better than the actual plot. 30 minutes into the movie i leaned over to my girlfriend and said Leo is insane and is a patient. She replied with yeah his wife probably killed his kids and then he killed her. My girlfriend never watches movies. She was spot on. The foreshadowing in this movie is way way way overdone and makes the entire plot, or lack thereof, pointless. Anyone with a 5th grade education knows whats going to happen at least by the 1 hour mark. The movie looks great, the sets are a little overdone but they do look the part. This movie would have been more compelling if it was actually about Nazi mind control experiments or even about an island full of ghosts. When the end of the movie finally comes around, after what seems like an eternity of glaringly obvious ""hints"" that Leo is insane, you figure out that he has overcome his delusions and is accepting his fate of having a lobotomy so that he can forget what he has done. The final line he delivers leaves no doubt that this is the outcome not that he is still insane. Worth a watch but by no means great."

And according to the last scene this is the second time in a year that the whole facility has gone through this charade to try to ""wake"" this guy up. Like I said, who's got the time and especially the money to devote to just this one patient? Never happen. Some of the scenes were intriguing. The actors were compelling in certain scenes.

","Shutter Island, the new film from Martin Scorsese, has a hell of a lot to live up to. Personally, I had great faith in the film and was quite looking forward to it. The premise seemed quite interesting and possessing of wonderful potential.<br/><br/>And that it was: Leonardo DiCaprio is US Marshall Teddy Daniels, sent to investigate the disappearance of a prisoner from the eponymous institution for the criminally insane. Working through the stress of a recent tragedy, he falls deeper and deeper into the mysterious case, where everyone seems to be hiding something.<br/><br/>When I first saw Teddy's partner Chuck, and heard in my head the words he was about to say (""You okay boss?""), I knew things were not going to go as well as I hoped. Predictability reigned supreme. From that clichéd 50s detective line to the ""twist"" ending, bearing all the subtlety and surprise of a loud and luminescent train, things were often painfully obvious. The beginning is annoyingly over-dramatic, the score astoundingly over the top. Plot-exposition-by-numbers soon follows, as well as the overstated oddness of this island. After a very flawed introduction, the film does turn in a better direction. The middle was far more enjoyable than what came before, winning me over somewhat with its developing strangeness. It's not long, however, before the clear signs are given and we see the ending about halfway into the film, making the rest rather a waste of time. We plummet dramatically into a worse third act than first. I was shocked at Marty's descent into intensive plot explanation, taking perhaps half an hour of drawn out dialogue followed by dramatisations of that very dialogue and making me feel as though he thought I was a child incapable of understanding what was happening. For goodness' sake, Ben Kingsley even unveils a drawn out explanation from beneath a velvet cover. Grow up Marty, and don't be so condescending. The movie also owes far more than it cares to admit to The Shining, desperately yearning to be the infinitely superior film for a good portion of its running time while adding the music of Cape Fear gone mad. My poor ears.<br/><br/>Shutter Island is riddled with flaws. It is clunky, overly long, shamefully evident, unoriginal, inconsistent in quality and poorly derivative of a far more enjoyable film. There is enjoyment to be found, however, in the fun middle section and closing statement; one which did at least lend gravitas to its climax. A poor film it may be, but it is at least a fun one at that. Scorsese has underperformed here, though not entirely terribly."

","*This review may also spoil the Sixth Sense*<br/><br/>The main problem with this movie for me was that it was very predictable that there would be a twist. When Leonardo Dicaprio's character finds out that Shutter Island may be grounds for illegal experimentation, it is painfully obvious that there is going to be a twist since there are still a lot of mysteries. Therefore, there is very little believability to the notion that Shutter Island is carrying out such operations and very little tension. While watching I though of a couple of theories for what the twist might be (thats how sure I was of the twist). Of course it was the least original one that I thought of: Ted Daniels is an actual patient on the island. While that ending is so ""out there,"" I also feel like I've seen it a thousand times. Scorcese builds the entire movie around this twist, which is a disaster because the twist is expected and unoriginal. <br/><br/>A similar movie with a twist, the Sixth Sense, is so much better than this one because it explores a very interesting conflict, but is not so mysterious which makes the viewer unsuspecting of any twists. The downfall to Shutter Island was Scorcese overdoing the mystery aspect. I would give this movie a 4, but I feel that this movie has inflated ratings because no one wants to admit that such a great director disappointed (that's not to say everyone's rating is inflated, but it makes sense to assume that such inflation exists when this painfully predictable movie has an 8.1.)"

","The most precious value of a human is the mental status during life. Most people had difficulties in life; furthermore, some of them couldn't handle the stress after a while. Teddy is the protagonist of this movie and he couldn't get over his children at the break point. From my point of view, the movie reveals many facts about schizophrenia.
First of all, repression is emphasized during movie. He tried to clean his bad memories but he couldn't be successful.
Secondly, Teddy denies every fact especially his real name, Andrew Laeddis. Indeed, his surname, ""Denials"" is the name of a prophet who interprets dreams. The movie is full wit denials. ""Shutter"" also refers to a closed mind to realities.
Thirdly, Teddy reflects his real identity to another character, Andrew Laeddis. He needed projection of his crimes to a new person.
Fourth, Teddy also needed displacement about his life at the island. He always assumed that he was there in order to investigate.
Fifth, Teddy couldn't handle his loss and his crime so he was in regression which resulted as schizophrenia.
Sixth, Teddy acts as if he was a marshal who was sent in order to investigate an escape from the hospital. Indeed, his duty is an sublimation which is acceptable by any resident of island.
In a nutshell, the movie explains how people lose their mind and they lose their identity. His superego declined so he lost his ego which ended with a break with real life."

He then meets the lost patient in a cave, who convinces him about everyone being evil on the island and that they would do anything to not let him go. He swims his way to the lighthouse and confronts Dr Cawley. THIS IS WHERE THE PLOT EXPLODES.
As Dr Cawley begins convincing him that Teddy himself is just another patient affected by OCD, we the audience feel the cunningness in his attempt to mislead Teddy.

","A pair of detectives arrive at a fog-bound island where a dangerous female patient has mysteriously disappeared from her cell in a mental asylum.

Unfortunately it's also signaling the introduction of a tired collection of generic characters, wasted talent, mundane screen writing and melodramatic directing. The plot's big twist is obvious within the first 15 minutes, after which it plods relentlessly on to the 'surprise' denouement. All suspense having drained away at an early stage - something of a drawback in a suspense film - there's little to hold an audience's interest, so the film stagnates like a bloated whale.<br/><br/>Since artists frequently steal ideas from one another, it shouldn't be a serious problem that the basic concept has been taken from a much earlier German film - only that it has been re-imagined in such a prosaic manner. The core idea is a clever conceit, but it requires subtle handling which seems utterly beyond Scorcese.

","Like any fan of Scorsese, I was very excited to see this film, but left disappointed. The build up of the story was fantastic: Hurricane season. Deary and moody. Epic shots of this huge, foreboding island. Haunting score that puts your senses on alert. Ominous mental asylum. Everything hinted at an instant classic thriller; another Scorsese masterpiece. With the 1950s setting, the U.S. Marshals/detectives, missing person case and the bleak tone the film was establishing, there was even a noir feel to it.<br/><br/>As the story progresses, the protagonist (DiCaprio) starts having these off-kilter flashbacks, and among one of them, a story that tells of his time in the Second World War. This is where I think the film hits its highest note. How all these different flashbacks fit into this puzzle that is this mental asylum, Shutter Island, is the mystery you're anxiously waiting to be unraveled. If your history is up to par then you'll know how fitting the WWII plot element is to the overall story of the film, which is also ultimately where I think the movie left me underwhelmed. I understand this film is based off of a novel, a set script, but I wish Scorsese would've explored more of the aforementioned plot element and done away with the tired, cliché story that eventually unfolds.<br/><br/>To the film's credit, the cinematography, score, set design, wardrobe and the often forgotten, lighting (very creepy and effective at times), were all marvelously done. DiCaprio, who I'm not a big fan of, was actually quite enjoyable and solid. Often times he doesn't seem to really fit the bill of the role, but in Shutter Island I was a believer. DiCaprio's character was very ""alive"" to me. The acting by the rest of the supporting cast were top notch as well. Mark Ruffalo, who I think is a very underrated actor, was a nice surprise as I didn't know he was going to be in this film.<br/><br/>Overall, 6 stars or a B-. Worth the watch but not something I would eventually buy on DVD."

","Shutter Island is one of the most intriguing film , which I have ever seen. When I started to watch it, I thought that is not interesting film at all because I don't like detective stories about policeman. But it amazed me at all .<br/><br/>This film is based on the novel of the same name by Dennis Lehane . It is take place in the mid-1950s where a main character, Teddy Deniels and his partner Chuck Aule, are sent to an island where there is a security prison for patients with some methods health disorders and many of them are so dangerous for other people. The plot is very unusual and unpredictable . You want to watch it and to see what happens at the end of this story.<br/><br/>This horror film with tons of atmosphere to music ,directions and set to a wonderfully story.<br/><br/>I believe that the main idea of the plot is to find your demons inside your own island in your head. Not only Teddy doing it.<br/><br/>As for actors, in this film you can see Leonardo DiCaprio who plays Teddy Deniels (main character). He gave one of the best performances hero and showed a man who has their own «demons» and many strange things inside him. He tried to solve the mystery of the island and this situation was really important for him. I'd recommend this film for people who like detective and mysterious stories with unpredictable ending."

","Shutter Island. I'm going to tell about this interesting film and express own feelings. First of all, a plot of the picture is so thrilled then you feel some fear from beginning to the end. Mystical hospital on the island has many puzzles and you begin to ask different questions yourselves. Then, play of the main character is so real and his searching for mystical truth excites all the time. I think that the main part of a good film for people is their interest in it. And you can't fall asleep after watching a Shatter Island. Illness or conviction? When I saw it once, I believed that we have a deal with an illness weirdo because strange lighthouse prove a simple one without any secrets, and awful experiments like he earlier imaged are not exist. However for the second watching, I understood that he is convinced. Secret pills, cigarettes, woman's note ""run out"" and a fascinating logic intellect can't belong to a crazy man. May be... Well, I was surprised after culmination. Who could imagine the end like this? I think none of us. We amazed by this plot, idea and then we begin to adore this film. This is an achievement of a director and fantasy which reflect interesting motions in Teddy's head. The secret of successful film- surprise, shock and our wish to see it one more time exactly with the same actors. People want to find some new, fresh and unusual belong boring and not good movies. And if you a person like this, you need watch Shutter Island. In conclusion, I'd want to say that we must watch films like one in order to being surprised and exited about opportunities of our mind. We must have wide open eyes on our usual world:)"

","1954; US Marshal Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) is investigating the disappearance of a patient who has escaped from a psychiatric hospital on Shutter Island. Once Teddy begins his investigations, he notices strange anomalies such as; Rachel managing to escape from a room that has been locked from the outside, the fact that she manages to bypass all the other patients and security staff without anyone noticing etc. Daniels is puzzled by Rachel's seemingly 'unexplainable' disappearance and is determined to get to the bottom of it.<br/><br/>I'll be the first to say that mystery films are probably my favourite genre (when they're done right) and films like Shutter Island help to cement that feeling. Shutter Island hooked me in straight away due to how creepy it looked - this was down to some superb cinematography. Then as the film progressed, I found that I was more and more hooked in. Shutter Island takes you in one direction, but then pulls you in another direction and it's all these twists and turns that help to keep things fresh. I felt a constant sense of paranoia throughout this film. I found that I never knew who I could trust when I was watching this film and this merely helped to increase the suspense. Daniels' dream sequences gave his character an added depth, but also added another layer to the plot. I found that Shutter Island not only kept me in suspense, but also kept me thinking and the two elements combined are cinematic heaven as far as I'm concerned.<br/><br/>Acting wise, Scorsese has got lots of big players on board such as DiCaprio, Kingsley and Von Sydow to name a few and all the players on board put in stellar performances. As mentioned, the cinematography was superb and this really helped to give Shutter Island a creepy and mysterious feel.<br/><br/>Where Shutter Island falters slightly is in the heavy handed way it dealt with one particular plot twist (which I won't reveal). Suffice it to say, this did lessen the impact when it was revealed. However, just when I was prepared to be majorly disappointed, Shutter Island throws in more twists and turns after the obvious twist was revealed and these added twists did surprise me somewhat.<br/><br/>This is an excellent film that will most likely appeal to fans of psychological thrillers or mystery films. I loved it and would strongly recommend that you watch it."
"begob","4","4","6","19 August 2014"," Unconvincing
","The first half of this movie is a fantasy, which gets solved in the second half by old-fashioned psychological here's-what-really-happened.<br/><br/>The lead looks too fresh to carry off the tragic role, and some of his delivery of the cartoonish lines is really poor (although may not be his fault). The fantasy part is half-baked with some clumsy clues, and then we get memories of the holocaust to illuminate the hero's past. Was that really necessary? I was thinking Jacob's Ladder, but I didn't like that either and it was a better movie than this.<br/><br/>The figuring-out part is like an '80s Hercules Poirot episode - neither scary nor emotive, just flipping over the cards as it suits the dealer. On top of his holocaust experience, the hero also had a mad homicidal wife. Bloody hell! The final flashback is awkward, and there's no effort to make us hurt for the children. The ending is ... ""led off in handcuffs"". Duh duh duuuuh! <br/><br/>Way too elaborate for a simple story."
"fung0","2","4","6","17 June 2013"," Elegant Drivel
","Scorsese is surely THE most over-rated American director of all time. I vowed never to see another of his bombastic travesties, but was lured into this one by the interesting premise. Alas, only to discover I was right all along. If Scorsese ever makes another good film, it will be purely by accident. He should stick to doing inane commentary on disc releases of other people's films.<br/><br/>Shutter Island seems fine at first: a 'mystery wrapped in an enigma' sort of thing. But it gradually unravels, like all Scorsese's films, as he tries strenuously to demonstrate his genius, rather than simply telling an intelligent story. The ending is a final insult - of the ""aren't you sorry you bothered"" variety. It's a silly trick that Rod Serling might have used for a half-hour TV diversion, and then only with a much-needed element of self-deprecating irony (a seasoning unfamiliar to the self-absorbed Mr. Scorsese).<br/><br/>Scorsese knows how to move a camera around, and get good performances out of his actors. But if you value logic and meaning over surface gloss, you need to stay away from this piece of elegant drivel."
"Bolly_Boba_Booboo","1","10","20","6 December 2011"," What on earth were they thinking?
","I'm about as far away from a Scorcese fan as you can get. In my book he targets the lowest common denominator via a combination of foul language and violence. True, there have been exceptions. I went to see New York, New York, despite antipathy to the two leads, because it was about Jazz in the immediate post-war years; verdict: ho-hum.<br/><br/>A little later he made Age Of Innocence and I went because I was almost certain that he would be unable to insert his winning parlay (scatological violence) without radically altering Edith Wharton's stylistic novel. Verdic: ho-hum.<br/><br/>I was sold on Shutter Island because I read that 1) it was set in am M. Night Shylaman universe which meant the twist is that the victim is revealed to be his own victimizer and 2) considerable footage was devoted to Cinema itself. Scorcese is well-documented as both loving and being an expert on movies so it is almost certain that he is familiar with The Shawshank Syndrome and it is equally certain that he has, to some extent, remade it with a Shylamanesque twist, if you recall, was a catalyst surrounded by sad people who needed 1) a nudge to bring them together or 2) some form of healing. DiCappio is also a catalyst surrounded by people who need help getting together - and healing - Ben Kingsley. Viewed in these terms it can be said that both catalysts succeed admirably but, it has to be said, when is a rip-off not a rip-off? possibly when it's a sacred cow doing the ripping-off.<br/><br/>The 3D is used effectively and Von Snydow supplies the best performance, counteracting the film's worst performance by Ben Kingsley. Dipccaprio is as mechanical as the interior of Big Ben and by far the best thing on view is the actual vintage footage."

","I really love the movies, but i had to leave this movie before it was finished. It's only the 2nd time i did that. How does Mr. Scorsese dare to use images of a concentration camp in his movie like this? In a way for shock effect? It's indecent and immoral. The film hangs to each other by cinematographic cliché's; dripping water, people who are casted because they look so scary, it looked like a cheap horror movie. Also the story it selves feels like one big cliché, full with unbelievable turns. Also the score was irritating me from the beginning, too much present, while there was no occasion for it. I hoped for a well made film, sound, like Scorsese should be able to make, but it was one big disappointment. Yesterday i saw Crazy Love, the contrasts between these 2 movies couldn't be bigger.

When watching this movie, I knew it seemed similar to some other movie, I just didn't know how similar it was. Essentially, the plot of Caligari is a horror story of murders which in the end is revealed to be in a patient's head. The bad guy was actually the doctor of the insane asylum at which he lived.<br/><br/>In Shutter Island the bad guy would seem to be the doctor, and the twist ending (a rather obvious on I guessed before the film) was that it was a patient who was imagining the whole thing.<br/><br/>Seriously, these two are two similar, and a film as important to film history as Caligari is one that should be held in much higher esteem than this.<br/><br/>And I didn't even start on the acting, which was just as weak as the movie."

"Michael_Elliott","Null","13","28","21 February 2010"," Terror of a Different Kind
","Shutter Island (2010) <br/><br/>*** 1/2 (out of 4)<br/><br/>Martin Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio's fourth outing together is a brilliantly made that has two hours of build up to a masterfully handled final twenty-minutes. In the film DiCaprio plays U.S. Marshal Teddy Daniels who with his partner (Mark Ruffalo) travel to Shutter Island, a mental hospital where a female prisoner has escaped. Teddy and his partner try to break through with the main doctor (Ben Kingsley) but he appears to be hiding what may have really happened. Meanwhile, Teddy continues to suffer migraines and bad dreams of his wife (Michelle Williams) who died in a fire shortly before current events. Out of the four pictures and director and star have made together, I'd probably call this one here the weakest even if it might be the best made one they've done. As I said, this movie has two hours worth of a drawn out mystery that has one brilliant touch after another and then we get hit with a chilling, extremely effective and at times disturbing third act that perfectly puts all the pieces together. Best of all is this is the type of movie that will guarantee people to be talking years after its release.<br/><br/>The technical side of things make this one of the most beautiful and haunting Scorsese pictures out there, which is saying quite a lot when you consider how many great films he has made. What I really loved the most was his wicked cinematography that perfectly puts you on this island and really captures all the possible evils going on. Even better is the music score that's one of the most haunting in recent memory. It perfectly builds up a nice tension and an overall doom and gloom that hasn't really been matched since the wonderful score in THE SHINING. Speaking of the Kubrick film, I can't help but think it was some sort of influence on Scorsese as the two films don't just try to go after cheap scares but instead they build up a strong story and then give us everything else second. Like the Kubrick film, a lot of this movie takes place during the daylight, which again adds a weird and surreal nature to the film. With that said, there are a lot of scenes in dark hallways and dungeon like cells that really work as well as the art direction and set design are top-notch. Other visuals work as well including an extremely beautiful and haunting sequence when DiCaprio first ""sees"" the ghost of his dead wife and they have a discussion about the missing patient. <br/><br/>The performances are also another very strong part with DiCaprio once again showing why he's one of the best and most interesting actors out there working. He gives another strong performance and it's rather amazing to see how much he can do and how much he can deliver whatever is asked. He perfectly fits the violent side of his characters mind but he is also believable during the conclusion of events and how everything plays out. He handles the emotion scenes extremely well as well as some of the lighter ones. Williams is also very refreshing in her scenes in the film, although she doesn't have as much to do. Ruffalo is also very strong and works well with DiCaprio. Veterans Kingsley and Max von Sydow are wonderful as well as Patricia Clarkson, Jackie Earle Haley and Ted Levine. The performances mixed with everything else really makes this a complete film from start to finish. <br/><br/>Again, the first two hours are pretty much just building up everything that follows. Perhaps a second viewing would change my opinion on this but I do think a little of this could have been edited out and we wouldn't have missed anything. With that said, one does have to admire the screenplay for getting so many different things in (including a haunting Holocaust sequence) and be able to work them in a way where it all comes through in the end. The ending, which I won't spoil, will have people talking for years and I'm sure many different theories could be made about what happened or didn't happened. To me that's the sign of something special and Scorsese really delivers once again."
"budmassey","1","13","28","20 February 2010"," A psychological drama grotesquely masquerading as a big budget thriller.
","I'm not particularly fond of Leo DiCaprio as an actor, although he is steadily developing into what may one day become greatness. But director Martin Scorsese has been great for so long he is worth seeing just on principle. And of course the previews were enticing. The movie itself was, however, entirely inert.<br/><br/>Once the anemic premise of Shutter Island unravels, which beings almost immediately and progresses with alarming rapidity, all you have left is a tedious and numbingly long dénouement that has been done before, only better. This movie has been likened to the work of M. Night Shayamalan, and the comparison is every bit the insult it was intended to be, as Shayamalan, unlike Scorsese, is known for crafting movies so pretentious, so insubstantial, and so dependent on their own hype. With Shayamalan it would have been expected. For Scorsese, I have to admit I was a bit shocked.<br/><br/>There were protracted financial and artistic complications that delayed the release of Shutter Island. The real tragedy, however, is that they couldn't prevent it altogether. The lurid score is almost mockingly overwrought. The endless and intentionally distracting flashbacks are tawdry and ineffective. Shutter Island is beautifully filmed, and its stars render creditable performances, but it is all for naught, as the film drowns on the ferry before its stars ever reach the island.<br/><br/>I am convinced that if Scorsese had been truer to Dennis Lehane's novel, rather than supplanting it almost entirely with Laeta Kalogridis' completely incongruous screenplay, there might have been something worthwhile. Shutter Island is a psychological drama grotesquely masquerading as a big budget thriller. If you want to see how it should be done, try Identity instead."
"socklessmenace","7","11","23","23 February 2010"," Predictable, yet Scorsese
","I am an extreme movie goer. So obviously I follow the works of the great Martin Scorsese. I heard this movie was also a thinker and much like an old style Hitchcock film. Considering Hitchcock is my favourite director and is a master at his work and a genius at the art of psychological horror...I was overwhelmed with excitement for this movie.<br/><br/>In all I say the plot of this movie was...okay. Don't get me wrong, it's very smart and completely original and as far as I know not done before. However, if you are as much a movie buff as myself this twist ending is a give away obvious one right off the bat. this is why it lost 3 stars for me. However, it touches on many emotions and other aspects besides the main plot of the film and runs deeper then its first visible roots. A truly complex film.<br/><br/>Now on too why I gave it the seven stars. Martin Scorsese, Martin Scorsese, Martin Scorsese. If for no other reason, see this film for its amazing directing. Shutter Island truly brings back the psychological thriller and is both beautifully and horrifyingly directed. This right here is why Scorsese is known for being a true dominator of his medium.<br/><br/>And so for Performance of the movie by both the actors and director I give this movie a probable 9.5 but for plot and story I give it a probable 6. I recommend it, but for those real film buffs out there who know the layout of how movies work and are good at guessing the twist endings...don't get your hopes up. However 45% of the people I went with said they didn't understand it so I guess that can be taken into account as well."

It was clear that I was not the only one who thought that this movie fell way short.<br/><br/>If you are trying to look for positives, there were a few. First of all, Leonardo DiCaprio was incredible. If he were not in this movie, it would have been a disaster. He is an incredible actor. He actually delivers a very inspiring performance. Secondly, there is a good story somewhere in there. I think that is what most people who liked the movie would point to. The story is good, it just so happens that it portrayed through terrible acting and a loose storyline. It comes across in a very disjointed (and LONG) way. This movie is WAY too long. It was over an hour into the movie before anything of substance happens.<br/><br/>I also found that the movie was not scary, at all. Do not expect to be scared. You will not be.

I must admit, my problem with the movie is based solely on the actual story line, since I am able to recognize that the cinematography and Scorsese's ""Hitchcockian"" approach to the film are definitely its highlights. If you and I have anything in common, initially, you base whether or not you like a film on the script, the actual story being told, with the director's vision, their angle for telling the story, following close behind. Long story short, while I was able to see the positives while watching Shutter Island (the acting and the film's direction will not disappoint), I found the film to be predictable and just simply, nothing special at all."
"Smells_Like_Cheese","7","9","18","20 February 2010"," Marty needs a new editor
","Well, after months and months of waiting, Shutter Island was finally released this weekend. I've been dying to see this movie, I love Martin Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio. These two together just equal gold and you are always sure to have a guaranteed good time at the movie theater. But maybe it's not always a guarantee; unfortunately, Shutter Island was a huge disappointment to me. The weird thing is, it's over something silly but important, the editing. We have fantastic actors, a great story, awesome direction and a spooky atmosphere. But the problem is, the movie does run a bit long, being at almost two and a half hours, it was exhausting to get through the movie. The beginning is so slow paced that it looses track of it's characters and by the time for it's exciting conclusion, I just felt a bit empty.<br/><br/>It's 1954, and up-and-coming U.S. marshal Teddy Daniels is assigned to investigate the disappearance of a patient from Shutter Island's Ashecliffe Hospital. He'd been gunning for an assignment on the island for reasons of his own -- but before long he wonders whether he hasn't been brought there as part of a twisted plot by hospital doctors whose radical treatments range from unethical to illegal to downright sinister. Teddy's code-breaking skills soon provide a promising lead, but the hospital refuses him access to records he suspects would break the case wide open. As a hurricane cuts off communication with the mainland, more dangerous criminals ""escape"" in the confusion, and the puzzling, improbable clues proliferate, Teddy begins to doubt everything -- his memory, his partner, even his own sanity.<br/><br/>I feel so awful because I wanted to love this movie, I was expecting it to be my favorite film of 2010. Still Leonardo DiCaprio, Ben Kingsley and Mark Ruffalo held their own and carried the movie very well. The whole feeling of the film was extremely spooky and does have some very frightening and intense moments. I absolutely adored the ending as it's a puzzle for the audience and it lets you make up your own decision on what has happened throughout the film. The story does have some clever twists and turns that should keep you locked in the movie. But like I mentioned before, the story really did need to be cut down. I have a feeling that if the movie was more like an hour and forty-five minutes, it would have worked a lot better.<br/><br/>The tension just wasn't enough for me to keep interest, my friends were also a bit disappointed, they felt the same. By the time the ending and all the answers came together, they were just disinterested in the story and characters. Now, I don't mind a lengthy movie, but that comes with the exception that the makers of the film keep up with the action and whatever is needed to keep the plot going. I felt like the Nazi story that Teddy kept dreaming about could have been kept to a limit, it's constantly brought up. Also another question I had was that it seemed like Teddy seemed to favor his daughter over his other children and I don't know why; because when he finds out that his wife killed his children, he immediately rushes to his daughter vs. the sons, he also dreams more of her than the boys. The ending was also semi anti-climatic. The critics were saying that the ending makes the movie all worth it and while I agree it's a great ending, it fell flat the very last second for me. I'm thinking this movie would be better as a rental, because you have the chance to have better concentration at home with what is going on in the story. Martin and Leonardo did a good job, but the film just wasn't what I expected, but I guess we all can't be perfect, right? Just why did this have to happen with Marty and Leo? Well, here's to the next project with them, maybe it'll be better.<br/><br/>7/10"

I could have gone to see Valentine's Day, which my friend had described as not as bad as he thought it would be.<br/><br/>Close to two slow hours are spent in developing the story that had a very convoluted and unsatisfying conclusion.

From the first five minutes, the obvious and supposedly twisted ending is revealed all too easily for the careful watcher. It gives you a feeling that the creators of this film don't think the audience can figure things out for themselves. Everything is handed to us and there's no time for suspense because everything is being answered before you can become curious. There is a great score that's guaranteed to give you goosebumps, but the film doesn't deliver anything but a few jumps here and there.<br/><br/>All in all, this film was a horrible miss at a psychological thriller.

","(Synopsis) In 1954, U.S. Marshall Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his new partner Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo) are assigned to investigate the escape of a patient at the federal maximum security hospital/prison for the criminally insane located on Shutter Island. Once on the island, they find that the hospital and prison staffs aren't really cooperating with their investigation. It seems that the staff is hiding a big secret and Teddy is going to uncover it. Teddy believes that if he can see the records that he would break the case. In the meantime, the island is hit by a hurricane, and more dangerous patients escape and must be captured. This gives Teddy and Chuck the opportunity to check out some of the buildings to which they had been denied admission. Teddy finds the answer he was looking for.<br/><br/>(My Comment) Shutter Island has an eerie atmosphere with flashbacks to the concentration camp at Dachau and haunting dreams throughout the entire movie. At times, you will wonder what is real and what is not. Then you will reach a point where you don't care. I started looking at my watch wanting it to be over. If you are a Leonardo fan and decide to see it, you will see that he does a good job of playing the character, but the creepy storyline is disappointing and is only good enough as a B movie. It will not take you very long to figure out the plot, especially, when you are inside Teddy's head. Overall, this movie is dreary and totally depressing. (Paramount, Run Time 2:18, Rated R) (4/10)"
"jdesando","Null","18","43","17 February 2010"," Not one of his greats.
","Martin Scorsese's Shutter Island reminds me of Hitchcock's successful Vertigo, Psycho, and most of all, Spellbound, without the success. The mentally unstable characters who provided Hitchcock hints of utter depravity in those classics in Shutter Island mainly serve facile plot twists.<br/><br/>Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a federal marshal who, with his partner, Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo) goes to Shutter Island Ashecliffe Hospital for the criminally insane in 1954 to investigate the escape of a notorious murderess of her own three children. Almost everyone at that Boston harbor institution besides the patients seems a bit off center, even Teddy, who brings some psychological baggage to the job.<br/><br/>While the cinematography is appropriately claustrophobic and the 19th century industrial brick insane asylum and its accompanying Civil War fort reminiscent of Silence of the Lambs with a touch of Alcatraz, the plot twists are indiscriminately telegraphed while Teddy's recurring visions of his deceased wife are too many and annoying. As the resident shrink, Dr. Cawley (Ben Kingsley) is much smoother than Lambs' Dr. Chilton (Anthony Heald) but not half as fun. Nor is there a villain who can come close to Hopkins' Hannibal Lecter. Although Teddy is the center of the film, Scorsese spends too many frames on tortured close-ups, as if he were making sure that DiCaprio is nominated for an Oscar next year. <br/><br/>The film should have expanded the role of Dr. Naehring, head of the hospital, because the estimable Max von Sydow could have saved the film from boredom as the twists are telegraphed obviously and way too bluntly. In its favor, Scorsese plays deftly, if not a bit too obviously, with different camera angles such as bird's eye and visual images such as bright red blood, reminiscent of the stunning work in Sam Mendes' American Beauty.<br/><br/>When you've directed Mean Streets, Taxi Driver, and Raging Bull, you have a tough time topping yourself. Shutter Island is not a film to be ashamed of; it's just not as good as his greats."

","I had seen parts of a trailer for this film and was in two minds about seeing it but I like psychological thrillers with unpredictable plot twists so I went to see it.<br/><br/>Unfortunately it was very predictable, approximately 10-20 minutes into the film anyone with average or greater intelligence will in all probability immediately spot what the plot twist is going to be. I only watched the rest of the film in the hope that I was wrong and that it was a double bluff and I was going to cheer in amazement but sadly I was disappointed, the movie played out as expected, waste of 2 hours.<br/><br/>I can't say the film was truly awful but it didn't make the grade as a psych thriller, I found the music as they entered the island to be very jarring as well, but thats just a personal preference. Also I found the overuse of ""certain imagery"" to be unnecessary.<br/><br/>I would wait for DVD if at all, but there are much better psych thrillers out there."
"martinmcdonough","3","10","21","22 March 2010"," Absolutely dreadful. A complete waste of time.
","I will write this as if a critic instead of dissecting it as I have no desire to re-hash this truly forgettable film.<br/><br/>Shutter Island bills itself as a taut, psychological, edge-of-your-seat thriller brought to you by Martin Scorsese who managed to channel the essence of Alfred Hitchcock. It fails miserably on all those account. It had no suspense whatsoever, plodded along for the majority of the film, was incredibly predictable, and provided no plot twists or surprises at all.<br/><br/>At the opening of the film, when the two US Marshalls played by DiCaprio and Ruffalo approached the hospital, the overbearing cello music was meant to build a heightened sense of suspense. It was more annoying than anything. When seeing that the island had a semi-detached lighthouse, one HAD to know that the climax of the film would take place either in it or around it. And when told that the most dangerous patients were kept in the old Civil War fort, you HAD to know that some key piece of evidence or information would be found there, and probably not easily. Predictability on all accounts did not disappoint.<br/><br/>Another key sign that DiCaprio was not who he thought he was came early on with the alcoholic flashbacks and being given aspirin that was conveniently at the ready in a paper dispensing cup rather then being dispensed out of a standard bottle. And when he and Ruffalo were given Orderly uniforms while their wet clothes were being dry-cleaned, well, all bets were off by then.<br/><br/>There came a point where the suspension of disbelief completely vanished and where the unbelievability of the plot / premise set in. I think that part happened when Koteas showed up for a few seconds and the audience behind me began to chuckle and remarks of ""oh, come on"" could be heard.<br/><br/>One review of this film I have read states that Scorsese achieved a sense of suspenseful claustrophobia. The only time I felt that was when it seemed the walls of the theater were closing in on me after I lost interest in this movie. Either then or when I asked the girl at the box office for my money back."
"dfranzen70","5","10","21","21 February 2010"," Minor Scorcese suffers from a lightweight lead
","Leonardo Dicaprio stars as a U.S. Marshal sent to a remote and forbidding insane asylum in 1954 to investigate the disappearance of a patient. As he proceeds, Teddy Daniels uncovers far more than he bargained for - or is it? In a movie in which nearly everything is actually something else, the audience is redirected too many times for this to be an effective thriller, and some gaping holes in the plot should relegate this to the dustbin in no time.<br/><br/>We first see Marshal Daniels (Dicaprio) on the way to the island via ferry, with his partner Chuck (Mark Ruffalo). Immediately, we size up our protagonist: prone to seasickness, a little grizzled, possibly wrestling with inner demons. Also has a prominent band-aid on his forehead, and as we all know any time a character shows up with a bandage and no explanation, that bandage will come into play later in the movie.<br/><br/>The asylum, Ashecliffe Hospital, is run by Dr. Cawley (Ben Kingsley), a pipe-smoking medical reformer who nonetheless looks down his nose at everyone else. His right-hand man is the assistant warden, McPherson (John Carroll Lynch), who informs the marshals that they must surrender their guns before they can enter the grounds. Again, something this obvious means that the concept will come up later in the movie, and sure enough it does.<br/><br/>Something doesn't quite add up about the missing patient, Rachel Solando. Solando apparently vanished from her room, barefoot, without anyone noticing, on an island. That is covered in rocky terrain. Daniels finds a note hidden under the floor tile that seems to indicate that there's an additional missing patient who's not accounted for. Further galivanting around the island simply unearths more and more facts and clues that don't make much sense. And then we find out that Daniels himself might be hiding something. He fits in very well with everyone else in this regard.<br/><br/>The movie is appropriately shot (by Robert Richardson, who's won two Oscars): moody, unflinching, terrifying at turns, well matched to the setting. But the movie has too many problems to be wholly satisfying. During the movie, one of the characters informs Daniels that being declared insane means that anything you do afterwards can be held up as evidence of your insanity. That makes sense, of course, but the trouble is that that logic can be applied to anything in this movie as well, a sort of self-justification. I Call it lazy screen writing.<br/><br/>And, honest to goodness, I still don't think Leonardo Dicaprio is much of an actor. His matinée-idol looks are already fading - he's got the head of Charlie Brown at this point - but his range hasn't really improved over the past decade or so. He seems to struggle with his reaction shots, and he doesn't have the gravitas necessary for such a heavy role. I'm supposed to believe he's a federal marshal? I'd have trouble believing he's dressed up as a marshal for Halloween. Here, he's supported by a very capable cast - particularly Kingsley, although he seems to be slumming it a bit, and Patricia Clarkson. But for the most part, his character is on his own, and Dicaprio flounders.<br/><br/>Shutter Island is, at best, minor Scorcese, a movie that's high on mood and atmosphere but a little light on a plausible plot. There are too many moments that don't make complete sense when they happen and that can only be supported by the notion that someone - or everyone - is insane."

","I always fear that preconceptions and/or high expectations can cause a film to do worse than it deserves. For instance, walk in to a movie that you know nothing about, and more often than not it will surprise you. On the other hand, walk into a film directed by Martin Scorsese, starring Leonardo DiCaprio, based on a novel written by Dennis Lehane (who wrote ""Gone Baby Gone"" and ""Mystic River"") and a supporting cast that includes Mark Ruffalo, Max Von Sydow, Sir Ben Kingsley and Emily Mortimer, you are almost certain to be disappointed. However, this may have been true with other films but when it comes to a Scorsese/DiCaprio collaboration (for example Gangs of New York, The Departed and The Aviator)I expect a little bit more, and I expect the film to deliver something. This film sadly does not deliver, it does not excite and it does not deserve to be in IMDb's top 250 (which at the time of writing it does). I can only conclude that the masses have decided not to bet against a previously assumed sure thing, and instead vote along with everyone else rather than question the latest Scorsese/DiCaprio collaboration. The film opens on a boat, and within minutes we see DiCaprio and Ruffalo standing on the deck talking. It was from this point onwards that I was disappointed and began to expect very little from the rest of the film. Blue screen? Green screen? Whatever they use, they used it here and it looked horrible. And if nothing else, I have always found that of the Scorsese films I didn't necessarily enjoy in the past I would at least walk out at the end saying how beautiful and authentic everything looked. Well not here. Seriously disappointing. Don't waste ya time!"

With such recent failure, one would hope that the script-writers could do something more imaginative.<br/><br/>Setting this movie in a mental home is such a cop-out because it means that nothing you see has to be real, or make sense.<br/><br/>The excessively overbearing soundtrack is as unsubtle as the rest of the movie, which is to say that even to numb-skull like me, the ending glared out from 15 minutes into the movie, and it was only the precise details that remained to be filled in.<br/><br/>Everyone's acting is first rate, but that does nothing to make up for the lack of satisfaction that this weak movie provides.<br/><br/>Surrealism doesn't automatically make a good movie, any more than a ""twist"" ending. It would have been a far greater twist if DiCaprio's character had gotten away and proved that there WAS a conspiracy...<br/><br/>I had such high hopes for this looking at the people involved with it, but now another great director is struck off my ""always trust"" list.<br/><br/>Has Hollywood's desire for safety tainted even this great director?"
"polos_are_minty","6","6","11","9 April 2010"," Starts very well, but is ultimately let down by a poor resolution
","I was looking forward to seeing this film, I had heard plenty of good things about it, and I know that some of the directors previous efforts are excellent films. I was also looking forward to seeing Dicaprio in this role, as recently his acting has improved so much that he is unrecognisable from some of his earlier films. However I was again disappointed, this seems to have been a step back for him, as opposed to forward. His acting swung from extremely wooden, to bouts of massive overacting.<br/><br/>The film however does have good production values, and the cinematography is good. The film is a pretty standard idea for a psychological thriller, detectives hunting down missing person. It is however slightly different. The director deliberately uses a confining technique, setting the film on an island. It is a clever idea, it creates a sense of entrapment and helplessness. It also allows things to stay small scale, rather then the pan America man hunts some films of this type have become.<br/><br/>The way the film is shot is interesting, there seems to be a reliance on flashbacks to push the story forward, which I think is not a good technique. Rather then finding out what is happening in the here and now, we are slowly drip fed information from the past not all of which is relevant. The set up is interesting, the two agents have not previously worked together, allowing for a better way for the audience to get to know the characters. As the characters relationships develop, so does our knowledge of their backgrounds.<br/><br/>I have commented on Dicaprios acting, which I feel was poor at best. However I must add praise for Sir Ben Kingsley, who in my opinion is brilliant. The actor clearly appreciated the role, because his acting is great. Kingsley is truly the star of the show, and for me steals the lime light from the lesser Dicaprio. What is testament to his skill is that even the most awfully written scenes are delivered faultlessly, like the terrible scene in the lighthouse.<br/><br/>The first half of this film had so much atmosphere, tension and power, I am at a loss as to explain where it goes to after that. But strangely everything seems to disappear after that point. The ending is predictably bad, I mean it seems to be a cheap imitation of so many other films. The ending is so cliché, that it was even used in The Simpsons as a joke several years before this films release. I'm afraid the use of the unreliable narrator was this time poor, it reminded me of the ending of Fallen. Which was in many ways better than Shutter Island.<br/><br/>I still can't quite fathom what happened in the second half, and how they managed to waste such grand potential. I'm afraid this can be scored no more than 6/10"

","A fresh attempt to make a story with an unexpected twist to keep the audience guessing until the end is just what this films attempts to do. Attempts but doesn't quite succeed as well as others have before. The film does leave the audience wondering what really is going on. We have two detectives that arrive at shutter island and must figure out the mysterious disappearance of a patient.<br/><br/>The set design and production values are well accomplished. Leonardo DiCaprio and Mark Ruffalo are accompanied by Ben Kingsley and perform outstandingly through the film. The acting isn't over done and is spot on for each character. The acting really brings to life the story. Although in parts the plot is quite disturbing and can make one look away and cringe for the most part it isn't full of holes and does all tie together.<br/><br/>This film falls short however in the fact that it's so much of a tale about trying to figure out exactly what the real story is that you already guess what the real story is and then have to sit and wait for the picture to tell you what you already know. It's like watching the DaVinci code and knowing what the solution to the puzzle is, the intrigue loses something when you already have the answer to the riddle.<br/><br/>All in all the film is something fresh and tries to be new, It's acting is superb and story line flows fairly well. It simply falls a little boring once you know the punchline. The ending line of the movie however does bump up the score one point just simply because you don't really know how it ends even after you know how it ends."

Either way, it is chock full of bad clichés, almost all of which are lifted from Hitchcock thrillers, but minus the suspense part. It's full of very unlikely scenarios and incomprehensible writing. An example (no spoiler): the island is supposed to be an asylum for the most horrendous criminally insane, can't-find-another-place-to-put-'em criminals, so you might be expecting something like Hannibal Lector, but no; when asked why she's there, one patient says, ""I killed my husband..."" and she ends up in this place???

Discontinuity in shots that I hoped were for on purpose for plot reasons, but was never confirmed. Sometimes it was obvious that a shot wasn't done in one take - a hand on the left shoulder from one angle became a hand on a hip in another. But that's just for starters.<br/><br/>The concept of the film was largely taken from an old silent film The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (sp?), which is a far superior film. The other movies it seemed to steal from include a) The Wicker Man, b) Gothika, c) Identity, and d) from too many Hitchcock films to be named.<br/><br/>Another big problem I had with this film was that it didn't let you become scared. It told you to be. There were too many scenes that didn't pan out and seemed like it was there for fear value. For example, the scene in the cemetery. They didn't find anybody there, but then again they didn't really look. All of the sudden the island was on the brink of a hurricane and they had to abandon the crypt they were forced to hide in. Nothing came of that scene and when the car pulls up to the gate apparently the weather isn't so bad or the guards are just highly undervalued as they're out and about and opening gates.<br/><br/>Not worth watching in my opinion."

","I often enjoy it when what some may call 'prestige' directors forte into what some may call 'mainstream' move-making for a film or two. You get the best of both worlds; a film palatable for a Friday night, and as well as weight behind the camera. Few would argue that Spielberg's War of the Worlds or Ron Howards Angels & Demons are their respective best work but I'm not one to throw on Citizen Kane over Bad Boys II when I simply want to relax after a day in the grind.<br/><br/>The same can be said for Martin Scorsese's Shutter Island. While I don't want to make unfair assumptions about how other filmmakers would have handled the material, his prowess behind the camera certainly adds some pizazz and gravitas to the material. Shutter Island is the third successful instance of a Dennis Lehane novel, after Mystic River and Gone Baby Gone, being brought to the big screen and here's to hoping this streak of winning adaptations continue. This time around we follow U.S. Marshall Teddy Daniels (played by Leonardo DiCaprio) and his partner Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo) as they investigate the disappearance of a mental patient from a stormy island penitentiary off the coast from Boston in 1954. The shifty resident doctor (played deliciously by Ben Kingsley) does not make things easy for the two as Teddy is haunted not only by the facility itself, but by past demons of his wartime traumas and the death of his wife years earlier.<br/><br/>Revealing much more than that regarding the plot would an injustice to the viewer so I shall say no more. What I will reveal is that DiCaprio turns in another star performance and while I feel it may be lost in the shuffle of the year to come, it is an award worthy exploit. His character complexly navigates between instances of professional integrity and unhinged paranoia. Ruffalo is by all means good in his role but it is, to be blunt, unmemorable. Not for his acting but for how the character is written. The real star is the set design and art direction which never release its grim grip for the length of the film.<br/><br/>There is nothing overtly terrible about Shutter Island only that there is nothing outwardly remarkable about it either. The middle portion sags before its fantastic conclusion and there are a few too many flashbacks and dream sequences all of which add up to a solid, but not great genre exercise. Contrary to the ominous aura of the film, the score utilized is far too brash for its own good; clanging and banging its way through the Gothic atmosphere. While I would not go as far as to create a direct comparison, it recalls the disastrous score from 2008's Blindness. It could have gone a long way to use more Drag Me to Hell style acoustics, which utilize everyday objects and sounds to eerie effect.<br/><br/>As is the unfortunate case with many thrillers and horror flicks, I cannot see Shutter Island standing up to repeat viewings with much potency. I will not deny however its sinister mood and great performances kept me more than entertained for 120 minutes and with its complex and rewarding twists it is still the best movie of this young year.<br/><br/>Read all my reviews at simonsaysmovies.blogspot.com"

","I saw this movie yesterday. I have been looking forward to seeing it for months. Let me just say that I am a HUGE fan of Leo and Martin. I love almost everything they do. This movie however was disappointing and predictable. I knew where it was going and I spent the rest of the movie hoping for a change of direction that never came. What a letdown. This is the first review I have ever written for a movie and hopefully that shows all of you how important it was for me to say--DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY. All of the praise I have read for this movie absolutely shocks me. The previews were actually better than the movie. It was not worth the price of admission. I hope this actor and director collaborate again and make a movie that can live up to the expectations that we have come to expect from movies such as The Departed."

","""Scorsese is old-fashioned and is making the same films that DW Griffiths was making early last century."" – Peter Greenaway <br/><br/>(For Part 5 of this quest, see my review of Cronenberg's ""Camera"") <br/><br/>The schizophrenic experience is an experience of isolated, discontinuous and disconnected material, signifiers failing to link up into a coherent sequence. Like the ""heroes"" of Cronenberg's later films, the schizophrenic does not know personal identity (identity depends on the persistence of an ""I"" or ""me""), is unable to create concrete models of self and world, and is incapable of experiencing continuity through time.<br/><br/>These symptoms are themselves associated with our postmodern era, a schizoid age which philosopher Gilles Deleuze calls ""the control society"", in which fragmentation extends like a blanket across every aspect of our lives, from the sciences, to modern psychoanalysis, to our economic models, to technology, to culture/familial/social relations, to art and communication and further outwards and inwards in all possible directions. The last paradigm here is genetic engineering and nano-medicine, fields which are slow moving.<br/><br/>Eventually this schizophrenic confusion scrambles or destroys the possibility of critical perspectives altogether, such as those found in modernist traditions. This is a direct contrast to the modernists who founded cinema, guys like Eisenstein, Pudovkin, Murnau, Renoir, all of whom were loosely allied with an ethic of social realism, and who attempted to capture the vital elements of social reality on screen. Such realism was depicted, for example, in the epic struggles of the Russian Revolution and classic depictions of poverty, exploitation, and upheaval within society. Over time, both modernism and realism followed the path of photographic representation, visible in a plethora of documentaries, docudramas, historical dramas, and other forays into cinema verite.<br/><br/>Eventually, the modernising ethic spawned by Enlightenment rationality and 20th-century industrialism intersected with such wildly divergent influences as Capra, Huston, Visconti and DeSica. When modernism died in the 70s, postmodernism began absorbing the trendiness of Existentialism and reacting to the failure of Positivism's reductionism, and the collapse of socialism's New Left. It re-introduced content, but only ironic content, rejecting any form of realism and becoming anti-realist.<br/><br/>So, in a very general sense, we move from the modernism of the 30s-60s (Eisenstein, Pudovkin, Renoir etc), to the last burst of rebellion in the 60s and 70s (new-modernists like Antonioni, Kubrick, Kurosawa etc who both upheld and critiqued Enlightenment principles), to an age of defeat, giving rise to the increasingly nihilistic, nostalgic and fantastical postmodern era from the late 70s onwards (Scorsese, Leone, Tarantino, Spielberg, Lucas etc). Or, using this century long period as a brain model, we have birth, a burst of hope, increasing disillusionment, impotency, a flight to fantasy and a mental collapse which gives way to pieces of rubble; the schizoid experience. The task now is to sort the rubble, re-organise and rebuild.<br/><br/>This, of course, is what the character of Spider tries to do in David Cronenberg's ""Spider"" (""Spider"" is the same film as ""Shutter Island"", ""wife"" replaced with ""mother""). Cronenberg calls this his ""internet movie"", Spider slowly web-browsing through the debris of history so he can determine whether his father ""traded his mother in for a new one"". Except, the old mother is the new mother, both are prostitutes, and Spider's nostalgia, his need to recreate a happy family that didn't exist, is ultimately what corrupts or skews his own little internet search engine. Cronenberg's typical mind/body splits are thus reversed from this point onwards. The subject's ""computer memory"" isn't reconstructing the past, but actively and constantly destroying memories specifically so it can create new ones which satiate its short term desires.<br/><br/>Enter ""The Departed"" and ""Shutter Island"", two of Scorsese's most schizophrenic films, which operate solely by cannibalising the past and serving it back up as a kind of postmodern, schizoid blip-time carnival. ""I don't want to be a product of my environment,"" Jack Nicholson says at the start of ""The Departed"", announcing the film's disregard for any larger, real world universe. ""The environment"", in this case, is but a collective data-bank of past images, memory traces which Scorsese rearranges and spits back out as mediated drug rush. If ""Goodfellas"" was every gangster cliché jazzed up for modern audiences (the very theme of ""Goodfellas"" is the falsity of itself as a film) ""The Departed"" is ""Goodfellas"" jazzed up, a mash-up of a mash-up, an amalgamation of an amalgamation, blended smoothly together to appeal to testosterone-laden males who get high off the head-shot gratification. In our post ""The Wire"" world (if ""The Wire"" hopes the map the world, ""The Departed"" turns away and serves up static), such things come off as pointless.<br/><br/>Far more interesting is ""Shutter Island"", if only because it shows how far Scorsese has drifted from the neorealist ethic. In this case, the plot is a standard issue Scooby Doo tale in which a police detective investigates a crime at an insane asylum. Throw in countless ""homages"" to Hitchcock, Kubrick's ""Shining"", Lang and a plot that rips off everything from ""The Cabinet of Dr Caligari"" (it's the same film as both the 1920 and 1962 version), ""Repulsion"", ""Spider"", ""Next Door"", ""Shock Corridor"", ""Perfect Blue"", ""Fight Club"", ""A Tale of Two Sisters"", ""Lilith"" ""Detour"", ""After Dark My Sweet"", ""Le Orme"", ""Memento"", ""Inland Empire"", ""The Sixth Sense"", ""The Others"", along with the Holocaust flashback-inserts of Lumet's ""Pawnbroker"" (Scorsese reduces the Holocaust to confetti), and you have one ridiculously evil movie, arguably Scorsese's worst since ""Cape Fear"". Of course it's also his most profitable film to date.<br/><br/>The Departed – 7.5/10 <br/><br/>Shuttler Island - 4/10 <br/><br/>Compare Cronenberg's undercover movie, ""Eastern Promises"" (watch it again, it's gorgeous), with Scorsese's undercover movie, ""The Departed"". Then compare his schizoid movie, ""Spider"", to ""Shutter Island"". Cronenberg examines the very condition Scorsese now wallows in.<br/><br/>(For Part 7 of this essay, see my review of ""Demonlover"")"

","I've heard a lot of folks talk about how shocking the ending of this film was. I've read a few reviews to the same effect. All I can say is . . . really? Have any of you folk what didn't have the whole thing figured out within the first fifteen minutes ever seen any other, ""what a twist"", movies? <br/><br/>I'm actually really disappointed in my fellow man. I'm even more disappointed in Mr. Scorsese. I mean with all the movies that this man has seen and made, well, his expansive knowledge of all things cinema is one of the things you know about him. How could he have failed at subtlety so tremendously here? <br/><br/>Okay here's why I'm so disappointed. A year ago I read part of the book. I got to the point where Daniels and Aule (DiCaprio and Ruffalo respectively) first enter ward C where all the real crazies are kept, got bored with it and never picked it back up. I swear to all that is sacred and holy that I had no idea the story was even going to have a twist at that point. If I had, then maybe I would have kept reading just to see how far I'd get before figuring it out. At any rate, by the same point in the film I had long since had to stifle the urge to shout out in the theatre, ""He's crazy! He's a f***ing patient!"" <br/><br/>Mr. Scorsese's decision to insert the hallucinations so early in the film, for me anyway, just immediately screamed, the man is a loon! And I mean really, these hallucination scenes are the only way that the movie differs from the book--up to the point which I can actually speak for that is.<br/><br/>I'm sick of Hollywood treating us like we're all stupid, taking us by the hand and walking us through each little step. The worst thing is, in hearing the public's reaction to this film I suppose I've found most of us actually need it. My own cousin, as well as reviewers on this site, took issue with, The Wolfman, because it was too subtle in spots, lightly touching on small sub-plot elements, asking you to use your imagination to answer a few questions here and there. I mean we're talking, The Wolfman, was too cerebral for these people.<br/><br/>Just thinking about how many times I've read reviews where the reason a person doesn't like a film is because it didn't answer every single one of their bloody questions, makes want to kick a kitten. Sometimes you don't even have to use your imagination in these cases! Sometimes all you need to do is actually think about what you've seen and heard for a minute before saying you don't get it.<br/><br/>I can't wait to have kids so I can raise them to believe it's COOL to be smart and read books, think for yourself, imagine."

When he begins to believe it, I though there would be some kind of turnover, that he would not actually be a patient and that they were just really great liars, but no, everything is just ending like that.<br/><br/>Some people just left the theatre in the middle of the movie, others were laughing (when it was not supposed to be funny), didn't hear any positive comments on the way out... I went there with 4 other people, we all though it wasn't good (the first word coming to mouth was ""weird"")...<br/><br/>Anyway, this is not a movie I would recommend, judging from the reviews, I guess it's either love or hate."

","This is one of those rare films that only a genius could make. And having said that, I wasn't particularly *entertained* by it. In retrospect I realize there is a lot to it, a lot of implying, a lot of symbolism. Now, I like Scorcese, but I don't love Scorcese. The maestro can direct, no doubt, he can tell stories like none other, and he wields a camera like Davinci, but can he scare us? Not quite, though I don't think he meant to.<br/><br/>This is a movie that just oozes quality, its like a Mercedes, you ride around in a plush and finely crafted interior, but somewhere along the way you lost the feeling of being in control, the passion of driving.<br/><br/>To me the passion is missing in this film. I admire this film for its technical quality, but I was bored. I have two main issues with this film, first, no matter what the artistic intentions were, I disliked the music. It was either an unorthodox use of music in the narrative, or just plain over the top schlock. Second, the storytelling just fails to really engage. I never got caught up in the happenings on screen, in the emotional flow of fear or whatever this was supposed to do to us as we watch. It's broken up by strange dreams and hints and implications that ultimately add up to not really knowing anything, and maybe that was what was supposed to scare us, but I wasn't scared.<br/><br/>When you reach the end of the film, you've been brow beaten into a paranoid state where nothing can be trusted, and then voila' you are shown that everyone was just playing along in a little game. This is both disappointing and interesting to watch, but not frightening.

","This movie was absolute rubbish, from start to finish. The trailers and all the hype concerning this movie, lead the public to believe that it would be worth seeing. With which, I firmly disagree. I could tell you all the reasons, but quite frankly I feel I have wasted enough time on this movie by even watching it. I will tell you that the movie was predictable, depressing, and in very bad taste. It reminded me of one of those old black & white foreign flicks that wreak of morbidity and extremely bad taste. If you like that sort of thing, then by all means go see it. However, if you do not enjoy wasting your time on rubbish flicks,then don't waste your time on this one. I have always personally liked Leonardo, but I think I must chalk this one down as one of his worst acting role ever. Sorry Leo, just giving it to you straight. Of course there will always be someone of notoriety who will swear that the flick is fantastic. Let's be honest. There will be a lot of people that will go along with that. Simply because they think it impresses people to agree with someone of importance. However, people that are easily led around by their noses, rarely make any impressions ...other than being moronic idiots that cannot think for themselves. Needless-to say, I have this extremely annoying habit of thinking for myself, and this movie was absolute rubbish, from start to finish, no matter how many expert reviews to the contrary. Of course, you can always go see it for yourself. If you have time to waste ...why not. Now, I must apologize for wasting your time, as well as my own, to write this ridiculously lengthy way to say the movie was rubbish. However, IMDb does not allow us to just write a 'few' words. If a review does not contain enough words, then you will be prohibited from submitting it. Personally, I would have been quite happy with just saying, 'Shutter Island was Rubbish, from start to finish.' Thank you for reading my review, and have a nice day."
"ppp-45","1","11","25","5 March 2010"," Experience in mass brainwashing.
","Just another lame Hollywood attempt of depicting US/West as good guys as a screen for nefarious business. The twisted theatrics in Shutter deflects attention to the endgame: having us denied reality and to even be wishful for our ignorant state. It left me, a very average theater goer, very saddened and disturbed for being taken in on a deceitful and pitiful ride. The use of really talented actors such as DiCaprio and Kingsley is indicative and on a par with the recipe. Mind you, neither are at their best here as though they had dissonance for being used in a blatant fashion.<br/><br/>Just as Quentin Tarantino said that he made BASTERDS because the Holocaust genre was very much in demand by Hollywood producers and financiers, Martin Scorsese just wasn't going to be left out by the manna train and surest ticket to Oscars. So comes Shutter Island that deals with the gory concentration camp lore but more importantly, expands on the treatments of patients/detainees experienced in both; the first (Shutter) is where a very humane experience is conducted in order to break through a deep case of altered and second personality (DiCaprio); the second was used as labor camps for a war machine or in Hollywood and Holocaust meme, as extermination camps.<br/><br/>Shutter is another Hollyweird attempt to indoctrinate and disinform the general public. Operation Paperclip and Projects MK-Ultra and Monarch anyone? Paperclip oversaw the whitewash of war criminal records of between 3000 and 5000 German scientists (Von Sydow character who enjoys Mahler to make him more engaging) in a clandestine operation to bring them to the US as war loots. There were rocket scientists - Wernher Von Braun - but also and maybe even more so doctors who used humans as guinea pigs, Mengele ways. Paperclip was folded into Dulles CIA in the fifties.<br/><br/>Operation Monarch: covert human mind control project that was instituted in the fifties and early sixties. The roots go back directly to Nazi Germany and Josef Mengele. The goal is to reach and subdue the innermost soul - roughly in age 6 and a half and eight years of age, in every human being, there is a time where the neurones of the brain are not quite fully formed and it was found that if extreme trauma was induced, even to the point of death and torture on a young child, then you can cause these neurones to basically dissociate. They become such that other personalities and even spiritual entities can be implemented in that individual.<br/><br/>It's a perfect cover because the core personality, the true individual is in charge but they have multiple individual (altered personalities) hiding behind the curtain so to speak. A monarch goes from one personality to another that can be triggered externally by an handler without being conscious of it. Sirhan Sirhan, RFK killer was most probably a monarch child.<br/><br/>Teddy Daniels (DiCaprio) is throughout the movie in an altered state as a way to escape a horrendous past that was not of his own doing if one excepts the disfigurement to his supposed ex-partner. All the things alluded in Shutter, rod through an eye, brain butchering are used to demonize inhuman treatments but there are just parts of a whole range of treatments used the world over in mind control. The innocuous role playing which is the base of the whole film only serves to hide what really goes on on Shutter Island or in the US/West as a rule, hence disingenuous.<br/><br/>To accept that only humane treatment goes on is to be a willing denier and co-participant in mass programming. In so doing, we're left with a very simple black and white dichotomy that tricks us into accepting the bad cards we are dealt with in a game of playing with our own brain. The very last sentence Dicaprio says is revealing, something like: Is it better to live as a bad guy or to die as a good guy? And off he goes to the butcher table in a pseudo heroic stance so as ""to kill"" his guilt feelings; be dumb and guilt free, that's Hollywood message. Sorry but I refuse to be lobotomized. Better to live with your eyes wide open and see for what Shutter Island is no matter how bad."
"Doylenf","7","11","25","22 February 2010"," A thinking man's psychological thriller gets the royal treatment from Scorsese and company...
","Relax. This review won't give away the ending which comes as somewhat of a surprise, although many will admit to guessing the overall situation pretty early on.<br/><br/>If you like your mysteries drenched in atmospheric surroundings, look no further than SHUTTER ISLAND. Director Martin Scorsese starts out with murky skies and a foreboding of doom as two men (a sheriff and his partner) approach a rocky coastline on a ferry as an ominous looking island looms into view. The plot, although keeping the viewer in a sea of confusion as it unravels, only becomes clear toward the last thirty minutes--but until then, the less you know about the outcome, the more you will enjoy the satisfying ending.<br/><br/>None of the exposition is direct. Instead, we see the story from the viewpoint of a man (LEONARDO DiCAPRIO) who is obviously very troubled about tragic incidents in his past and who only gradually begins to see things in a different light. His journey is compelling right from the start, thanks to the marvelous performances of DiCaprio and MARK RUFFALO who begin their investigation into happenings at the island housing the mentally insane--some of them very dangerous cases.<br/><br/>Director Martin Scorsese has the benefit of an excellent cinematographer, ROBERT RICHARDSON, whose camera work makes every frame of the film captivating. All of the exterior scenes along the rocky coastline of Maine have a sinister look. The story is told in a leisurely way but there is always an air of mystery in the relationships between the main characters, including BEN KINGSLEY as the psychiatrist in charge of the institution and MAX VON SYDOW as a suspicious looking German doctor.<br/><br/>It's best not to dwell on the final outcome--but let's just say it probably won't come as a complete surprise to everyone. Nevertheless, it's the sort of thinking man's psychological thriller that any mystery fan should be able to savor."
"jessicareid","9","5","9","31 July 2013"," Leo DiCaprio was brilliant & plenty of twists
","I had been wanting to watch this film for a while and when I finally got round to doing so it did not disappoint. Leonardo DiCaprio was perfect in the role of the marshal Teddy Daniels and he really brought the whole film to life with his performance. Mark Ruffalo was also memorable for his portrayal of the supporting character and their relationship was a crucial part of the story so it was important that they both played their parts convincingly. <br/><br/>What I loved about this film was the whole psychological aspect of it which makes it extremely gripping. It's the type of film which constantly makes you wonder who is telling the truth and it pushes the viewers to try and figure out what is really going on. As the film progresses and reaches the final stage there are more and more twists revealed. Even after having seen the big revelation at the end of the film I still know I could watch this film again in the future as it would be interesting to view taking into account the truth at the end. <br/><br/>Even though this film is over 2 hours long it certainly didn't feel like it and the thrilling scenes and build up of suspension throughout made it go so quickly. This film is definitely worth a watch and some people may have mistaken it for a horror from some parts of the trailer but it was simply a good psychological thriller."
"MBunge","5","5","9","14 October 2010"," It's an ""eh"" for a Scorsese film, which means it's still better than a lot of stuff out there.
","With Shutter Island, Martin Scorsese has made the greatest Brian De Palma movie of all time. However as a Scorsese film, Shutter Island is just a bit above average.<br/><br/>Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a federal marshal in 1954 sent to investigate the escape of a prisoner at an asylum for the criminally insane on an island off the coast of Boston. He's joined by a new parter, Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo), who spends most of the movie as one of the most useless sidekicks in cinema history. While investigating, Teddy has to deal with the interference of Dr. Cawley (Ben Kingsley), the head of the asylum, and Dr. Naehring (Max von Sydow), the asylum's chief head shrinker. In addition, Teddy is plagued by memories of his role as a US soldier in the liberation of the Dachau concentration camp and by very involved visions of his dead wife (Michelle Williams), who perished in an arson fire. It turns out that Teddy is looking for the arsonist who set that fire and believes he's somewhere in the asylum. It also turns out that Teddy suspects there's some sort of brainwashing taking place on the island that has something to do with the House Un-American Activities Committee. Then after all of that, there's an elongated twist ending that neither truly succeeds nor truly fails.<br/><br/>The modern standard for the twist movie is, of course, The Sixth Sense. That's because if you took the twist completely out of it, it still would have been a great movie with a compelling story that stood on its own. Shutter Island does not live up to that standard. Take the twist out of this film and there's really nothing left.<br/><br/>Of course it is well directed and well performed. We are talking about Martin Scorsese and a very talented cast of actors. But the story is jammed full of things that just don't work as the movie unfolds, like the uselessness of Mark Ruffalo's character and an excessively melodramatic soundtrack, which are explained and supposedly redeemed by the swerve at the end. The problem with that is twofold.<br/><br/>1. You can see a twist coming a long way away. You might not be able to figure out exactly what it's going to be, but there's enough stuff that either seems forced or doesn't make sense to clue you in that something is going to happen. The story doesn't hold together on its own, so you know there's a missing piece that will eventually be revealed. And once you realize a big revelation is coming, it spoils both the set-up and the payoff.<br/><br/>2. A twist can't retroactively make a movie more enjoyable. The clanging off notes in the script that are later justified by the twist, remain clanging off notes while you watch them the first time. It's like the fruit at the bottom of a yogurt cup. No matter how much you enjoy the fruit, you need to be able to enjoy the yogurt you have to eat to get to it. The yogurt of Shutter Island seems overstuffed, contrived and simplistic.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong. Shutter Island isn't a bad film. It's atmospheric, well paced and narratively ambitious. The movie pretty clearly falls short of fulfilling those ambitions, though, leaving you with the impression that it should be much better than it is. Scorsese and company have made a decent film that many viewers would appreciate. That you can't help but expect more than that, really isn't a fair criticism."
"webmaster-3017","8","5","9","5 April 2010"," HK Neo Reviews: Shutter Island
","Dark and intense mental therapy...<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio is a great actor and together with director Martin Scorsese, DiCaprio moves up a notch. It is not an understatement to claim that Shutter Island only works because DiCaprio makes it convincing. It may seem to be one of Scorsese lesser work in first glance. However, the film does not disappoints, with enough suspense and interesting moments to get us through to the finish line. The ending itself is what made this film a cut above genre conventions. The film ends by raising more questions than it answers and in turn allowing the audience to decide for themselves as to what really happened. For me, it works, but for those looking for answers, it will probably just leave you wondering. Shutter Island is like a classic noir flick, its dark, its murky, it's even depressing, but it is also quite a satisfying experience to sit through.<br/><br/>The movie goes like this: DiCaprio plays a cop who is assigned to an isolated island with a mental hospital. The year is the 1950s and a mental patient have escaped the maximum security of the Shutter Island. Together with his counterpart (played by Mark Ruffalo), they explore the island and like a haunted house or a horror story, nothing is what it seems to be.<br/><br/>Ben Kinsley is what you call a method character actor. He has the unique ability to make even the griminess of smile into something hidden or evil about it. He has the grin and looks of a cunning interior. Kingsley plays a mental health professor, but somehow he is more to it than that. A clever actor in his own right, Kingsley made his character quite an interesting one to watch. DiCaprio as mentioned before carries the film with both of his shoulders. Maturity has certainly passed him by and not for the first time, he continues to impress me with the emotional range that he possesses. His moment of mental breakdown is a joy to watch and if that moment near the end is given to a lesser light, the film may have already been blown off the rails. This is a steady-fast performance that works.<br/><br/>All in all, Shutter Island is a departure from the director usual aim of winning awards, but that does not mean that Shutter Island is any lesser of a movie. With strong acting turns from the increasingly reliable DiCaprio and the ever intriguing presence of Ben Kingsley, Shutter Island is convincing enough to be believable. The thought provoking ending may actually be a blessing in disguise. There is a quote that leaves us pondering: ""Which would be worse, to live as a monster or to die as a good man?"" For me, what it means is that DiCaprio chose to erase his memory and die a good man. The reason to it is simple. One of the saddest and toughest aspects of life is to have a good memory. Memories are what shape us, but also is what makes us more cynical and bitter about the world. At the end of the day, Martin Scorsese has created a movie that allows the audience to come up with their own viewpoint of what happens. Whether that is a good or bad thing, it is really the way you approach and think...(Neo 2010) <br/><br/>I rate it 8/10<br/><br/><ul><li>www.thehkneo.com</li></ul>"

","Excellent art direction, excellent acting, good cinematography. The score was the best part though - a very nice three note ostinato alternating with quiet melody in the cello. The beginning motif is one of the simplest but most affecting since Jaws.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the movie failed in its screenplay. It relied for emotional impact far too much on trite horrible scenes, rather than eliciting powerful emotional responses more subtly. <br/><br/>For example, there are numerous scenes of horrible gore, and there is a long scene with dead children. Obviously, a scene with dead children, especially of a father crying over them, is unsubtle. <br/><br/>In a good film, the emotional climax comes from something whose meaning derives from the film itself. It's cheap and unsubtle, and kind of boring, to rely on old standbys like deformity, gore, and child corpses."

The supernatural elements hinted at by advance materials turn out to be nonexistent. <br/><br/>Worse, this is a throwback to 1940s/50s Hollywood feature in that (HERE COMES THE SPOILER) various action and intrigue happens for the majority of the film...then the final reel is spent with some psychiatrist or other figure of authority explaining at length ""Well, what REALLY happened previously was just an elaborate and implausible charade designed by us to induce a healing repressed-memory catharsis in our patient! Now all is well! Blah blah blah blah...."" That ending NEVER worked (even in ""Psycho""), usually coming off as a con job and turning everything before it into one big red herring. Which is just what happens here. <br/><br/>There are good performances by Mark Ruffalo, Patricia Clarkson and Jackie Earle Haley (the latter two just getting one big scene each). Ben Kingsley, Michelle Williams and Max Von Sydow are in a fair number of scenes yet get pretty much wasted in generic narrative-device roles. The movie is of course well produced, designed, shot, et al. But you know something is wrong when you're watching a supposedly terrifying thriller and midway you think ""Gee that 'creepy' island setting is attractive! I'll bet that would make a nice vacation spot!"" <br/><br/>I realize even Martin Scorcese has to do one for the box office every so often, but this uninspired genre piece (with a story more contrived and less resonant than the prior Dennis Lahane ones adapted for ""Mystic River"" and ""Gone Baby Gone"") feels like a marking-time exercise for everyone involved."

","I'll start with the good first. Overall this movie was very clever. The storyline and plot were intriguing and it definitely plays with your mind. The beginning was very moving, the acting phenomenal, and the end left little room for loopholes as it brought full circle everything that happened throughout the movie. HOWEVER, the middle of the movie, the largest part, was a bit slow. The excessive use of dream sequences was particularly tedious. Perhaps I was disappointed because the movie was advertised as a horror film, when it really is more of a drama. I wouldn't even say it's a thriller, as most scenes are not really ""scary"" but more disturbing. Finally, what most likely will determine how you feel about this movie is whether you figure out the end about 20 minutes into the movie. I'm not one of those egotistical morons who go to movies so they can try and figure out the end before everybody else, but I had a pretty good notion of where this movie was going early on. So as a word of caution if you are used to reading stories from old horror masters like H.P Lovecraft or are an Alfred Hitchcock enthusiast this movie is going to be pretty obvious to you. All in all I would recommend this movie, but I did not find it as amazing as everybody else."
"Maladjusted_1","6","4","7","16 June 2015"," A cartoonlike dystopian by a director of much better films.
","'Shutter Island' is a Martin Scorsese film about a federal officer, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, who visits a high-security hospital for the criminally insane, and this facility is located on a remote island. This setting immediately establishes a feeling of bleakness, isolation and dystopia, which amplifies greatly as 'Shutter Island' progresses. I think that Scorsese's maintenance of the grim atmosphere is one of the strongest qualities of the film, but this hard exterior belies the hollow psychology of 'Shutter Island'. The dark exploration of the mind doesn't hold a candle to 'Taxi Driver', nor do the twists live up to 'The Departed'. I felt as though the portrayal of insanity in 'Shutter Island' was a little too cartoonlike, seeming to resemble something you'd find in Gotham City. This discredits the film, in my opinion, and makes 'Shutter Island' feel very hollow and superficial at times. There are one or two satisfying twists throughout the film, but I don't think that they sufficiently compensate for the tedium of the first half. DiCaprio's objectives in the film seem ambiguous at times, and, combined with the barrage of flashbacks and hallucinations, 'Shutter Island' often feels like a video game played inattentively. The film isn't a disaster, though, as the editing is very enjoyable at times, and Scorsese's creation of the cold, dystopian landscape has to be commended. I just wish that this film was a little more 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest' or 'The Silence of the Lambs', and a little less 'Batman: Arkham Asylum'."

I read so many rave reviews and everybody told me that I had to see this movie, the ending was wild and I'd never ever guess what it was and all that. Sadly, within the first five minutes I realized it was just an updated version of The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, announced that DiCaprio was insane and all that, and infuriated my friends.<br/><br/>I do understand and respect why many people adore Shutter Island. My opinion may be different because I saw Caligari first or it may be because I'm a fan of silent films, but whatever the reason, I find the original more exciting to view."
"cherold","6","4","7","13 January 2011"," Lesser Scorcese film fails to satisfy
","Before I get into the spoilers, I'll just say this is an initially intriguing movie with a great performance by Michelle Williams and a great, brief performance by Ted Levine. It is beautifully filmed but overlong and predictable.<br/><br/>********** SPOILERS BELOW ************** Shutter Island begins well. It has an eerie quality to it that at first suggests it will be some sort of horror movie. In fact, it is filmed as such all the way through, with spooky whispering and dark places and dripping blood. But it is not a horror movie, and much of the problem with Shutter Island is that the tone does not fit well with what the movie actually is.<br/><br/>The movie starts out as detectives Teddy and Chuck come to an asylum for the criminally insane to find a missing patient. How did she escape, why didn't she take her shoes, why are the doctors uncooperative? Interesting questions, but it soon seems there is something more than this going on. Doctors make odd comments and give odd looks. Teddy has weird dreams and headaches. Doctors or patients sometimes say something that oddly suggests they know something about Teddy's life they shouldn't know. Early on, you realize that there is either some conspiracy involving the asylum or that Teddy is perhaps insane.<br/><br/>At a certain point in the movie, it is clear that it is the latter. When Teddy tells his partner that HUAC, the anti-communist organization, is funding medical experiments, it was clear to me that Teddy was a paranoid-schizophrenic. And almost everything in the movie past that point fit with that being the case.<br/><br/>The problem is, the movie keeps playing along with Teddy long after it's obvious he's crazy. There have been very good movies, like A Beautiful Mind and Repulsion, that gave the audience a peak into mental illness, but they didn't try to toy with the audience as long as Shutter Island does. By the time it becomes clear that Teddy is insane, the movie needed to have ready a twist to reframe everything we saw. Instead, Teddy continues with his investigation. It is not until the very end that the reveal happens, and while it adds some interesting details and offers alternate interpretations of previous events, it is too little too late.<br/><br/>A twist only works if you're not expecting it. If you're waiting for it, and waiting for it, and it doesn't come, it's just kind of boring.<br/><br/>I was surprised to discover when I came to this site that a small number of people take Teddy's story at face value, insisting he was sane and driven crazy by the doctors. This makes absolutely no sense, but perhaps it's a result of people not being able to accept that genius Martin Scorcese made a rather obvious, unexceptional movie.<br/><br/>Visually impressive, with some nice scenes and good performances (Williams is awesome as the dead wife), Shutter Island is still overlong and underwhelming. I wish Scorcese had just gone ahead and made the simple thriller I thought was coming instead of this psychological muddle."
"vostf","3","7","15","23 March 2010"," Overused storyline, overblown execution
","This is the third time, and thus the last time, I decide to go watch a Scorsese/DiCaprio movie. A utter disappointment. Di Caprio teamed with Scorsese so he could have a great director to secure a couple of solid films over the years. I don't know who's at fault here, but Gangs of NY, The Aviator, and now Shutter Island are all devoid of emotion. They are symptomatic of this Hollywood cancer were everything looks utterly professional, well designed and nicely crafted, lots of work, energy and dough that can't make up for the lack of creativity. Lots of TV series are much better at that, and no wonder since the best writers are continuously fleeing towards non-cinema formats.<br/><br/>The good points are the location, which would really deserve a better story, Dante Ferreti's settings and the cast - although I'm bored with good boy DiCaprio doing his best with the contrived emotional range stuffed for the main character in those scripts. Scorsese is just a journeyman in those flicks. The story is so heavy handed, it's a pity to see his devoted editor patch together dead-long scenes overflowing with pathos and deliver such this overlong and overblown continuity. There's nothing in Scorsese's direction that makes you feel the ever-present insanity. It's all in the annoying score and cheap horror tricks.<br/><br/>Nuff said. Scorsese can't do great movies if they're not about Italian American marginals and mobsters. With Di Caprio he is bound to do overblown impersonal stuff. And Di Caprio should start to look for a real villain part because we've seen him to much trying to do good with his chubby face.<br/><br/>Bottom line: if I had downloaded this movie instead of going for the big screen, I would most certainly have stopped watching and erase it 45min into the story, would have saved me lots of time and the bore of a movie becoming worse and worse as it rolls out on the sickening pretense of being clever."
"howard.schumann","6","7","15","28 February 2010"," Neither logical nor believable
","Based on a novel by Dennis Lehane and adapted for the screen by Laeta Kalogridis, Martin Scorsese's psychological thriller Shutter Island is set in 1954 on a remote island off the Massachusetts coast that houses Ashecliffe, a mental hospital for the criminally insane. This is where Teddy Daniels, a United States Marshal played by Leonardo DiCaprio, arrives with his partner Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo) to investigate the disappearance of Rachel Solando, a patient who was incarcerated after murdering her three children. The missing woman appears to have vanished barefoot without a trace from her locked cell during the night after leaving a strange note.<br/><br/>Backed by production designer Dante Ferretti and cinematographer Robert Richardson, Scorsese builds a dark, foreboding atmosphere that soon escalates into full-blown uncertainty and dread as the story unfolds. Incorporating aspects of different genres, Shutter Island keeps the viewer off-balance and unable to ascertain with certainty what is real and what is fantasy until the very end. As the investigation begins, we soon discover that the marshal has some back stories of his own that are making things more difficult for him. These include nightmare visions of liberating Dachau at the end of World War II and of lining up and shooting Nazi guards as payback. He is also beset with migraine headaches and flashback visions of his wife Delores (Michelle Williams) who died in a fire.<br/><br/>Teddy and Chuck question patients and orderlies who last saw the missing woman but things become more interesting when they interrogate the psychiatrist in charge, Dr. Cawley (Ben Kingsley). Cawley talks a great deal about his disdain for pre-frontal lobotomies and use of Thorazine and his preference for talk-based therapy but puzzlingly refuses to provide the investigators with important documents they need for their investigation. Also interviewed is Dr. Naehring (Max Von Sydow) whose Germanic persona causes Teddy to have flashbacks of Dachau and raises doubts in his mind that he is being told the truth. People talk in whispers and everyone seems to be keeping a secret and the attitude of Warden (Ted Levine) and Deputy Warden (John Carroll) only adds to the mystery.<br/><br/>As a Category 5 hurricane rolls in, it becomes apparent that no one is going to get off the island anytime soon and doubts begin to arise in Teddy's mind as to whether or not there really was a patient that disappeared or whether he may have been lured to the island under false pretenses. Before long we are immersed in whispers of government experiments being conducted on prisoners in the island's lighthouse, an item straight out of today's headlines where a fully clothed, mutated human body was recently reported washed ashore on Plum Island in Long Island Sound where the U.S. allegedly studies dangerous animal diseases.<br/><br/>Fear is ratcheted up even higher when Daniels reveals a personal agenda of his own that sends the investigation off on a tangent. Unfortunately, the flashbacks, visions, and other visual pyrotechnics pile up, and what began as an intriguing mystery becomes an ordeal of repetitive psychological horror with the screen often filled with tasteless images such as those of dead children and holocaust victims. Though the last fifteen minutes brings a degree of resolution, Shutter Island ultimately wastes the considerable talents of its outstanding cast with an overwrought and overblown production whose premise is neither logical nor believable."

","Was looking forward to seeing this yesterday and thought the set and music at the beginning meant I was in for a good ride. Boy were we disappointed. How this movie is getting all these accolades and rated so highly is a mystery. I guess if Scorsese is directing and Caprio and Kingsley are in it its automatically a winner, not this time. The movie isn't really boring, its the type of movie where you keep expecting something to happen and it never does.Just one scene after another leaving you with that unfinished feeling. Nothing really strange ever happens, which you would expect in a forensic mental hospital, its not particularly violent and the twist is really obvious. Too bad because Ben Kingsley is one of my favourite actors and his role as head Psychiatrist could've been a real scene stealer in a more interesting movie but his role was very pedestrian."

When DiCaprio has his breakdown in Kingsley's office, skip to the end in the lighthouse and finish it from there.

","Shutter Island is a Gothic thriller about Teddy (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Chuck (Mark Ruffalo), two police officers investigating a disappearance at an insane asylum run by Dr. Cawley (Ben Kingsley). The film's first 15 minutes are fantastic, setting the mood just right, but it gets too weird from then on. This is directed by Martin Scorsese, a usually wonderful director. Scorsese's best films investigate the main character and peeling back his or hers layers. That's just where the problem starts with Shutter Island. The film has too much going on and never gets to fully peel back the layers of any of the characters. There are Teddy having nightmares about the war & his wife, the disappearance plot, and a bunch of twists & turns. It plays mind games with its audiences for 2 hours before making sense with its final 20 minute twist. That brings me to my next point, the film is too long. It's 2 hours & 20 minutes, which is far too long for such a weird & uneven film. I've always thought Mark Ruffalo was underrated & a good actor, but he's given nothing to do with his character. His character is extremely dull. Scorsese's use of sound is also torturing. Overall, Shutter Island spends too much time stalling and ends up being unsatisfactory in the end. I can't recommend it to anyone, because life is too short to spend 2 hours & 20 minutes watching this."

","This film was a traditional Scorsese picture. The cinematography was fantastic, acting excellent, music emotional and direction superb. That being said, I have trouble saying that this film is an instant classic. The technical elements were sound. If I were to go through with a score sheet, ""Shutter Island"" would receive a perfect 10 in each category, yet something about the film left me wanting more. I don't blame the ambiguous ending. On the contrary, I enjoy an ambiguous ending. (""Gone with the Wind"" anyone?) I can't put my finger on what it lacked for me, but I can safely say it was missing that something that I was hoping for. Perhaps, it was the hype that surrounded the movie. Well, say that's what it is...for now.<br/><br/>Onto the positive aspects of the film, the first thing to strike me was the fantastic score Scorsese compiled. Classical music was used sparingly and effectively. Also, the use of silence in this film was remarkable. As Teddy (DiCaprio) is walking through the terrifying halls of the mental hospital, the silence scares the audience more so than the darkness and prison-like cells patients are thrown into. <br/><br/>The cinematography was also fantastic in this film. I loved the switch in color palette between life on Shutter Island and the recesses of Teddy's mind. This plays a huge part in the story line, helping the audience decipher what is real and what is clearly a hallucination though even that can trip you up.<br/><br/>The acting was wonderful. DiCaprio is at his finest. He is believably and charming. You can't help but empathize with his character, no matter what. Ben Kingsley is intellectually terrifying. Though not the same, his performance hearkens to Christoph Waltz in ""Inglourious Basterds,"" Mark Ruffalo is overshadowed in this film but does a nice job. Emily Mortimer is quite convincing as a mental patient and Michelle Williams' depth was a pleasant surprise. I didn't think she'd play quite as large a role as she did.<br/><br/>Scorsese directed. I think that's all I have to say. He is a master. He knows what he wants and how to get it."

","Shutter Island, Scorsese's fourth film featuring Leonardo DiCaprio, recounts the unnerving of a U.S. Marshal with his arrival at the Ashecliffe Hospital for the Criminally Insane to investigate the disappearance of an inmate. The film is categorized as a horror film but falls more appropriately under the rubric, psychological thriller. Despite an all-star cast and a variety of technically adept cinematic features, the film falls short for a Scorsese work and even shorter for a horror film. <br/><br/>Teddy Daniels, the protagonist played by DiCaprio, is partnered with Chuck Aule, (Mark Ruffalo) in this investigation. Daniels' own psychologically debilitated state is made apparent through recurring graphic flashbacks of his involvement in WWII and through hallucinations of his recently deceased wife. The film opens with Daniels vomiting on the ferry destined for the island, the camera following him under deck as he tries to gather himself. Such vulnerability does not serve him well at the outset and beyond and suggests possibly that he might some day be greeted as an inmate himself. Indeed, upon entry into the facility, he is welcomed by a setting of low ceilings and chains as if, in time, he might find himself, given this introductory psychological makeup, restrained by them. Such symbolism is only the beginning of what makes the outcome of the film remarkably predictable...<br/><br/>To read the rest of the review visit: http://www.soundonsight.org/shutter-island-review-2/"

","When I first saw the trailer for this film I have to admit I was excited, I thought that Hollywood might have gone back to the good old psychological thrillers that I have grown to love. The trailer gave the impression of a sense of dread and suspense that looked set to follow through the entire movie. The trailer also set the scene for a film with twist and turns and frights round every corner. The only fight I got from this film as just how terrible it really was, the film tells the tale of two Federal Marshals that go to the mysterious Shutter Island in search of an escaped mental patient. So far so good right? That's what I thought. As the film progresses that main character Teddy Daniels , played by Titanic star Leonardo DiCapiro, dives deeper into the dark history that surrounds the Island and goes in search of the truth and uncovers a dark and sinister plot. Now I don't know about you but as soon as they stepped foot onto a Insane Asylum I started to have my doubts about this film and had pretty much guessed the ending. But I thought that I would give Mr Scorsese a chance to, as more mysteries are reviled to us it becomes clearer that the film is going to end just how I thought. This isn't helped by the fact that we get repeated flash back of his gory past in the army and the fact that he keeps seeing his dead wife, does exactly strike you as a sane man. With the mention of the lighthouse that is the apparent venue for grizzly and nasty experiments was the final ail in the coffin for me with this film. <br/><br/>First off the horror, well to be frank there isn't any, besides from one jumpy moment the horror is basically non existent and it's a shame cause this film had such potential to be a frightening movie. I mean it had all the ingredients dark scary Island, dark hidden secrets and crazy people, the things that got me the most as I sat in the movie theatre waiting for the to be something jumping out at me but nothing. I know that jumping out of your seat isn't all that makes up a horror but at the lack of a plot it normally helps. <br/><br/>The storyline, or should I say what there is of it, is not a terrifying twisting and turning story of one man battle to find the truth. Its just bloody confusing and I don't mean in a good way sure I'm all up for films to make you think but not just completely and utterly lose you half way through only to give you and ending that you could have figured out with half the hassle. I mean just because the film has a weak ending doesn't mean you can completely try and lose the audience in the rest of it to make up for it. As for the flash backs and visions of his dead wife this only helps to add to the films predictable ending. <br/><br/>All in all I found this film a huge disappointment which is a shame cause I wanted so much to like this film I really did. On paper with the director and the basic storyline this could of made movie gold but I'm afraid to say is more likely to make the bargain bin."

The opening is great and for a few moments you think it's going to be a great movie, but quickly the story loses any forward momentum. The main character's hallucinations quickly overshadow any plot that was beginning to develop. The script sets up a false premise that really has nowhere to go. Indeed the script is telegraphing the end right from the start giving the bulk of the film a strangely aimless feel. I am amazed anyone could find it tense or refer to it as a horror film.<br/><br/>A good psychological thriller needs to make you believe in it, but with the director undercutting the reality every step of the way I actually found many of the scenes laughable. Truth be told it seemed many of the actors were also struggling with the script and only clicked in at the end when there was a real story to be told. <br/><br/>Unless you're a big Scorsese fan, save your money. My guess is this will be on television before you know it."
"DailyScrawl","9","6","13","11 March 2010"," Verdict: Engaging, entertaining, and intelligent — if you let it suck you in.
","Have you ever lost your orientation under water? Fallen into a river and momentarily become unsure of which direction is up and which is down, for example? It may only last a split-second, but it's a terrifying experience. While never frightening or terrifying, Shutter Island brought me as close as any movie has to becoming that disoriented, and it can do it to you too if you let it.<br/><br/>Overview<br/><br/>The movie starts out rough. Some wooden dialogue is exchanged between two detectives on a ferry. Honestly, it had me worried those first few minutes. Fortunately it doesn't take long for the mystery to begin, and after that it's hard not to get pulled in by the questions that build up. The movie keeps you chasing after answers like a carrot on a stick. If you pay attention, virtually every scene adds more questions to the mystery, and any answers that are given become increasingly tenuous.<br/><br/>While the unanswered questions about Shutter Island drive the story forward, there's more than mystery to keep you entertained. That's an important point — the movie holds its own even if you're familiar with the plot. Most of the dialog is clever. While the characters are flat and 2-dimensional, each one functions well within the story. Interesting silhouettes all, you could say. Possibly the most intriguing aspects of the film are the dream sequences. To me they felt very dream-like (a hard trick to pull off), and they intertwine with the plot brilliantly.<br/><br/>The Cast<br/><br/>Every actor is well placed in their part, and it's an interesting assortment of talent. Ben Kingsley is a stand-out and manages to convey the position and feelings of his character with simple glances and expressions. Leonardo DiCaprio well, as always, his acting is excellent in some ways, but at times I felt like his voice was too controlled and somewhat stiff. I also have a suspicion that he intentionally seeks roles that don't suit him just so that he can show his breadth of range. Once or twice during the first half of the film I found myself wondering about this once. As the story progressed, however, I began to identify with him more and more as Teddy Daniels, and I began to see less of DiCaprio. I could have sworn that his acting got better as the movie progressed, but that might have been my mind playing tricks on me.<br/><br/>Some of the most interesting acting went into the minor roles — Patricia Clarkson, Emily Mortimer, Max Von Sydow, Ted Levine and Robin Bartlett all deliver memorable, if brief, performances.<br/><br/>The End<br/><br/>Without going into details, all I'm going to say is that the end of the movie is very satisfying, in a thought-provoking way, and not because of any ""twist."" The last line, in particular, has interesting interpretations. (Note: If you've seen the film and you're confused about the last line, I've written a few brief words on it)<br/><br/>How to enjoy this movie:<br/><br/>* Commit yourself to trying to solve the mystery of exactly what's going on, and just go along for the ride.<br/><br/>* Don't expect a whole lot of action. This movie is full of suspense and mystery, but not much of a thriller.<br/><br/>* Don't expect the main character to make all the right moves. It's easy to think ""He should be doing this,"" or ""Man, what's he thinking? I wouldn't do that,"" but then again we have a bird's eye view of this story's progression.<br/><br/>* Pay attention to where people cast their glances throughout the movies. Very telling? Maybe, maybe not. Very interesting, for sure.<br/><br/>* Don't put the weight of your judgment on ""the twist"" (this one applies to all twist movies). I don't understand people who do their best to guess what the twist is going to be, only to whine and complain when they get it right. They set themselves up for disappointment and then blame it on the movie rather than themselves. My advice: Don't fall into that trap. Simple as that.<br/><br/>Weak Points:<br/><br/>* If you try to get the better of this movie, or try to be smarter than it, you might succeed but then you won't get anything out of it. Intellectual masochists beware."
"Coventry","7","6","13","6 March 2010"," Island of high expectations but slightly lobotomized results
","Perhaps I should better begin this user comment by underlining that I'm primarily a horror fanatic and, moreover, that I have a specific exaltation for genre movies taking place on (A) remote inescapable islands and largely set in (B) mental asylums. I've seen numerous cheap horror movies, ranging from astounding to abominable, featuring one or both of these keywords and I personally think they are fundamental components to help determine the creepiness impact of a certain horror movie. ""Shutter Island"" features both these key ingredients as well, so normally this should have been one of my most anticipated movies ever, but instead I was quite skeptical ever since I first saw the trailer. First and foremost I'm annoyed again that everybody seems to avoid labeling this as a horror movie. Like it's still common to think horror is in an inferior genre that acclaimed directors and actors don't even lay their hands on. If you look on the main page on this website, ""Shutter Island"" is categorized as drama, mystery and thriller. I assure you, given the subject matter and the scenery featuring here, this is a horror film. It has everything to do with atmosphere and nothing with bloodshed or ax-wielding maniacs. Secondly, I tend to be very tolerant and easygoing on those aforementioned cheap horror movies because they're often low-budgeted and struggling movies from aspiring and hard- working directors. However, in the case of ""Shutter Island"", where the budget is practically unlimited and all the involved people are highly respected and critically acclaimed names, I feel I'm entitled to be extra demanding. I expect everything to be impeccably perfect, including the plot, the atmosphere, the set pieces, the acting performances, the directing, the continuity and the tension level. <br/><br/>The greatest news to announce is that ""Shutter Island"" lives up to most of these expectations, especially when it comes to atmosphere and choice of locations. Right from the opening seconds already, you can tell this will become a thoroughly ominous and gripping film with a professional eye for detail. A ferryboat appears from a thick cloud of fog, there are clear signs of an approaching hurricane, there is recitation about an ""asylum for the criminally insane"" and the first long images of the titular island are brought under the guidance of excruciatingly sinister musical tones. The intensity of the opening sequence promptly grabs you by the throat and you want the two main characters – Federal U.S. Marshals Teddy Daniels and Chuck Aule – to get away from the island as far as possible before they even set foot on it. ""Shutter Island"" first unfolds as a compelling mystery set in the paranoid and depressing post- WWII era of the early 1950's. The island is a controversial governmental place where the Doctors Crawley (Ben Kingsley) and Naehring (Max Von Sydow) are running a mental institute facility for ""normal"" male and female cases as well as incurably dangerous patients. The Marshals are called to the island to investigate the inexplicable disappearance of a female patient, but there's obviously a lot more brooding underneath the surface. The doctors and wardens deliberately boycott the Marshals' investigation and Teddy Daniels has a personal and much more critical agenda to fulfill. He's looking for the pyromaniac patient responsible for the death of his wife and he intends to expose the island as a place where the American government uses mental convalescents as subjects to experiment upon. Teddy also suffers from painful War traumas, like the sights of frozen cadavers in a German concentration camp, and he still has conversations with his deceased wife Dolores. When the hurricane vanquishes the island, Teddy and Chuck see an opportunity to sneak into the infamous C-Block, where they lock away the worst cases and presumably the experiments, but the revelations where Teddy stumbles upon as from that moment are certainly not what he expected or hoped to find out. <br/><br/>""Shutter Island"" is the type of film that overwhelms and deeply impresses you with plot twists, subliminal themes, red herrings, convoluted conspiracy theories, character drawings growing increasingly complex and intriguing but ultimately irrelevant sub plots. The script feels like a solidly structured and tightly woven wholesome for as long as you're watching the film, but it's definitely worthwhile to analyze the movie afterwards. Unfortunately I can't elaborate too much without revealing some essential plot elements, but I urge you do it yourself. Once you leave the cinema or take the disc out of the DVD player, starting thinking back about the little things that were done or said throughout the entire film. Movies like this deserve to be discussed and analyzed rather than to just walk away with a feeling of overall astonishment. You'll notice that some minor details fit in perfectly with the denouements revealed at the end, whereas other story aspects will suddenly become illogical, senseless and implausible. And also, if you've seen a lot of grim, obscure and long-forgotten horror movies (the kind I talked about in the first paragraph), well than you honestly won't be surprised at what you see that often. You won't hear me claim that ""Shutter Island"" is unoriginal or predictable, but like so frequently the case, it does incorporate many little facets (whether just a certain noise, bizarre characteristic or tiny plot detail) that I spotted already in other movies. That really isn't a complaint; merely a footnote. I don't intend to say that ""Shutter Island"" ripped any other films, simply that horror fanatics are likely to be slightly less impressed than the more mainstream audience. My only main complaint is that I personally found ""Shutter Island too long. Admittedly I have a bit of an aversion towards long films, but I really felt that some of the sub plots and repetitive hallucination sequences could have been cut shorter. The filming locations, set- pieces and scenery are tremendous and particularly the re-creation of the 50's atmosphere is admirably accurate."
"barbara-czarniawska","5","6","13","25 February 2010"," Sinking in the middle, rescued in the end
","The middle of the movie is so pathetically bad, that one really wants to leave the movie theater (I did). I expected a Godzilla or a vampire to crawl out of a hole at any time (this is NOT a spoiler!) Luckily, it pivots and arrives at the end as a fairly interesting attempt. ""Fairly"": in general, the movie needed a cruel editor, who would have cut out the middle, or most of it. My suggestion would be to cut out all so-called Dachau scenes (so-called, because the picture of the gate shows Auschwitz). The Disneyization of the concentration camps continues, although one could have hoped that Scorsese would know better. He didn't, but perhaps this is common to all the US directors. They do not seem to believe it was real, and as a result treat it completely disrespectfully.Think about ""Letters from Iwo Jima"" done in the same manner: the protests would never cease. DiCaprio was good, no doubt about it: shouldn't he be given a better chance?"

","If you're a fan of pointless movies with no real plot other than continual misdirection then this movie isn't for you.

","So, I watched this, despite not being that fond of thrillers, way back when it was released... and I liked it at first, the atmosphere was amazing, the visuals stunning, and the plot became more and more complex as we learned not everything is what it seems with the island, hinting at experimentation and conspiracies. And then comes the last 10 or so minutes of the movie, revealing basically everything was in our main character's head. Seriously, I kept hoping this was just a final ""maybe it isn't!"" twist and there would be another one, like in the Lazarus Project, but nope. It was disappointing. The conspiracy story was far, far more interesting than the real ending about a run-of-the-mill ""dead wife and kid"" past of the protagonist. Maybe I am spoiled with having thrillers with interesting twists, or because I prefer the strange to the mundane, but ending it all on Ben Kingsley shaking his head and saying the treatment was not a success was one of my biggest annoyances that year."
"Screen_Blitz","9","3","5","31 December 2015"," Twisted, somber, but hugely entertaining Scorcese thriller
","Martin Scorcese has laid many cinematic landmarks in crime genre, and as a result, has earned a spot as one of the most influential directors to ever step foot in Hollywood. He has been met with much critical acclaim with his gritty portrayal of the gangster life in his film such as Taxi Driver, Goodfellas, Casino, Gangs of New York, and The Departed. Teaming up with his frequent collaborator Leonardo Dicaprio, Scorcese takes a more dark and surreal direction in this psychological thriller set with plenty of twists and turns. Leonardo Dicaprio plays U.S Marshal Teddy Daniels, who travels across seas to investigate a mysterious and deserted island along with his partner Chucke Aule (played by Mark Ruffalo). There lies a hospital run by Dr. Cawley (played by Ben Kingsley) and Dr. Neahring (played by Max Von Sydow) holding mentally insane prisoners, where Daniels and Aule are in search of a patient named Rachel who has mysteriously disappeared. Going further into their investigation, the two quickly turn the dark and sinister secrets behind the wretched prison of a hospital, soon to the point where Daniels deteriorating of his mental state and his identity all together. <br/><br/>Mixing elements of neo noir and elements of pure horror, this film conveys a dark and surreal plot that unfolds to something truly shocking and well crafted in a unique way. The psychological elements conveyed throughout the story go very deep in ways that may remind those who seen films like 'Seven' or 'The Sixth Sense' as these both deal with individuals who are psychological damaged. This film paces steadily through one spine- chilling thrill after another, and as the story progresses, the tone gets more and more eerie; building up an astonishing plot twist at the end that is likely to leave you startled. Like David Fincher's 'Seven', this film never lightens up in tone, giving you the feeling of hopelessness throughout its run time, yet it's still entertaining. The plot doesn't go without its flaws however. The film has its moments where gets overly convoluted to the point I could leave you scratching your head. Ultimately, the plot picks up not to soon before it reaches its grim climax.<br/><br/>Leonardo Dicaprio has been one of my favorite actors for as long I can remember, an actors always shows off powerful performances, yet has never landed an Oscar for his works. His performance as the main character Teddy Daniels is terrific. He is very charismatic throughout, especially when his character go through some spine-chilling changes. Mark Ruffalo who plays his partner also deserves some applause for his performance, playing his role very solid and willfully. Ruffalo is who I believe is an underrated actor and hope garners an Oscar one day (as well as Dicaprio). <br/><br/>Shutter Island is a twisted, but stunning piece of entertainment by Martin Scorcese, complete with a terrific screenplay, powerful performances, and a strong narrative that grabs your attention. This is much different than the typical Scorcese fare. Nonetheless, it is astonishingly entertaining."
"aedesjanus","6","3","5","20 June 2015"," Hall of Endless Mirrors and Little Else
","Scorcese at 67. Obviously it needs to be full, luxurious, and each moment complete. No part of the film should disappoint, or elude the control or presence of the auteur. In consequence, each scene is carefully played out to satisfy the intent of the director, while he remains motionless. Although Shutter Island uses the dependable trope of cherchez la femme, a more appropriate focus would be the search for the réalisiteur. This is not to be confused with a lack of directing. The film is so over-directed that it ceases to be just that. And the film unwittingly deconstructs this very theme.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio, plays Teddy Daniels, a United States marshal taking a ferry ride out to the island to investigate the disappearance of a patient in 1952. Like gangs of New York, the production design cannot be outdone, and thus lacks the spark of imaginative interpretation. There is no leap of faith required to believe in the environment created. What it makes up for in authority of voice, it loses for being lifeless and imperial. Like the experience of a theme park, every character we meet is to be no more and no less than we expect. No character should break out because it cannot conform to the role.<br/><br/>We watch DiCaprio playing the role of a man on a search in a flawlessly constructed historical über-reality. At no point do we stop seeing DiCaprio playing this role, and being the actor he is, we go along with it. At no moment do we actually feel like the constructed environment is anything but that. The film unfolds with increasing use of overly mannered genre fragments from thrillers and horror films, including a sound track that gives the literal interpretation of the visual dimension an updated definition. This only gets past us because we are in a fascinating theme park with a mesmerizing tour guide. All this schtick is supposed to provide the emotional aesthetic for DiCaprio's descent into the revelation of his insanity.<br/><br/>But this does not reveal anything about Scorcese, DiCaprio, the period so meticulously reproduced, or any one of the particular grand themes the film nods towards. This is particularly telling in the scenes set in the liberation of Dachau. The portrayal is heavily sanitized. The piles of bodies, in civilian clothes, not starved, and covered in snow. On the one hand one could applaud the unwillingness to engage in ""KZ pornography"", yet these images deprive the victims of the horrors they endured. They are not permitted the death they experienced, because it would obviously disrupt Scorcese's meticulously framed indulgence. The film viewer shares the same fate as DiCaprio, as he struggles to find any meaning in all of this .<br/><br/>DiCaprio's ""decision"" at the end of the movie to retain his madness, at the expense of a lobotomy, underscores this. He sacrifices his ability, and the burden, to adjudicate ambivalence and substance in order to formally assert his right to illusion. And by analogy, Scorcese affirms his own right to indulge his parallel reality, independent of what substance it may have for anyone involved. The problem is that, unlike Taxi Driver, he is not a (young) creator in search of himself in the periphery of society's failure. Shutter Island unwittingly serves as an example of how a film exemplifies the evisceration of once insightful creative indulgence, made possible only by the legacy of former successes.<br/><br/>The film is Scorcese's largest grossing movie. This success does little more than underscore the fact that it has no real intended audience. It is a Martin Scorcese film that exhausts itself in being that. The film carries us forward in the unfolding of an exquisitely crafted conceit that is entirely harmless and ultimately meaningless. This apotheosis of form is at the core of imperial entitlement. Through it Scorcese exercises his power and agency. But this proof is only of particular interest to Scorcese and the stakeholders around him. There is no place at the table for uncontrollable elements like substance or real pain."

","After having recently finished reading Dennis Lehane's smart,tense Gothic Horror mystery-Noir novel Shutter Island,my anticipation for seeing the film adaptation greatly increased when I found out who the director and cast were that are connected to this movie,which started to make me really looking forward to going on a holiday to Martin (who due to both of us never having exchanged X-Mas cards with each other,I will not call ""Marty"") Scorsese's Shutter Island.<br/><br/>The plot: <br/><br/>Arriving to a hospital for the criminally insane based on an isolated island in 1954,US marshal Edward ""Teddy"" Daniels (who has been brought out of early retirement related to the brutal murder of his wife by ""the force"",who feel that he is one of the very best for this case) and new recruit to the force: Chuck Aule go to meet the chief psychiatrist, (Dr. John Cawley) on Shutter Island to find out why they have been ordered to pay a visit to the isolated hospital.<br/><br/>Hardly wasting any time with even greeting Teddy and Chuck,Cawley tells the marshals that they have been ordered to pay a visit to the place,due to one of the hospital's most dangerous patients (Rachael Solando) having mysteriously ""disappeared"" from Shutter Island a few days ago and not leaving a single trace of where she may have gone.Deciding to search Solando's cell,Daniels and Aule do an extensive search in the cell and sadly find no clues at all to what may have happened to Solando.<br/><br/>leaving the cell,Teddy suddenly notices that one of the floor panels is broken.Carfully moving the panel,Daniels finds a cryptic note,strongly hinting about there being a ""secret"" patient hidden deep inside the hospital.Being told by,the suddenly frightened looking Cawley that he should ignore the note as ""The words of a mad woman"",Daniels begins to wonder what Cawley is trying to keep hidden away on Shutter Island,and also if it might be connected to the man that killed his wife.<br/><br/>View on the film: <br/><br/>Smartly focusing on the essential elements of Dennis Lehane's novel,screenwriter Laeta Kalogridis cleverly makes sure that the Neo- Noir and Horror elements of the plot stay evenly balanced,with Teddy's flashbacks to the last days he spent with his wife allowing Kalogridis to create some very strong macabre moments,whist Daniel's (played by a tense Leonardo DiCaprio) and Aule's (played by a fantastic ""by the book,sir"" Mark Ruffalo,who along with this,2004's Collacteral and 2007's Zodiac has become one of the main faces of 00's Neo-Noir) increasingly dangerous search for the ""truth"" on Shutter Island allows Kalogridis to build a good Neo-Noir feel,as Teddy and Chuck get deeper in the murky waters surrounding the island.<br/><br/>Although Kalogridis does not build the solid foundation which made Lehane's ""turning of the cards"" truly masterful,and also shockingly gets near to giving away the ""twist"" early on, Kalogridis is still able to get some ""kick"" from the ending,by including a number of moments,which initially look completely minor,before the film unleashes its ""surprise"" and makes those moments look like some of the most important sections in the movie.<br/><br/>For Teddy's dreams,director Martin Scorsese shows an amazing eye for just using the right amount of CGI to make the scenes really unsettling,whilst never taking the easy option of completely going overboard with the CGI.<br/><br/>Despite the film having an absolutely fantastic setting which looks like a near guarantee for the movie to be filled with thrills and chills,Scorsese unexpectedly shows a restrained side to his directing for most of the film,which despite having a misty feel never transformers into becoming a truly under the skin haunting atmosphere which would have made Shutter Island a place that you would never want to leave."

But the conclusion of Shutter Island is similar to the end we've already seen in a bunch of other movies, such as ""Identity"", ""The Others"" and ""Never talk to strangers"".<br/><br/>I strongly wished the writers of this film were a little more daring and could have had more creativity to make it more original and amusing.

Maybe I read too many books, and watch old films too much, but I find it surprisingly easy to predict the stories of these "" Dolly-wood tries to be clever"" films. <br/><br/>Lovely cast and still a great watch, cinematography great, but all the over the top tension building music in the beginning was intensely annoying, even though I understood what they were trying to do.<br/><br/>I'll watch this film every five years or so, worth buying when it's on the eight dollar shelf."
"kosta-pap","6","3","5","4 April 2010"," Decent thriller, surprisingly polarizing
","I was very surprised to find this film was either loved or hated by most reviewers. Of course, it tends to be an inherent quality of publicly posted comments that people with strong opinions will be the ones who will bother to post, but still... I thought the film was a decent and well-made one. Predictable - yes. Over the top acting - come on, it's Marty! Too long - again, Marty. However, I must insist that the predictability of the ending was rather a strength of the film: If one were to follow the ""conspiracy/detective"" plot through 2 hours, it's logical that the ending will disappoint - but that's your problem, dear viewer! Not only is the insanity plot much more interesting, the film becomes much more interesting once you watch it from this premise. For example, the warden who drives Teddy back from the cliffs, who isn't buying into the doctors' tactics and gives him the ""you're dangerous and violent"" comments: great scene, but merely weird if you haven't suspected the context. Flaws: The score was horrible. Horrible. Destroyed many scenes, and I'm so glad Marty toned it down toward the end. The dead children scenes were redundant and extremely overused; then again, Marty always does that with his favorite ""symbols"": rubbing it in, again and again. Some of the dialogue could have been much better written, but it's a mainstream movie after all. One last note on the history of psychiatry: the struggle between psychosurgery and modern psychiatry devoted to the phenomenology of the patient's narrative - that is a true fact, and it did begin in the fifties. Furthermore, going along with a patient's delusion at crtain points of the therapeutic process: I'm appalled that many reviewers found this so absurd. I'm a psychiatrist and it's my line of work. Granted, the film is an exaggerated version of that, but it's fiction after all."

","What is nagging me the most about this film is that it is not really bad, it's just not particularly good, and at times it gets rather boring.<br/><br/>Many reviewers are stating that the plot ""twist"" is predictable within the opening moments of the film, and they are not wrong. Unfortunately, once the twist is guessed at (or even as it is revealed in the film) all that is left is some brooding cinematography and an overtly dramatic music score that fails to excite. There are some brutal WW2 flashback moments, but their relevance is questionable and rather than add weight to De Caprio's character and the plot they are more likely to frustrate an audience who wished there was more to them. Some of the imagery throughout is brutal and chilling, but it does not go far enough when the plot itself fails to unnerve. Moments of exposition are too drawn out, De Caprio is good but I've seen his range of expressions numerous times, Kingsley is convincing but his character is barely fleshed out.... <br/><br/>From the opening moments it is clear that this film is directed by a brilliant film maker, but as the hours drag on one starts to ponder if the script were written by a brilliant screen writer. Ultimately, dwelling on the thought that Scorcese could be behind something so average is likely to drive a person insane. Best avoided."

The pairing of Dicaprio and Rufalo was also fresh.<br/><br/>But frankly, I've had one too many intense Leo/Scorcese movies with Leo faking some hard-boiled east coast accent and getting into a lot of arguments. Give it a rest. Everyone played themselves. Ben Kingsley, Mark Rufalo. Which is fine sometimes, but not much of a challenge.<br/><br/>This thing went on forever. There are multiple scenes of bloody dead children and grotesquely mutilated adults. It flirts with some left wing propaganda about anti-Communist witch hunts or brainwashing, and dabbles in ""America is just as sinister as other countries"" narrative.<br/><br/>Why not? The book writer and the movie people involved are probably Leftists. I'll give it some credit for a few good lines here and there, good acting by some of the bit players, and great atmosphere.<br/><br/>But I don't recommend watching this thing in one sitting.

His acting here is a little forced and not great. Anthony Hopkins would have been a much better choice for the role. The movie lacked flow and directing was pretty poor. Martin Scorsese films really set-up a scene and situation to highlight the actor and unfortunately Leonardo didn't bring his 'A' game. Maybe I'm being to critical because the movie meandered around too much for anybody to really shine. The whole movie is just a really long set-up for the ending.

","Martin Scorsese's Gothic thriller works overtime to wring chills from its creepy setting (an institution for the criminally insane) and mysterious plot twists. But despite, or maybe because of, all of the obvious and heavy-handed directorial flourishes (moody film noir lighting, constant rain and thunder, a screechy score that announces every emotion you should be feeling before you're allowed to feel it), the film is surprisingly unengaging and, even more surprisingly given its stylish director, fairly pedestrian.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio plays a federal marshal who travels with his partner (Mark Ruffalo) to the eponymous island to investigate the disappearance of an inmate. They butt up against uncooperative administrators (Ben Kingsley, Max von Sydow) and uncover a possible conspiracy that involves inmates being used in mind-control experiments similar to the ones inflicted by the Nazis on concentration-camp Jews. Throughout, we're treated to dream-like flashbacks in which we learn things about DiCaprio's past and help us understand the personal vendettas driving his behavior. Everything builds to a surprise plot twist that's meant no doubt to make us question everything we've watched up to that point in the film but which frankly didn't come as that much of a surprise.<br/><br/>The film is chock-full of recognizable faces in brief cameos: Michelle Williams, Jackie Earle Haley, Elias Koteas, Emily Mortimer, Ted Levine and most notably Patricia Clarkson. But despite the film's high production values and A-list cast, it's hard to believe that someone as talented and capable as Martin Scorsese made this. It's not a bad movie, but it's an awfully mediocre one. There's a reason a film by such a high-profile director was dumped in theatres in the dead of winter.<br/><br/>Grade: B"
"Eumenides_0","9","4","8","14 April 2010"," A Heartbreaking Character Study Masquerading as a Mystery
","I watched Shutter Island a few hours ago and I'm shocked to imagine that I almost missed it on the theaters. The trailer made it look like a modern horror movie: full of silly jump scenes, dissonant music, grainy cinematography, fast editing. I found the trailer so disgusting to look at, I nearly missed the movie.<br/><br/>Well, I'm glad I watched it after all, because I wouldn't hesitate to consider it a modern masterpiece. It's also the best Martin Scorsese movie I've seen by him since Casino.<br/><br/>The movie, a mystery set in 1954, follows US Marshall Teddy Daniels and his new partner, Chuck, as they arrive at Shutter Island, a desolate place that holds a mental hospital for the criminally insane. Their original mission is to find a patient who disappeared, but Teddy has a secret mission: he believes Shutter Island is keeping sinister secrets, involving experiments on the patients. And he took the mission to get on the island and gather evidence to prove it.<br/><br/>To reveal more would spoil the movie.<br/><br/>In recent years Martin Scorsese seems to have been making only Oscar bait - his historical epics, Gangs of New York and The Aviator were clear attempts at getting the prized statuette, and it's ironic that it was his least ambitious, more banal movie to date, The Departed, that finally got him an Oscar. But it seems that it released him from this obsession and he has gone back to making great movies without Oscar concerns. Shutter Island is his first movie in a long time to make a good combination of plot and character, and use pacing in an exciting way, drawing the viewer into the story slowly but hypnotically.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio has improved a lot in recent years, taking more interesting projects. In Shutter Island he gives a great performance as Teddy, an ex-soldier who witnessed the liberation of Dachau, haunted by the horrors of the Holocaust, who became a US Marshall only to be hit by a tragedy in his own country. His face and body language, but especially his eyes, transmit the pain of a man who's seen too much and suffered too much and yet continues to cling to life. Although the movie starts as a mystery, it's in fact a character study of Teddy.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is just as good: Mark Ruffalo is hit and miss for me, but here he hit it as Teddy's likable partner, Chuck. Ben Kingsley gives a great performance too as Dr. Cawley, a man who radiates nothing but caring for his patients and yet Teddy thinks there's something evil in him. Max Von Sydow, with less screen time than any of the others, is also perfect as a truly sinister doctor.<br/><br/>The rest of the movie is in the hands of Scorsese's usual team: Thelma Schoonmaker, Dante Ferretti, Francesca Lo Schiavo and Sandy Powell. I loved the cinematography throughout the movie, every shot was so well framed, so elaborate, the movements so fluid and unusual. I was quite happy to learn it was Robert Richardson (Platoon, JFK, The Aviator) in charge of the cinematography: he's one of the best DPs working in Hollywood nowadays.<br/><br/>Another aspect that captured my attention was the music; it seemed so fit for each scene I was amazed to discover none of it had been composed for the movie. I especially loved the use of Max Richter's music in it; he composed one of the best scores I've ever listened to - Waltz With Bashir - and his non-film music can be quite good too. The piece used, On The Nature Of Daylight, was one of my favorite tracks in the movie.<br/><br/>Shutter Island is an exciting, tense, and heartbreaking movie. Leonardo DiCaprio made Teddy Daniels such a likable person, the ending might leave some people sad over his fate. It's not death, but this movie shows that there are things worse than death in this world. And perhaps that's the best praise I can give this movie, that it shows new types of horrors we're not accustomed to think about. For that, Martin Scorsese and everyone involved in Shutter Island deserve a lot of praise."
"LaowaiGuy","8","4","8","7 April 2010"," Enterntaining Film with Enormous Plot Holes.
","Shutter Island is one of those thrillers that can really only go one of two ways. The first option is the ""he/she's gone crazy option"". The main character is dreaming, on drugs, insane or dead and no one can seem to help him or her recover from their unfortunate condition. A Beautiful Mind or The Sixth Sense are prime examples of these types of films.<br/><br/>The other option is the massive conspiracy option where the character is being heartlessly manipulated by numerous people in some sort of cruel diversion required for him to truly appreciate his charmed existence. Movies like The Game or The Forgotten played that angle to ridiculous extremes. Shutter Island tries to have the best of both options and still manage to come off as a credible movie.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong. It's an entertaining movie with a great performance from one of the best directors and best actors of this generation. Leonardo and Martin can help create an engaging movie, however it doesn't change the fact that the main characters in this movie have to jump through incredible holes in the plot to get to the truth.<br/><br/>The audience has believe that a in facility full of nurses, doctors and policemen that all these ""protect and serve"" types are just going to let a delusional person run around the compound and try to figure out his true existence. We have to suspend all belief in reality in order to serve the needs of one troubled character. No one will try and help him? No one will try to stop a possible criminal from roaming around the complex questioning everyone he sees. This seems a bit much to ask of people who work at this facility, even trained professionals.<br/><br/>Would they really risk endangering all the people who live near or on this facility to be exposed to a possibly dangerous or deranged individual? It doesn't seem very likely especially in an era where anyone who acted different than the mainstream population: Communists, educated African-Americans, gays and Rock 'n' Roll stars were all cause for alarm in 1950s American society.<br/><br/>I the movie's acting, cinematography and direction were top-notch (except for forgettable Mark Ruffalo as Leonardo's buddy). It was just to hard to ignore the gaping holes in the plot."
"derekrankine","8","4","8","5 April 2010"," A B-movie plot with ambitious themes
","The less you know about Martin Scorsese's latest, the better. The film opens in bright white light, which is gradually faded to reveal Leonardo DiCaprio's character, a senior investigator from a US Government agency, suffering seasickness on a ferry crossing. He is en route to the eponymous Shutter Island, to assist with efforts to find an escapee from the island's prison-cum-hospital; a facility that is home to some of the most notorious mentally deranged criminals of 1950s America.<br/><br/>Immediately, we are hooked. The car journey from the ferry to the facility is filled with foreboding and intrigue, melding eerie sound textures with dark, bleak images of the unwelcoming island. Once we arrive, the curious behaviour of the accompanying police officers and the local staff, in addition to the more understandable actions of the patients/prisoners, further builds suspense, paying homage to classic Hitchcock techniques.<br/><br/>The most impressive achievement is that the storyline is consistently riveting for a running time in excess of two hours, seemingly without a single wasted scene, shot or line of dialogue as the plot unfolds in lavish, cinematic scale. DiCaprio's mature and compelling performance, in a character not too dissimilar to his undercover police officer in The Departed, is complemented perfectly by Ben Kingsley, Mark Ruffalo and the wealth of heavyweight acting talents playing minor characters. A couple of minor plot contrivances aside, this is a robust and stimulating addition to Scorsese's canon; albeit one that it is unlikely to reach the same high plateau of critical acclaim as much of the director's preceding efforts.<br/><br/>The film is based on a novel by the increasingly impressive Dennis Lehane, whose Mystic River and Gone, Baby, Gone were also translated for the cinema, and who was also a writer for The Wire. The themes and settings of Shutter Island represent a diversion of sorts, but it transcends the B-movie genre in the same way as the TV/movie adaptations of his other writings were much more than just crime stories."
"oOgiandujaOo_and_Eddy_Merckx","10","4","8","17 March 2010"," Provided an epiphany for me
","For me Shutter Island was revelatory, in sympathy with the protagonist Teddy Daniels, the Marshal who comes to investigate the mysterious McCarthy-era Shutter Island asylum, I experienced feelings associated with metanoia. This is the theoretical process whereby the mind, or more specifically the model by which one understands the world, reforms itself as a result of challenge and becomes uplifted after a period of apparent mental illness. The feeling that it culminates in is a realisation that everything you understood before is wrong. By the end of the movie I felt lifted out of myself, as in a moment of clarity.<br/><br/>Shutter Island therefore seems to work the best when you associate with Teddy. If you do, you're forced into a deep introspection, where you realise how much of your persona is built out of coping strategies. The feelings it provoked in me were very personal, but I would expect that if the film ""worked"" for you they might be similarly cathartic. I felt I could feel how deluded I often am by depression, I felt how beautiful some of the people I know are, as if seeing them for the first time.<br/><br/>Aside from this wellspring of emotion, the film has plenty to offer in visual terms. Mr Scorsese and director of photography Robert Richardson provide strange and beautiful images in the movie, a darkened chamber, pools of dripping light beneath an antique, coffered, barrel-vaulted ceiling; golden hair, and a golden locket mingling with red blood; a family room softly snowing ash. There were also some horrifying images, concentration camp scenes that have drawn flak from critics. I think though that if you reject the film because of this, as Pontecorvo's concentration-camp-set Kapò was rejected, you throw the baby out with the bath water.<br/><br/>A big pitfall for twist movies can be the expositionary info-dump at the denouement, but for me it worked here, because I felt involved in the struggle for Teddy's soul.<br/><br/>Good acting is to be found all over, sprouting in abundance, like the daffodils in Spring; Mark Ruffalo and Leonardo di Caprio I feel steal the show, though the jeep ride with Ted Levine's Warden is one of the most astonishing things I have seen in a cinema, pure dream fabric.<br/><br/>I wonder if the choice of Penderecki and Ligeti in the soundtrack is a Kubrick homage (he used these both for The Shining). In any case the soundtrack choices are an triumphant. I was close to tears listening to a resetting of Dinah Washington singing ""This Bitter Earth"" over the credits, and I'm not prone to such behaviour.<br/><br/>Obviously I can't recommend this film enough."

","MAJOR SPOILER ALERT------------MAJOR SPOILER ALERT.<br/><br/>I give this a 5/10 out of respect for Scorsese's body of work and some of the production values, I am probably too generous.<br/><br/>Very heavy handed direction, way too long and repetitive, force feeding the audience ""clues"", main plot point becomes obvious early on, I don't know what to say just soooooooo disappointing!<br/><br/>I was immediately taken aback by the intensity of the music and ""staginess"" of the opening, I comforted myself, ""it's an homage to film noir of the 40's & 50's"" not yet realizing that it was done to pound home the dream or fantasy world of our protagonist.<br/><br/>As this film wore on I found myself wanting to leave the cinema (I have never done this in my life, just so obvious and lame, the 67th patient, he is looking for himself....I am at a loss for words...<br/><br/>This movie is not worth the price of admission , you could rent it on DVD to see what you think about the low point in Marty's directing career.<br/><br/>I have difficulty grasping that Scorsese could make such a poor film.<br/><br/>I'm out."
"proletinchen","7","4","8","9 March 2010"," Potentially a good movie
","Unlike many of the other reviewers, I actually thought this movie wasn't scary at all. Rats, people with scars, Nazis - this is all being used BETTER before. The movie as a horror fails. The movie as a mystery fails completely. I don't think someone will buy this story since Memento said it all.<br/><br/>MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD!!!!!!!! <br/><br/>Please know, that I reveal the full story - incl. the ending.<br/><br/>The story is about a guy, who was a US Marshall- married, with 3 children. He didn't pay enough attention to his wife and drank too much. His wife was unhappy and had mental problems. One day she got completely insane and murdered their 3 children. When our main character, the US Marshall Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) gets home, he found his wife completely crazy, his children murdered. So he can't take this - he shoots her, so that she doesn't have to be put away. But this whole guilt destroys him slowly. He also gets insane, paranoid and have to be put away. His guilt kills him slowly from the inside, and so he creates this imaginary world - where he is still a Marshall and he investigates a disappearance of a patient from the mental hospital. The doctors in the hospital try through the whole movie to help him, to make him face the truth. And in the end he does. But what can you do when you can't take the truth, when it is too much to bare? How can you live with all this guilt? Isn't it better to be insane and not face the reality?<br/><br/>The movie is following the book very strictly, except the ending. THE ENDING isn't shocking, or scary. It is purely dramatic and rises moral questions.<br/><br/>I think this movie fails completely to be scary movie, thriller or whatever Dicaprio and Scorcese intended. But I think accidentally they found something deeper, something really dramatic and interesting.<br/><br/>The big problem is, they didn't go further with that, but basically count on cheap tricks to scary the audience, instead of make her think."

","First off let me say that I for one actually think Leo is a pretty decent actor. Sure in his early days he was the ""heart"" throb pretty boy of Titanic and Romeo and Juliet.. But after seeing his latest attempts - i.e Gangs of New York, The Aviator, The Departed and Catch me if you Can.. I've developed an appreciation for his skills as an actor... Also i respect the director of most of the same previous mentioned titles that Leo stars in...<br/><br/>But honestly what the hell were they thinking with this movie!?!? The story pace is terrible and the plot so predictable that I literally had called everything (and i mean EVERYTHING - including his wife etc..) 20 minutes in. I was hoping i was going to be proved wrong by some other twist but no..<br/><br/>As the movie started with them driving into the institution what was with the music score?? I was sitting there listening to the BOOOOM BOOOM.... BOOOM BOOOM... thinking ""OK.. that isn't suspenseful.. its just irritating.."" <- OK total minor point but I think it was from this point that my expectations from the movie started to drop.<br/><br/>I saw the movie a few days OK and it just keeps popping up in my mind how bad it is... its not scary at all. The plot is predictable. And the acting was below average. Avoid at all costs unless you have an I.Q under 100 and you haven't watched any 'twist' movies in your entire life."
"Willie-12","8","4","8","22 February 2010"," Well Done
","When it comes to directors who are of the caliber of Martin Scorsese, even when they're not producing their best stuff, it is still so much better than most everything else out there. That is the case with Scorsese's Shutter Island. This was not a perfect movie. Not by any means or stretch of the imagination. It was a bit long, and some of the material felt a little recycled. In fact, there's a sequence near the beginning of the film where it seems that Scorsese was borrowing a little too heavily from movies like The Shining or Psycho. However, this was still a movie that kept me on the edge of my seat, and thoroughly entertained. And I have to say, Leonardo DiCaprio turned in one of his best performances to date. His reaction near the end of the movie when his character faces a reality that is absolutely horrifying, was both heartbreaking and genuinely moving. I have to admit, even I got a little choked up during that scene, and that is something that almost never happens. It's interesting. When Paramount pushed back Island's release date to February 2010, I got a little nervous. After all, this time of year is a notorious dumping ground for production companies' crap. However, the fact that it was Scorsese kept me interested. I don't know why Paramount pushed the release date back. And I really don't care. All I know, is I'm glad they did. It was nice to go to the movies in February and not feel like I was throwing my money down the drain."

I really enjoyed listening to people in the theaters letting out ""WHAT?!"" and ""Oh Wow"" when they started to figure out what was going on. I think people lie when they say it was predictable. The way they lied when the 6th sense came out. It's not that predictable. Unless you think like a person who has been on a nut hut island! The music was a bit extreme it was like the opening credits rolled and fog and then (Dumb Dumb Dumb!!!!!) They just overdid the music a little bit.

"Matt_Layden","8","4","8","20 February 2010"," Scorsese + My Favourite Genre = Win
","After the disappearance of one of the patients on Shutter Island, two Marshalls are assigned to the case and figure out what's going on. The only problem is that the people working there aren't really helping, and weird things start happening. <br/><br/>Scorsese and my favourite genre? Instant win. The film is so masterfully crafted and well shot that it almost feels too good to be a part of this genre. Yet the script and theme fits perfectly. Yes, I knew the ending when they first showed the trailer ages ago, but that did not spoil the intrigue and suspense this film had. There were even a few surprises added on which was nice. <br/><br/>Dicaprio is again, on his game. He pulls out crazy very well. It's not a spoiler that he goes a little crazy while investigating, it's all over the trailers. Added to the cast of characters if Mark Ruffalo, he does his best as the sidekick, Ben Kingsley and Max Von Sydow as eerie doctors , Elias Koteas in creepy make-up in one scene and a scene stealing Jackie Earle Haley.<br/><br/>The film has it's Kubrick feel here and there, but it's Scorsese's stamp on it. It doesn't reach the heights of his previous efforts, but it's still better than 90% of the stuff that's out there. Scorsese knows this genre well enough to know where to pull the strings. The music is a key part in this and the restriction of jump scares shows that this is a well done film that wants to focus more on it's story, than to scare the audience. <br/><br/>That being said, the film is not scary, but it does make you feel uneasy at times. When they go to Ward C, you can't help but feel the hair on your neck stand up as they search the halls.<br/><br/>The twist is obvious, but the unravelling of everything is interesting enough to keep your attention. At times I did question myself, but in the end I knew I was right. Scorsese is able to chip away piece by piece the lead character's sanity to make the film work. Some people may feel cheated, others will like it. I found myself liking it, even if some of it is a bit out there.<br/><br/>Shutter Island is one of the better films you'll probably see this year, it's no masterpiece and it tends to be a the long side of the running time, but it works."

Seriously, I kept expecting to see M. Night Shyamalan take a stroll across the screen in one of his cheesy cameo appearances! This is just the kind of awful movie he practically patented.

"ncoviell","9","6","14","19 February 2010"," DiCaprio shines in a perfect adaptation
","Shutter Island: 9.1/10 - As should be obvious by now, Martin Scorsese is all about creativity; painting a picture through film and completely absorbing the viewer in the world of the movie. His undeniable ingenuity of the process of film-making and truly creating a work of art makes Shutter Island that much more impressive. Scorsese does what he does best, creating a vivid and surreal world and sets one underlying mood that is present constantly throughout the movie; however, he didn't stray far from the story that Dennis Lehane created. In fact, he captured every element piece by piece, presented the atmosphere with delicacy so as to bring the island, the characters and the story to life.<br/><br/>The narrative time-line of Shutter Island isn't that of your normal film. Some scene cuts seem awkward and make the viewer feel as though they may have missed something. However, Scorsese does a beautiful job of displaying this type of feeling. While reading Lehane's book, one cannot help but feel like they are missing something as they go page to page; that is not by accident. Lehane structured his book to give off a level of uncertainty, to give off a feeling of something missing just like how Teddy Daniels seems to always be missing something. Through Lehane's writing and Scorsese's directing the audience is brought into Daniels' world; full of fill-in-the-blanks and confusion.<br/><br/>However, Scorsese didn't stop at simply confusing the audience and pulling them into the mystery; we also brought Daniels' innermost struggles and tortures to life. The nightmare sequences are by far the highlight of Shutter Island, at least from a filmmaker's perspective. In these shots the viewer is introduced to haunting images such as Daniels' memories from war and mesmerizing sequences between Daniels and his dead wife. The connection between all of it, much like the film, is a bit hazy, but for specific reasons: just as Daniels struggles to put everything together, so does the audience. Likewise, Scorsese uses a great deal of foreshadowing, especially earlier on in the film that might not be so easy to pick up on, thus adding to the puzzle.<br/><br/>Outside of the techniques and elements used to successfully capture the atmosphere, tone, and mood of the setting, the cast does some of the best work thus far in 2010. Lead by an almost superhuman performance by Leonardo DiCaprio, which may very be his best work to date; each actor portrays their character exactly as described and made out to be in the novel. Aside from DiCaprio, Ben Kingsley (Dr. Cawley), Michelle Williams (Dolores) and Jackie Earle Haley (George Noyce) are especially effective in their roles as is Mark Ruffalo (Chuck Aule) to a lesser extent.<br/><br/>Though it may not seem so, Shutter Island is the best movie to have been released in 2010 so far. Because although its structure and design may seem nothing more than a nightmare to some viewers, even nightmares contain a touch of beauty and a great deal of art if you can dig deep enough."

While the cinematography was well done, it copied Deloris Clayborn in both format and style which surpassed this film. The cast is strong but it just can't overcome the uneven pacing of the film or the averageness of the script.<br/><br/>As we prepared to see the movie, I informed my movie partner that the movie plot shouldn't involve certain twists else I would be very disappointed. Within the opening scene, the films ultimate conclusion was apparent so I was forced to suffer through the next two hours to see an ending I already knew. For some movies that isn't always a bad thing because getting there can be half the adventure (Lord of the Rings comes to mind) but in this case, between the poorly paced flashbacks and the current storyline, there was little to keep the audience excited.<br/><br/>While the actors delivered strong performances, Dicaprio and Williams do not have on screen chemistry. Thinking of the awkward love scenes in Star Wars Eposides 2 & 3 with Anakin would give you some idea of how these two do not fit together.<br/><br/>This is a Netflix movie and not something you want to pay $10 to sit through. It has been done before and a whole lot better than this movie."

","This is the kind of thriller Scorsese tried to make where the viewer is lead through the plot from the trauma induced, delusional perspective of the main character, only there's too many flashback distractions to make any sense of it all. The flashbacks are what gave away the end for me. I knew it pretty early on in the movie.<br/><br/>However, the premise is fascinating from another perspective they only touched upon which is the idea of how anyone could be brainwashed into thinking and doing anything if given the proper support system much like what happened in ""The Manchurian Candidate"". I actually thought that was where it was going.<br/><br/>What's not explained in the movie is from where the main character is deriving his delusions while participating in the mental hospital's roll playing therapy experiment. What induced the delusion to roll play as a US Marshal? Why choose to be a US Marshal? Was this his occupation before the actual trauma occurred that caused his psychosis? <br/><br/>What was the seed of information that caused him to delude specifics like imagining finding a former doctor hiding out in a cave whose escaping a delusion of her own. Why would shooting your wife for drowning the children cause you to make up all that stuff? Usually in movies there's a seed of reality and logic that starts the spiral downward toward paranoid delusional psychosis this guy was experiencing. To many holes in the logic for me to suspend my disbelief.<br/><br/>Great idea for a movie, though. It's just clumsily executed."

","WARNING - Contains spoilers - WARNING<br/><br/>Martin Scorsese adapts Dennis Lehanes's novel Shutter Island into a near perfect film. Starring alongside Leonardo DiCaprio is Sir Ben Kingsley, Mark Ruffalo, John Carroll Lynch and Elias Koteas. If you're a fan of Scorsese you'd know that his cast always delivers and this one was no different. The acting for the majority was top-notch but DiCaprio especially stood out. He was absolutely amazing, his attitude, intensity and emotions in his eyes made you feel what he was going through at every point throughout the film. For his performance he deserves the best actor nod for next year's Oscars. The story revolves around two U.S. marshals Teddy Daniels (Dicaprio) and Chuck Aule (Ruffalo) who are sent to Boston's Aschecliffe Hospital for the criminally insane; which is located on the island to investigate a disappearance of an inmate. When they arrive they're told by Deputy Warden McPherson (Carroll) of what is where and the rules. This scene engages you instantly and makes you curious about what is hidden behind all those locked doors. Next they meet Dr. Crawley (Kingsley) who informs them of what has happened since the prisoner vanished and this is when the investigation begins. Throughout the search, we were shown multiple locations that made the atmosphere authentic; they didn't have to use music in order to make you anxious and or frightened. The different types of landscapes they utilized worked perfectly. For once there weren't any CGI and green screens in this, and I'd like to thank Mr. Scorsese for using actual environment shots on the island. However some of the scenes were irritating. For instance one scene, which involved a fire, was beyond annoying when two of the characters were in this cave discussing the matters about the island. The usage of fire was a good choice for light but shot in the worse way possible; while they were talking the flames kept flickering in front of their faces. That was such a horrible distraction and made you want to close your eyes and sleep through the scene. Don't know if it was Scorsese or the Director of Photographer that decided to shoot the scene like that but it should never be done again. During another sequence of events, the parts that got frustrating were the constant flashbacks. Even though it's based on a novel which should be followed to a certain degree, some of the scenes should have been cut. It was confusing sometimes because you didn't know if it was real or a flashback. With all these different flashbacks, it felt like it was Saw for several minutes and with regards to these scenes it almost takes away the flow of the movie. Nevertheless, this is one of the best psychological thrillers out there. This is a must-see for everyone except for children. Do not bring your child to this. As much as this is an amazing film sadly it's the type of movie you see once.<br/><br/>9 out of 10"

","68% on Rotten Tomatoes, really?<br/><br/>This movie has multiple meanings but at times it is hard to explain the meaning because you can't find the words to describe it. So I'm going to try and keep it easy to understand.<br/><br/>At the beginning we see our main character, Teddy Daniels a.k.a. Andrew Laeddis (as we find out towards the end) throwing up on a ferry saying it's because he is seasick, but now I get it. He is throwing up because he so horrified by his past, his wife killing his three children by drowning them and him shooting her in the stomach that he gets sick every now and then. Ben Kingsley's character says that Dr Sheehan is overseas, which we find out is actually Andrew's psychiatrist for Shutter Island. His disguise name is Chuck Aule and he tries to play the part as Daniel's buddy in this new situation.<br/><br/>Close to the introduction of the film, we see the cops handling rifles when Daniels gets out from the ferry, this is because he is a dangerous patient and we have no idea when he is just going to get mad and kill somebody. He has had a short temper ever since the death of his wife and his three children. When you first watch the movie, you don't realise why the cops could be handling the rifles when Teddy is around, that is the genius of Scorsese. Second time around, you notice something odd about the way people act around Andrew, they're scared of him, they try to act civil around him but the freak out!<br/><br/>The one scene where Teddy and Chuck are interviewing patients and he comes across that one female that seems fine, he asks her, ""Have you ever seen a patient called Andrew Laeddis?"" she answers back, frightened, ""Nope, never heard of him"" and runs out crying, that is because she is legitimately afraid of him.<br/><br/>And if you pay real close attention the name that Teddy gives his wife, Rachael Solando and the detective name he gives himself Teddy Daniels spells out the real names of the two.

","Shortly after I watched the Black Swain, I knew I had to watch another movie like it. I was hooked. Through the many different plot points, its ability to tell a story behind the actual story, and an ending that would surround your every thought for the rest of the day, psychological thrillers like Shutter Island interested me. The next step was watching the movie and to put it honestly, Shutter Island lives up to its genre perfectly. My rating for Shutter Island is 4.5/5 stars. Now let's go through exactly why 4.5/5 stars is appropriate but, before we get into this review, a spoiler warning is needed!<br/><br/>
Shutter Island was directed by Martin Scorsese and is based off of Dennis Lehane's book with the same name. It is normal to read a book that truly catches your attention throughout and be disappointed with its movie nowadays. Shutter Island however pleasantly surprises you. Its suspenseful sound track keeps you on the edge of your seats throughout the movie. The movie ultimately centers around a detective, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, searching around a mental hospital in order to find a missing patient who killed his wife. Throughout the movie Martin Scorsese does an excellent job of evoking a lack of knowing from the audience. Even though it seems like a straightforward plot, Scorsese includes details and scenes that gave me a clue that not everything is how it seems. These scenes include innovative camera angles and intense sounds that gave me a hint that something big was coming. Specifically these sounds grew an intense atmosphere and changed the normal tone of the movie and made it feel like i was watching a movie within the movie. I was very very confused. It wasn't until the ending that I was able to understand all the details. The ending drops a weight on your head and makes you rethink every scene in the entire movie. An ending to rival ""The Empire Strikes Back"" and no, i'm not saying someone is the dad. The ending showed that the inmate the detective is searching for is indeed himself. I am normally very good at guessing endings of movies but I was totally unprepared for this reveal. This reveal made a second viewing of the film a must and had me rewatching it as soon as I finished it. The second time I watched it, it felt like I was watching a different movie. All the scenes that didn't make sense suddenly painted a new story within the story. I was very impressed. The final scene in Shutter Island left us with an amazing quote. ""Which would be worse, to live as a monster or to die as a good man?"" This has stayed with me much longer than I imagined and is still a question I find myself thinking to this day. A very powerful way to end a movie. In conclusion, Shutter Island took me on a roller coaster throughout its 2 hours and 19 minutes of screen time and has earned a 4.5/5 stars!"

The eagerness to want to know the answers holds you back. And it's incredible the script's decision to decide the explanations.

","'Shutter Island (2010)' is a film entirely about perspective, and the first time I watched the picture I was so immersed into the perspective of the protagonist - who's point of view is intrinsically inseparable from the narrative and integral to the success of its various reveals - that I was totally swept up and taken along for the ride, made to dance like a marionette to the thriller's tightly-timed and twisty tune, so much so that I was completely in sync with DiCaprio's increasingly disheveled detective and experienced all the same emotional beats that he did, ranging from fear and confusion to sadness and even denial, which meant that I was captivated and totally board no matter how outlandish or somewhat confusing certain aspects may have seemed; I've now seen it twice, however, and the second viewing was a very different experience as, while our perspective isn't entirely out of sync with that of the protagonist, the knowledge of what's to come provides a slightly different point-of-view that makes even something as simple as a sideways glance into something altogether more monumental and, while this time around inevitably isn't as impactful as the first as it exposes a number of issues such as some second-act pacing issues, it holds up remarkably well under the scrutiny of examination afforded by the separation of audience and character that occurs once you know the flick's final hand, while still being surprisingly emotionally resonant too. 8/10"

","As a fan of the Scorsese-DiCaprio partnership (Departed, Aviator, Gangs of New York, etc) as well as their separate works (Casino, Goodfellas) (Inception, Blood Diamond, Catch Me If You Can) I thought this film would be a slam dunk success. The ratings show that it is, but it simply isn't.<br/><br/>The plot is so obvious, so predictable, it is hinted at, then basically shown and then hammered on over and over and over until you get it. The twist is an acknowledgment of what you've already been told many times over. It is the equivalent of the twist of Titanic being that the crew were not prepared for this and many are going to die.<br/><br/>This film is proof that Scorsese can do no wrong. No really.

","For me, this is a rare miss for Scorsese. It's not necessarily bad, it's just really not good. The performances are all strong, as these are heavyweight actors, and they're what saved it for me. The directing is good but at times too heavy handed for a mystery thriller, big twist type of movie.<br/><br/>Without giving anything away, if you haven't figured this movie out in the first half hour (and that's generous) then you're not paying attention. Scorsese uses too many ""tricks"" too often too quickly and shows you the ""twist""(if you can call it that) way too early. And the ridiculous looking green screen shots are just awful.<br/><br/>While I have the utmost respect for Scorsese and his work, this one just feels , to me, like Scorsese trying to do a Shyamalan movie. Average at best. I know I would not anticipate watching another Scorsese mystery thriller."

","Opening with some rather amateur special effects to create a ferry trip was an unusually, off-putting experience, especially from the likes of Scorsese. But as 'Shutter Island' progressed, I was soon immersed into the mystery of the missing suspect. <br/><br/>Leonardo Dicaprio played an engrossing detective with an unbridled drive and determination that often clouded his judgement, but with the reluctance of Mark Ruffalo was kept sensible. <br/><br/>The first half never dragged as it introduced new and interesting characters that added to the curiosity of the island which was also helped with typically Gothic set design. <br/><br/>Unfortunately the second half became slow and confusing with an unambitious push towards the disappointing and predictable ending. <br/><br/>I would have preferred to watch the first half of the film, stopped it and left the ending as a mystery for my imagination."

There is something about Kingsley you know as a viewer you can't trust.<br/><br/>The SS past of DiCaprio is almost well done. I like the fact Scorcese made this aspect a part of the movie, even with Kingsley in it who made his movie about Anne Frank's history. But when there is a line up and people are getting shot, they are shot all together at the same time but they drop on the floor at the time the camera is shooting them.<br/><br/>The movie is exciting until the end.

","The evolution of Martin's career has been fascinating. For most of his movies up until Cape Fear, the camera was literally never more than 3 or 4 feet away from his actors. While he has always demonstrated a flair for moving his camera around, I found the lighting schemes to be pedestrian. He discussed this in an interview around the time Saving Private Ryan came out. He had been on the set visiting Spielberg, the famous scene where the soldiers come up over the hill in silhouette. They had been waiting hours for the sun to reach the right position in the sky. He remarked that instance would never have occurred to him, simply because he grew up in Little Italy being surrounded by skyscrapers where you would not be paying much attention to the position of the sun.<br/><br/>This is a movie where photography matters, even more so than characters. The camera has to exist in a world apart from the characters. Space, texture, color and light are as important as the characters, perhaps even more so.<br/><br/>The story of the movie is which reality is the Leo character living in. The story that is informing that story is the director attempting to escape his own limitations. One directly informs the other. This is why I believe there is no solid conclusion to the ending, in fact it could very possibly be all 3 things:<br/><br/>1) It really was a cold war spy factory
2) It really was a bunch of escaped Ex-Nazis performing human experiments
3) He really was a lunatic US Marshall who murdered his wife after she drowned their kids<br/><br/>I believe there was a victory here - the director was victorious in his encounter with himself. Here, the camera is not anchored to a person. Here, look at how well we understand the importance of location, architecture, place, space, situation. Exposition was not needed at all. That's the hand of a master storyteller in full embrace of his powers."
"lavatch","Null","1","1","24 August 2018"," Overwrought & Heavy-Handed
","While there were some merits to ""Shutter Island,"" including the fascinating island setting, the film was labored in the first half, then turned on an intriguing plot twist. Still, there is the clear impression from this reviewer that an actor other than Leonardo DiCaprio would have discovered greater depth in interpreting the main role of Teddy Daniels.<br/><br/>The time is 1954. The setting is Boston Harbor. The more precise locale is an institution for the criminally insane in an Alcatraz of the East Coast. An innate is on the loose on the island, necessitating the arrival of the marshal, Teddy Daniels, and his sidekick, Chuck Aule. Unfortunately, the film really drags for the first hour as Daniels and Aule explore the island and are sized up the medical staff, including the two principal doctors, Cawley and Naehring. Ben Kingsley and MaxVon Sydow are in top form with an undercurrent of menace in their treatment of the visiting cops.<br/><br/>During his whirlwind experience on the island, Teddy appears to be prone to visions or flashbacks, based upon his World War II experience of having discovered the horrors of Dachau as an American GI who first entered the camp. He was also traumatized by the death of his wife in a fire. But the dialogue seemed strained and artificial when a girl appears to Teddy and says, ""Why didn't you save me?"" with Teddy's response a succinct, ""I got here too late."" Is Teddy recalling his experience at Dachau, or is it a more personal vision of a family member?<br/><br/>In the essential structure of the film, the success depends in large part on the actor playing Teddy Daniels. DiCaprio often overacted the part. The role demanded many facets of the character's personality and nuanced responses to intense situations. Leo simply could not carry the film the way that was needed in the psychological dimensions of a complex character."

This movie is about perception and the way the mind chooses to see/ things. At the beginning, unknowing of the facts, we follow along with Leonardo DiCaprio's character, believing and seeing as he does. Eventually we reach the end and the twist is revealed to us as it is simultaneously revealed to DiCaprio. While watching the movie the second time everything its very obvious what's going on.

"parker1177","Null","1","1","4 April 2010"," Shutter Island
","For probably the first time, I was very excited about a Scorsese film. I have been left cold by nearly every film I've seen of his, either due to subject matters that I just cannot bring myself to care about or I'm generally unimpressed by the film. There are exceptions of course as Gangs of New York was flawed but very powerful and The Last Temptation of Christ is a masterpiece, but despite a blip here and there over the years, Scorsese generally makes films that don't speak to me.<br/><br/>Well, with Shutter Island he had me. I have a weak spot for psychological thrillers set in historical asylums. I gravitate towards these films, and when they work, they quickly find their places among my favorites. I found myself comparing the trailers for Shutter Island with Brad Anderson's Session 9 and the detective films of Kiyoshi Kurosawa (i.e. Cure, Retribution). i assumed that Martin Scorsese was influenced by the amazing atmosphere of the Japanese detective thrillers and was making his own. If Shutter Island hails from those influences, it doesn't succeed in duplicating the tone or attention to setting. Sadly, Shutter Island instead tries to be a M. Night Shyamalan film without the tension and unlike, Shyamalan, Scorsese gives away the twist immediately. Calling Shutter Island a disappointment is an understatement.<br/><br/>Stop reading now if you want to avoid spoilers, because I'm about to give away everything.<br/><br/>My biggest issue with Shutter Island is that nothing holds together and the more I think about it, the more annoyed I get. I hate movies that depend upon a big reveal at the end that finally explains everything. The biggest problem is that they almost never hold up to repeat viewings. Well, if Shutter Island had worked up until the lame and blatantly obvious reveal that Teddy Daniels is criminally insane, then I'd just be annoyed with it in the way that I am at the filmography of Shymalan, i.e. I was entertained the first time, but it completely falls apart with any scrutiny . If one could say the same for Shutter Island, it was be a complement.<br/><br/>The problem is that the whole premise of Shutter Island is completely retarded. I realized to my disappointment very early on that Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) was not on the island to reveal a conspiracy, but as a patient. But are we really supposed to buy this plot? Would a mental hospital allow a delusional patient to wander about their facility for a few days playing detective in order to determine if he can be cured? Shutter Island's biggest failure is that it didn't make a lick of narrative sense. I enjoyed some of the dream sequences, but again, they allowed the truth of Teddy Daniels' crime to be so obvious as to made the last 30 minutes of the movie unnecessary for anyone who was awake during the first half-hour. In fact, the second half of the movie bludgeons you with Teddy's actual story, which was evident from the not so subtle clues throughout.<br/><br/>However, there was one completely unforgettable part of the reveal. The moment that Dr. Cawley (Sir. Ben Kingsley) brings out the visual aids to show Teddy that all of the names in his conspiracy plot are anagrams, was the best bit of unintentional comedy that I've seen all year. But then, what could have been a downright cool detective thriller investigating the very horrific practices that happened in asylums during the first half of the 20th century, we get another movie with a non-nonsensical plot that is simply explained by the protagonist being insane. Yawn. My advice is to watch Quills, Session 9, or The American Experience: The Lobotomist for some intense, horrifying stories of mental institutions."
"jmbeck-660-975527","5","64","250","13 February 2010"," Quite disappointing... in a way
","Just saw it at the world premiere in Berlin. Well, this movie has the labels 'Martin Scorsese' and 'Leonardo DiCaprio' written all over it. It is a good movie. It is a bad Scorsese movie. If you're into horror movies as I am, you will know the plot after about 15 Minutes. There are tons of Mad Asylum - movies out there, and this is just one of them. Take for instance the crappy 'Madhouse' - Movie with Joshua Jackson, or any other movie in this vein. Shutter Island is the luxury-packed, atmospherically gloomy version of these movies with good actors. Just because it says Scorsese/DiCaprio doesn't make a B-Horror-Flick something special. And Shutter Island is nothing more than a nice Asylum-Horror-Movie. If it had some no-name director and cast, it would have gone straight to DVD.<br/><br/>You can watch it, it is nice, never boring, the atmosphere is bleak and therefore good, but Scorsese usually delivers something special. Shutter Island is not."
"MartinHafer","9","6","15","8 July 2011"," I know it's convoluted and slow, but stick with this one...really.
","2010 was very good to Leonardo DiCaprio. Shedding his pretty little boy image, he played in two very gritty and similar films, ""Shutter Island"" and ""Inception"". I saw them both and enjoyed them both. And, to buck the tide, I'd have to say I actually liked ""Shutter Island"" a little more...really. Now do NOT just rush out to rent this one, as I can't see this film appealing to everyone. It IS confusing. The plot can feel a bit tiresome and slow. But, if you are very patient, it all comes together perfectly--with the last 15 minutes totally enthralling me. I think part of it is because I am a retired psychotherapist and psychology teacher--and the film is a great psychological drama. And, the story actually is consistent psychologically and is actually plausible.<br/><br/>Now I could recap the plot, but currently there are something like a bazillion reviews on IMDb for this film. Instead, let's talk about what I liked. First and foremost, the writing was simply great--very intelligent and well-crafted. It really makes you think and doesn't underestimate the audience's intelligence. Second, the acting is really good. DiCaprio was excellent, but having Ben Kingsley and Max Von Sydow REALLY made this a wonderful picture. Watch this one...it's currently on premium cable. And, it's also a film that bear re-watching as there are many layers to the film you won't notice the first time."

","I hated this movie!!!!! It was dark, gloomy, repetitive and uninteresting. I thought I would probably not love it based on the trailer but still expected more from a Martin Scorsese film. I am not sure why it is getting such rave reviews; it really surpasses me what people saw in it.<br/><br/>The thriller is set in the 1950's, with Leonardo DiCaprio interpreting a U.S. Marshal, and Mark Ruffalo as his partner. Together they are investigating the disappearance of a dangerous inmate from an insane asylum on the very isolated Shutter Island.<br/><br/>The atmosphere and music are ominous from the start, much like the opening scenes of Scorsese's 1991 Cape Fear. It rains constantly on Shutter Island and the decor is conveniently populated with cliffs and a towering lighthouse where a dramatic (if somewhat disappointing) plot twist later takes place. <br/><br/>There are lots of twists and turns and psychological unraveling on the part of DiCaprio's character. He is haunted by flashbacks of scenes he witnessed of concentration camps during WW2, and visions of his murdered wife played by Michelle Williams. DiCaprio's performance was skillful and talented, as was Ruffalo's. Ben Kingsley was appropriately dramatic in his portrayal of the chief psychiatrist at the institution.<br/><br/>The movie carried on for quite long and its ambiguous ending was not enough to redeem its exasperating, overly paranoid quality which veered too much towards the horror genre for my taste. More boring than horrifying, I give it a 3.<br/><br/>My rating: 3/10 Fabio's: 4/10 Total score: 7/20 Please check out http://paulinasmovies.blogspot.com for more"

","The main question going through my mind after seeing this movie was, Really? The whole time it seems rather obvious what is going on and i kept waiting for the big twist where i was wrong, but the end had no twist whatsoever and it ended exactly like you think its going to from the start. It dispels any illusion of terror or foreboding when you know exactly what is happening the whole time. This is a sad sad movie for the legendary scorcese. It wasn't a horror movie in the slightest and while it tried to be a phsycological thriller it never once pulled it off. Ben kingsleys character basically told you in the first 10 minutes how it would play out. I was hoping this was going to be good but i left very disappointed.

","Shutter Island is a body of land in Boston Harbor which has a hospital for the criminally insane. It's run by a pair of doctors played by Ben Kingsley and Max Von Sydow who have certainly essayed roles of some very deep villainy. Couple that with the fact that this film is set in post World War II where America has just been fighting with people who have mysterious accents like Von Sydow and Kingsley. It's a recipe for a Hitchcock like thriller.<br/><br/>US Marshal Leonardo DiCaprio has been sent to Shutter Island with his new partner Mark Ruffalo to investigate the disappearance of a woman who was declared criminally insane by the courts and is now confined to the island facility. Though it is a hospital also, primarily Shutter Island is a prison and run by the Federal government and subject to their jurisdiction. <br/><br/>Although Ruffalo is content to follow DiCaprio's lead, Leo's not happy with the lack of cooperation he's getting on the investigation, even more unhappy that inclement weather is forcing he and Ruffalo to stay on the island. Something suspicious is going on and DiCaprio's going to get to the bottom of it.<br/><br/>Actually something very suspicious is going on there, some very intricate mind games are being played, some experimentation is being conducted by the staff. But trust me, it's beyond DiCaprio's powers of grasp.<br/><br/>Shutter Island marks the third film that Martin Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio have teamed as director/star. It's possible Leo is trying to tie Robert DeNiro for times working with Scorsese. This part is certainly one a younger DeNiro might have done. I don't think Shutter Island ranks up there with either The Aviator or The Departed it's still an intricately plotted story and one where the lead has to be convincing or the film goes nowhere. DiCaprio doggedly plods on with his investigation while battling some inner demons that the audience is gradually let it on. A younger DeNiro couldn't have been better.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast ably supports Leo, but in the final analysis Shutter Island belongs to him and to Martin Scorsese for putting it all together. Alfred Hitchcock would be proud."

","## This does contain information that could be considered ""spoiler""ish##<br/><br/>The set up: Leonardo DiCaprio and Mark Ruffalo are federal marshals sent in 1954 to the dark and foreboding Shutter Island to investigate the near impossible disappearance of a patient from the island's asylum for the criminally insane. It soon becomes clear the staff is as suspect as the patients and that DiCaprio may actually be right when he jokingly says insanity is contagious.<br/><br/>The good? So much has here has been done right. The mystery quickly grows with so many possible explanations to pick from. Is it supernatural? Could the ghost Dicaprio's dead wife literally be helping him solve the mystery? A government conspiracy? Continuation of Nazi experiments? There are some beautifully shot dream/hallucination scenes infused with drama and emotion by superb acting on the part of DiCaprio and Michelle Williams who plays his dead wife. The script is smart, clever with comments on the horrors of war and how the view of humanity was altered by assembly line like mass murder of the Holocaust. DiCaprio is the center of this drama in ways you will only realize at the end but the rest of the cast is equally adept. <br/><br/>##Spoiler## The bad? I guess I should give the obligatory spoiler alert here...Half way through the movie I began to suspect where it was going to end and said a little prayer to the movie gods that it not be true. In the post Sixth Sense era, moviegoers have been, in my opinion, deluged with movies that abuse the ""twist"" ending. Often it is just lazy storytelling rather then a clever trick. It was not until later that I found out Shutter Island is based on a book; so my one big criticism does not really add up to too much. Rather than a conscious decision by Scorsese, the ending is consistent with the book. What is the twist? Don't worry I won't tell but let's just say that doctors on Shutter Island have some pretty progressive treatment methods.<br/><br/>One last note, when Brittany Murphy died, I saw someone online post, ""who is going to play the crazy girls now?"" I nominate Michelle Williams because in Shutter Island she plays crazy in ways that are scary good."

","Where do I even begin? I was curious to see this movie as parts of it were filmed in my area. I knew some of the extras that would be in it and there was a lot of hype. Needless to say this film for me just didn't work. The premise of the story is that Leo's character is sent to a mental institute for the criminally insane to investigate a missing patient. He has flashbacks and as the story unwinds you begin to see he has his own struggles. You begin to wonder who the 'good guys' and the 'bad guys' are.<br/><br/>The film starts off slow...peaks to slow..and even ends in an unsatisfying way.

Leo, Michelle, Mark and Ben all do great jobs with the acting ( I guess)..it was just painful to stay awake with the story lines. Too draggy...<br/><br/>Some of it was even just unbelievable...(i.e. the 'c' building that seemed more abandoned than an actual hospital setting and the lighthouse ..spiral staircases make it difficult to lug all that bulky furniture) ...but yet ..it happened..<br/><br/>I loved 'The Departed' and usually like Scorcese's twist on story telling...I just didn't enjoy this one..I would wait for the DVD.<br/><br/>The"

","I was lucky enough to see this film on opening day and like a lot of people I was interested to see how Scorsese would tackle this new genre. I must say that the movie was nothing like I expected, but in my opinion is one of the best films to come out in a very long time.<br/><br/>That being said, I lined up the very next day with a different group of friends to watch it a second time to see how different the perspective would be having that I already know the twist. I really believe that it's not until you watch this film the second time (or that you have an extremely good memory) that you can't really appreciate just how good this film is.<br/><br/>A lot of people have been bagging out the film saying that the twist is predictable. Well yes, obviously it's not a stretch to work out that Leonardo's character is somewhat psychopathic given the constant flashbacks and how overall unstable he appears to be. Although, Scorsese does do a good job of trying to throw the viewer off the scent (e.g. the second meeting with Rachel). However for me, the actual twist was not the fact that he was unstable, more the fact that the entire film had been a set-up by the institution and Leonardo was, as so aptly put by a patient, 'a rat in a maze'.<br/><br/>The thing I really liked about this film (and again, watching a second time I highly recommend) are the subtleties across the entire film that suggest the twist. Things like Mark Ruffalo struggling to get his gun out of his holster early in the film (obviously because he's never had to unclip a holster before). The institutions flat out refusal to hand over records of staff. The joking and lack of attention when Leonardo is interviewing the staff. When the axe lady was asked about Dr Sheehan, she mentions that he is good-looking and a very quick shot is then taken of Mark Ruffalo (who we later find out is Dr Sheehan) glancing back at her with almost a smirk. The constant dropping of various lines across the film to try to spark Leonardo's memory. Various glances between staff working at the institution. The first Rachel scene where they try to jog Leonardo's memory about his wife murdering the children. The warden's obvious dislike towards Leonardo claiming that he is violent and knows him well. Theses truly are the things that I believe make this film (and there are a tonne more) a cut above most other Hollywood trash.<br/><br/>This was a brilliant film and whilst I don't believe this is something for everyone, I feel it really challenges the viewer mentally and you can't help but go through the psychosis with Leonardo, wandering if he is actually insane or whether the institution is setting him up. Throw into the mix some first-class acting and this is a real winner in my books, watch out for this as a contender for some big awards."

That's what U.S. Marshalls Edward ""Teddy"" Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo) are trying to find out.<br/><br/>Throughout their investigation they begin to wonder if Solando really did escape. Does a Rachel Solando even exist? Perhaps it's a trap. Someone wants them on that island and isn't going to let them escape. And with the hurricane nearby they couldn't even if they wanted to.<br/><br/>That's the mystery in director Martin Scorsese's first film since 2006's The Departed, the movie for which he finally won an Academy Award. Like The Departed and even his 1991 film, Cape Fear, it's a thriller that'll have audiences on the edge of their seat. However, it is the weakest of the three. If this movie has one flaw (and it's only ONE flaw) it's that it relies too much on the mystery. Once you know the ending there's no reason to re-watch the film. It's two hours and twenty minutes of DiCaprio running around a mental institute. Aside from two or three humorous scenes nothing distracts the plot. It's on autopilot.

The first 40 minutes or so set the scene tremendously well, introduce the characters, draw you into the despair of a mental hospital and prepare you for a Hitchcock type nerve jangler for the remaining hour and a half or so....But I'm afraid that nerve jangling didn't quite appear. There was nothing in the rest of the film that made me sit up and go ""ooh!"" or ""yikes!"" or even ""gosh"". There were no explosive scares.

I've loved everything(with the one aforementioned exception) that I've seen by Martin Scorsese, and this, while it might at first appear excessively mainstream, is another example. This is beautifully shot and edited, and the lighting is just astonishing. The look is amazing. This also has outstanding FX, though they are clearly not the focus, only a tool to tell the story, which is rather brilliantly put together. In general this is immensely well-written; the dialog is clever and there are numerous memorable lines, the script is smart and every character is credible, well-developed and psychologically accurate. The acting is flawless. Levine gets an unforgettable speech that he delivers impeccably, Lynch does his ""there's something funny about that guy..."" thing perfectly, and the entire principal cast are spot-on. The score is grand and really helps set the tone and the mood, if it is arguably over-dramatic in a place or two. This is quite creepy, terrifying and exciting. There is plenty of bloody, at times gory, violence and disturbing content, relatively infrequent strong language, brief nudity and a sexual description.

","I feel that there are quite a few glowing reviews on IMDb which may be totally fake and written by paid PR companies. Some are written in such a canned style with perfect 10 scores designed to boost the average overall score. I do agree the acting in this film is fantastic but the plot was utterly disturbing to say the least. Anyone attempting to graphically portray such a ghastly subject matter about children seriously needs to look carefully at themselves. I can only imagine how the make-up artists felt when they went through some of the more graphic scenes depicting the children towards the end. Quite frankly, it's disappointing if there's false reviews posted by PR agencies employed to rate this film much higher than it deserves. Overall, the criticism here lies with the deplorable plot and subject matter. The acting is first rate and obviously it's shot well. But who could possibly excuse some of the graphic scenes especially towards the end.? I'm not against difficult subject matter. I loved films like Capote, Goodfellas & Leon the Professional but this was just weird. When I left the cinema I got the feeling everyone else who'd watched the film felt this one missed the mark. I watched the film in the cinema with two other mates and they agreed it was a bizarre film. Sixth Sense is a brilliant example of how this type of genre can be fantastic to watch.

","It wasn't a fair movie. Teddy's reality was absolutely unambiguous until the very end. We saw him hallucinating even when he didn't: when the ""doctor"" wakes him up in the cave. That's cheating. If you're going to twist the end completely around, there has to be some clue. You can bury it and hope the viewers miss it, but there should be a clue that the narrator is unreliable. Like in the 6th Sense. You go back through the 6th Sense and notice that it's never inconsistent; no one but the boy ever speaks to the lead character; there's no overlap. If you're clever enough, you can guess the end. Shutter Island offers no clues and it's not consistent, so that the end comes out of left field, and that's not fair.<br/><br/>There is no movie rule that says thrillers must be fair and there have to be clues, but there is no viewer rule, either, that says I can't prefer them that way."

","For a pseudo-noir film where ""God"" is mentioned in passing half a dozen times, Shutter Island has the same feel as a vintage Twilight Zone episode. The ones introduced by creator Rod Serling. There's a twist ending coming, for sure, but where-as the black and white series delivered some well-written, unexpected surprise endings, on Shutter Island blatant hints deter from any plausible surprise twists coming. Michelle Williams does nice work in her haunting role, but the truth about her character's demise lands like a thud when it's revealed. Jackie Earle Haley delivers crackling tension in his cameo, but that's the problem. It's just a cameo, and his character is leagues more interesting than the rest of the ensemble. Scorsese handles the direction well, but this is not like 'Cape Fear' at all! There is no Max Cady running loose. The musical score evokes feeling, but the story itself lacks any component of Faith or discussion of ""God."" Such a shame for a film that searches for truths to the protagonist's dilemma, a la 'Identity' with John Cusack, and ends unsure of what ""truth"" is."

","Visually, Martin Scorsese is unparalleled. But, if you know anything about cinema, you already knew that. This film isn't a masterpiece, or a storyline we haven't seen before (think along the lines of Identity [2003]), what this film is, is a beautifully crafted thriller. If you enjoy thrillers, you will enjoy this movie, period. I'm not just referring to the twists and turns in the plot either. When you deal with Scorsese, you get quality, and this film is no different. The acting was phenomenal; DiCaprio, Rufallo, and Kinsley delivered, big time. This flick reads like a great novel, and yet, it refuses to take on that distinctive and predictable Hollywood style (that we have all too often been gratuitously subjected to.) In addition, this film has such a realistic quality to it, that never once did I feel as though I had been cheated out of my money. If anything, the previews for the film don't do it justice, they have promoted it as a ""scary movie"", and that couldn't be further from the truth. I can assure you that Mr. Scorsese isn't looking for the cheap ""Boo! I got you!"" moment. It's just simply not one of those kinds of movies. He realizes he is dealing with an intelligent audience, and thus, he provide us (the audience) with a clever intellectually stimulating film..<br/><br/>I commend Mr. Scorsese for not electing to go with a conventional ending, and although some people in the theater went ""aaww"" (in a bad way), I went ""aahh!"" (in a good way), because I understood the reasoning behind it. With so much humdrum useless junk in the theaters these days, and in particular so much junk in the thriller genre, it is truly a delight to witness a talented director like Martin Scorsese take on a project like this. As you can see, this was definitely my kind of movie, but I have a hunch that I'm not alone, and I have a hunch this thing is going to catch on very very fast.<br/><br/>One last thing, I urge you to see it in theaters, your really missing out if you decide to wait until DVD for this one, trust me on that."

","In the space of a week we have been given two very distinct examples of how to (and how not to) generate genuine scares. Joe Johnston's The Wolfman exhibited cheap, shallow attempts of frightening the audience, mostly consisting of lazy ""don't look around the corner"" moments that relied on loud noises and sudden movements to make you jump. On the opposite end of the spectrum, Martin Scorsese - as you would expect from such a virtuoso director - demonstrates an innate knack for producing goose bumps, combining atmospheric sound design and terrifyingly vivid images – most notably during Teddy's dream sequences – that get under your skin to brilliant effect. Shutter Island is not a horror flick mind you. It is more akin to Hitchcock's The Birds; eerie, chilling and deeply disturbing. You'll probably not jump out of your seat once but, like Scorsese understands and Johnston needs to learn, it is what stays in your head after the credits roll that is of greater significance.<br/><br/>Based on Dennis Lehane's novel, Shutter Island's narrative doesn't hold its punches back. Dealing with murder, corruption, alcohol abuse, mental sickness, genocide and torture; no dramatic stone is left unturned. Occasionally it feels a little heavy-handed, but what else can you expect from the guy who penned the source material for Mystic River and Gone Baby Gone? Screenwriter Laeta Kalogridis commendably keeps Lehane's story moving, never allowing it to be bogged down with one particular issue ensuring the thriller aspect of the film – arguably what the majority of audience members will be seeing the movie for - gets plenty of room to develop. With a handful of twists here and there and information drip-fed methodically, you'll never be wholly confident in what you think is happening or, more importantly, what is going to happen.<br/><br/>Regular Scorsese collaborator Leonardo DiCaprio (he's starred in the director's last four films) is in top form yet again, adding clout to the ever-increasing opinion of this reviewer that he may well be one of the best actors of our generation. Willing to give himself over to the material completely, the onetime Romeo embodies his character with such verve and preciseness that he's never less the entirely convincing. Meanwhile Michelle Williams is quietly carving out a niche for herself as the tormented soul, her eyes able to convey so much emotion that words almost seem unnecessary; old-timers Kingsley and von Sydow provide their psychiatrists with the perfect amount of ambiguity; Haley is gruesome and sympathetic in a cameo role whilst Ruffalo plays the unfussy part of Teddy's partner with more subtle cleverness than initially noticed.<br/><br/>Due to the class of Scorsese throughout his illustrious career this may not even make his top five, however 99% of directors around the world would gladly call this their masterpiece.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 (1 - Rubbish, 2 - Ordinary, 3 - Good, 4 - Excellent, 5 - Classic)"

","Are the holocaust-movies so plenty lately that even the most liberal ones are getting tired of them? But you still need to push the agenda to guilt-trip the people? Well lets make a completely unrelated movie, then scatter flashbacks"" in it with the most emotionally loaded pictures possible! (Dead and frozen women and children puring out of boxcars? Only the dead puppy is missing!) You might as well also put a historical controversy in the flashbacks about Allied war crimes and than claim it's a madman's fantasy at the and while you are at it. Some radical feminist agenda can also be found in the movie, for example the way they present domestic violence, or that the husband is responsible for everything, even his wife's crimes.<br/><br/>The story itself is OK, with a clever plot twist. However there is something amiss the whole time and not in the way they intended: the island supposed to be a well locked mental hospital for the most dangerous criminally insane people in the US. But there are no Hannibal Lecters locked up there! The inmates you find are ordinary madmen with 1-2 ordinary"" kills (without extreme brutality) tops, some of them didn't even kill anyone. These people wouldn't need a maximum security institute. The same is the problem with the threat that they will find a way to diagnose the inspector with something and than keep him there: an ordinary madman has no place in a maximum security madhouse.<br/><br/>To sum it up: the idea for the story is good and they could have made a really good movie of it if it wasn't just an excuse for pushing an agenda. Like this it's so full of mistakes it's barely a mediocre movie."

","It's well directed by Scorsese, nicely photographed, the locations and photography are convincing. Very atmospheric. It's the kind of storm that would send me scurrying to the cellar.<br/><br/>But I'm beginning to wish M. Night Shyamalan had never turned ""The Sixth Sense"" into a successful movie, in which you can't tell the living people from the flashbacks from the ghosts from the hallucinations from the dreams.<br/><br/>I was puzzled by the ghosts (or whatever they were) in ""The Shining."" Here's Jack Nicholson, heretofore troubled but sane, strolling into the deserted ballroom of the Overlook Hotel, slapping his hands on the bar, and saying with a big, welcoming grin, ""Well, HELLO, Lloyd! How's business tonight?"" And the accommodating bar tender suddenly appears and replies politely. Well, we know Lloyd isn't really there. Is he one of Nicholson's hallucinations? After all, Jack calls him by name. But later there are ghosts with masks on that Jack has absolutely nothing to do with. I'll tell you, it's a conundrum. The mind boggles.<br/><br/>""Shutter Island"" has the same problem in spades. It's completely bewildering through most of its length. I finally caught up with it in the last five or ten minutes. It's even more confusing because the staff of the psychiatric hospital in which DeCaprio is a patient are playing roles that coincide with DeCaprio's delusions. Mark Ruffalo, whom I like, for instance, is in reality DeCaprio's primary psychiatrist but he's playing the role of DeCaprio's partner in the U. S. Marshall Service. The whole hospital is organized around DeCaprio's psychosis -- just to see if going along with his paranoia will somehow cure it.<br/><br/>It's a nifty premise, but like the notion behind ""The Game,"" it's not just improbable. It's impossible. ""The Game"" was kind of enjoyable because it had its small comic moments but Scorsese clearly means this story to be tragic. ""Which is better,"" DeCaprio asks his partner/psychiatrist at the end, ""to be a living monster or to die like a hero?"" In other words, DeCaprio seems to realize he has a choice. He can accept reality and be the monster -- he murdered his wife. Or he can submit to a lobotomy and, somehow, go on being the innocent hero of the U. S. Marshalls that he once was.<br/><br/>That lobotomy business is pretty aptly described, by the way. The operations began in the 1930s and António Egas Moniz, a Portugese neurologist, won the Nobel for using and describing the operation. Mostly it was a last resort and sometimes it worked, though with side effects. It was more or less discontinued after the discovery of anti-psychotic meds in the 1950s. If DeCaprio wants to go on living as a hero, he probably makes the right choice in choosing a lobotomy. It didn't usually rid the patient of his symptoms. It just calmed him down so he didn't act on them. DeCaprio will probably still think he's a federal agent but what remains of his personality will be a bloody stump and he won't care if they let him off the island or not."

","The world would be stupid if this movie is to be considered a very good psychological thriller/ twister. Come on, there are so many better ones.<br/><br/>Let's compare this with Tarantino's Inglorious Basterds (about the same time), though not exactly categorized as a psychological thriller but similar to Shutter Island, relies heavily on the suspense/twist factor to win the crowd. Inglorious Basterds was successful in that regard, as I was not able to predict the next outcome because the sequence of events happened in an almost random manner; even if someone can predict it, he would find it difficult to catch up to the quick pace of the movie.<br/><br/>Shutter Island, regrettably, gave off TOO MANY HINTS from the very beginning. I, at the very least, already foresee the truth during the 1st quarter of the movie. I know this is based on a novel, but Shutter Island's ending lacks the kick that Inglorious Basterds had, probably because the desired effect is sure to be tuned down once you figured out what was going on. <br/><br/>If i were to edit this movie, I could easily remove certain 'spoiler elements', like firing Michelle Williams for example, and Shutter island would be a whole lot better. Fortunately, the abundant amount of twists (thanks to the convenient use of hallucinations) kept me watching even when I already knew what is going to happen."

","I went to see this at the theater on opening day, not only did I see it once but twice, it's that good. Imagine an ex US Marshal who was put in an Institution for the mentally ill/criminally insane. It happened to Teddy Daniels, an Ex US Marshal in the 1950's. The story starts out as an interesting on to Marshal's show up on Shutter Island for an investigation. Once there clues start to pop up about a missing patient Andrew Laddius. Daniels and his partner start to investigate this so called missing patient or # 67. The viewer starts to put the puzzle together, with the help of other patients at Sutter Island we see that this is not a real investigation, it is a last ditch effort to cure Teddy Daniels. He was committed two years ago when he found out his wife killed their 3 children. I would say maybe he had some sort of break down or something that part wasn't clear to me.<br/><br/>Teddy's doctor is doing a new treatment in order to cure Teddy Daniels of his violent behavior. It is like a role playing game they are preforming at Shutter Island. Teddy/Andrew Laddius, must convince the doctor he is cured of his delusions of being a current U.S. Marshal or else this experimental treatment is all for nothing and the next step for Teddy is a Lobotomy . This treatment has most everyone involved, that works there; as well as some of the patients, and his partner is really his psychiatrist. <br/><br/>In the end Teddy/Andrew finds out the truth, what his doctor is doing, what happened to put him as a patient at Sutter Island, but in the end when you think he would snap out of it he doesn't. I thought with an experimental treatment, maybe it would work. Then the ending comes and he begins to talk to his psychiatrists/doctor, like he's still with the Marshal Service. Then U see the psychiatrist shake his head; and they come to take Teddy away.<br/><br/>I loved the movie; but the ending I thought could have been better. I thought sure he would snap out of it and realize that it was a therapeutic way to treat him; but it failed. I guess if anyone when though the psychological trauma he did, it would be a miracle if you could heal from that. THX, Kris L. CocKayne"

The boss, Teddy, asks a lot of questions, but doesn't get a lot of answers. The story he is told makes it seem impossible for the patient to have vanished from her cell. We soon see things aren't what they seem and there is an even more dangerous patient on the lose.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: It's OK, but it doesn't take a genius to figure out what is going on."

","I got myself to watch this movie since a lot of people kept saying how much better this was than Inception. It's hard to compare the two movies, since they both do amazing at their own kind. I'm a true fan of Inception, but the great psychological content made this film absolutely unforgettable to me.<br/><br/>Just to start with, we're in 1954, on an isolated island where an asylum for the criminally insane takes place (in other words, they have put some of my very favorite subjects together, nice). Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) visits the island on the purpose of investigating the disappearance of one of their patients (or as he calls them ""prisoners""), but from the very beginning he knows that something is wrong with the place. As the events go on, there are more and more weird things happening, and all together with Teddy's tragic memories as a war hero and from his personal life, he's starting to see hallucinations and feeling worse about the whole situation. Time passing by, he seems to be losing his sense of reality, and becomes more and more aware of that there's something the staff of the mental hospital won't tell him. He continues on with his investigation, but there are dark things awaiting him to find out. One question which is up during the whole movie: is there really conspiracy, or is the reason of the unreasonable oddity something more obvious, which he can't see through the veil of his past blinding him? The atmosphere of the movie is magnificent, and the acting was great as well. I'm not one big fan of DiCaprio, but I must admit that he did an amazing job in this movie, probably the most amazing act of his I have seen so far. The movie had its scary moments, and it was really exciting so it's nearly impossible to get bored of.<br/><br/>I recommend Shutter Island to everyone who likes films that makes the audience think after watching them, or even read a couple of film analysis to fully understand what they have seen. In short, a beautiful masterpiece of modern cinema."

","Because honestly, it looks like you grabbed Leo DiCaprio, a couple of wind machines, a rough draft of the screenplay for ""Inception"" and made ""Shutter Island"" over a long weekend. Granted, your genius is evident throughout the movie . . . ""Shutter Island"" is muddled, confusing and ultimately pointless, but it's littered with raw, brutal, beautiful images that are much more disturbing than the nonsense storyline. What a masterpiece you could have made if you'd taken a few months to meditate on those visions of Dachau and drowning children. They could have been the heart of this movie instead of red herrings that ultimately have nothing to do with Leo's quest for . . . well, we're never really sure, since he doesn't seem to know either. Okay, maybe I shouldn't blame you for the inconsistencies of the plot, I've never read Lehane's novel. But I will remind you that some novels shouldn't be filmed, and maybe ""Shutter Island"" is one of them. I don't mind ambiguity. However, my idea of ""ambiguity"" is not knowing why Leo came to the island. Your idea of ""ambiguity"" means getting Leo to the island and then inventing five different competing reasons for him to be there . . . is he trying to find the man who murdered his wife? Is he trying to expose atrocities committed by the US government? Is he trying (and failing) to prove that he can keep an accent for an entire movie? He has to fill in the blank along with the audience, and I'm sorry, that's not as interesting as trying to solve a riddle with a single answer."

","Look guys, I do get it. The film is a study of insanity before a thriller/horror. Doesn't make it good. Furthermore, if you read the book you'd see my point.<br/><br/>I read the book nearly a year before the film got released and I loved it. Quite possibly the most edge-of-your-seat book I read in a long time!!!! Furthermore when I saw the trailer and heard Scorsese would be doing the film adaptation I got ecstatic. Scorsese is one of the best filmmakers, and he directed my favorite film of 2006- The Departed. That movie was just spectacular, and it changed the way I saw movies forever. It blew my then-teenage mind, and I'll never forget the first time I saw it.<br/><br/>So could tell, I was excited, and flocking to the theatre on opening day, I was ready to place this at the top of my list.<br/><br/>The film is true to the book, yes. Is that a good thing? It depends. I was happy they stuck with the book, as basically it seemed like they used the book as the film's screenplay.<br/><br/>However, I have the feeling that this would be a one star review if I hadn't read the book. For one, even my girlfriend, who hadn't read the book, knew the ending about 10 minutes in. The plot worked well in the book, but as a movie, just simply fails, again showing that not all books that are great make good movies. The movie is pretty alright, as it is lush and colorful in a few scenes and at times even seems like a Gothic horror film. Again, pretty pictures does not equal good movie.<br/><br/>Another thing ruining the film is its ""punch in the face"" musical score. Come on, the score was ridiculous. Spooky tingling piano music!!! Nazi-marching-into-town-music!!! LOUD BRASS music!!! Whoever did the score needs a kick in the teeth. The murder scene near the end was hilarious due to the inappropriate spooky tingling piano music.<br/><br/>In short, honestly this film is pointless. I love Scorsese but this film just doesn't do anything for me. Skip it."
"ildimo1877","4","3","6","2 September 2010"," A barely enjoyable miss
","Forgetting the sucker I am for this kind of genre filmmaking I'm afraid I have to abstain from this one. Mr. Scorsese 's been trying too hard to make a grand, Oscar wining movie too long and now he's won it he seems plagued by his habit. The touch is officially lost. Blame it on the legend.<br/><br/>Right or wrong a noirish crime psychodrama is heavily relied on its plot. To this writer, and I guess to anyone who's read his Edgar Allan Poe and seen his Angel Heart - the far superior movie ancestor of this one – the plot is known in the first ten minutes. The rest, plot-wise, is an alarmingly unpleasant déjà vu. Of course, this being a Scorsese picture, it ought to contain more than meets the eye. It does – to a point at least. There is obsession, pain, guilt, and wrong turns taken. There is also the bombast of self-importance and meaning. Shutter Island (I'd hoped) wasn't the case for applying this kind of filmmaking mentality. Spectacularly, Island, besides being the patchwork of cinematic tributes to end all patchworks, also seeks for post post-modern auteuristic appraisal – not to mention a voracious self-gratification/affirmation. Hitchcock, Fuller, Siegel – all of them here imitated, none of them Oscar holder – would never indulge <br/><br/>Mr. Di Caprio, next only to his last year's performance in Revolutionary Road, is near perfect, the personification of the failing powers of a broken man. But, make no mistakes this a Scorsesian picture – even more than Gangs of New York and Aviator were in their own egomaniacal way. Overindulgent and cinematically aware, this is a 138 minute thriller of the mind emulating genre cinema of the 40s-50s that was about 50 minutes briefer and decidedly more economical. It is beautifully shot and meticulously executed of course but all is so overtly stylized and unfortunately scripted to feel redundant at half time. Scorsese has never been a director of atmospheres in the manner of a Vidor, a Tourneur or a Wise and by attempting at exactly their kind of filmmaking – which he admittedly adores and rightfully acknowledges – fails considerably. His strength has always been addressing the fallen male and in that he manages a welcomely engaging finale – albeit, a gloriously predictable one.<br/><br/>An ill masterpiece for the scholars of the future – who undoubtedly will contribute volumes of their own lives projected in the film – a barely enjoyable miss to the rest."
"MrGKB","6","3","6","27 August 2010"," Yet another over-rated Scorsese outing...
","...that leads me to question (once again) the movie-going sensibilities of the ""common man"" as represented by the denizens of the IMDb. I am utterly perplexed that this high-grade bit of noir-ish filmmaking has so impressed the masses; its current rating is far too generous for what's been delivered. Much like ""Avatar,"" Scorsese's latest is all about style and very little about substance. The ""twist"" to the story is so transparent that it becomes obvious long before the film is over, thus rendering the final reels an exercise in tedium. Hearkening back to the days of Hitchcockian psychological thrillers, replete with obvious dreamscape tropes like vertiginous cliffs, revelatory caverns, and hallucinatory warnings, ""Shutter Island"" mines its territory with no small degree of authority, but no lesser degree of familiarity and lack of tension and surprise. The professionalism of the work is admirable, but its creativity and heart are, sad to say, pedestrian and unremarkable. I have no doubt that the novel on which it was based is a better read than ""Shutter Island"" is a viewing.<br/><br/>Scorsese scored his best box office to date with ""Shutter Island,"" so I suppose I shouldn't complain too loudly about how he's been progressively dumbing down his product (although, then again, maybe that's exactly what I should be complaining about); it's at least small blessing that his repeated collaborations with Leonardo ""Titanic"" DiCaprio have born financial fruit. Using established collaborators/luminaries like DP Robert ""Kill Bill"" Richardson, production designer Dante ""Casino"" Ferretti, and a host of name actors (even in peripheral roles) certainly didn't hurt, but unlike the aforementioned ""Vertigo"" and others of its stature, ""Shutter Island"" is destined to recede from the fickle memory of the great unwashed masses to take its place in the immense repository of ""better than a sharp stick in the eye"" films that Hollywood churns out by the hundreds.<br/><br/>What is it with the lapdog idolization of Scorcese by the predominantly adolescent/young adult IMDb legions? The man has helmed a solid pantheon of ""great"" movies, including ""Taxi Driver,"" ""Raging Bull,"" ""Goodfellas,"" and arguably ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" (and perhaps even ""The King of Comedy""), but this is little reason to elevate his lesser works to equal heights. Are his fans here on this site truly that indiscriminate, or unschooled? Perhaps it has to do with the man's intimate devotion to popular music, as evinced by films like ""The Last Waltz,"" ""No Direction Home: Bob Dylan,"" ""Shine a Light,"" and the upcoming ""Sinatra;"" I don't know. All I know, I suppose, is that Scorsese is finally getting his due, and I suppose that isn't all bad. If it takes LCD work like ""Shutter Island"" to do it, I guess I'll accept it. But it won't change my perceptions of quality storytelling one iota, nor my dismay at the easy acceptance of average as excellent by the bulk of young moviegoers."
"kuciak","6","3","6","7 July 2010"," When Less Could Have Been More
","Watching Shutter Island, I asked myself the question who might have been a better director for this movie. I thought about a director like Sam Fuller, (someone Scorcesse admires) and I even thought of some possible obscure directors, who might not have had a huge budget, and would not have been able to shoot some of the scenes on their budget. Watching the film, like another writer here has pointed out, you think of the famous 1919 German film, The cabinet of Dr. Caligari, I also thought of the overrated 1970's British film, The Wickerman )esspecially when the lead character is going to the lighthouse. Also came to mind, a film which I think is superior to this, the 1987 film Angel Heart.<br/><br/>Is Scorcesse paying homage to these films, maybe. Before the film even began, I suspected Dicaprio's character would turn out to be a patient on Shutter Island. The poster for the film also seemed to be to much of a giveaway. Part of the problem I have with the film are the flashback sequences to the main character. Yes we know that his wife is dead, but for the director to have to show these scenes, and to have hallucination type scenes ruins the film, as we are clearly going to realize that Shutter Island, is not the search for a missing patient, but is about the mind of the Dicaprio character. Worse still are the World War II scenes of concentration camps, as if trying to give greater importance to a thriller. When the final denouncement of who the Dicaprio character really is, it should come to no surprise to the audience, if they are surprised, they certainly haven't seen many movies.<br/><br/>I wondered watching Shutter Island, what a great 1950's or 60's low budget film this would have been. What if some producer had given some money to a gifted director who just wanted to make a good film, and the producer said ""Here is the money, go make the film, but don't go over this budget. Perhaps a taunt and shorter interesting thriller would have been made, and the events of the Dicaprio characters past, would only have been discussed, except for the important final flashback scene. I think such a film might be discussed some 50 or 60 years latter, which I don't think this film will achieve.<br/><br/>I enjoyed Shutter Island for awhile, there going to the Island, and introduction to the Island was fine, but after the scene where we see Mr. Dicaprio talking to his dead wife, her turning into ashes into his arms, it was downhill from their. The scene was so over the top. The last hour of the film, I just wanted it to end. The ending scene however is poignant, and Dicaprio's last line memorable. Some have even suggested that Scorcesse was paying some homage to the RKO produced Val Lewton horror films of the 40's. If so, what Mr. Scorcesse has forgotten is that Val Lewton did not have a great deal of money to throw around like he does, and probably made more superior films that Shutter Island."
"Cyck1","8","3","6","23 June 2010"," A solid entry from The Legend...
","That legend being Scorsese of course.<br/><br/>Okay, bad stuff out the way first... Shutter Island's tendency to rape your mind with chilling hallucinations from DiCaprio's character Edward Daniels ultimately ends up being a bit on the superfluous side because at one point its completely obvious what the twist is going to be (Noyce cell scene). Unlike the deceptive and absolutely beautiful visions that Daniels has throughout the film, its 100% clear that the Noyce scene is really happening and because he is talking complete sense its clear that he isn't lying. All other attempts at making me wonder what is true and what isn't true then become null. I know how it will end and Scorsese doesn't surprise me.<br/><br/>Now the good news... seeing the twist coming a mile away doesn't destroy the film. Not even close. Unlike other directors Scorsese packs every scene with enough power and weight and beauty that a twist being predictable hardly matters at all. Between the haunting cinematography, cool CGI effects, razor-sharp musical score and trademark Scorsese violence this film will suck you in and spit you right out. DiCaprio completely redeems himself here from his bleh performance in Revolutionary Road. The supporting cast also does a great job.<br/><br/>And that's the long and short of it. Shutter Island is a masterful thrill ride. It's a roller coaster of a film and a roller coaster isn't any less exciting just because you can see the end of the track while waiting in line. Hope that sounds smart."

"tburke85","8","3","6","12 June 2010"," Shutter Island An Excellent Suspenseful Thriller
","Shutter Island is an excellent suspenseful thriller with some flaws which I'll get into later but the good more than outweighs that bad in this one. Director Martin Scorsese is admirable in making Shutter Island giving audiences nearly everything they could expect or want from one of these films. Leonard DiCaprio is great as always as Teddy Daniels a US Marshal on route to a remote island for the criminally insane to investigate the disappearance of a murderess who somehow escaped from her locked hospital room. Or as Ben Kingsley's mysterious head Dr. Crawley explains; ""We don't know how she got out of her room. It's as if she evaporated straight through the walls."" Leonardo DiCaprio brings an intensity to the role (like in Blood Diamond and The Deaprted to name a couple) and at times vulnerability. He continues to show audiences and critics his talent as an actor. This film is no different. Well done. The rest of the talented cast including Mark Ruffalo, Ben Kingsley, Michelle Williams, Emily Mortimer, and Max von Sydow in a small role are effective as the supporting characters in their limited screen time. Particia Clarkson, Elias Kosteas, John Carroll Lynch, Ted Levine, and Jackie Earl Haely are also very good in their brief extended appearances since most of the story's focus is on DiCaprio which isn't necessarily a bad thing. Shutter Island turned out to be much better than expected. It has an interesting story, suspense, an eerie mood, and atmosphere with strong performances from the cast. The movie also has some nice twists and surprises. One I sort of did suspect and others I found surprising to say the least. So it's better to avoid spoilers and watch this film without knowing too much about the plot for you to truly enjoy Shutter Island. I found this film to be much better than others who disguise themselves as suspense thrillers (The Grudge, The Happening, and Shutter to name a few). I enjoyed that Scorsese didn't heavily rely on CG except for some and instead used for the most part realistic locations and atmosphere to create the suspense. The location they chose for the island was a perfect setting for this story to take place and it added a lot to the movie. The flashback sequences of Teddy's time in World War 2 were an interesting touch that give us some insight into his traumatic past which continues to plague him while on the island. The pace of the movie was a little slow in the beginning before the suspense really started to kick into high gear but overall I can't think of all that much I didn't like about this film. Sure it might have some tiny flaws including a surprise I sort of saw coming but I thought Scorsese still did a good job with the execution of the twist none the less. In some ways Shutter Island reminded me a bit of the Shining because both films used actual locations, surreal images, and atmosphere to create suspense build up instead of relying on CGI. I was impressed with this movie and I plan to watch it again sometime because second viewings I think are needed to fully understand the story so it makes sense. Not that the story itself is very complicated but I believe Shutter Island's worth watching a second time even with a 138 minute running time because the film is that good despite it's few flaws. If you're in the mood for a suspenseful thriller or you're a fan of the genre, you can't go wrong with Shutter Island. It has an intricate story, suspense, twists, surprises, and solid performances by the cast (especially DiCaprio, Ruffalo, and Kingsley) who make this thriller worth the time to watch."

","Too rarely are we offered films that are so well written (Laeta Kalogidis does a marvelous adaptation of Dennis Lahane's mesmerizing novel) that after viewing the audience is almost afraid to leave the theater or home screen for fear they may have missed some important information that will help them figure out why the story is so successfully enigmatic. Such is the case for Martin Scorsese's brilliant film, SHUTTER ISLAND. It is only in retrospect, after the shock of the film is over, that the magic of quality cinematic achievement can be appreciated. Then in rethinking the events the film portrays so well the story is as straightforward as Scorsese's vision. <br/><br/>The film opens in 1954 nothingness - from out of the fog slowly appears a ship headed toward Shutter Island, a terrifying prison for the criminally insane, and almost incidentally we meet US Federal Marshal Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) emetically cloistered in a ship's lavatory while his newly assigned partner Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo) awkwardly waits for him on deck. The two are on a mission to investigate the escape of a female prisoner. They are greeted by curious wardens who escort them onto the terrifyingly ugly and ominous island to meet with the famous psychiatrist Dr. Cawley (Ben Kingsley) and Dr. Naehring (Max von Sydow). Curious restrictions are placed on the Marshals who decide to return to Boston because of lack of cooperation from the psychiatrists. A hurricane prevents their exit and slowly the story unwinds: Daniels is haunted by memories of his war experience in viewing the concentration camps in Dachau and delusion of his wife Dolores (Michelle Williams) in nightmares he cannot explain. The various aspects of the Marshals' investigation lead them to all of the compounds where prisoners are kept and treated and surgically altered and the terror mounts. To tell more of the story of one man's descent in to madness would distract from the viewer's own grappling with the conundrum of this tale. It must be seen to appreciate the brilliance of the story. <br/><br/>In addition to superb performances by DiCaprio, Ruffalo, Kingsley, von Sydow, and Williams there are astonishing well crafted cameos by Patricia Clarkson, Elias Koteas, Emily Mortimer, John Carroll Lynch and a very large cast of bit players. The cinematography is superbly crafted by Robert Richardson. The music score for this moody piece is a montage of works by such brilliant composers as György Ligeti, Krzystof Penderecki, John Cage, Morton Feldman, Schnittke, Lou Harrison, John Adams and even Gustav Mahler whose rarely heard 'Quartet for Piano and Strings in A minor' plays a significant role in the film. On all accounts this is a superb film. Why it did not do well in the theatrical run is puzzling: perhaps it is a long film that is way ahead of its time. Watch it on DVD and become absorbed by all the bizarre mysteries it captures. <br/><br/>Grady Harp"
"horrorshowmovie","7","3","6","20 May 2010"," Good visuals, but disappointing
","This is a good movie, but for Scorsese, it's disappointing. It has the acting and the visuals, but falls flat in the subtlety department. If you watch many psychological thrillers, you will almost immediately be aware that at least some of the events in the movie exist in DiCaprio's head. This is barely a spoiler, it's just incredibly obvious. <br/><br/>There are many, similar movies that have an overly stressed police officer/agent/whatever, often with headaches, often with a new partner, who try to unravel a labyrinthine plot only to discover that much of what they assumed is an illusion, usually caused by past stress. If this kind of framework sounds familiar to you, Shutter Island won't be very impressive. <br/><br/>Some of the events in the movie lack subtlety. I would have appreciated the scenes from Dachau more if they hadn't be explained point blank-- just suggest that this knowledge of evil is with the main character, don't beat us over the head with it.<br/><br/>On the plus side, the island looks perfect. The wind and rain are terrific, the whitening flashes of lightning are great, and the visuals in general are spectacular.<br/><br/>The acting was also good, but it can't elevate an average storyline.<br/><br/>I do recommend this movie. It was a disappointment to me, but it's not bad, and for viewers who aren't as familiar with psychological thrillers, it might be quite fresh."

","There seems to be a divide among critics and audiences on the twist and ending to ""Shutter Island,"" with some calling it brilliant, and others calling it cheap. I found the ending to be effective, and here's why.<br/><br/>I think it helps cement the picture as a statement on what a person will do to block out (or warp) a bad memory. Keep in mind that Andrew Laeddis (I will refer to Leo's character by his real name here) did not want to be associated with killing anymore after the incident in Dachau. Because he was so traumatized by that, and by the actions of his wife, he tries to fulfill his commitment by putting the murder on someone else. The reason he goes insane is because his mind will do anything to deny the truth, even if it means falling into delusional traps. The last scene may also show how far he is willing to go to wash out the memory of him murdering his wife. Has he really regressed, or is he just pretending so the memory can be gutted out?<br/><br/>Laeddis wants to remain a good person. Yet not only does his insanity block him from the dark truth, but it also makes the other people on Shutter Island not trust him or take him seriously (Laeddis once remarks that once you're declared insane, anything you say or do is perceived with a wary mind). He's a war veteran, he is a former U.S. Marshall, and he's living in the era of Cold War paranoia. How far will he go to avoid, as he puts it, to ""live a monster""?<br/><br/>Yes, ""Shutter Island"" plays numerous mind games and misdirects us. But not only do I feel this is understandable (since the protagonist is an unreliable narrator), but I feel it all plays into the film's themes of denial and sanity (or lack, thereof).<br/><br/>I give it an 8.5/10, and I will stand by my belief that this is another solid film from Martin Scorsese."
"colinrgeorge","7","3","6","6 April 2010"," ""Shutter Island""
","""Shutter Island"" is a schlocky, second-rate screenplay--which has the incredible good fortune of being directed by Martin Scorsese.<br/><br/>A psychological thriller wasn't really what anyone expected from the acclaimed filmmaker, and although he sometimes feels lost in the unfamiliar genre, Scorsese lends a natural authenticity to the predictable plot and an earnestness to the would-be flat characters that salvages what might have been another ""Wolfman"" for something half-way memorable. And, hey, he won his Oscar. What better time to branch out?<br/><br/>The problem with Scorsese's experiment is ultimately that it feels safe, which is half a function of an unremarkable script, and half his unfamiliarity in directing horror. He approaches the genre in the way a famous baker might prepare a steak—He goes back to the recipe. Sure, he sears some effectives sequences, with palpable suspense and unsettling visuals, but it's missing those hand-written notes in the margins that bring you back for seconds.<br/><br/>His take on the story, while infinitely superior to, say, Joe Johnston's, still isn't quite ideal, and he seems to cling to the familiar whenever possible. He has a tendency to play up the noir element, with a fetishistic infatuation for the fifties period trench coats and fedoras that Leonardo DiCaprio and Mark Ruffolo sport, and for conversations punctuated by cigarettes, with a performance vocabulary that screams of the gangster flicks he's known for. That ""Shutter Island"" so clearly bears Scorsese's fingerprints is sort of the issue: a film about an insane asylum should be anything but predictable.<br/><br/>But the director's successes should not be undermined either, and when ""Shutter Island"" works, it really works. For instance, DiCaprio as Marshall Teddy Daniels suffers from a particularly disturbing recurring flashback (compelling perhaps because it wasn't spoiled in the trailer) that features the young man as an Allied soldier liberating a Nazi concentration camp. The grotesque imagery of the war blends beautifully with the heady horror, and the cinematography is so sharp that one might wonder why Scorsese has never taken on a war film.<br/><br/>Scorsese also achieves some masterfully atmospheric scenes on the island itself. He has a way of making the omnipresent hurricane a character, and the way the rain beats against the windows and leaks in during the night is subtly threatening, ratcheting up the intensity that he skillfully pays off in exteriors. These great moments are hardly lonely, but even the director's eerie visuals and tight pacing falter by the final third of ""Shutter Island's"" overlong 138-minute running time.<br/><br/>The film becomes so suddenly talky and expository at its end that the whole thing almost capsizes under the weight. There is a twist, and you will likely understand it long before Scorsese is finished spoon-feeding you the solutions to each presumed non sequitur and tying up absolutely every loose end.<br/><br/>But even though Scorsese is feeling his way through the dark in directing a modern psychological horror film, watching him work is still enjoyable, and I stress that the vast majority of the problems with ""Shutter Island"" on the screen are problems with ""Shutter Island"" on the page. Scorsese elevates the mediocre script into an above-average thriller that, if nothing else, is better than what's playing down the hall. Whether you enter as a fan of the genre or the director, ""Shutter Island"" is a palatable film. Just don't expect to be hungry for seconds."
"doctorsmoothlove","5","3","6","24 March 2010"," Studder Island
","Shutter Island is the newest reference point for why I hate movie trailers. Ever since September I was berated with flashing images of ""an asylum for the criminally insane"" while simultaneously watching some crazy person attack Leonardo DiCaprio. This had the effect of making me think I would enjoy a high budget horror or thriller from Scorsese. What I got was actually a noir film. Not that I am too angry, but why was the film advertised in a way that an audience could misinterpret its genre? As a homage pic, the film gushes with both stylistic and story references to the heyday noir films. It's even set in the early '50s.<br/><br/>US Marshal Teddy Daniels (DiCaprio) takes a case at Shutter Island (home of the criminally insane), an Alcatraz-like place, to investigate the disappearance of a patient. He is accompanied by a new partner and may have a personal motive to take care of. His wife recently perished in a house fire, and a suspect is being kept there. When he arrives, he is greeted by the enigmatic owner John Cawley (Ben Kingsley). Cawley says everything is under control and offers his help in the investigation. This investigation leads Daniels to many locales all of which feature overbearing, dramatic music. This intentionally distracting addition becomes its own character. Whenever it picks up, prepare to feel tense (you usually do). Scorsese knows how he wants us to feel and firmly places us into his preferred condition.<br/><br/>Daniels suspects there is more happening than Cawley will admit. He imagines horrific Nazi-style brain control experiments may be happening. He continues going to different places as a storm brews. He is becoming too obsessed with finding out what is going on and sees ghastly images of his dead wife. He makes it to the place where the experiments are taking place and is greeted by Cawley. It is now when the almost famous plot twist occurs, and I cannot ethically reveal it. It's the film's greatest asset.<br/><br/>Has there been a film as over-directed as this one recently? Scorsese does too good a job in placing the camera below his actors, dimming the lights, or showing a thunderstorm. His handiness is an attempt to counter the film's gratuitous length of 138 minutes. Additional footage of Daniels' personal life is referenced multiple times as well as many unnecessary visits to different places. The film could be cut by at least 40 minutes and lose little of its story. The movie while ""good"" under the categorical meaning of that word is a dreadful bore.<br/><br/>While we have now sat through well-directed nothingness for about 110 minutes, the tone suddenly changes once the truth is revealed. And it is at this juncture that I went from passively enjoying the film (enough to recommend it) to disliking it. The film's climax does not fit logically within its structure and lacks the screen time to fit within the story. The ""whodunit"" comes about and then an existential quandary is presented to justify it. What a cheap shot. It's like leading someone (who is ugly) to think you (who are attractive) want to date them and then admitting it was a prank.<br/><br/>The difficulty in predicting the twist shouldn't be praised. In the previous Dennis Lehane adaptation Gone Baby Gone it was unexpected yet plausible and thus satisfying. I think a twist is meaningless if its presence reverses the entire way an audience has been indoctrinated into a film. Scorsese's ability cannot cover for a weakness in the novel's storytelling and once you have experienced one type of Shutter Island you can't enjoy the other. The novel is probably the better version of this story.<br/><br/>Not Recommended"
"ferguson-6","8","3","6","20 February 2010"," Rat in a Maze
","Greetings again from the darkness. Ahh yes, the psychological thriller is my favorite movie genre. Not sure what that says about me. There are so few good ones, at least since Alfred Hitchcock passed on. Director Martin Scorsese often includes some psychological warfare in his films, but with ""Shutter Island"", he leaps feet first into the world of the criminally insane.<br/><br/>This is a very difficult film to comment on because it is crucial that the viewer watch with a clean slate ... in other words, don't let someone toss out some spoilers if you plan to see the film. All I will say regarding the story is that it's fun to watch and my brain was working non-stop the whole time (that's a good thing!). Scorcese uses many different camera angles, close-ups and bright red to go with the island storm. The film has some of the style of his Cape Fear, but even more darkness to the story, as here, EVERY character is a bit off center.<br/><br/>Scorsese has, as usual, assembled an excellent cast. Leonardo DiCaprio takes the lead as Teddy. His partner is played by Mark Ruffalo and they ""investigate"" the disappearance of a patient from Shutter Island - a treatment center for the criminally insane. This is no vacation island and at the center is a civil war fort that houses the worst of the worst. The creepy place is run by Ben Kingsley and Max von Sydow, who could both make afternoon English Tea seem downright ominous.<br/><br/>The cast is so strong that Emily Mortimer and Patricia Clarkson are basically limited to one scene each and Jackie Earle Haley continues his resurgence with a wicked one on one scene with Leo. Michelle Williams makes her appearances via flashbacks, visions and sweaty, late night dreams. By the end of the film, her ugly yellow dress was itself a frightening prop.<br/><br/>To cap off the mental and emotional turmoil, Scorsese adds an unusual score that at first seems overbearing at odd times, but later reveals itself to have been ""right"" all along. My favorite shot of the film is at the very beginning when the ferry first breaks through the fog. Funny enough, it was ME in a fog for the next 2 hours!"
"zardoz-13","4","6","16","21 February 2010"," Utter Hokum!!!
","Oscar-winning film director Martin Scorsese's latest movie ""Shutter Island"" with Leonardo DiCaprio, Ben Kingsley, and Mark Ruffalo, qualifies as his worst epic since ""Boxcar Bertha"" in 1972. Mind you, Scorsese received an Academy Award finally in 2007 for his absorbing Bostonian undercover crime thriller ""The Departed."" Previously, he missed bagging the bronze statuette for ""Raging Bull"" in 1981, ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" in 1989, ""Goodfellas"" in 1991, ""The Age of Innocence"" in 1994, ""Gangs of New York"" in 2003, and ""The Aviator"" in 2005. Based on ""Mystic River"" author Dennis Lehane's 2003 bestselling psycho-thriller, ""Shutter Island"" constitutes a masterpiece of art direction, set design, cinematography, computer-generated special effects and top-notch acting. Nevertheless, you'll hate this gimmicky claptrap as soon as Scorsese and ""Alexander"" scenarist Laeta Kalogridis trot out their mind-boggling eleventh hour revelation! Talk about getting the rug yanked out from under your feet! Indeed, Scorsese seems to be channeling Alfred Hitchcock of ""Vertigo"" and ""North by Northwest"" during the first half of this portentous two-hour and eighteen minute melodrama before he shifts gears and imitates director M. Night Shyamalan of ""The Village"" in the last 20 minutes. Contrived and complicated from the start, this gloomy Gothic mystery thriller about a Houdini-like escape from a Federal maximum security asylum for the criminally insane, which resembles Alcatraz in Boston Harbor, is as delusional as a dog chasing its tail. Visually, ""Shutter Island"" could pass muster if it had stuck to its fairly predictable police procedural plot. Unfortunately, Scorsese weaves quite a tale that takes some strange turns before the bottom falls out. People that hate movies about elaborate mind games that lead them by the nose through a maze and then surprise them with a bad ending won't enjoy ""Shutter Island."" Meantime, audiences scavenging for visceral shocks to chill themselves are going to be sorely disappointed.<br/><br/>""Shutter Island"" opens in 1954 in the Boston Harbor Islands as a storm is brewing offshore. Hard-boiled World War II veteran Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio of ""Titanic"") and his new partner Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo of ""The Last Castle"") are U.S. Federal Deputy Marshals who have been assigned to investigate the mysterious disappearance of an inmate patient at Ashecliffe Asylum. Ashecliffe occupies an island of its own, like Alcatraz Prison, and its terrain is both craggy and forbidding. A bald-headed, pipe-smoking Dr. Cawley (Ben Kingsley of ""Fifty Dead Men Walking"") welcomes our gumshoe heroes to the island. Ashecliffe is more than an asylum; it is a hospital and a laboratory. Cawley lets Teddy and Chuck know from the start that he favors drugs over lobotomy. He struggles to bring moral order and peace to the troubled inmates, most of whom are murderers. Cawley has summoned the Marshals because a convicted psychopathic killer, Rachel (Emily Mortimer of ""The Pink Panther 2""), has vanished from her cell. Rachel is a murderess who drowned her three children. Deputy Warden McPherson (John Carroll Lynch of ""Grand Torino"") has dozens of uniformed guards out turning over rocks while all this is transpiring. Teddy is just recovering from the voyage to the island. He suffers from seasickness. Cawley offers him aspirin. According to Cawley, when the attendant locked Rachel into his cell, he locked her in from the outside. When the Marshals scour Rachel's room, all they find is a cryptic note about 'the law of 4.' Moreover, Rachel left behind both pairs of shoes, and the terrain is far too treacherous for her to negotiate it without footwear. Deputy Warden McPherson points out that swimming under the current circumstances was out of the question. The currents would have driven her body back ashore. <br/><br/>Meanwhile, Teddy and Chuck are livid with indignation when they learn Cawley let the doctor treating Rachel take his long overdue vacation at the genesis of an investigation. Essentially, Teddy and Chuck spend most of their time interrogating the doctors, the staff, and the patients. Teddy wants to scrutinize the personnel records of everybody that dealt with Rachel. Cawley refuses to open the books because the information is confidential. Initially, since neither senior psychotherapist Dr. Naehring (Max Von Sydow of ""The Seventh Seal"") nor Cawley will allow Teddy to examine the personnel records. Eventually, Teddy discovers that Rachel could have slipped past one attendant when he went to the restroom. During their wanderings around the island, Teddy and Chuck get caught in a bad storm that forces Cawley and company to mobilize the staff and patients for an emergency. Our heroes wind up drenched to the skin, and Teddy resigns himself to staying on the island since the storm prevents their departure. <br/><br/>""Shutter Island"" doesn't look as bad as its plot is. Scorsese creates a palatable sense of paranoia, and the atmosphere simmers with tension. Early long shots of the ferry penetrating a fog bank on its way to the island reminded me of the ship in ""King Kong"" approaching Skull Island. Unfortunately, ""Shutter Island"" simmers but never comes boils. Despite ""JFK"" lenser Robert Richardson's incredibly flavorful cinematography and long-time Scorsese editor Thelma Schoonmaker's brisk cutting, this film takes too long to unfold and its payoff doesn't equal the time spent conjuring it up. A major flaw for any Hollywood movie is the absence of a sympathetic hero for whom we can root. The Leonard DiCaprio protagonist may generate a modicum of sympathy, but he lacks charisma. Nobody in this movie is remotely likable, especially the eerie Dr. Naehring. Naehring and Teddy have an intimate moment in the hallway and Naehring gets a taste of his own medicine. Moments like that aren't enough to redeem this potboiler. Altogether, ""Shutter Island"" amounts to utter hokum."

","Shutter Island had a promising premise and a good trailer, but when I left the theater I was totally annoyed - movie was worst scheisse that Scorsese has put out (saying it mildly).<br/><br/>First thing that bugged me was the quality of film - it could have been badly focused projection of the film in the theater in question (Kinopalatsi, Helsinki) - but I noticed that some scenes had really blurry shots because director of photography chose the depth of field totally wrong. Film had some visual moments, but general blurriness of picture ruined those moments.<br/><br/>Story was incomprehensible with it's flashbacks and twists. DiCaprio was just going around the island without any significance. Story didn't go nowhere and it was getting boring in the end.<br/><br/>I can imagine Hollywood producers thinking that they will combine atmosphere from the 'Shining' with story similar with 'Beautiful Mind' and TV series 'Prisoner'. I think that Scorsese didn't have much to say in this - I can't believe that he would have done this voluntarily, probably did it just for money."

I would have ankled this piece of unmitigated water torture after thirty minutes, but being wedged into a balcony seat at the Friedrichstadt Palast theater and unable to extrude my body without disturbing the whole balcony, I was condemned to suffer through the entire torture session to the bitter end. I did try to close my eyes and think of other things a few times, but even that didn't help much. This is pure unadulterated insanity and mindfuck without a letup. The music selections by Mahler, John Adams, John Cage, and others of the Depressia Profunda School, were carefully chosen to provide the film with a certain intellectual cachet, while enhancing the mood of endless misery with a No Way Out conclusion. In the film the exceedingly creepy doctor Kingsley and his Frankenstein like syringe clutching crony, Von Sydow, on the Evil Island where experimental Nazi type brain operations are going on, are trying to convince Govt cop Dicaprio that he has lost his mind, and finally succeed in doing so --but by this time the audience has also been driven pretty much gaga as well.<br/><br/>Mr. Scorcese is obviously trying to outdo Kubrick in ""The Shining"", but where the Shining had some shining moments, lots of verve, and a bit of a sense of humor, this extended piece of dark mumbo-jumbo has no redeeming moments, no verve or social value whatsoever, certainly no sense of humor, and plods relentlessly on and on aiming for the jugular vein of the mind. This all only goes to prove that Mr Scorcese could probably use a complete brain transplant himself before carrying on. He shoulda thrown in the towel after Raging Bull, but he is apparently too much in thrall with his ""great Hollywood director"" image to know when it's time to quit. (He did say he was ready to quit a few films ago, but has sadly reneged on this promise). ""Shutter Island"" (or, The Isle of Ultimate Ghouls) was definitely one to ruin Anybody's Valentines Day.

He does the same with his latest cinematic triumph ""Shutter Island"", a psychological thriller of almost surreal proportions and breath-taking beauty; it's not your typical Martin Scorsese film (then again, no Scorsese film is TYPICAL Scorsese), but his genius is apparent throughout the entire two hours and twenty minutes of the film.<br/><br/>The story follows Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio), a war veteran who's investigating the disappearance of a dangerous psychotic murderess from Shutter Island, a secluded high-security prison for the criminally insane. The island itself is enough to give you the creeps: the only building is the prison itself, and the rest of the island is a vast wilderness of falling trees and jagged rocks. It's constantly being beaten by rough waves and storms, and the island is situated in the middle of nowhere; the only way in or out of the island is through its feeble port, which is controlled by the US army. The wardens at the island are mysterious and creepy (they're Ted Levine and John Carroll Lynch, the psycho murderers of ""The Silence of the Lambs"" and ""Zodiac"", so you get the picture) and the chief doctors and psychiatrists at the prison are even creepier: Dr. Cawley (Ben Kingsley) and Dr. Naehring (Max Von Sydow), very intelligent specialists who always seem to be on the 'patient's' side and who mysteriously are uncooperative with Teddy's investigation.<br/><br/>A patient named Rachel, a woman who drowned her three children, is one of the most dangerous inmates at the prison. She's quite violent (they say), and she lives in a delusion where her children are still alive and where the prison is actually her home and the inmates are her neighbors. During a stormy night, Rachel goes missing from her cell...which is quite strange, given the amount of security this particular prison offers, and she is now out and about who knows where. Teddy arrives to Shutter Island with his partner Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo) to investigate her disappearance and to aid the wardens in her search. Nevertheless...Teddy has a secret agenda in accepting to help this investigation. As a war veteran fighting in the liberation of Dachau during WWII he learned of some horribly inhuman psychological experiments that were being conducted by the US government on the criminally insane, and he plans to uncover if Shutter Island has some connections to these experiments (which it probably does).<br/><br/>Teddy is a highly tormented man: his experiences in Dachau, where he came in full view of the horrors humans are capable of have left him scarred. Not only that, but his wife Dolores (Michelle Williams) had recently been killed in a fire accident in his LA apartment, where the pyromaniac janitor who worked there had been proved guilty and had been sent to Shutter Island but of whom (mysteriously) no one in Shutter Island has heard of. With a heavy heart and a heavily-laden agenda, Teddy aims to uncover the truth these creepy wardens, psychiatrists and patients are withholding from the world...but Shutter Island turns out to be more than Teddy can handle, and he soon finds himself in a nerve-shattering race to stay alive and, more importantly, to keep his sanity.<br/><br/>The movie has all the elements of a pitch-perfect thriller, and it is just that. It's a thriller that has you breathless from the very first scene all the way to the very last horrifying twist at the end. Over two hours long and it doesn't waste a single minute. Once again, Scorsese gives a heavy dose of depth to his characters, especially Teddy whom we come to understand and identify ourselves with very early in the film. Every single scene is perfect! The cinematography is breath-taking and sublime, the lighting is a thriller's dream of perfection, the sound design and the music augments the film's tension to nerve-shattering levels and the exemplary acting makes the events unraveling on screen and the truths we discover all the more astounding. The screenplay, adapted from a Dennis Lehane novel has little or no flaws, and Scorsese seamlessly weaves all these quality aspects into one of the best films of the year! What can I say? I'm afraid that I can't say too much, for if I utter another syllable of the plot I would be giving the game away, and the individual aspects of the film work in such perfect symbiosis that they CAN'T be reviewed piece by piece lest the film is deprived of the wonder it conveys upon watching it. Suffice it to say that it's one of the best Scorsese films ever: VERY intelligent, suspenseful to a tee, deep, poignant, entertaining...you'll want to see it at least twice; I did, and the second time around it hadn't lost an iota of its greatness. Rating: 4 stars out of 4!! Oh, by the way: I can't fathom a possible reason why this film was left out of the Academy Awards this year. There's no reason, human or divine, why it shouldn't have received some nods. I can only hope it will be taken into consideration for next year's Academy Awards lest the Academy wants to indirectly declare themselves a fraud."
"Turfseer","6","3","7","24 June 2010"," Thoroughly entertaining despite far-fetched role-play plot
","I have to liken 'Shutter Island' to another mystery-thriller: 'The Sixth Sense'. Both have a myriad of clues planted throughout the narrative, leading to a highly entertaining twist ending. I'll confess that I was pretty much fooled up until the climax but I did have my suspicions that things couldn't be what they seemed. At first, it seems that 'Shutter Island' is going to be a tale about some evil psychiatrists (aided and abetted by a corrupt staff) who are conducting secret experiments on a hapless population of psychiatric patients. Dr. Cawley (perfectly played by Ben Kingsley) does everything he can to stymie Federal Marshall Teddy Daniel's investigation including his refusal to hand over staff personnel folders. Before you know it, there are rumors that lobotomies are being performed at the lighthouse, on a different part of the island.<br/><br/>I became quite confused after the hurricane when Teddy and his partner Chuck (later revealed to be psychiatrist, Dr. Sheehan) are so easily able to walk into Ward C, where the most dangerous patients are housed. After all, if this was where all the really bad things were happening, wouldn't Cawley and his guards make it a point to prevent Teddy from learning Ward C's dark secrets? My best reasoning held that the marshals were able to slip into the off-limits area due to the confusion in the aftermath of the storm. But it didn't look right; the guards supposedly knew who Teddy was and they were simply letting him casually walk into the house of horrors where he does in fact learn that patients are being mistreated (i.e. lobotomized).<br/><br/>Was this simply an example of poor screen writing or was something more sinister afoot? As it turns out, Teddy's beliefs that everyone was out to get him on Shutter Island, was simply a paranoid fantasy. In fact, Teddy's 'investigation' was simply an elaborate role-play set up by Dr. Cawley, designed to break down Teddy's defenses. The ubiquitous Rachel Solando, who supposedly murdered her three children, was one of Dr. Cawley's staff members, pretending that she was a murderer in order to help Teddy realize that it was actually he who had murdered his wife after discovering that she had murdered their three children.<br/><br/>Because all of this calls for a great suspension of disbelief, Shutter Island ranks up there as a solid piece of film entertainment but holds it back from being considered a true 'artistic masterpiece' (as some have argued it is). There are three big problems with the film's narrative.<br/><br/>Firstly, there's a big assumption here that such role-playing could ever lead to such a huge improvement in a paranoid schizophrenic's psyche. Cawley and Sheehan concede that the role-playing can lead to a regression (as it did with Teddy nine months earlier, as they candidly admit). They call it a new ""experimental therapy"" but role-playing has been around for centuries. It looks awful nice how they get Teddy to confront his demons, but I would think that role-playing (as it's shown here) would tend to aggravate the patient, much more than it would lead to any kind of meaningful revelations.<br/><br/>That leads to the second problem: why would the Board of Overseers countenance such a therapy? After all, those are the guys who approve the lobotomies at the slightest hint of violence amongst the mentally ill population. Back in 1954, lobotomies were actually believed to be helpful for patients. Why would such do-gooders, such as Cawley and Sheehan, be given the chance to turn Teddy around? Not only don't I believe such people would be in charge of a Federal lock-up for the criminally insane but even if they were, they would not be allowed to conduct such a role-play experiment.<br/><br/>In reality such an experiment would place both the staff and the prison population in jeopardy. In a ridiculous scene, after Teddy bursts into the lighthouse, Cawley asks him, 'did you hurt the guard very badly?' In real life, he would never have been allowed to put any of the guards in jeopardy. Just imagine if Teddy actually had killed the guard by slugging him over the head with the rifle? And would Dr. Cawley allow his expensive European convertible to go up in smoke just to help the most dangerous patient on Stutter Island—simply out of the goodness of his heart?. I know he's a liberal but no one's that liberal when it comes to their own property that's worth so much money.<br/><br/>So without the role-play taking place, there's no twist ending and no accolades for Dennis Lehane, the author of the novel along with Director Martin Scorsese. Nonetheless, there's much to admire about this picture. Scorsese has a terrific way with camera angles. I love all the subtle closeups such as when the Dachau Commandant reaches for his gun, as he lays wounded in his office along with the old Victrola, with the record playing over and over. Scorsese sometimes overdoes things, especially with those scenes involving the murdered children at the end of the film (just a little too much blood for my tastes). All the performances are quite good here including Kingsley (as noted earlier) along with a very cool Max Von Sydow (who at first glance is supposed to be the bad guy but on second viewing, is quite benign).<br/><br/>Scorsese also smartly added the ambiguous line at the end suggesting that Teddy is cured but pretends to be insane since he can no longer live with the guilt of failing to save his children at the hands of his murderous wife.<br/><br/>This is the type of picture worth watching twice. The first time around you'll be in the dark; the second time you'll watch it for all the clues missed. But after that, there are no profound ideas here to sift through. In other words, an Ingmar Bergman film it ain't! But as a solid entertainment—it hits the mark!"
"secondtake","7","3","7","21 June 2010"," It's so well made, the unsurprising twists end up deflating a visual masterpiece
","Shutter Island (2010)<br/><br/>You know when a friend tells a story and includes lots of interesting details, and tells it really well so you listen to everything, and then they finish and you think, ""And?""<br/><br/>There is a lot of that on Shutter Island. Martin Scorsese is a director who knows very much how to tell a story. And this movie, told so well, might become famous for having no punch line. It's not that the end is bad or illogical, or that getting there was so bad. Just the opposite. The end is heartwrenching and sensible, and the two hours getting there is fabulous stuff, great movie-making, and filled with all kinds of strange and beautiful moments.<br/><br/>So you have to realize this is more about being there than the actual story. It's a finely tuned work of art, really, as a visual experience, and with a fabulous score. Expect another solid, impassioned performance by Leonardo DiCaprio, along with a whole host of superb secondary acts. Even just the island with its cliffs and gloom and sprawling old brick buildings is creepy and fantastic. The characters on it, from the glaring cops with shotguns to the host of crazed and criminally insane people, are colorful to say the least, but not exaggerated. <br/><br/>Once you realize that the cunning Ben Kingsley is in charge or that Max von Sydow is possibly an ex-Nazi at the end of his life, you really pay attention. And then, as if this isn't enough, there begin flashbacks to World War II, and to a brutal murder, and other visions appear, including some really dreamy moments of magical realism. And you wonder how real it all is and whether it actually relates to the basic point of DiCaprio's being there as a federal marshal.<br/><br/>As usual with this kind of movie, the setting is a pastiche of places far apart, though all in the North East, including famous Peddocks Island in Boston Harbor (which is a park, not a prison). The horrible treatment of the German (and other) prison guards shown in the Dachau scenes has some basis in truth, but in fact was probably more sporadic and messier, and did not apparently involve a whole lineup of American shooters. You can look up the Dachau Massacre for details, but of course, the bigger (much bigger) massacre that is Dachau itself belongs to Nazi cruelty, and is represented with reasonable (if cinematic) fairness here, toning down (if anything) the gruesomeness. There is a long history of unethical experiments on mental patients held by the U.S. Government, though nothing I could find that involved this particular surgical option (by the government). Lobotomies (including those made with an ice-pick sort of instrument from the eye socket, into the brain, scrambling it up a bit) were still an option available to doctors in the 1950s, when this movie was made.<br/><br/>Still, I wouldn't take any of this movie as a history lesson. It simply layers up lots of real horrors with the imaginary ones of the fictional plot, which is pretty horrible, too. In all, we have a formal gem, a masterful construction that will dazzle and beguile your eyes and ears. But might leave you, as it has many viewers, wanting a little more for your own unscrambled brain, too."
"honorhorror","9","3","7","26 May 2010"," Don't be freaked out by this movie, yet.
","Spoiler alert first. This review is only intended for those who finished watching Shutter Island.<br/><br/>First off, if you were freaked out by this movie, congratulations! You just became a new guinea pig after a few millions people who just saw it. My suggestion is, think again. Don't just resort to questioning your own sanity like some serious viewers. That's because the masterful Martin Scorsese pulled out a masterful magic trick in narrating, and fooled you into a psycho's shoes. The settings, atmosphere,performances, character studies are all fascinating, yet mind-provoking. The final twist will have no less effects than great psychological thrillers like Fight Club, Psycho, etc. That's also why I gave it a bow and a 9/10 on IMDb.<br/><br/>Though the movie definitely gave us a lot of details suggesting the final revelation moments, we as audiences did saw those intentionally-made hallucinations as if they are real. Also, the whole atmosphere and the fact that the ways doctors treating mental patients are not perfect also helped building up paranoia. The main character, as we get to know him and his mental scars, are also put into these series of procedures which inspire paranoia as well. Like Hitchcock's masterpieces, this movie has a great assumption that insanity is a dwelling element in our society, which we can't weave away. This revelation may help us examining the philosophies behind this movie.<br/><br/>Like Batman Begins, the movie's theme is also very religious, ""to save or to destroy?"" Such is the clashing point of the psychological doctors in the movie. It's just like an argument between an angel and a demon, yet if you watch closely enough, you will also notice that the ""demon"" side in the movie,the doctors holding that brain-paralyzing surgery is the best resort are surely cold-hearted, without much of a goodwill, not to mention any kind of love toward the patient.However, the ""angel"" side of the doctors are also not so good as we have come to assume. Ben Kinsley's character is essentially playing God in controlling and affecting the test subject's mind, yet the conditioning and controlling procedures in this so-called Role-playing game are marred by either lack of goodwill from the other side, or the very procedure which can torment the subject and generate some more paranoia out of him. So this story is basically a sad-sad beginning continued with a sad-sad ending, which has already been decided by the writer's pessimistic logics.<br/><br/>I am definitely not criticizing the movie's authentication on a story level. In fact, the movie very honestly revealed one truth to us, that you only get to choose to be saved or to be destroyed in a limited time, and you won't be given another chance forever. That's because if you always ruin the chance of being redeemed, the whole life becomes a repeated torture, which is not so different from hell. Shutter Island definitely achieved in questioning the human's weak spot and make us scream inside or outside. Yet, the story lacked some very important factors, which I have been wondering since I noticed that none of the main characters revealed to have any religious belief and assumed atheists. Scorsese had been, according to my memory, mocking at or ignoring Christianity since his early movies. In this socially-concerned movie, he again showed this tendency. Simply put, simply believing in people's mind can choose to face the facts and turn to the good helpers, while factoring out God's saving grace, is a silly belief which beats itself. That's the very dilemma and failure Ben Kinsley's character met. Also, Playing God in this dreadfully set ""Role-playing-game"" also beats itself because you can't even be almighty enough to control all the chess pieces, like the movie had shown.<br/><br/>That being said, I very much like to see everyone who's frightened by the movie to relax and have a good dream. That's it."
"tha_mongoose","10","3","7","24 May 2010"," Who said Noirs were dead?
","Scorsese's genial work needs no introduction. Every full-feature film he has made in the last twelve odd years has been brilliant in some way or other. Shutter Island, his latest installment, is an instant classic. Having read a few reviews that chastised the film this reviewer feels the need to give the work the praise it deserves.<br/><br/>Set in the 1950's, an age when, regarding attire, people dressed in much more stylish fashion than we do nowadays, Shutter Island pits the viewer with the usual trench-coats, police uniforms with flappy raincoats, tweed suits, hats, flowery female dresses and the rest that have now gone out of wear. Another aspect that brings the 50's back to life is the automobiles – we also get a shot of such a vehicle in Shutter Island. <br/><br/>But the visual experience we are treated to with this movie does not end with the car and wardrobe, or the beautiful asphalt buildings of the penitentiary. The Island itself is worthy of mention. It possesses an air of insanity that is prescient from the very beginning, when the viewer's ear is invaded with overtly melodramatic insertions as the camera approaches the Island and DiCaprio and Ruffalo are arriving. Soon enough, however, we will begin to comprehend the significance of these details.<br/><br/>Shutter Island is in much reminiscent of Hitchcock's work. While the movie is not set in black-and-white, it is more Noir than many Noirs were in their heyday. Not only does the music fit in with this assertion; as well as the shots of the cliffs and island, and of the surrounding water; but the progression of the story, that goes from mysterious to incomprehensible soon enough, transcending the real and reaching hallucinatory plains, aids in creating a masterpiece of an ethereal, ephemeral thriller.<br/><br/>To be sure, such an ambitious project would not have been feasible had the director not only been intimately involved with Hitchcock's and other master thriller-makers' work but also without the aid of a stellar set of actors. DiCaprio, Ruffalo, Kingsley, the incomparable Sydow, as well as the female cast all stand tall and play their parts to full effect. This could be one of the trickiest parts DiCaprio has approached in his whole career, and he has succeeded. It is a pleasure to appreciate the development he has undertaken since his frail days in 1999's Titanic. <br/><br/>In summary: screaming Hitchcock, Shutter Island is an assault on the senses, an epic psychological journey into the most elusive, extreme confines of the mind. It deserves a place among the best such films being made in recent years. 10/10"
"meeza","9","3","7","10 April 2010"," Shut up! Shutter Island rules!
","Welcome to my Punner Island where all your pun dreams can come true! Of course I am going to punhabit my review of Director Martin Scorsese's brilliant ""Shutter Island"" as I do to all of my reviews. ""Shutter Island"" is not associated with the documentary based on every time that Paris Hilton opens her mouth, that one is called ""Shut-her Island"". OK, I will focus on ""Shutter Island"" before you guys think I belong on ""Shut-him Island"". Leonardo Dicaprio, collaborating with Scorsese for the fourth time, stars as Teddy Daniels; a 1950's U.S. Marshall who travels to Shutter Island to investigate a case of a missing patient. The island is primarily comprised of a hospital for the criminally insane. Sounds crazy ha? OK, sorry. Moving right along Teddy's marshall partner is Chuck, played by the reliable Mark Ruffalo. Teddy was a soldier in World War II and played a big part in rescuing Holocaust victims in a Nazi concentration camp. He is a recent widower whose wife accidental death still haunts him as he keeps having hallucinations of her. In the hospital for the criminally insane, they are met by numerous peculiar characters who do not help Teddy & Chuck much with the investigation; and I am not primarily referring to the patients also. I really cannot indulge more in providing you plot lines of ""Shutter Island"" because that would have me institutionalized in the hospital for the spoilerly insane, they have that? It is not insane to state that Leonardo DiCaprio's masterful performance should garner him another Best Actor Oscar nomination. The supporting performances of the film were also sanely proficient. Besides Ruffalo's fine work, I was psyched with the stellar performances of legendary actors Ben Kingsley and Max Von Sydow as the hospital's primary psychiatrists, Kingsley playing the head mental honcho. The up-and-coming Emily Mortimer and the always stupendous Patricia Clarkson were scene-stealing in their brief performances as a couple of zany Rachel patients. Michelle Williams was not spectacular in her work as Teddy's deceased wife Dolores, but I would not say she was ""dead in the water"" also with her moderately commending performance. Kudos also goes out to veteran character actors John Carroll Lynch and Jackie Earle Haley for their powerful supporting work; Lynch playing a head guard and Haley playing a loony patient held at the hospital's ""critical psyche condition"" ward. The film's cinematography and art direction were vivid enough to also be called as Oscar nominees at next year's show. Laeta Kalogridis' twisting screenplay based on Dennis Lehane's novel made me ""twist & shout"" with literary pleasure. But who is crazy and daring enough to put all of this together- the one and only highbrow eyebrow maestro, Mr. Martin Scorsese. His daring direction of ""Shutter Island"" does not depart from the fact that Scorsese is still at the top of his game. So take that surreal cinematic voyage to the bizarre but worthwhile ""Shutter Island"". ***** Excellent"
"waelbendhia","3","3","7","9 April 2010"," Technically brilliant, but ultimately predictable and heartless.
","One thing I've always loved about Scorsese's earlier films is how full of life they were. With time his technical abilities have gotten better but his movies became more and more lifeless. Well with Shutter Island it seems Scorsese has hit rock bottom. While the movie looks fabulous and the performances are solid nothing about this film is engaging. The plot is contrived and predictable, the characters seem wholly artificial and clichéd. If you're a fan of Scorsese I suggest you avoid this at all costs lest your image of him be tarnished. If you don't really care about movies that much you'll find this to be a thoroughly enjoyable."

Hollywood is at a time where movie are made so people don't have to think for themselves... they just have to buy the ticket and be shoot with fast piece cuts and explosions, robots and etc. .... Most of the critics i have seen for this movie are always complaining about the end being to rushed... being to bad... there is actually almost 80% of the people complaining about the fact that in the end Andrew stayed Crazzy...<br/><br/>Let me try to explain... Andrew Creates an alter ego named Teddy and with it a full conspiracy world. He believes, and we believe at the beginning that he is the only person who knows the truth but that's not what is happening.. There's a great review up here saying this is the kind of movie where a Last sentence explains everything... and i am gonna explain to u all..<br/><br/>When Andrew is sited on the stairs, just in the final scene and Chuck comes giving him a cigarette, Chuck ask ""Now What""? This is the DOCTOR Chuck trying to see how is patient his... if i continues sane or not. Andrew looks at him and says they have to get out and tel the world about the experiments.. Chuck realizes that he and the other doctors have failed and signals to the other doctor telling the public that Andrew is insane again. So, since it has failed and Andrew is a dangerous man they have to lobotomize him. But the we, the public, get another great moment in this movie. Andrew says before he left: ""After being here Chuck... what would you like? To live like a monster? Or to die like a normal man"" ... This simple sentence gives us the big picture.. Andrew is sane... and is aware of all the things he has done ... He knows he can.. and will return to that crazy state, like he has before, and believes the best for him is to die wile sane and maybe see his family again in another place... This is the heart of the story and i am really sorry for those who just didn't get it and because of that just give it a 1 out of 10... <br/><br/>Like i said... its a shame how the Popcorn has win... over the real ART.."

Since the whole story is imaginary and spins around and around in a single mind, having a twist means nothing else but coming back to our point of departure.<br/><br/>So, to some, this movie has a twist.

Pay attention from the beginning to the end to understand it.<br/><br/>***** spoilers ***** For me, it is clear what happened.. but the most interesting is that the director wants you to believe in the doctors' lies.. so every dialog is made for you to believe them.. cause they are in charge of driving conversation. But Teddy's memories contradict what they have been telling him..<br/><br/>What happened in the island, and lots will disagree, is the following: The Marshall came to the island with his assistant George Noyce, he is after a murderess that disappeared, but has the intention as well of finding his wife's murderer. He and his assistant find out what has been happening in the island: it is a big brainwashing laboratory.. but, since they are marshals in service, they are drugged by the doctors and go into a brainwash program to forget all about it. The two marshals are isolated from each other and Teddy is told that one of the island's doctor is his assistant called Chuck. He confidenced his feelings to that doctor as he probably did to his actual marshal assistant earlier, and then they use that information about his life to make Teddy even more confused. Teddy's mind resists bravely to that brainwash, sometimes escaping from their lies more or less effectively.. but his mind still confuses his actual partner with the crazy doc and they can use that to see if Teddy is managing to react to the brainwash. They just can't let the Marshal out of the island with the truth.<br/><br/>One example is that Teddy is told he's a violent man (a man of violence), but it is a lie.. how can a violent man be impressed by violence? And he is clearly impressed by the horror he saw in the world war II. He said to his assistant he don't want to kill his wife's murderer.. because in the war he killed so much. It is not an attitude of a violent man. But they need to make him believe he is violent in order to ""prove"" he killed his wife. <br/><br/>One example of what really had been happening is when they were interrogating a woman who is told to have killed his husband with an axe.. when his assistant went for drinking water, the girl quickly wrote down a word for Teddy: run. Why did she wait his assistant to get away to do that? It is clear she knew what had been happening in the island."

","For those who complain that Scorsese, in the 2000s, spent a decade trying to win a Best Picture Oscar, Shutter Island might be for them. It's essentially a B movie, an insane asylum-based thriller adapted from a novel by Dennis Lehane. You'll probably guess the film's final twist within a matter of minutes, but it doesn't matter too much. It's a heck of a ride. Leonardo DiCaprio stars as a Federal Marshall from Boston visiting an island asylum for the criminally insane after one of their patients mysteriously vanishes. He has an idea that there might be something more sinister going on on the island. Mark Ruffalo plays DiCaprio's partner, Ben Kingsley the head psychiatrist of the institution and Michelle Williams is DiCaprio's deceased wife (in frequent flashbacks, dreams and fantasy sequences). They round out the main cast. The supporting cast includes Max von Sydow, John Carroll Lynch, Elias Koteas, Emily Mortimer, Patricia Clarkson, Ted Levine and Jackie Earle Haley. Everyone in the film turns in an excellent, heated performance (Ruffalo is a tad more laid back than the rest). Some of the movie plays out like a first-rate horror story, especially DiCaprio's entrance into the dreaded Cell Block C, which contains the most violent criminals in the institution. As I stated above, it's pretty easy to guess at what this is all leading to, and, when it gets there, Scorsese spends far too long explicating everything. But the very last moment of the film is quite good. All in all, it's a worthy film in the Scorsese canon."

","Most people go into ""Shutter Island"" expecting that director Martin Scorsese will pull off another ""Taxi Driver"", or ""Raging Bull"". Though this is not the case, Scorsese succeeds in constructing one of the best psychological thrillers in years due to his prodigious directing, brilliant cinematography and excellent performances from each member of the cast.<br/><br/>Shutter Island takes place off the coast of Boston in 1954. The film follows U.S marshal Teddy Danial's(DiCapro) as he investigates the disappearance of mental patient Rachel Solondro, who has escaped from her room in the mental institution located on the island. As a violent storm hits the island, Teddy discovers that there is more to this case then he first believed. As the plot unfolds, and Teddy begins to hallucinate about his dead wife, and images of past experiences of concentration camps while he was a soldier in WW2, he begins to question why he is on the island. Is he there to kill the man who murdered his wife? Is this all a set-up for some sort of dark conspiracy? Or is it something of much greater importance? <br/><br/>Though many aspects of this film are similar to ""The Shining"" (haunting music while we reach the mental institution, quick cuts to dead children, etc) this is NOT a horror film. Like ""Taxi Driver"", each scene (with the exception of the beginning of one), has the protagonist in it as if we are viewing the world through his point of view. Scorsese makes us feel what Teddy feels and due to Scorsese's brilliant direction, we as an audience are unsure what is real and what is fake by the middle of the film.<br/><br/>When you have made more then three masterpieces and have perfected your craft so efficiently , you are able to break some of the rules to make the audience feel a specific way. Scorsese tends to break multiple rule such as noticeable continuity errors, abrupt camera movement when there shouldn't be, and edits that seem to be just one beat off. But Scorsese does this on purpose to make the audience feel both out of place and uncomfortable, and he does it very well.<br/><br/>The juxtaposition of the beautiful sets while Teddy dreams of his wife, and the bleak, film-noir set of the mental institution are also quiet compelling. This just goes to show you the range of the directors capability and how he is able to combine two very different setting to create an intriguing story.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, after the first two acts (which were near flawless), the script seems to fall apart. The twist is not only predictable to many viewers, but has also been done multiple times. There are many things in the first two acts that make it seem like the twist could not be possible and you walk out of the theatre thinking to yourself, ""wait but if that was so, then why did this happen?"" Though unintentional, some of the dialogue throughout the film also seemed quiet comedic as if it came out of one of a scene in the ""Scary Movie"" trilogy. Lines like, ""I'm dead"", come out as comical instead of the tone that the director intended.<br/><br/>Though flawed, Scorsese has created one of the most compelling psychological thrillers in years and has redefined the thriller genre. ""Shutter Island"" is a better film then Scorsese's ""Gangs of New York"", but comes no where close to that of ""Taxi Driver"", or ""Raging Bull"". But when you've created films like those two, it's not understandable that this one is not as brilliant. This film is one that you need to see at least twice but when you see it for the first time, expect a slow paced psychological thriller, because it is NOT a horror film.<br/><br/>8/10 <br/><br/>HINT: Though I will not ruin the ending for you, pay very close attention to the last scene. Though the narrative suggests one thing, something Teddy Daniels says and how he acts during this scene suggests that it is not what it seems."
"p-simondet","6","3","7","20 February 2010"," Scorsese fosters the inanity of Hollywood
","If you've seen the trailer, and are a cinema-goer who enjoys thrillers or mysteries, you already know the plot of the first half of the film. Thus, I won't chronicle the movie's events, as that will neither persuade you to, or dissuade you from, seeing this film. Obviously, the following will be subjective. It is a review, after all.<br/><br/>First of all, I highly respect Scorsese as a film maker and an artist. His characters, infamous for their actions and humanity, have always been directed with a rare finesse. He picks stories with grit and emotion and is a master at such. Of late, however, he has seemingly acknowledged he can't outdo his acclaimed character masterpieces (Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, Goodfellas) and has turned to genre pieces. I had high expectations going into this one, despite it being a February release (confounding). I was hoping, if not for a return to form for Scorsese, at least for something as entertaining as Departed, or as gorgeous and deliberate as the Aviator, or as vindictive as Gangs of New York. It had these qualities, but their respective stage time was uneven, intermittent at best. Onto the film <br/><br/>The atmosphere isn't gripping, but it is done in a lovely fashion. The story isn't captivating, but it is intriguing. The score isn't a subtle undercurrent, but it sure gets loud. The CGI is distracting, and I felt that many shots were uninspired and completely reliant on the location. But, as expected, the acting is commendable. Some of the cinematography is very nice. Also notable are Teddy's backstories, which were well implemented and interesting. Moving on, my gripes. <br/><br/>Critics are saying that the big twist (and it's a biggen) is either completely shocking, or completely nonsensical. In reality, its both. It's both because it comes out of almost thin air, and just makes you feel stupid. Don't be alarmed after the dust settles, though, because I doubt that 10% of the audience will have a notion of what ultimately happens. The ending isn't decisive, and I don't mind ambiguous endings, but this was just silly. There are discrepancies that may make you want to pull your hair out. Without saying much else, as so I don't ruin anything, this was ultimately disappointing. The first half was superb, but the first climactic point is actually a poor plot device in disguise, whereafter the story takes a hard dive into mediocrity. While this film is certainly above average, it's entertainment value is greatly diminished by its latter components. It saddens me that a living master is contributing to inanity in contemporary film-making. <br/><br/>Also, by the time the credits roll, you should have realized you've seen this film a few times before. I will not list any of them here, though, as they would ruin the fun of discovery! Enjoy, and happy viewing."

","SHUTTER ISLAND is the story of two U.S. marshals, Teddy Daniels and Chuck Aule, who are summoned to a remote and barren island off the coast of Massachusetts to investigate the mysterious disappearance of a murderess from the island's fortress-like hospital for the criminally insane.<br/><br/>SHUTTER ISLAND is Martin Scorsese's first jab at doing a horror/thriller-type film since CAPE FEAR. However, there's no doubt that the film will disappoint many who are expecting a straight up horror film as the TV spots and trailers suggest. In fact, it's further from the truth. At its heart, SHUTTER ISLAND is all about atmosphere and the building of uneasiness, which, at times, do fail to work. It's not a perfect film, at least for me. It's far from it. I found the pacing to be slow at times and the mystery didn't quite pull me in as I expected it to be. Director Martin Scorsese also seem to have a hard time trying to build up suspense, especially towards the end.<br/><br/>I also found it to be a frustrating movie experience, but I say that as a compliment. The film does get it at you in the head with the intentional inconsistent editing of scenes and making the viewers very confused with what the film has to offer. In the end, however, Scorsese manages to put all of the puzzle pieces together without cheating the audience. Sure, some might find the ending to be very bad and others might find it very obvious, but there just can't be a movie that everyone ends up liking.<br/><br/>I loved how Scorsese refrained from using clichés from certain scenes that begs to have clichés be used. You know those scenes where the music builds up to a huge pop up scare? Well, there's none of that here. Scorsese lets the scenes play out for themselves, rarely using any building up of music at all. This is how he achieves the tone and atmosphere of the film. It's the working relationship between the cinematographer, production designers, director, actors, etc that molds every scene together which is one reason for this film to stand out on its own.<br/><br/>The film brings along a lovely cast, including Leonardo DiCaprio, who gives it his all in here. He gives a terrific performance even as his mental state breaks down as the film progresses. Ben Kingsley does a great job in here as well along with a few scenes by Michelle Williams in her Boston accent and Emily Mortimer. Patricia Clarkson also shines through with her brief but important role. The film is also visually stunning. It's obvious that attention was put in every detail of a set and every other thing surrounding it.<br/><br/>SHUTTER ISLAND is a film that is handled with precision and care, although sometimes losing it's focus on the big picture. It's not an Oscar-worthy film as some might hope it to be, but I enjoyed the psychological game Scorsese plays with in the audience's minds and the film's overall haunting story and tone. See this film if you like to enjoy a psychological thriller with a good story that supports a great cast and a fantastic director."
"christian-mcleer","9","3","7","19 February 2010"," Scorsese has once again brought a great film to the playing field!
","First off, if you are a fan of Scorsese' previous films (Taxi Driver, Goodfellas, The Departed), you need to know that Shutter Island is a whole new style for this director.<br/><br/>Shutter Island is a psychological thriller, starring Leonardo De Caprio as Teddy Daniels, that attacks our fears on an entire new level. The overall dark tone and bleak state of mind we are in builds and builds, never letting go through out the movies entirety. The film is thrilling, captivating, and most importantly, extremely entertaining. I was not once asking myself when the film was going to be over and found myself so engaged in the story that, at times, was unaware I was even watching a film, but that I was living it.<br/><br/>Some have complained that they are dissatisfied with the ending and saw it coming from miles away. Yes, you may think you know where it is going, that you anticipated the right turn when in arrived, but no one will be expecting the sudden left turn it makes in the films conclusion.<br/><br/>While Shutter Island was made by a true master of the film trade, one thing you will find unpleasantly delightful, is the director's ability to genuinely creep you out in several terrifying scenes. The film doesn't rely on loud bags in the silence (although a few do occur, and will make you jump) but more on dark imagery and even darker dialogue that never lets up and brings the tension to a painfully disturbing level. This one will not escape your thoughts so easily.<br/><br/>The only major flaw I found in the film was within the ending. Not to say it wasn't terrifying or original, but the mystery revealed, in my opinion, is one that has become quite overplayed and generic in recent years. That being said, Scorsese adds his usual twist and craft to it, dressing it up in an entirely new way.<br/><br/>I found Shutter Island to be a fantastic film and encourage everyone to go see it. Ol' Marty hasn't lost his touch as a truly talented film maker and seeing this film puts you in store for a great ride."
"griffolyon12","8","3","7","19 February 2010"," Far From Scorsese's Best, But Definitely Not His Worst
","Director Martin Scorsese weaves a tale that I can't quite place words upon. Shutter Island is part drama, part thriller, part horror. It is a touch film noir, while also being a pinch trippy. Regardless as to what it truly is, the mystery of Shutter Island is one worth seeing, but perhaps not the director's best in his long pantheon of work.<br/><br/>On an island off the coast of Boston, engulfed in the fog and on the rim of a hurricane, there lies a mental hospital called Aschliffe. The hospital only takes the most dangerous, most mentally unstable patients. A patient has recently escaped, and no one can explain her mysterious disappearance. Two U.S. Marshalls come to the island, our hero Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his partner. But is there more going on upon the mysterious Shutter Island than meets the eye? That is what Teddy is trying to find out, while also searching for his wife's killer, who is an inmate in the institution.<br/><br/>This film is what one would call a mindbender, and for that Scorsese should be duly applauded. While I figured out the big twist at the end about halfway through the film, I was severely impressed at how well Scorsese painted a portrait of insanity in this film. To call this film crazy would actually be a compliment and not a detriment to its storytelling abilities. It is an insane film, making you feel as if you ventured inside a crazy man's head for 2 hours. Dream sequences, hallucinations of the ghosts of his past, Teddy is our guide through this look at sanity and its breaking point, and it is there that the film is the most stunning.<br/><br/>The dream sequences highlight Teddy's past, his traumatic history. The death of his wife, his time serving in World War II where he came across a graveyard of dead bodies in a Nazi concentration camp. A man with such a tragic past, it is very easy to see how he eventually snapped. Though, it is with these dream sequences that Scorsese evokes his adoration for film noir. Teddy is the quintessential film noir protagonist. He's a troubled man, haunted by his past, and he is madly in love with the elusive woman he can't have. DiCaprio is stunning as Teddy, delivering a timeless performance that at times is reminiscent of Bogart or Cagney, but he always remains true DiCaprio and makes the emotional scenes between Teddy and his deceased wife all the more believable and heartbreaking.<br/><br/>Martin Scorsese instituted his trademark visual flare here with the marvelous dream sequences and well done flashbacks, but as a whole the film lacked that special something to make this one of Scorsese's best. The film starts off riveting, dripping with suspense, and oozing with mystery. The latter half of the film is not as strong as the first, and it is debatable as to whether or not the ending was the right one for the film, because it kind of feels as if the story kind of just comes untied and feels incomplete rather than satisfying. Regardless, the film is a visual feast and is a cinephile's dream, and don't get me wrong, the film is entertaining and mindbending, but it does not manage to live up to the suspense, nor the mystery set up at the beginning of the film.<br/><br/>I give Shutter Island an 8 out of 10!"

Take my honest word that if you enjoyed any Scorsese movie in the past or have enjoyed movies that include surrealism, Shutter Island combines the two into an intense thriller that boggles the mind and possibly even ""corrode it, rusts it"". Also, if you are hesitant to watch this film because the trailer perceives it as a horror film with a lot of ""jumpy"" scenes, ignore that. I had the same feeling entering it, and there was only one towards the very end, but it was worth the shock.

I couldn't stand the annoyingly loud background score and the artyfarty dream sequences. And right from the beginning I couldn't take to Mark Ruffalo's character, there was just something weird about him and his accent that I couldn't put my finger on.<br/><br/>But as the movie goes on it builds up to an amazing and shocking climax. I didn't see it coming although I had a feeling something wasn't quite right! Looking back, this one is one hell of a cleverly constructed script and I'm guessing we have the original novel to thank for that. What started out as an annoying movie actually turned out to be really good and I want to watch it all over again to (without spoiling anything) see what references I missed.<br/><br/>I still think it was a bit too artyfarty at times and that background music was too loud and annoying and there was something about the cinematography that I didn't quite like, but overall I think it actually worked.<br/><br/>9/10"

","This might have Spoilers.<br/><br/>OK, I like this film. It has good dialogue all the way through, a nice pace and lots of strange things occur. The mystery keeps building and building like a puzzle and I like that. Over all I really like the conspiracy idea that Leonardo's character comes up with. This I find fascinating as it does tie in with covert operations that the Americans were doing in mental hospitals after WW2 and the mind control experiments of the Nazis and the Korean military in real history and I'm a sucker for things like that. Love it. For this reason the plot at the beginning is highly plausible and compelling, such as using humans as guinepigs as a part of secret government experiments into trying to control their brains with mind altering chemicals etc. The sad thing is that the ending was clichéd and disappointing and left me cheated and feeling unfulfilled. I cannot believe that the whole film amounts to the 'it was all a dream' 'or it was all in his head' a bit like the characters in The Wizard of Oz or Secret Window or a Beautiful mind. It made the film seem like one big goose chase in the end. There was so much brilliant effort made into making the viewer believe that something really serious was going on but- there wasn't!! Compelling and mysterious film but bad, bad ending."
"elazotes","10","2","4","11 December 2015"," Excelente película
","Martin Scorsese's new movie is a tale of sound and fury, signifying  well, not nothing exactly, but a heck of a lot less than it promises, given the straining intensity of those performances, the glowering darkness of mood, the grand gesture at 20th-century history's grimmest nightmares, and the sheer length. This was supposed to be Scorsese's experiment in B-movie thrills, but no mere B-movie director would go on for two hours and 20 minutes. That's an auteur running time we're talking about, and at the end of it, I got a whiff of shaggy dog.<br/><br/>The silly twist ending is supremely exasperating, and creating the narrative foundation for this final revelatory whiplash has meant laying down some long scenes that at the time look baffling and unconvincing. However, I admit everything looks good and fits together, and the film packs a fair-sized punch. Shutter Island is based on the 2003 thriller from Dennis Lehane, the author of Mystic River (filmed by Clint Eastwood) and Gone Baby Gone (filmed by Ben Affleck). The setting is the 1950s, an era when America's fighting men from the second world war would often have found uniformed jobs such as police officers in civilian life. One such is US Marshal Teddy Daniels, played by Leonardo DiCaprio in the scowling mode that he presented to the camera in Scorsese's The Departed, a man in almost constant spiritual pain."
"sianr10","9","2","4","5 December 2015"," Great film!
","After only seeing this film once it instantly became my favourite film because it has such a great mystery revealed. Leonardo Dicaprio and Mark Ruffalo are a good combo as well (but that may be a bias opinion as I love all of their films) Would definitely recommend this film to anyone who loves a good thriller! I wouldn't want to say something that would give anything away so all I will say is that it was very unexpecting, for me at least. I can't find a fault with this film, it was thought provoking and kept me intrigued through out which can sometimes be difficult for longish films. All I want to do now is to watch the film again to see the puzzle piecing together after knowing the final image which I imagine will still be as intriguing."
"luke-a-mcgowan","8","2","4","28 November 2015"," Not outstanding, but solidly good from all involved.
","If David Fincher directed One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, it would probably come out something like Shutter Island. Dark, deep, twisted, menacing and extremely cold - Shutter Island is by far the least Scorsese movie I've ever seen. It misses the moments of levity that made Taxi Driver, Casino and Goodfellas so captivating in their dark themes, but the dark stuff is done so well that its hard to complain about anything in that sense. It doesn't feel at all like a Scorsese picture, but it certainly feels like a well-directed one. The film is probably Scorsese's most visually arresting film since Taxi Driver, and the atmosphere is terrifying thanks to fantastic lighting and sound design from the crew. Some of the film's most incredible sequences are during flashbacks to Dicaprio's war memories, including a long take of his man massacring Nazi guards. There's some horrifying scenes in which slow falls very slowly through a scene in which a big eyed Emily Mortimer stares at the screen.<br/><br/>I find it almost impossible to review Shutter Island without spoiling the twist(s) so I'm doing so. I knew Shutter Island's final twist, but what I really enjoyed was the massive misdirect they threw at us regarding Patricia Clarkson's Rachel and the decision we have to make between whether this is a conspiracy movie like Changeling or a psychological thriller like Memento. Shutter Island falls far closer to The Usual Suspects in execution than something like Se7en - its fun to watch clues for the big reveal even when you know what is coming. The script is tight, with some well written dialogue and incredible themes that radiate all through the film - the recurring comments that ""once you are declared insane, no one cares what you have to say"" being a prime example. The film's final line, spoken by DiCaprio to Ruffalo, will knock your socks off if you interpret it the way I did.<br/><br/>Thelma Schoonmaker deserves most of the film's kudos for editing the film together so flawlessly to fit the suspense. She makes key decisions not to cut to Kingsley's or Ruffalo's face when Dicaprio learns something extremely important for his ""case"". Clues are dropped subtly within the film for us to pick up on, and the film rarely drags except on a few scenes that could have been cut altogether (most of John Carroll Lynch's scenes past the first half). <br/><br/>Shutter Island gathers probably the year's finest cast, with everyone doing fine work from Ben Kingsley all the way down to Robin Bartlett in a one scene character. DiCaprio makes for a solid protagonist and does typically fine work but there are a number of moments in which it feels like he is acting, not a real person. The acting is still good, and its hugely benefited from Scorsese's cast and crew - other actors start speaking to him different, a set of circumstances force DiCaprio to wear white clothing. Above all else, his desire not to sound crazy makes him come across as crazy. Ben Kingsley and Max von Sydow are both superb as men who might be conspiratorially evil in one scene and then nothing more than a kind doctor in another. Ruffalo is in his pre-The Kids Are All Right/Foxcatcher excellence phase, but does solid work throughout. The film's actresses - Patricia Clarkson, Emily Mortimer and Michelle Williams - all land slam dunks in their roles. Jackie Earle Haley aces the small part of George Noyce.<br/><br/>Shutter Island is far from perfect, however. Jennifer Dunnington's score is at times overbearing and far from subtle. DiCaprio sometimes overdoes it. Killing his wife because she murdered their children was a big let down after being called ""an unspeakable crime"". The twist requires us to suspend a bit of disbelief - does Kingsley's experiment make him in control of the weather? Did DiCaprio seriously believe that Ruffalo killed himself after being told to stay put? All of DiCaprio's war stories end up having very little effect on the story, which padded the pretty substantial run time.<br/><br/>Shutter Island is a fine film. Its not remarkable work that will stand out of DiCaprio's or Scorsese's resume, but its a taut, exciting thriller that is worth the time to watch."

","Well, pretty much good, better, best and worst has been said about this movie in 950+ reviews and it's kind of rare that reviews are somehow divided because as it happened after watching this movie my friend and I was totally engrossed and left the theater not knowing what really hit us. Because we were not prepared for anything like this from Scorsese or Dicaprio, we know they both are capable but not on this scale. At the same time two other friends outrightly rejected this movie as anything but great. So, that's how the audience would be divided you either liked it or you hate it. Also, those who don't like it much doesn't mean they don't get this movie or they don't know how to decide the movie, I believe they don't want something this hard to take it easy. They must enjoy comedy and light tragedy, but not something of this scale. Because I know my friends they can't digest dark movies with lots of emotions, emotions that involve tragedy, not some dog got killed and like that. And, by GOD from first shot to last shot this movie getting bleaker and bleaker until the last line which not only sums up the entire movie, but, it was so sad and bleak that I couldn't able to get off the seat even after it finished for few Min's.<br/><br/>Making a tragic and dark movies is one thing, but making people feel the atmosphere, hopelessness, emptiness, the coldness, the suffocation feeling is not everyone's cup of tea, but Scorsese nailed it and you can almost start feeling yourself in that asylum and confined in that wall, you could almost feel the wet and cold walls of that Island and couldn't help yourself but look for an air to breathe.<br/><br/>Mind that I didn't say a word about the story or what that movie is all about. It's about the human mind and complexity of human relation.<br/><br/>Also, most important if you watch this movie as simply like Paranormal activity kind of horror, then you will wouldn't get the point or movie at all. At the same time if you don't give attention to the overall atmosphere, the time period, especially the dialog then you would definitely miss the movie and that's happening with my friend they totally missed the point because they watched it unprepared like any other horror movie genre. But, this movie is not a horror movie in a sense, but, it's scary to the core, not jump scary, but you would question the life of human and what human is capable of.<br/><br/>Each and every dialogue are weighted and worth every second, but few of the dialog just stayed with me.<br/><br/>When Warden told Teddy: If I was to sink my teeth into your eye right now, would you be able to stop me before I blinded you? Teddy said give it a try with a look. My goodness, that shows the true human nature.<br/><br/>But the best one as per me is the one before credit rolls.<br/><br/>When Teddy finally realized who he was and why he was here and his real identity, he looked at Chuck and said: Which would be worse - to live as a monster, or to die as a good man?"

"Vartiainen","Null","2","4","18 July 2012"," Intense, pure Scorsese
","Martin Scorsese has always had the ability to pull his viewers in. His movies usually take place in a tormentingly bleak and familiar modern world, mixed in with small hints of grandeur, exotic and downright unfamiliar. Like so in this case as well. Shutter Island has a familiar feel to it. The idea of a mental asylum has been deeply ingrained into our collective cultural psyche and Scorsese uses that, presenting us an island that's both a cliché and something terrifyingly new. The colours are just a bit off, the characters sometimes step away from the roles that we have given them in our heads, the plot doesn't dance to the pipe that we all expect to hear. It's a harrowing experience at times, which is exactly the reason that makes the movie so interesting. The movie constantly throws us questions that we start to answer from our experience with these kinds of movies, but then we realize that the answer doesn't fit and we are left feeling lost and intrigued.<br/><br/>Not to say that all of the twists are completely unexpected or even that original. It's a thriller after all and some genre conventions are still being respected, lovingly I might add. Scorsese has the ability to raise the ante, make us question our decisions and expectations, and at the same time make us guess and ponder about the case. Which makes for a great thriller. Add in some really nice acting, very nice editing and cinematography and a score that's just right for the mood, and you have in your hands an excellent film. Though I personally didn't care for the constant flashbacks as I thought that they broke the mood, but afterwards I could see their purpose, so my singular big complaint was reduced to a nitpick.<br/><br/>All in all not Scorsese's best film, but a great piece of film-making, nonetheless. It's everything that a thriller should be and keeps surprising its viewers all the way to the end."

This is a movie like that.<br/><br/>As a negative view, I would like to express that more action scenes and more excitement would make this movie more amazing and more unforgettable, however this movie deserves 7 points out of 10 due to its intelligent fiction, thrilling atmosphere, and making viewers think and wonder."

","U.S. Marshal Edward Daniels and his partner Chuck Aule travel to the (fictitious) Shutter Island in Boston Harbour, which houses a hospital for the criminally insane. They are investigating the disappearance of one of the patients, Rachel Solando, who has been confined in the hospital after drowning her children.<br/><br/>As the film progresses, however, we begin to suspect that Daniels may have other motives for visiting the island, motives connected to his troubled past. In a series of flashbacks we learn that Daniels' wife Dolores died in a fire two years earlier. We also learn that Andrew Laeddis, the arsonist responsible for starting the fire which killed her, is also incarcerated on Shutter Island. Is his real motive for seeking this assignment, therefore, to seek revenge against Laeddis? Or is it, as he claims, to investigate claims that the US government is using the hospital to conduct illegal psychiatric warfare experiments? The death of his wife is not the only dark secret in Daniels' past. We also learn about his experiences in World War II, where he was one of the American troops who liberated the Dachau concentration camp. He is also tormented by guilt about his part in the ""Dachau massacre"", when American soldiers killed a number of the German guards.<br/><br/>One reviewer wrote that ""aafter four decades, Martin Scorsese has earned the right to deliver a simple treatment of a simple theme with flair."" I agree with him about the flair, but cannot agree with him about the film's simplicity, either in its theme or in its treatment. This is a very complex film indeed, and not only in terms of its plot, which I won't set out in any greater detail, as I don't want to give away the ending. The film deals with several interrelated themes, namely the relationship between reality and illusion, that between sanity and madness, and that between crime and law enforcement. Can Daniels trust anyone, including his partner Chuck or Dr Cawley, the head of the institution? Can he even trust his own memories, or is he suffering from hallucinations? Is he really who he claims to be? Is he really who he believes himself to be? At one point, one character points out the similarity between the word ""trauma"" and ""Traum"", the German for ""dream"". Etymologically there is no connection between the words- ""trauma"" is derived from the Greek for ""wound""- yet one feels that there should be, as a mental trauma and a dream are two different types of illusion.<br/><br/>The influences on the film are also complex, and go much deeper than the standard modern thriller. An obvious influence is the film noir of the forties and fifties, the period during which the film is set. Another influence is the work of Alfred Hitchcock, who throughout his career, and especially in films like ""Spellbound"" and ""Psycho"", was fascinated by psychology and psychiatry. A third influence is the horror film; the plot can be seen as the modern equivalent of an Edgar Allan Poe story. (As in some of Poe's works, word-games and anagrams play an important role). Visually, too, the film, with its autumnal feel, mist-shrouded woods and graveyards, owes something to the horror tradition, although a distinctive visual style is also a hallmark of many neo-noir films. Some visual elements- a cave, a lighthouse- take on a symbolic importance of their own.<br/><br/>I never really liked Leonardo DiCaprio in his teen idol phase in the nineties, but after ""Catch Me if You Can"", ""The Aviator"" (also directed by Scorsese) and ""Revolutionary Road"", ""Shutter Island"" confirms that he has become a fine actor and one of Hollywood's leading talents, especially as the mentally tormented Daniels, unsure of his own identity, must have been a particularly demanding role to play, as demanding as Howard Hughes in ""The Aviator"" and perhaps more so than the roles he took in the other two films mentioned. He receives good support here from Michelle Williams as Dolores (seen in flashbacks) and Ben Kingsley as the smooth and outwardly humane Cawley, who may be hiding guilty secrets of his own.<br/><br/>As I stated, I won't give away the ending of the film, but I can say that it involves a startling twist when Daniels is confronted with new information which completely overturns everything we have previously been led to believe. This revelation seems to make perfect sense of all that has gone before, and it significantly takes place in the lighthouse, a structure whose very purpose is to lighten the darkness, so it can be seen in symbolic terms as an enlightenment for both Daniels and the audience. Or can it? Even when it seems that the truth has been made clear, there are troubling hints that this might not in fact be the case. What if Daniels has in fact been the victim of a massive and cruel deception? (To judge by the message boards on here, there are people who have interpreted the film in two quite different ways). This ambiguity, which in some films would have been a weakness, is here a strength, a good example of a film which actually becomes deeper and more profound because its meaning cannot be pinned down precisely.<br/><br/>I was surprised that the film was not nominated for any Oscars, although part of the reason may have been the fact that its opening date was shifted, for financial reasons, from late 2009 to early 2010, thus making it ineligible for the 2010 awards. Despite this neglect by the Academy, however, ""Shutter Island"" confirms my view that Martin Scorsese is one of the finest directors working today. 9/10"
"Chard121","7","2","4","23 November 2011"," Ridiculous Premise, Excellent Execution
","*********IMMEDIATE SPOILERS********* The idea behind this movie, that they'd let a highly trained and potentially violently insane man loose on an island and purposely lead him to believe that his insanity is true in order to some how cure him, is ridiculous. They're putting their lives in danger, the orderly's lives in danger, and the other patients in danger. On top of that, behaving in ways that encourage the patient's idea that he's uncovering some kind of conspiracy does only that, encourage his insane way of thinking, not correct it.<br/><br/>Regardless, the film is a fun and entertaining ride. Visually it's quite stimulating, the acting is excellent, and the story provides a nice combination of action, thought, and mystery. If you're willing to suspend your disbelief, the film does a great job of causing you to buy in to it and thus make you live vicariously through the film as the madman trying to figure out what reality is."
"Leofwine_draca","6","2","4","4 August 2011"," Fun to sit through, but little longevity
","After two decades of making the gangster films that his name's synonymous with, Martin Scorsese goes for something else entirely: a period-set mystery/horror/thriller that takes place in a remote, island-bound lunatic asylum during the 1950s. Scorsese openly admitted that his film's highly influenced by the Val Lewton-produced horror films of the 1940s, where lighting, camera setup and atmosphere play key roles and the emphasis is on toying with the viewer's imagination, conjuring demons in the shadows instead of trolleying in the latest variant on Frankenstein's monster.<br/><br/>And for the most part, SHUTTER ISLAND is a decent piece of filmmaking. The movie's distinctive look is a highlight, with the old horror movie clichés (dark and stormy nights, forbidding buildings) brought vividly back to life. Scorsese even employs some dodgy back projection during the car journeys in homage to the films of yesteryear. Leonardo DiCaprio is another strength, bringing to life the character of his tortured investigator Teddy Daniels and experiencing some highly disturbing nightmares along the way.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is packed with familiar archetypes played by familiar actors: the reliable partner (Mark Ruffalo), the urbane but slightly sinister asylum head (Ben Kingsley), along with many others including a trio of villainish types (Ted Levine, Jackie Earle Haley and Elias Koteas). As the film went on, things began to jump out at me: clues, sometimes over-obvious I thought, pointing towards a twist ending. The suspense builds and the story deepens and I become more and more convinced of the way the film was heading. In the end, I turned out to be right; I'd sussed it early on.<br/><br/>As the credits rolled, I realised that I hadn't been entirely impressed with the production overall: it's well-made, certainly, but it covers exactly the same kind of ground that I've watched in countless B-movies from the 1930s onwards. I couldn't help but sense a slight pretentiousness to the script, a 'look aren't we clever' feel to the plotting. When compared to a similar psychological movie like THE MACHINIST, SHUTTER ISLAND comes up short. It's fun to watch once, but slightly vacuous, and once you find out the nature of the joke you're not going to want to go over it all again."

","I rented this out of the library to watch with my mum, and it looked like it had great potential, so we decided to give it a go. I really liked the first hour, then it started to get confusing. As I am only thirteen I understand that I will not get the whole plot but the ending just was, well, bad! I thought that Teddy's character was portrayed well by Di Caprio but it lacked something, and I am still trying to work out what it was. The plot really messed with your mind and everything you thought was true, wasn't. I think it had a good story-line and some great actors. Overall Shutter Island is a good film with some entertaining scenes and some great actors. I would give it 7.5/10 and say it is suitable for anyone 13+."
"alex-babansky","4","2","4","22 April 2011"," A masterpiece that will be missed
","This review explains some elements of the plot and also suggests possible improvements that could have saved the story from stopping halfway from the ballpark.<br/><br/>One thing is certain: the producers should NOT have entrusted this film to Martin Scorcese. This story could have been given a much better treatment in the crafty hands of Polanski, or Fincher, or, better still, Cronenberg. A film director who's only leading actor's name is Leonardo should be given a desk job instead.<br/><br/>About 70% of all the promise and potential in this story was, sadly, wasted. To begin with, the screenplay itself was raw and unpolished. Let's face it: there are way too many things in it that are somewhat announced but never really delivered. I'll explain what I mean, but beware of the SPOILERS GALORE!<br/><br/>Okay, a former FBI marshall becomes mentally unstable and is undergoing a treatment in a severely guarded clinical facility. A year into it the doctors decide to give him the last chance (before subjecting to lobotomy) and play out what's called in psychiatry 'psychodrama': you put a patient in hypnosis, program him to believe in a certain set of circumstances, and then deliberately lead him to the 'crisis' - final realization of his folly and the error of his ways.<br/><br/>The young protagonist Edward and his sidekick arrive to a severely guarded island to investigate the disappearance of one of the inmates. We are soon given glimpses into Teddy's past traumas and start to suspect that something's not right with him. At the same time the story suggests that something's not right with the facility as well: the rumors of violent experiments conducted on the inmates, the strange attitude of both doctors and police wardens etc. Somewhere 5 minutes into the film I got the feeling that the hero looks like he belongs there, because he is clearly delusional, just like the rest of the crowd there.<br/><br/>This is where the dream sequences come in, and they, I should say, are the most skillfully crafted element in the whole film. The movie speaks in Jungian symbolism here, inviting us to play a game of deciphering the meaning of the messages from the depth. We can clearly perceive the juxtaposition of the two elements: fire and water. The hero dreams of fire destroying his past love, only to be awakened by ever increasing showers of water bringing him back to brutal reality.<br/><br/>Although you are constantly haunted by the feeling that all of this somehow doesn't seem real altogether, if you learn to understand the language of the symbolic elements (mainly water and fire), the story becomes largely transparent. Edward suffers from a severe psychic trauma after his wife, being prone to bouts of schizophrenia, murdered their three children by drowning them in the pond. Upon discovery of this morbid predicament Teddy impulsively shoots his wife dead. The whole thing is too painful for him to live with, so he represses the whole episode deep into subconscious (classic Freud here) and creates a fictional memory instead, where his wife fell victim to arson and perished in a fire along with their apartment. ""She died."" - he explains to his sidekick. - ""Not from fire - from smoke. That is important.""<br/><br/>When interrogating the inmates Teddy is constantly asking them about a certain Laeddis. It turns out the guy was responsible for the arson. ""He lit the match that destroyed her."" We find that this person was Edward's own invention to relay the guilt of his wife's death. Since Edward blames 'Laeddis' - his alter ego - for the whole disaster, he obviously had thought he had somehow provoked\triggered his wife's insanity (although we are never really told how; we can only speculate that it was his excessive drinking which led to distancing away from her and thus pushing her mind to the edge.) In his search for 'Laeddis' he's actually looking for himself.<br/><br/>Edward finds the missing patient (Rachel) in a cave by the fire. During their entire conversation we see flames, which is clearly to tell us that Edward is again hallucinating and Rachel is in fact a figment of his imagination.<br/><br/>The film never fully uses its premise to the possible end: all the psychodrama so thoroughly played out by doctors and staff ends abruptly in the lighthouse scene (another Jungian symbol) where doctor simply TELLS Edward the truth (which is not something he should do, literature- wise and psychiatry-wise). The whole scene felt so out of place, as if the film crew were running out of time so instead of developing the story further they simply decided to quickly TELL the viewer the rest of it.<br/><br/>This is a shame really, because the story COULD have gone in a number of promising directions (for which all the premise was set): 1) play out the Warden character as a proper antagonist (immoral brute who is effectively questioning Edward's moral stance) 2) play out the love romance with either one of the female inmates, or even with fictional Rachel, which would help to reveal Edward's character flaw (that had helped instigate his wife's insanity) and possibly overcome it. Yes, there WAS a way to redeem Edward should have been MORE flashback scenes, and simply put MORE ROMANCE in the film in order to save the story."
"Sandcooler","7","2","4","7 December 2010"," Less impressive than expected
","This suspense thriller relies mostly on a number of clever plot twists, which to me is also its Achilles heel. Throughout the entire movie, I had the annoying feeling that it was always rather obvious what was going to happen. The script isn't quite as mysterious or complex as the makers assumed it was, it's not particularly difficult to figure things out. All other aspects of the movie are nothing short of brilliant though. DiCaprio and Ben Kingsley are both perfect for their roles, the scenes they share are the highlights of the movie. The style of the film is also very well-crafted, the images are beautifully gripping. Still, none of that quite holds up when the key twist is rather predictable."
"horrorreviews123","8","2","4","14 July 2010"," An Effective Psychological Horror Film. Worth a Watch.
","Shutter Island is an example of a horror film that doesn't require any distracting action sequences, pointless side-storys, token characters, or useless nudity to draw its audiences in.<br/><br/>Shutter Island is Scorsese's psychological horror film. Obviously the star is Leonardo DiCaprio, but the supporting cast stood out as well. There wasn't really a misplaced actor in the entire film. Every character stood out as necessary, as did every particular scene with those characters. The movie moves at a solid pace and doesn't let up from the start.<br/><br/>The movies atmosphere starts as the opening scene begins, and doesn't let up until the credits. Shutter Island is a movie that starts out good and doesn't let go. An intriguing storyline and genius film making make Shutter Island a highly recommended film for fans of the genre. It isn't your typical popcorn horror film, as it starts out slow and builds itself without any flashy special effects. This doesn't stop the effectiveness of the movie, as scenes are disturbing and the twists work well"
"hall895","5","2","4","13 July 2010"," Sometimes a big twist isn't enough
","We have seen before that a big twist at the end can make an otherwise ordinary film into something much greater. Think The Sixth Sense. But we have also seen that relying on a final big twist to save your movie can be a dicey proposition. Because if your big twist doesn't have as powerful an impact as you would hope your movie falls flat. Think M. Night Shyamalan films other than The Sixth Sense. Sadly Shutter Island falls into that trap. The ending doesn't satisfy and certainly doesn't redeem all that came before it. Because so much of what came before is rather mundane. But you hold out hope because you know the story is building towards some kind of big revelation. It has to, this is a movie which screams ""Twist!"" from its very beginning. This was never a story which was going to play out in a straightforward, conventional manner. So for whatever disappointment you may feel as the movie progresses the hope is still there that there will be a big ending to save the day. But alas that is not to be the case. The movie fizzles out. The ending, really the whole movie, turns out to be a dud.<br/><br/>Now of course Martin Scorsese is not a man prone to churning out duds. So how did this all go so wrong? Maybe it's a case of a story trying to be too smart for its own good. It's a puzzle in which not all of the pieces end up fitting together properly. We start with an interesting setup. Two U.S. Marshals are sent to investigate the mysterious disappearance of a patient from a hospital for the criminally insane. The fact that this hospital is located on an island essentially cut off from the world ratchets up the intrigue and suspense. But right from the start you get the sense this movie's messing with your head. Something's not right. Somebody's hiding something. Somehow everything seems just a bit off. Is it the location? The characters? Whatever it is there's a great sense of mystery, the possibility of great discovery. But the movie never pays off that initial promise. Eventually you get the sense you are destined to be let down. And in the end you are.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio does the best he can with the lead role of Marshal Teddy Daniels. Whatever failings the film has can't be laid at DiCaprio's feet. He is utterly convincing. But the story is not. There are plenty of fine performers to support DiCaprio. Mark Ruffalo, Ben Kingsley, Max von Sydow and Michelle Williams all play their parts well and there is room for some fine work from other actors in smaller roles. But ultimately the fine cast is let down by the story. The story is the big problem. There are other problems too. The overbearing musical score comes to mind. But it is undoubtedly the story which dooms the movie. When the final piece falls into place you look back and realize the story's not nearly as smart as it needed to be. The end result is an utterly ordinary movie. It's one of those movies which demands a second viewing to really see how all the pieces come together. But it's not an interesting enough movie to make you care enough to go back and watch it again. Once is enough. A second viewing isn't likely to enhance your appreciation any. You can look back, put it all together in your mind, and realize it just doesn't work. Scorsese has made such a brilliant career for himself with tough, gritty, urban dramas. With Shutter Island he wanders a bit outside of his comfort zone. He's done so before to sometimes good effect. But this time he couldn't make it work."
"brandon_lee420","8","2","4","13 July 2010"," Stays true to the book.
","While the film was in theatres, I took my chance to read the book that made this film come alive. The book was fantastic and puzzles and twists were very surprising. When the film reached my local video store, I took my chance to grab it off the shelf and view it. The film does a good job of having the same atmosphere and dialog as the book while also staying true to it, as well. The cast did an excellent job of portraying the characters in the book and their performances were over the top. If I hadn't read the book, I would've given this film a perfect ten but that could, sadly, not happen since I already knew what was going to happen and it made the film a bit more boring. The dialog in Shutter Island is mostly what you read in the book but the people who say those lines do a really good job. Two particular lines that were used in both the film and books were, ""Thorns as big as my d*ck."" and ""Pull yourself together, Teddy."" and I remember them a bit more than the others because one was funny and the other one was cool. So cool in fact is that I wake up every morning and splash water onto my face and stare at the mirror and exactly say that line. The acting was top notch in this motion picture with Leonardo DiCaprio, Ben Kingsley, Mark Ruffalo, and Jackie Earle Haley taking the top four spots. Leonardo DiCaprio, in my opinion, did a superb job of portraying Teddy Daniels and my vision of Teddy was what Leonardo gave us. He plays a U.S. marshal who is investigating the disappearance of one of the patients from the Ashcliff Hospital for the criminally insane. Along the way he discovers puzzles and finds out that everybody is keeping a secret from him. He really gave a convincing act. Ben Kingsley does a well done job of Dr. John Cawley, who is the somewhat mysterious, and his accent is really cool. Mark Ruffalo plays the partner of Teddy, Chuck Aule, as they are sent to the hospital where a mystery plagues the entire hospital. Ruffalo impressed me a lot in this film and he does a good job of knowing nothing when he really does. The best and by the far most impressive actor has to be Jackie Earle Haley for his wonderful role as George Noyce, a mental nutcase who speaks in riddles. Haley knows how to act in a good, realistic way and that is what separated him from everyone else and made him the king of Shutter Island. A lot of people are saying that this isn't one of the Scorsese's best works but I have to disagree and say that this his second best film after, of course, ""The Departed"". I suggest that you stop listening to these remarks and just be immersed into this complex yet fascinating mystery/thriller/horror. The wardrobe for this film matches the year it was set in and it does give the film a 1954 feeling. The makeup is quite good as well from the hairstyles to the facial makeup.<br/><br/>In 1954, Federal Marshal Teddy Daniels and his new partner, Chuck Aule, from Seattle travel to Shutter Island to investigate the disappearance of a patient there, Rachel Solando. She had been sectioned at the institution for dangerous criminals at Ashcliffe Hospital, because she drowned her three kids. Teddy is a veteran WWII soldier, traumatized by the war experience in the liberation of the Duchan concentration camp and the loss of his beloved wife in a criminal fire. Teddy is unable to access the records of employees and patients and feels that his investigation is obstructed by the management by the Federal facility. Teddy has severe migraines and when there is a storm; Teddy and Chuck find that they are stranded in the island. Teddy interviews the internees and follows a lead to the lighthouse, where he discloses the mystery about the Shutter Island.<br/><br/>Roger Ebert wrote in his review, ""the movie is about: atmosphere, ominous portents, the erosion of Teddy's confidence and even his identity. It's all done with flawless directorial command. Scorsese has fear to evoke, and he does it with many notes."" and I have to agree with that. He awarded the film 3 and a half stars. People on IMDb who wrote negatively about the film mostly complained about the ending and how they would have liked it to go in another direction. Well, I have a message for them: LIVE WITH IT! The ending was as perfect as it gets but in the film you don't get as much shock form it like the shock you get by reading the book. If anyone is reading this review make sure that you don't read any reviews that contain spoilers because most of them ruin the surprise ending and with a delicate film like this it is easy to say, ""Sh*t! I wish I could go back in time!!AHH!"". The flashbacks that haunt Teddy are portrayed in a mean, nasty way from the war, his life, and his wife. This film should be recommended to people who love Scorsese's works because this is one of his masterpieces that you have to feast upon. I also strongly suggest is that, if you can, read the book before you watch the film because it will make you want to view the film more. I watched it so I could compare this with the book and I was very happy as a result. 8/10 - Shutter Island is a film that you can't miss out on and that is a rule!<br/><br/>""Over and Out."" 13 July, 2010."
"Robert_duder","8","2","4","8 July 2010"," A solid thriller if not a little over rated. The twist isn't truly so twisty
","Everyone I ever spoke to that had seen Shutter Island raved about it. I don't disagree that the film was very entertaining and a solid thriller but I felt like maybe people saw more originality in it than I did. It was well worth seeing and impressed me so don't get me wrong but it wasn't a mind blowing Scorsese classic in my opinion. In fact I think this was one of Scorsese's more mainstream films, although I've never really seen him as the 'amazing' 'monster' director everyone else does. I usually find he tries too hard to be unique. Still Shutter Island's creepy setting, and isolated prison is very well done and keeps you enthralled. The entire film happens on Shutter Island but you won't soon be tired of the setting as it takes the lead character from the prison like rooms to the coast of the island and back. Add in the time period of the mid fifties, and then toss a Hurricane at the Island to boot and you have the perfect suspense thriller setting to keep things moving. But by the time you add some of these key features it might start to feel a little predictable which you don't really expect from the film or from Scorsese. You can say a lot about him but predictable isn't usually his alma mater.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio, who truly impressed in Scorsese's previous smash success The Departed (see my review), and is great in his role as U.S. Marshall Teddy Daniels. You very quickly realize that something far more sinister is at work through the eyes of DiCaprio. Despite a solid supporting cast the film does really revolve around him and if anything you can say that DiCaprio can carry a film. He is very watchable and always gives a roll his all and makes everything seem mysterious in the film. Mark Ruffalo plays DiCaprio's new partner and right off the bat his vibe is one of mystery. Ruffalo has really honed his acting skill over the years because I used to find him downright dull but he really is showing some spirit. He plays a great role and has solid chemistry opposite DiCaprio. A master of his craft Ben Kingsley seems like the ideal choice for Shutter Island lead doctor Dr. Cawley. And indeed he is however somehow I expected for maniacal behaviour from him. But in essence that does defeat the purpose of the story. Kingsley gives a solid very interesting performance. On top of that the amazing Max von Sydow plays Kingsley's partner in a small but very effectively disturbing role. John Carroll Lynch has a small role as well but is really excellent as the Deputy for the Island. In fact I would have liked to have seen him more in the film.<br/><br/>Shutter Island's big hook is the twist to the whole story and the unravelling of the mystery. My issue is that the final solution is really a bit predictable and not very exciting. I don't consider myself very smart when it comes to solving cinematic mysteries but I think I had it all figured out by the time the ending rolled. I don't know what I wanted from the ending but with the set up and the creepy atmosphere of Shutter Island I guess I felt a little bit let down. With that aside you won't be disappointed in seeing Shutter Island. Maybe I had high expectations given how many people raved about the film. If you're looking for a solid thriller or even something with a dash of horror film then you won't be disappointed with Shutter Island. 8/10"
"TreyLovesMovies","8","2","4","8 July 2010"," The chilling journey to Shutter Island is one worth taking.
","Martin Scorsese is one of the last living legends of film-making. His latest offering Shutter Island once again stars his current muse Leonardo DiCaprio and continues their tradition of creating quality cinema together. Though the film doesn't reach high tier Scorsese, this effective mystery story proves that the director is still very much a master of his craft.<br/><br/>The story weaves a web of intrigue surrounding an escaped prisoner on the mysterious Shutter Island, home to the Ashecliffe Hospital for the Criminally Insane. DiCaprio stars as US Marshall Teddy Daniels, who, along with his partner played by Mark Ruffalo, is sent to assist in the investigation and re-apprehension of the patient. They are met with underscored hostility and reserved answers from the staff, which leads Daniels to believe that there is more to the island and its facility than the staff are letting on.<br/><br/>Scorsese presents his audience with images that instill a sense of uneasiness that never lets up. His use of a hurricane, decaying buildings, and disturbing nightmares prove incredibly effective in drenching the film's atmosphere with uncertainty and confusion. With a haunting score and lovely, dreary cinematography by veteran Robert Richardson rounding out the sense of impending doom nicely.<br/><br/>The movie's themes are hard to discuss without spoiling the shocking finale, but know that they deal with the power of our mind and how easily we can use that power to deceive ourselves, preventing us from having to accept the truth, especially when it is ugly and unbearable. Such dark themes make the overall affair rather depressing to witness, but this is also its greatest strength.<br/><br/>The film's biggest weakness is that it is billed as a thriller, and though Scorsese is obviously trying to draw viewers to the edge of their seat, he often fails, obtaining a strong level of uncertainty rather than fearful anxiety. This makes the film work more as an intriguing mystery.<br/><br/>If you are in search of a thoughtful, adult film that is loaded with subtle chills and superb performances, Shutter Island is a place you want to visit. Just beware that what you see there is not always reality."

","It's a pity Scorcese wont come back to his origins, although in this title he tried to do. In Shutter Island you can really expect to see a very good movie in terms of the technique, colors and lightning, camera movement and editing, Art department and sound. All of these contributes to a glorified picture that in the end doesn't look to fill the gap in the plot of the story.<br/><br/>The thing about the story is that although it has very good characters, all the movie is so well constructed and justified towards the end that almost into the first 30 minutes you can easily guess the ending. An ending that will come not to surprise you in any way, it will come to justify the story that you already figure out at the first half.<br/><br/>It's a pity because what could be an excellent movie that initiates from a well thought motor idea (""La Vida es Sueño"") it ends to be just another ""pretty"" movie just like in the tendency Scorsece has been showing lately."

","Shutter Island is one of the biggest loads of old tosh I've seen in a long time. The twist - if you can call it that - can be guessed from the trailer and must have been seen at least 47 movies before this one. There is a strange, artificial feel to the whole film, with the crazily doom-laden music the icing on the bizzaro cake. How this 70s B-movie script attracted Scorsese, DiCaprio, Ruffalo etc who know - perhaps it was just an excuse to camp it up for a while. That said, it entertains in its way, despite its overlength and awkward plotting. Truly a bit of a curio, no doubt it will become something of a cult 'guilty pleasure' down the line."

","Martin Scorsese's new movie is a tale of sound and fury, signifying ... well, not nothing exactly, but a heck of a lot less than it promises, given the straining intensity of those performances, the glowering darkness of mood, the grand gesture at 20th-century history's grimmest nightmares, and the sheer length. This was supposed to be Scorsese's experiment in B-movie thrills, but no mere B-movie director would go on for two hours and 20 minutes. That's an auteur running time we're talking about, and at the end of it, I got a whiff of shaggy dog.<br/><br/>The silly twist ending is supremely exasperating, and creating the narrative foundation for this final revelatory whiplash has meant laying down some long scenes that at the time look baffling and unconvincing. However, I admit everything looks good and fits together, and the film packs a fair-sized punch. Shutter Island is based on the 2003 thriller from Dennis Lehane, the author of Mystic River (filmed by Clint Eastwood) and Gone Baby Gone (filmed by Ben Affleck). The setting is the 1950s, an era when America's fighting men from the second world war would often have found uniformed jobs such as police officers in civilian life. One such is US Marshal Teddy Daniels, played by Leonardo DiCaprio in the scowling mode that he presented to the camera in Scorsese's The Departed, a man in almost constant spiritual pain.<br/><br/>
As a cop, he is someone who has seen his share of horror in the line of duty, and is now about to see an awful lot more. But this isn't at all why he appears so profoundly troubled. The clue here lies in Daniels's troubled personal life: his war record, and the death of his wife.<br/><br/>We see him first on a ferry, wretched with a seasickness that is a part of his continuing personal malaise. He and his partner are travelling over the water to a scarily forbidding prison called Shutter Island, a former civil-war fortress that has been converted into a maximum security facility for the criminally insane, and Teddy has reason to suspect that his wife's murderer is being kept here. Mark Ruffalo plays his partner Chuck - tough, level-headed, and much less affected by what he sees.<br/><br/>On the island itself, both officers are disconcerted by sudden bad weather preventing them from leaving, and the fact that the prison chief, smoothly amiable and pipe-smoking Dr Cawley (Ben Kingsley), seems to have been granted authority to do more or less as he wishes on his remote island kingdom. To the cops' disgust, Dr Cawley explains his liberal therapies for the psychotic murderers in his care. He disapproves of brutal lobotomies and electric shocks, preferring a radical new approach of letting the patients cathartically work through and act out their anxieties.<br/><br/>Teddy and Chuck are there to investigate the disappearance of a female prisoner patient from her cell: a stark impossibility, given the security conditions - unless the guards have helped her in return for sexual favours, or the prison authorities themselves, for their own sinister reasons, have made away with her.<br/><br/>The fact that Dr Cawley's associate Dr Nähring, played by Max von Sydow, is German, triggers traumatic memories. Teddy was one of the US soldiers who liberated Dachau; to him, Shutter Island has distinct similarities, and little by little, he suspects that the government has secretly enlisted certain qualified foreigners to help with psychological research here, using patients as guinea pigs. More even than this, secluded Shutter Island may simply have evolved into the doctors' private sociopathic fiefdom, a mad, dysfunctional sect where they do as they like - and have no intention of letting suspicious police officers ever leave.<br/><br/>Kingsley, DiCaprio, Von Sydow and Ruffalo give the picture solidity and weight, and Scorsese provides Hitchcockian and Kubrickian perspectives on that weird, secluded place which is closed in and yet agoraphobically exposed. It is perfectly possible to enjoy Shutter Island as a pulpy melodrama, yet I couldn't help thinking that an actual pulpy melodrama would be leaner in terms of plot; it would move more swiftly and be less self-conscious. There's just so much classy, brassy furniture in this movie, in every respect: acting, direction, music and production design. It is distractingly, disproportionately engorged with technique - all leading to a contrived ending. As for DiCaprio as Teddy, it is an angry, unsmiling and rather opaque performance: the type of performance that Scorsese is now habitually getting from him, in movies including The Departed, The Aviator and Gangs of New York: but he undoubtedly has presence and star-wattage, and carries the film.<br/><br/>The awful secret of Shutter Island, which Teddy has in fact not yet begun to grasp, is finally hammered home by Scorsese with muscular determination - a cinematic sledgehammer for a pretty small nut."

","When tragedy happens and you can't face it, you can go crazy, or you can choose to go crazy. If you don't choose to go crazy, you will. It's as simple as that.<br/><br/>A lot of times people wonder: how do the criminals, the moral scum, the hypocrites, how do they continue to live in this world in the face of their evil deeds every day? If only I were dead.<br/><br/>It doesn't have to be in some mysterious way. We all do the same thing every single day. When a person does something wrong and there is a conflict between behavior and attitude, it can be very uncomfortable. This is because people have a need for the unity of mind and body. But wrong has become a fact can not change, then can only change the attitude. Psychology is called cognitive dissonance.<br/><br/>The phenomenon of cognitive dissonance, first described by Leon Festinger, has inspired more than 3,000 experiments. To some extent, this mechanism of adjusting our attitude to our behavior is a healthy self-protection mechanism, otherwise we will be regretting the stupid things we do every day, feeling guilty and unable to eat or sleep. Festinger's student Elliot Aronson has written a book called ""Mistakes Were Made (but not by me)"" to explain why we not only defend our stupid behavior and bad decisions, but find a way out, and even get stronger under the circumstances. In short, just to make myself feel better.<br/><br/>But sometimes the reality is tragic to the point where normal rationalizing mechanisms for mistakes are no longer sufficient to produce any positive results. Like when you come home from work one day and you find your three kids all drowned in a lake and you shoot this woman. Then you recall that your wife was already showing signs of insanity, but you didn't listen, and you didn't act quickly enough to prevent that from happening.<br/><br/>How do you talk yourself out?
<ul><li>There 's no way.</li></ul><br/><br/><br/><br/>Teddy Daniels is teetering on the brink of collapse. So he chooses to create for himself a new reality, another reality that can explain the madness of reality -- called illusion. He chose to go insane to keep himself from going insane and killing himself.<br/><br/>Maybe it was a cowardly choice.<br/><br/>On a sunny day after a storm, Teddy sat on the steps outside, smoked a cigarette, and said to his doctor, ""we can trick them."" when he said, ""Don't worry partner, they're not gonna catch us, Chuck."" when Dr. Sheen shook his head to Dr. Cawley, the audience was convinced that he was back in the world of fantasy.<br/><br/>But at the end of the day, before he turned his head and came to pick up the man who had done the operation, Teddy said, ""I wonder, is it better to live like a monster, or die a good man?"" Is it better to die a good man, or to live like a wild beast?<br/><br/>In reality, Teddy is the man who killed his wife who drowned his children. After the operation, he will become a man with no memory. Although he will die believing that he is a good man who has never done anything wrong, he is a walking corpse without memory. Is it not a living monster? In other words, to die a good man, he had to live like a monster for the rest of his life.<br/><br/>They say that in the end, Teddy chose die a good man, which shows the brave side of human nature. Not really. Just because There is no ""better"" way.<br/><br/>It's just another choice without a choice.<br/><br/><br/><br/>When old luo is talking, he once said that ""a strong life needs no explanation"". And the tragedy of life, because there is no way to explain. Whenever there is a little rut, can make do with rationalizing everything that happens, also can always survive. We still have some resilience.<br/><br/>But self justification always has a bad day. What are you going to live on? Nothing is reliable.<br/><br/>I guess that's what I was trying to say."

I was surprised with the high ratings at first as it reminded me of ´Insomnia´ for the hallucinations and ´The Others´ for the final twist but there are actually different twists and the scenario is playing with our brains, mislieading us each time we think we know what is happening. For this reason, I think it is necessary to watch it twice to understand the final outcome.
Some seem to have been disappointed with the final twist as it could actually be easily guessed but I don´t think anyone could actually do so. And as it is based on a book, unless this part has been changed, the book would be the one to blame, not the film.

","The shutter island.(2010).<br/><br/>
Cast by : Leonardo DiCaprio, Mark ruffalo, Ben kingsley, Max Von Sydow and Richelle Williams.<br/><br/>Directed by : Martin Scorses<br/><br/>Synopsis: Shutter island is a 2010<br/><br/>American neo-noir psychological ..thriller film directed by Martin Scorsese and written by Laeta Kalogridis..Released on February 19, 2010.In which Leonardo DiCaprio stars as U.S. Marshal Edward ""Teddy"" Daniels, who is investigating a psychiatric facility on Shutter Island after one of the patients goes missing. Mark Ruffalo plays his partner officer; Ben Kingsley is the facility's lead psychiatrist; Max von Sydow is a German doctor; and Michelle Williams is Daniels's wife.<br/><br/>Review:<br/><br/>It is one of the best movies made by director Martin Scorsese. It is perhaps the best movie starring Leonardo DiCaprio. Honestly speaking, it is one of the greatest films of the decade.<br/><br/>""Shutter Island"" is simply a masterpiece. The beginning of the movie suggests a very basic plot of a detective story, possibly a thriller. As the movie progresses, the plot becomes bigger and bigger with more and more complexity added to it. The way this happens is incredible. The placing is really good. That is what makes the movie so interesting. And, even though the movie gets more complex, it is not difficult to keep up with the major plot points. And, the final twist is one of the best plot twists I have ever seen.<br/><br/>In 1954, federal marshal Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his new partner Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo) arrive on Shutter Island, a treatment facility outside of Boston for the criminally insane, to search for an escaped murderess. Haunted by past images from Nazi concentration camps and visions of his dead wife (Michelle Williams), Teddy has another, more personal reason to visit the island. Unfortunately, he soon discovers that there might be far more sinister things going on, and that doctors Cawley (Ben Kingsley) and Naehring (Max von Sydow), may be involved in some kind of hideous experiment. But even if Teddy can find proof, will he ever get off the island?<br/><br/>Teddy has a dream where his dead wife Dolores tells him that Rachel is ""still here."" Believing that Rachel had help escaping, Teddy interviews the other patients in her group therapy sessions, but learns nothing. Marooned in a shelter during a storm, Teddy tells Chuck that the arsonist who killed his wife, Andrew Laeddis, should be at Ashecliffe, but is seemingly missing. Teddy also reveals that he interviewed a former Ashecliffe patient named George Noyce, who told him that Ashecliffe is conducting illicit experiments on political subversives. Chuck worries that the men have been lured to the island and are being set up by Cawley.
Teddy learns that Ashecliffe has 66 patients, believing Andrew Laeddis to be the 67th. When Rachel Solando turns up alive, Teddy interviews her, but fails to understand a seemingly delusional story she tells him about ""swimming in the lake."" Teddy suffers a migraine and dreams of Rachel, three dead children, a scarred man he believes to be Andrew Laeddis, and Dolores, who tells him to find Laeddis. Teddy wakes up and goes searching for Laeddis with Chuck in Ward C, where Ashecliffe houses the most dangerous patients. Teddy attacks one patient, and follows a voice until he finds a badly scarred George Noyce, who tells Teddy his investigation is fake and to leave Dolores behind. Noyce also tells Teddy that Laeddis is being kept in the lighthouse.
Disturbed by Noyce's words, Teddy becomes suspicious of Chuck and heads toward the lighthouse alone but cannot reach it due to the high tide. In a nearby cave, Teddy finds an older woman he believes to be the real Rachel Solando.
The movie is dark and psychologically engrossing. Yet it does have a short lived and very brief happy moment with the tiny plotline involving Dr. Cawley's motives. That's all I can say without getting into complexity. Leonardo DiCaprio, Mark Ruffalo and Ben Kingsly have given some of the great performances till date. I don't have anything that bugged me. So no mixed or bad aspects of the film<br/><br/>Conclusion. On the whole, for me, it's the movie of the decade. The decade is almost over, and still I have not got any movie in the league of ""Shutter Island"". It's a very engaging and thrilling movie. It's one of those films I consider to be an all time great"

","From the opening shot of the ferry coming out of the fog, you know this is going to be a masterpiece of film-making from Scorsese. I've personally had my ups and downs with him, he can be mediocre in my opinion, but when he is brilliant, he truly is brilliant. Scorsese assembled an enviable cast of actors for this film. While that in itself is always a bonus, without a skilled and talented director (as has been seen numerous timed over the years) it is not a guaranteed recipe for success.<br/><br/>Each actor and actress is perfectly cast here. Ben Kingsley as the Doctor is suitably creepy, Max Von Sydow is his usual evil looking self and Emily Mortimer is brilliant in her small role. Every single one immerses you into the story. The film is beautifully shot and each location is filled with the just the right amount of light, shadows and suspense. The script by Laeta Kalogridis, adapted from the brilliant novel by Dennis Lehane is tight and never meanders, always holding your interest.<br/><br/>US Marshal Teddy Daniels (another Oscar-worthy performance from DiCaprio) awakens on a ferry. Disorientated and suffering from sea-sickness, he heads outside to meet his new partner Chuck (Ruffalo). They have been assigned to investigate an escaped 'patient' from Shutter Island, an institution for the criminally insane. As soon as they embark onto the island they are met by the deputy warden, and straight away things appear to be not as they seem.<br/><br/>Met with a lack of cooperation and stuck on the island due to a vicious storm, Daniels and Chuck try to investigate how the patient escaped. But is everything really as it seems? It's a little difficult to go into more details as there are so many little twists and red herrings that it would be easy to give everything away for anyone who has not seen the film or read the book. Suffice to say that the film will take you on a mystery filled ride.<br/><br/>Once everything is wrapped up, the ending is certainly up for debate and repeated viewing is a must. If this was made in Italy and in the seventies it would have made a brilliant Giallo. The setting is perfect and Scorsese really makes it a menacing atmosphere with his direction of the story. A film that requires repeated viewing to truly get the best from it.<br/><br/>

He often leaves you on the wrong track and a lot of things undiscussed, he's toying with the viewers emotions.<br/><br/>'Shutter Island' also contains great characters. The way Teddy reflects on the war and how it influences his decisions give a nice twist to the film. Teddy's reaction to certain situations suggest there is a lot of stuff you don't know about, which also builds up the tension. He is clearly someone with a lot on his mind, and the way his dreams are shown gives us an introspective view on his character, which makes voice-over narration unnecessary.<br/><br/>Though the film hasn't the most sharp dialogue, like in, for example, 'Goodfellas', it is gifted with some impressively intelligent conversations.<br/><br/>The absolute greatest thing about 'Shutter Island' is - something I had never experienced before - how Scorsese seems to give us a choice at the end.

The buildup of what inevitably arrives makes you question what is real. Is this all a game as from what George told him while going through only the most insane area of the mental institution? Is the protagonist still being tricked into believing he is an inmate himself as from his cave hallucination? Obviously he is emotionally disturbed and unstable from his past trauma, but the way the movie is laid out, it doesn't make it so far fetched that the twist might not be a twist. Perhaps we just watched the institution turn a U.S Marshall into believing the past he once thought of his own was a lie.

This approach that the movie I love to my heart from Scorsese films has created a world for this film, a world of its own alone, will mess with your mind and destroy your convictions and distract your nerves, you will not know from the good and the evil, from the oppressed and from the oppressor.
This is what led to one of the most enjoyable movies and most painful films for the viewer, which is the relentlessly deep into the issue of psychologically and mentally disordered, a torrent of surprises in every event, a great acting performance of the whole, a decaprio that is incomparable as usual, charismatic and elaborate diversity in expressions and emotions, Raphaelo is in his best condition, and I miss a lot of movies like this now, especially with the praise of Almighty Ben Kingsley, who locked my breath in every scene he appeared in. This man has his way of acting that I have never seen in others before.This tight structure of the characters is not due to Scorsese alone. The author (Dennis Lehan), the author of which the movie is excerpted from, should be praised, and he also presented us with a novel (Mystic River), from which a movie with the same name was cited as being nominated for four Oscars, and the real pleasure of the film remains in the shock of the shocking and genius END."

"jamheigei","7","0","0","1 October 2018"," Good but overrated thriller with disappointing visuals.
","Shutter Island is a sometimes mind-bending psycho thriller. It's a good movie with a great cast and it provokes discussion after you've seen it with your friends. It also has a deeper meaning and somewhat of a message for me, which is always a sign for a good film. So overall, I liked it.<br/><br/>What really bothers me, tough, is that it often seems to be seen as the >ultimate psycho thriller< because it is really not.
There is a plot twist in the movie. Admittedly, I can't say how I would have predicted the plot if I didn't know about the existence of that twist before watching, but I doubt my prediction would have been much different. Bottom line here: Seemingly >>small details<< that hint towards the twist aren't at all small. They're in fact pretty obvious at times which, for me, destroys a lot of the myth that's been created around Shutter Island. Though ultimately the plot turns out to have more layers than expected, it still failed to really blow my mind. Once I realized fully what was going on, I thought >>Wow, there's more to it. But really, I could have known<<.
So yes, it's complex, but too much is given away before the actual twist/truth-reveal happens (and yes, it happens and Scorcese wants you know that it's happening).
While that sounded not too great, really the most disappointing aspect about Shutter Island is the way it is made. Right at the start, the two agents are on a ship towards the island. What's actually going on, though, is they're standing in a studio with a truly laughable green screen effect post-producing a horrible looking sea in the background. No wind noises, no wind blowing through the actors' very long coats, it's just cheap. That movie is from scorcese? And what, it had an $80M budget? C'mon. That trend of terrible and unnecessary studio shots (it's not impossible to just shoot on an actual boat, you know) continues through the rest of the cinemtography that has its moments in terms of colour and atmosphere creation, but eventually remains luke warm and is hard for me to oversee in a Martin Scorcese movie."

","Martin Scorsese (Raging Bull, Taxi Driver, Goodfellas, Casino) the man is a master of bringing to life films with character driven devices. The over the top performance by Leonardo DiCaprio is devout acting at it's finest. In my opinion it is flawless, he is effortless in his performance. <br/><br/>The plot is wisely made to begin like a 50's detective thriller with Caprio playing a US Marshal and Mark Ruffalo his partner ""Chuck"", called upon to investigate a disappearance of a patient on Shutter Island. As the fil swiftly moves along the picture and plot become entangled in something more mysterious and sinister going on within the island. The dynamic of the film paces perfectly which keeps the audience enthralled in what is happening. A ensemble cast with Sir Ben Kingsley playing the lead doctor/psychiatrist, Michelle Williams as Leo's wife and rounding out such a great cast is Emily Mortimer, Max Von Sydow, Jackie Earle Haley, Ted Levine, Elias Koteas.<br/><br/>This is a mind blowing, mind bending style of thriller, suspense and drama.

"SquigglyCrunch","6","0","0","9 February 2017"," A Cool, Though Easily Predicted, Twist Ending, and a Generic Missing Person Plot
","Shutter Island follows a US Marshal who goes to an island filled with mental patients and attempts to locate a woman who escaped the asylum. <br/><br/>I have really mixed feelings about this movie, mostly due to the twist ending, which I will try my best not to spoil. While it is incredibly easy to predict at least an hour in, I still enjoyed the ride more or less. The mystery itself plays out how every missing persons case seems to play out in film. It's generic in it's presentation and writing right up until the last twenty minutes, where it makes everything slightly more acceptable. But it's still 2 hours of uninspired blegh, so I don't really know how to feel about it. <br/><br/>There are several scenes throughout the movie that don't make a lick of sense, but are explained by the ending more or less. Still, they aren't fully comprehensible, and while they can be easily explained, they still didn't make total sense. A lot of this movie doesn't, but the ending wraps it up well enough. Again, I'm not sure what I think about it. <br/><br/>Despite the fact that the ending does a decent job of wrapping up an otherwise unoriginal story, there still isn't much in the technical respect. The directing is nothing special, nor is the soundtrack, acting, writing, or anything else. Really, the ending is the only thing that saved the movie, but as a whole it's just kind of nothing. <br/><br/>Overall Shutter Island is good-ish. The ending is kind of a cop-out, but it still works, especially in accordance with the last hour (where it ceases to make sense). However, the ending is so unbelievably obvious that I can't give it much credit. It's not mind-blowing or anything, but more a confirmation of the audience's suspicions. In the end Shutter Island is by no means a bad movie, but it is by no means a great movie. I would even hesitate to call it 'good'. It's alright. It's a lot of nothing simply for a confirmation at the end. Still, I probably would recommend it to some people, more because of how much of a classic it has become and less because it's actually a great movie."
"ersbel","Null","0","0","27 November 2016"," I used to see Scorsese as magic
","Growing up I used to see Scorsese as magic. And he is only a director who had the chance, and maybe some inspiration, to choose the box office hits from all the projects he received. In the case of Shutter Island, is the script that does the magic. Scorsese just directs people according to the given script. DiCaprio? Well, it would have been much better if he could act. But, as usual, Leo DiCaprio only moves around the set with a blank expression. Like any puppet he moves around, she can open the mouth and tell the lines and that is about it. Actually, thanks to the demigod director, most actors are in the same state and unless for the realism, one might think this is an animation project. Max von Sydow is the only one acting, but that is maybe because he is too old to be directed by the mighty Scorsese. And the role is small.<br/><br/>It is also interesting to see the transformation of Scorsese in the light of his exposure to the Asian film makers. He is trying color filters and enhancers. It would have been nice to have these variations back in the days of Goodfellas. Still, it is only an experiment and it looks like one as the color variations are cute, but add nothing to the story itself.<br/><br/>So I have enjoyed the script and not much else.<br/><br/>Contact me with Questions, Comments or Suggestions ryitfork @ bitmail.ch"
"Tarx309","6","0","0","19 September 2016"," Neither Scorese's worst nor his best
","Shutter Island is a movie that I had fairly large expectations of. Based off the rating I've given it, it's needless to say they weren't entirely fulfilled. Let's start with the positives. The opening is intriguing and effectively introduces the audience to the characters and the general plot line. It's a suspenseful opening, and gives the audience a good basic idea of the characters. The principle four characters are played by Leonardo DiCaprio, Mark Ruffalo, Ben Kingsley and John Carroll Lynch. DiCaprio is reliable as always, and gives what it obviously the best performance of the entire movie. He effectively mixes torment, determination and grief all into one high quality performance. Ruffalo and Kingsley both give good work as well, even if they are slightly overshadowed by both DiCpario's performance and character. John Carroll Lynch was also as good as always, although his character is not developed enough to justify his large portion of screen time. The characters are, for the most part, good and well written. However as the movie unravels, and they unravel with it as we learn more about them and who they truly, the characters become much less appetising. The simple way to put it is plot development at the expense of the characters. As the plot thickens, the characters become far less appealing.<br/><br/>The problem is that it all feels like its been done before. The movie builds suspense up to the final act, and when we finally get to the climax - which is more than two hours into the movie - the only feeling I was left with was disappointment. And even the building to the climax is too long; at times it feels it would benefit from a faster pace and a smaller run time. At a grand total of 138 minutes, it's only natural that the audience would question whether that is strictly necessary; and in this case, sadly, it is not. This is a movie that would greatly benefit from some more original ideas, for it all feels a little too cliché. There is twist after twist to the point where it all overloads. Too often Scorsese doesn't take the time to develop one plot point, but instead tosses aspects of the movie away every ten minutes or so, and then moves onto the next. The movie is bloated with ideas, none of which are particularly new, all of which are let down by a disappointing end.<br/><br/>Still, this isn't necessarily a bad movie. There are faults, yes, but the aching sense of mystery that simultaneously accompanies the characters and the story helps to keep the audience invested, and some great cinematography doesn't go amiss either. In the end this is not a movie I will be watching again, but neither is it a movie I would warn people against watching. I'm sure it's not Scorsese's best work, but it's probably not his worst either."

I think its must be some sort of a fashion or status-quo in America to praise and talk +vely about such films that have no ending or have a very confusing plot or one that does have (supposedly) a hidden meaning etc: while I fail to see how can so many Americans actually understand such complex plots and also like them, when mostly they are considered quite 'dumb,' and perhaps rightly so.<br/><br/>I was astonished to see that people had rated this movie at 8, when brilliant movies like 'Paycheck', 'Bone Collector' or 'Fracture' are only around 6-7.

"TheLittleSongbird","9","3","8","6 August 2010"," Atmospheric and clever- really makes you think deep
","I like Martin Scorsesse a lot, and I was interested in seeing Shutter Island. It had a truly intriguing concept and my 17-year old sister was raving about how brilliant the film was. Shutter Island is not Scorsesse's best, but it was atmospheric, clever, incredibly thought-provoking and somewhat disturbing too.<br/><br/>I do agree it is too long and that it drags in places, that Shutter Island is still very impressive and gripping. The cinematography is great, dark, expressionistic and Gothic. Same with the scenery which is both picturesque and bleak, while the direction is superb, almost operatic and imaginative. The screenplay is intelligent and the plot gripping and clever, however Shutter Island is one of those films that if you miss a line of dialogue or a plot point you are in danger of missing something important. I also liked the music- admittedly the repeated bass motif which has a knock-on-the-door effect makes us think immediately that something out of the ordinary is going to happen but I have to admit it was haunting, while the Mahler chamber music piece along with the more gut-wrenching images at Dacchau was put to effective use, though coming from a classical music enthusiast I never knew Mahler wrote chamber music.<br/><br/>The acting is very good, Leonardo DiCaprio and Ben Kingsley are both excellent, and Mark Ruffalo was surprisingly good too. Max Von Sydow is also good, and although I wasn't sure about Michelle Williams at first she was suitably eerie and haunting. Finally the ending, some have said it was clever, others were underwhelmed by it. For me, I found it very clever and it was actually the part of the film that made me think about most. Of course it leaves questions rather than answers, but I think that was the point, it is ambiguous and open to interpretation and I certainly would have never thought of that. There could also be the possibility that there is no right or wrong answer, we are left to wonder for ourselves whether he was sane or not, and I think that was a reason for why the film ended inconclusively- I for one asked myself what did happen to Ted? <br/><br/>Overall, very gripping and clever, with an ending that really makes you think. It is not what I consider a perfect film, but the direction and acting makes up for any misgivings. Plus it is probably a film you need to see more than once to completely understand or appreciate it. 9/10 Bethany Cox"
"john-souray","3","3","8","13 July 2010"," Losing the plot
","This could have been a good film, a great one even. The ingredients are all here. An imaginative director, wonderful location and sets, actors that are never less than competent and sometimes a lot better (I was particularly struck by Ruffalo, an actor I've not previously taken notice of). There is a promising premise – an Alcatraz of Hannibal Lecters, the island asylum where they send everyone that nobody else wants or can cope with. And potentially great themes; the excesses of American psychiatry in the early fifties, the disputes between the advocates of surgery, the advocates of medication, and the advocates of therapy. And something even darker still, something touching on the character of evil (or what we call evil) itself. Can someone be driven mad simply by witnessing too much? But the film bungles it, horribly. And it's not too hard to work out why. The script just isn't good enough. Actually, not even the script; the plot is not good enough. To be fair, I may have been in a good mood, and the film engaged my attention throughout. It's only afterwards, thinking about what you've just seen, that it all starts to come apart.<br/><br/>I think I can do this without spoilers. The basic premise is on the DVD sleeve. DiCaprio plays a US marshal (with his sidekick Ruffalo) who is called in to investigate the disappearance of a patient (which ought to be impossible). The procedural development I found, though stolid, gripping; and the creeping realisation that there is more here than meets the eye was well handled and well timed.<br/><br/>But what is really going on here? Several theories are discussed, and the truth when it finally emerges is certainly a twist of sorts, though it may well be one that the viewer has already thought of. (No prizes here. Night Shyamalam has a lot to answer for. Not every twist has to be like the one in the Sixth Sense. Sometimes, the most enjoyable and effective twist is the one that the viewer can work out, because it's the one that flatters the viewer's intelligence). But whatever sort of twist this is, it has to work. It has to make sense; and in this film, it doesn't.<br/><br/>It is another of those preposterous conspiracies that only work in fiction. The plot appears to work, in that it makes sense of the puzzles that precede it, and seems consistent enough with everything that has happened. But you realise, turning it over in your mind, that from the point of view of the conspirators, it is a completely mad plot. There is much too much that could go wrong, at every stage.<br/><br/>There are plenty of examples of this absurdity in the other reviews, some with spoilers, some without. Some I'd spotted for myself, others I ruefully recognised, and they all contributed to this sense of everything unravelling, of the whole plot falling apart in your hands. I will just add one myself: The film opens with a pallid DiCaprio sea-sick in the heads of the ferry taking him and his assistant to the island. My question (which will make sense to those who've seen the film, but will seem odd to those that haven't) is: what was DiCaprio doing five minutes before? More importantly, what was he thinking? That isn't a stupid question, either, as we subsequently learn quite a lot about what he is thinking, mostly in dreams and memories. DiCaprio discovers, patting his pockets, that he's lost his cigarettes, and accepts one from his assistant. Think, man! Where could you have left them? The realisation dawns on you that this whole conspiracy is a trick played not on or by DiCaprio on or by other characters. It is a trick played by the director on you, the viewer.<br/><br/>And with that, the film falls apart. We know that amongst the memories haunting DiCaprio are the fact that he was part of the contingent that liberated Dachau. The mentally ill (or ""defective"") were though fewer as disgraceful a part of Nazi extermination programmes as the Jews, and there are clear parallels that could be drawn here with the American programme of psychosurgery (though note that the island asylum's staff includes – I won't say who – representatives of the humanitarian as well as surgical and pharmaceutical wings of psychiatry). But this film, a shoddily assembled comic book plot, just cheapens and demeans these historical resonances.<br/><br/>It leaves me feeling quite angry. The film must have cost tens of millions . As my opening remarks say, the talent and the resources are all there. It's just so lazy, so slapdash. Is there no quality control? There's forty, fifty amateur critics or more on this site, each of whom could have told the producers and director what was going wrong. How could this mess get made?"
"mike-adly5","9","3","8","23 May 2010"," In a Nutshell: Shutter Island
","Shutter Island..A journey from darkness to revelation.<br/><br/>Highly anticipated through the vibe of Here's-another-Scorsese-DiCaprio- collaboration, Shutter Island delivers what's expected and more. It is an acting-directing masterpiece that won't fail most of its viewers. Set in 1954, this is a story of Teddy Daniels (DiCaprio), US marshal, who's called for a special investigation of the disappearance of a psychiatric patient from an island based asylum for the criminally insane. As Teddy steps foot into grim Ashecliffe, he's disturbed by the looks of the patients on the outer grounds of the hospital, but he has no idea that what he's about to encounter is out of his wildest expectations.<br/><br/>Based on a novel with the same name by Dennis Lehane, writer of ""Gone Baby Gone"" and ""Mystic River"", this story needed a great ensemble of actors lead by none other than legendary director Martin Scorsese to live up to its viewers expectations, and luckily it did. Scorsese had also chosen his all time buddy Film Editor and 3 time Academy Award winner Thelma Schoonmaker, the lady behind editing movies like ""Gangs of New York"", ""The Departed"" and ""The Aviator"", to become his editing mastermind. I say, since Marty chose to employ flashbacks, visions and short intervening scenes to help reach the dramatic climax of the story, he needed the helping hand of such a remarkable editor.<br/><br/>In this picture, not only is your mind captivated by the thrill of the story, but also your senses by its absorbing setup and its powerful score. Throughout the movie, you can tell that a great effort has been exerted in the art direction especially in scenes of Teddy's dreams, visions and flashbacks. And it's all only backed up by a brilliant choice of music that serves achieving no less than the desired emotional state of the audience. <br/><br/>And just as if you aren't satisfied with brilliant acting of DiCaprio, Ruffalo and Kingsley, Martin Scorsese presents a triple serving of spectacular short appearances by Emily Mortimer, Patricia Clarkson and Jackie Earle Haley. Each with a story of their own, they not only deliver dazzling performances that may very well earn them supporting role nominations, but they also push the story forward toward its ultimate revelation.<br/><br/>In Short, apart from a rather limited hype of negative criticism towards the similarities of the story and an old silent film called The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, Shutter Island has had a great reception worldwide and had been very well appreciated by the book readers and those who just saw the movie. I say if a movie is the highest grossing and the most financially successful in Martin Scorsese's career, you should see it if you haven't already."

Whilst investigating Teddy becomes paranoid, believing there is a wider conspiracy, with patients being coached, and that the leading psychiatrists Dr. Cawley (Ben Kingsley) and Dr. Naehring (Max von Sydow) were conducting experiments on the patients and that Teddy's arrival on the island was a trap. Teddy also plans to find the man who torched his apartment building where his wife died. He too was an inmate on the island.<br/><br/>Scorsese shows once again his skill behind the camera, giving the audience a stylist, neo-noir story with a very eerie atmosphere throughout. He keeps the mystery going in this fast paced film. He tells a very compelling thriller with good horror moments in what must have been a complex novel. It is stylist, but also has a lot of substance. He give justice to Laeta Kalogridis' screenplay.<br/><br/>Once again Scorsese turns to Leonardo DiCaprio for the lead role and DiCaprio gives one on his best performances, and a very mature performance as the guilt ridden officer. He has proved like Brad Pitt that he is more then just a pretty boy but also a very talented actor in a long career. Ben Kingsley has finally performed in film where he can give a more understated performance which he is better at. He offers a sly performance as the main antagonist of the film. Mark Ruffalo is an actor who has made his career in supporting roles, and again he does a good performance as Ted's main ally.<br/><br/>Despite all the positives to the film, everything did not add up and by about the two thirds of the way through I guessed the big twist. However, that does not diminish the quality of the film.<br/><br/>Shutter Island will easily make my Top 10 for 2010."

","I went today to see 'Shutter Island' with so many reasons and worries that would make me hate it, cause first of all I've read the novel (one of the best novels I've ever read) and I've never seen a movie before that was better than the novel it's based on and also due to some of the bad reviews this movie has got..but I have to thank God that I was wrong!! Every element of Shutter Island was top notch...Leo does it again and shows to everyone who questions his talent how brilliant he is by his performance as Teddy Daniels. Ben Kingsley, Mark Ruffalo and Michelle Williams all gave superb supporting performances too. Cinematography and Lights had a major role in keeping the atmosphere of the movie as mysterious and uncomfortable as possible, it made you feel what Teddy Daniels is going through..and finally, the direction. Mr. Martin Scorsese, the king of masterpieces, gives us again another masterpiece of his. It's not only that he knows how to control all of the cinematic equipment he's got the way he wants, but he also puts the viewer's mind exactly where he wants..Through his image, this plot had more depth, more passion, more subtlety and much much more tension that made this movie literally surpass it's novel by all means..I read some reviews that complained about the predictability of the movie, which I didn't feel while watching it, but even if it is a predictable movie, this won't lessen anything from it's value..you can watch it for it's great performances, character development, the mysterious and tension filled atmosphere, the well thought and written dialog and an original score that helped keeping the tension for two and a half hours. All in all, an unforgettable experience and a must see thriller, from an all star cast and the best director out there."

","A tension-filled film which has you second guessing all the way through. Brilliantly filmed, directed and acted by all. However, I can't write this review without mentioning Leonardo DiCaprio's amazing acting in this film. I thought he should have won Best Actor for ""The Aviator"" - then saw him in ""Revolutionary Road"" last year and was blown away once again by his performance opposite Kate Winslett - and now this. He is head & shoulders above any other actor of his generation at this moment and it is only a matter of time before he will be well and truly recognised as such. Just a pity SI was released too late for this year's Oscar - as by the time 2011 comes around this film will have been forgotten (at least as far as Oscar nominees are concerned)."
"Likes_Ninjas90","5","3","8","23 February 2010"," There are some interesting visuals and good performances but DiCaprio was not the right fit for this role
","Aboard a ship in the 1950's, a Federal Marshal named Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his new partner Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo) are heading towards Ashecliffe Hospital, a mental institution on Shutter Island. Ashecliffe holds some of the most criminally insane patients and it is reluctance then that Teddy must had over his pistol before entering. Teddy holds little remorse for the inmates. He is haunted by the memories of his wife Dolores (Michelle Williams) who was killed by a firebug. When they reach the mainland, Teddy and Chuck are briefed by the ambiguous Dr. Cawley (Ben Kingsley), who describes how a murderer named Rachel Salon escaped from her cell and has now gone missing. Beyond this disappearance though, Teddy suspects that there is something far more sinister occurring on the island and seeks to find evidence of it. He also suspects that the other doctor on the island, Dr. Naehring (Max von Sydow), might be a former Nazi.<br/><br/>The novel Shutter Island was written by Dennis Learne, who's other works Mystic River and Gone Baby Gone, were turned into immensely successful films. With the appraisal of these adaptations, along with a director as talented and as experienced as Martin Scorsese, the expectations for this film have been justifiably high. To the credit of Scorsese, his cinematographer Robert Richardson and regular film editor Themla Schoomaker, the film is stylishly constructed, with images that are haunting and other scenes that are just beautiful in their simplicity. The first vision of the island in its entirety is actually quite magnificent to behold. Yet through the fault of either Learne's novel or the script written by Laeta Kalogridis, this is overall a rather obvious and disappointing film, which does not stand up to scrutiny. At the beginning on board the boat, Teddy states to Chuck that he is his new partner and then begins to explain how his wife died in the fire. It is a rather odd start that so thickly describes what is happening. If the expository dialogue was limited to just this scene it would remain a minor fault. However, the film is so heavily laden with lines of dialogue that telegraph what is to come that the surprises and power of some of the biggest revelations are diminished. The writing is set well on and truly on the wall at the end, or more specifically Dr. Cawley's whiteboard, when everything is so neatly explained. There are more obscure dream sequences that distract and make one question what is going on but regardless, the twist is largely foreseeable and makes little sense in relation to the rest of the film. People will discuss this film for its own implausibility, rather than for a mature examination of mental illness.<br/><br/>Frustratingly, the lack of subtlety extends from the dialogue, to the tone of the film and some of the performances as well. Shutter Island is a film so intent in submitting itself as horrific that it becomes outright tiring, instead of emotionally affecting. The film's overbearing, thunderous music score, foggy skies and iron gates, suggests doom and damnation in every way that has been seen before. The representation of mental patients is not a sympathetic one either, with some of them, such as skeletal woman with most of her hair missing and a man with a scar halfway across his face, looking like leftover peasants from a Zorro film. It is not particularly unnerving or scary, just a sensationalised representation and DiCaprio's performance is another example of this. There is no shortage of effort in his fourth reunion with Scorsese. Yet DiCaprio becomes almost exhausting as Teddy, relying on such an overzealous personality to carry the film. There is a possible explanation for this, but along with his lack of compassion in the film, it does not make him particularly likable or sympathetic. DiCaprio's weakness as an actor is that he has not physically matured enough to be able to immerse himself into any role, like Sean Penn or Philip Seymour Hoffman and the brief flashbacks to Teddy's army days in particular, highlight this. He looks quite out of place in some sequences. Ruffalo is thankfully more contained in his role and Kingsley is formal and proper, but also deceptive and ambiguous. It is a shame then that despite running at over two hours there is not a great deal of time dedicated to coming to know some of the characters more thoroughly.<br/><br/>There is little doubt that both Martin Scorsese and DiCaprio will continue to make stronger films than Shutter Island. This picture suffers because of some poorly written dialogue and too many obvious hints. The subject matter could have been so interesting and contextual to the period but it is handled in such an unsubtle and obvious manner that the film just isn't as tense or as affecting as it should be. There are some interesting visuals and good performances but DiCaprio was not the right fit for this role. One must hope that if he chooses to partner with Scorsese for a fifth time, the role will be suitable rather than compulsory."

","The plot is captivating, the acting is impeccable and the direction is slick. I went for this movie with high expectations and it did not disappoint. It was not the usual Scorsese movie. It was different and it was well done.<br/><br/>The story is basically about Teddy Daniels ( Leonardo DiCaprio ) and Chuck Aule ( Mark Ruffalo ) coming to Shutter Island, an institute for mentally disturbed criminals, to investigate the disappearance of one of their patients. From there on they get caught in a deadly game when they begin to realize that Shutter island may be a much darker place than its owner Dr. Crawley ( Ben Kingsley ) makes it out to be.<br/><br/>The twists and turns are the key to this movie and those are what will keep the viewer hooked right till the end. Even though DiCaprio carries the movie through, Ben Kingsley manages to make his mark with an outstanding performance. Although not completely unpredictable, Shutter Island remains to be a great watch."

My husband and I are thinking of seeing it again at the movie theater.<br/><br/>The look, the directing/editing, the acting, the music, were all done extremely well. It had an old movie feel to it. I find I enjoy DiCaprio's acting the older he becomes--and he did not disappoint with this one. It is a thriller in the true sense of the word. Perhaps there are those movie goers who are more intuitive about endings or even in figuring out where a movie is headed early on in the picture, but for me, the movie unfolded at a very nice pace. I had enough time to think 'ok, where is this headed now?' but the 'maybe this or maybe that' still kept me wondering, never quite sure where it was headed--it could go this way or that or that, up unto its conclusion. Too many movies build-up, build-up only to disappoint the viewer at the end, this simply did not. <br/><br/>My husband and I recommend Shutter Island, and at a minimum, rent it when it comes out on DVD."

","I knew this film was going to be amazing when I first heard of it. Leonardo DiCaprio, Mark Ruffalo, Martin Scorsese, and that's all I gotta say. Leonardo DiCaprio has been one of my favorite actors since ""The Basketball Diaries."" Once again, he shined in this movie, and his performance was unbelievable. Mark Ruffalo was a great supporting actor as well.<br/><br/>Let's start with the story. Everybody knows from the trailer, that basically 2 US Marshalls go to Shutter Island to investigate a missing patient. Sounds pretty great. It's not until you see the movie, you capture everything. It is definitely the best psychological thriller I've ever seen. With this film, it actually has a great plot, and since it's a psychological thriller, you actually have to pay attention and think (duh). No bathroom breaks during this movie, or else you may miss something important. <br/><br/>The twist with this film was perfect, and some people may have been able to guess it before they even seen the movie. Who is patient 67? But it's not until you see the full movie that you understand everything. It isn't a predictable twist, and by that I mean if you knew it before, you probably didn't know how everything came to be. I'm a hard movie critic, but I will probably see this once again, and will most likely buy this when it's out on DVD. It's that good."

It never strays far from respectability. <br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio furrows his brow a lot and looks constipated for the majority of the film and decides to call that a performance, but it's not really his fault. He's not the one who wrote the story. <br/><br/>There's no one single tense or scary set piece to be found and, by the time the big twist is revealed, anyone with half a brain will feel insulted. <br/><br/>Shutter Island is handsomely made, middle brow fluff without anything interesting to recommend.

","Shutter Island has been very critically acclaimed but several fans and critics alike. The film by director Scorsese has become a hit as it was released back in February 2010. Starring Leonardo DiCaprio as the lead for their 4th collaboration (up to that point), Shutter Island does tell a very interesting story, however the journey we see does not fully equal to what one would expect. As all of Scorsese films, the performances delivered by the leads and supporting actors are top notch, as well as the visuals and scenery. Though one would have expected more. <br/><br/>By the finale, when the big twist is revealed, it does not feel as one is satisfied with everything that has happened, or we simply do not care so much. It was somewhat predictable with everything leading up to the conclusion. Perhaps as many have stated, Shutter Island could use multiple viewings and perhaps one would enjoy it more with another viewing. Though as it stands, I do not understand its hype it has received, as I do not feel it is an IMDb top 250 worthy film."

I thought of the 1944 ""Gas Light,"" when Charles Boyer was trying to drive wife Ingrid Bergman insane.That's what this appeared like until reality set in.<br/><br/>For a film regarding mental institutions, we see very little acting out on the part of the inmates."

A island where they treat mentally ill people,we sure ask questions on why was a Cop sent there and what will he find out.<br/><br/>The suspense factor is really chilling and needless to say Leonardo has yet again performed at his best, the acting is so convincing that you get the scares and the chill goes down the spine. Mark has done a exceptional role in supporting the lead actor at the same time without any silly sentiments or dragging the story<br/><br/>The movie starts with the asylum and that's where it stays all along, as we get into the scenes we discover the myths surrounding it and with every new discovery made; we think it is gonna connect the dots, but you need to wait. Also the special effects team has done a exceptional job in choosing the right atmospheric colors and sounds and have made sure we never come out of our shell<br/><br/>The movie is very cleverly paced, some might feel it is slow; but hey we are talking about a Martin Scorsese epic, he induces poison and the dose takes its time to reach your head. By the time it reaches there you are literally blow away and you will be awe-inspired by whats happening after that. I can only say the flash back should have been less confusing and to the point, but once you put the pieces together you realize you have witnessed something special.<br/><br/>I wonder why doesn't Mark choose such meaningful characters maybe he is playing a second fiddle, but he does a damn good job, its characters such as this makes the casting complete. the movie is centered around only these two characters and the findings they come into.

The first 15 minutes or so were good, but everything from that point to the full reveal were boring and monotonous. It wasn't clever in the least. It all felt like a string of ragtag incidents sort of tenuously strung together that really prevented watcher from emotionally connecting with DiCaprio's character.

We see interleafs of torrential rain and driving snow as the detective played by DiCaptrio switches between the present and a past experience at the Dachau death camp. The mixing of his experiences at Dachau and Shutter Island are perfected by special effects images.<br/><br/>Mark Ruffalo, Ben Kingsley, Michelle Willaims, and Max von Sydow add to DiCaprio's impressive performance.<br/><br/>The tone of the movie changes significantly near the midpoint.

","I didn't read the book on which the movie is based. From what I've heard it's a great book . This movie is definitively not great . Anyway , the movie had advantage on me with the fact that I didn't knew anything about the story. The basic facts I knew sounded promising and despite that Scorsese in last years haven't been in good shape , I was still hoping for a good movie. It seems that not always you get what you wish for.<br/><br/>The movie doesn't work for few reasons . First of all – Leonardo DiCaprio . I'm sorry , but he just doesn't fit for a guy with troubled past . He doesn't look manly enough . Also , he overacts too much . He shouts and makes a ""I have troubled past"" face too often . His role required subtlety he just wasn't able to give . William Hurt would be perfect for this type of role.<br/><br/>I don't know was it DiCaprio overacting or Scorsese clumsy direction , but I was able to guess THE BIG TWIST after 40 minutes of the movie . Even if you aren't too clever , you should figure out at least in the half of the movie. If you haven't figure it out till the movie reveals the twist to the audience , it's done in so lame way that my head hurt. The whole revelation feels like Scorsese is explaining the twist to someone retarded. It's annoying and done in terribly amateurish way.<br/><br/>Scorsese directs the movie badly . If I didn't knew that Scorsese was directing this movie , I would thought that it was made by one of those MTV-generation directors , like Bret Rattner. The movie should be dark , scary and emotionally engaging . Yet it comes out as flat , cold and Hollywood type of dark stuff. From what I've heard from the readers of the book they were heartbroken with the ending . Here it comes out emotionally empty . The movie just seems to flow from one scene to another in a soulless way. I was watching it , not experiencing it like I should.<br/><br/>Mark Ruffallo gives a nice performance here , just like Jackie Earle Haley and Max Von Sydow. Ben Kingsley seems to be bored . There is some fine art-direction . The music is annoying. In the end you can follow the second interpretation what really happened . Not that movie is worth re-watch.<br/><br/>I give it 5/10."

","Islands are terrific settings for thrillers. We know it from our own cinematographic experience, and we know we are in claustrophobic territory from the very first scene of this film, with the Shutter Island somewhere out of Boston in the mid-50s appearing in the mist under the gray oppressing skies. In Polanski's previous film or in the first series of Millennium there was a bridge to connect the island with the continent, here there is no bridge and a storm will soon cut any connection with solid ground and any way for the characters to get back to the safety of their routine existence. If there is one.<br/><br/>There are a lot of Hitchcock quotes in this film of Martin Scorsese, we almost may characterize it as a Hitchcock film directed by Scorsese. The setting of the film in the 50s reminds immediately the great films of the master of the suspense from that period, and the main character, a US marshal sent to investigate the impossible disappearance of a patient in a special asylum, where criminals are treated for insanity using modern psychoanalytic methods behaves for a while as one of these Hitchcock heroes whose sanity is placed under doubt, but we know that it is not them but the world around that became crazy, and tries to pull him into its lack of sanity. Is this the case here? Leonardo DiCaprio plays the lead role, I am no fan of his, but I confess to have liked immensely his acting here. In a film where nothing is really what seems to be, where the reality and terms of reference change slowly to be completely swapped by the end, his solid but very nuanced acting is critical and sustains the film from start to end. DiCaprio is present in every scene in the film, because what we see is what he sees, and what he feels starts to infuse into us viewers as the film progresses. His perception of reality becomes ours, his flashbacks bring his past under our eyes, his visions and nightmares end by hunting us.<br/><br/>There are many beautiful scenes in this film, ideas, shots, dialogs that are all memorable. Acting from actors like Ben Kingsley or Max Von Sydow as two of the psychiatrists in the prison-asylum is positioning their characters against the evolution (or is it an involution) of the hero in search of the truth, which becomes a search of his own identity. If I am to explain why I was not completely happy with this film I would maybe blame its duration, the rule of 'way over two hours' which seems to have been legislated in Hollywood lately applies here as well, with no clear benefit. It's maybe a way to say - this is a serious and heavy movie- but there is no need to have said it in this case because the film is serious and catching and the final is hard to forget anyway. Less is better, here is another rule which could have applied. Scorsese makes great films, they need not be excessively long also."

Essentially, (SPOILER COMING) if you like movies where everything you just watched isn't true and is undone RIGHT at the end (Beautiful Mind, Sixth Sense), then you'll love Shutter Island. If you think movies like that are annoying, or (worse) frankly just lazy, (as I do) you'll hate this movie. If I could sum this movie up in one sentence, I'd call it, ""A Beautiful Mind set in an insane asylum"".<br/><br/>As for the acting itself, it's well-enough done, no qualms there. The musical score, however, is often so over-the-top that it's actually comical, rather than setting a suspenseful mood as it obviously intends. In fact, the musical score right at the beginning of the film as the main characters approach Shutter Island, is so overdone that it's somewhat hilarious. Saturday Night Live should really do a spoof of it."

And I also love Marty but this film however was a disappointment. <br/><br/>Leo is a Marshall trying to investigate the disappearance of a mentally ill patient on ""Shutter Island"" which is where most mentally ill patients are being treated by doctors. He comes to the island with his partner and keeps on investigating and investigating until he discovers that there is No patient missing, He's not actually a Marshall or at least not anymore, his partner is in fact his psychiatric and he is a patient on the island which is just as crazy as King George III. <br/><br/>OK, I know the ending is supposed to be a Shock ! and this movie was supposed to be great and we weren't supposed to see it coming but this movie wasn't ""entertaining"" because of the Plot holes and the lacking of explanations, when the film ended I felt I had more Questions left unanswered than more Questions answered. I didn't feel fulfilled, my curiosity wasn't satisfied !<br/><br/>Why ? Why would the doctors try so hard on helping Leo ? And if they were that concerned wouldn't it be easier if they tried to put him in more realistic grounds e.i show him pictures of his previous life and his dead family ? Perhaps brought an old friend over to talk to him, tried to pull him out of the complete state of denial and Schizophrenia that he is in, instead of feeding it more by playing that little drama with him ? How was that supposed to help him ? Apparently their method didn't work because at the end he continued to reject the truth of himself and deny his crime anyway and even a bigger Question why did Leo was put in a Mentally ill institution in the first place ? He killed his wife wasn't he supposed to be put in jail for that ? Putting him on an island filled with mad patients and even madder doctors is guaranteed to drive a sane man crazy ! Yet alone a man who just killed his wife for drowning their kids. <br/><br/>I think it would've made more sense if Leo was an actual Marshall who was sane and who came to investigate the disappearance of a patient and then undercover a secret criminal/inhuman/illegal you name it act towards the patient on the island. Maybe the ending wouldn't have been as SHOCKING but the story would've actually made sense and it would've been more realistic/likable etc...<br/><br/>Skip this movie, Watch The Departed or Gangs of New York these are actually better films that are less depressing and more realistic and if you like those thriller movies I would recommend you watch the sixth Sense since its a great film and there aren't as many plot holes."

","I've seen this movie twice now. This review is my opinion of the movie. Obviously I had no hand in the production. Nor can I read minds on what the makers did hope to show and/or accomplish with this motion picture. And it is a motion picture.<br/><br/>One we've seen in different spaces and different places so many times before. We can relate the story to other templates we know. Troubled but capable man solves mystery. Then we find out he has a closer tie to the mystery than we originally imagined.<br/><br/>The year is 1954. Teddy Daniels is a U.S. Marshal. His newest case is on an isolated island. A mental institution is housed within the Civil War era buildings. The mystery Teddy is here to solve is simple. A woman who drowned her kids escaped the prior night. It becomes more complicated when we learn that her cell was locked from the outside, and she left without even a pair of shoes. As Teddy muses ""We haven't heard the truth once yet."" Teddy is a WW2 veteran. He helped liberate the Dachau concentration camp. He killed a lot of people in the war. His wife, as we learn early, died in a fire. It was the smoke that got her, not the fire. The escape didn't take place at any regular institution. This is Aschliff Asylum for the criminally insane. These are the 'patients' that no other facility can handle. They've harmed or murdered before.<br/><br/>Teddy's only friend is the partner he only met on the ferry onto the island, Chuck. Teddy trusts Chuck enough to let him know that he requested this case specifically. Teddy's wife didn't just die in a fire. It was arson. Andrew Laeddis, the man who set the fire. got away with it. He's finally sentenced to prison for burning down a school, but gets transferred to Ashcliff, then disappeared. Teddy is there to find him. Not to kill him. No. Teddy's had enough of killing. He wants to uncover what's really going at Ashcliff. Because prisoners don't just disappear, and Teddy's informant has told him of dangerous surgeries done in secrecy. Teddy is there to blow the lid off this place.<br/><br/>Tortured dreams of his wife haunt his nights. But she's leading him. Telling him the arsonist is alive and somewhere on Shutter Island. Teddy saw things in the war. Horrible world-breaking things. He lost his wife.<br/><br/>Shutter Island is his chance. From my own service overseas and the loss of loved ones in my life, Teddy's journey was mine. I want him to succeed so much. He's got a mystery here to solve and it's not an escaped patient. There's more going on. In the end Teddy can't succeed. There are two scenes in this movie that stand out as some of the best filmmaking has to offer. Teddy's first dream sequence and his conversation with the wonderful Jackie Earle Haley as George Noyce. In that scene, Noyce tells Teddy that he has to let go of his late wife or he'll never get off this island.<br/><br/>I knew he wouldn't. I knew he couldn't. I know he'd spend the rest of his life on that island from the beginning. I know because I'm stuck on my own Shutter Island. I wish it really was as simple as finding Andrew Laeddis. I wish it were as simple as blowing the lid of the place. But as Teddy discovered, Andrew Laeddis is the last thing we want to find."

The first half I wait and wait until something special happens. Then the plot is for me not hot enough to get adrenalin. Even the end let me cold and I could only shake my head. The story was even predictable that from the running time of two hours they could have cut at least 30 minutes. Director Martin Scorsese is the specialist to expand movies as he did already in The Aviator or Goodfellas and I definitely don't like extra long films. <br/><br/>One sequence remembered me the cartoon of Tom and Jerry playing in the mysterious castle where the brain of the dog is switched in the cat or the sound of bird takes over the elephant and so on if you know what I mean.<br/><br/>The dialogs were well adapted to the Fifties and Leonardo Di Caprio delivered here one of his best performance. Ben Kingsley is back again and was very believable in his role. Visually it was good too and the scenery well chosen. Avoid this overrated movie except if you are a Di Caprio fan. See instead the other lighthouse thrillers MURDERS BY NUMBERS or HALF LIGHT.<br/><br/>5/10."
"austynphillips","2","2","5","25 July 2010"," not too bad
","shutter island has a good story and everything but the way it looks cheaply made and how the characters act is way too stupid. For example the tomb scene that was very corny.Also when the wife is talking in his dreams its just stupid. But don't get me wrong there's good parts too,like the lighthouse scene that was awesome,i also like the noir type theme. yes i agree with everyone else its not as scary as i expected,and this is coming from a person who's not a fan of scary movies.Shutter island also is a little hard to keep up with but after the movie when you put the pieces together you'll start to understand it.Well all in all shutter island is good with the story and twist but effects and character acting is not that good <br/><br/>2 of 10"
"peter-bruck","7","2","5","13 July 2010"," Deja vu all over again
","It isn't even a real spoiler anymore to state that a modern mystery thriller has got another ""alter ego""- plot point in the end. Oh, how surprising. The main character finds out that the he himself is Tyler Durden/a dead guy with a hole in the stomach/a bunch of people in a motel/the author of the mysterious book/the house ghost/the invisible friend of his daughter/John Turturro wearing a stupid head... Yeah, it's deja vu all over again. Shutter Island is a decent, exciting horror thriller. Scorsese and all the fine actors from Leo to Ted Levine, from Mark Ruffalo to Max von Sydow, from Carol Lynch to Patricia Clarkson, they did a damn fine job. The only flaw is that it ends the same way thrillers end since 1998. So one more time, let's say it all together: BORING!"
"the_drifter","6","2","5","11 July 2010"," The Ninth Configuration is back...
","This movie is terribly similar to The Ninth Configuration (1980), written and directed by William Peter Blatty (of The Exorcist). Although set in a different location and time, it is basically the same story. I quite liked this one, but much prefer The Ninth Configuration for being the 'original'.<br/><br/>I noticed a few continuity mishaps in the filming at the beginning of the movie, and cannot relate them to the story that later unravels. Being Scorcese as meticulous as he usually is, I have to accept that he made them on purpose... but cannot understand such purpose.<br/><br/>Dicaprio is only OK. I was delighted to see von Sydow again! Kingsley plays himself, as usual. Ruffalo is good.<br/><br/>Don't have more to say. I hope that the length is enough. Why worry about comments' lengths, IMDb?"
"E-un","2","2","5","27 June 2010"," Very Poor Effort
","I don't have much to say about this movie at all. I felt that the storytelling was amateurish at best. The scenes were hacked together in such a poor fashion, and the clues to the ending were so blatant. I worked out the premise of the movie about 8-15 minutes in. Sure, I wasn't absolutely certain at that point, but once I reached my conclusion the 'clues' came thicker, faster, and so blatant they were right in my face. After 30 minutes I had no further doubts that I'd nailed it. It's not so much that I'm so awesome at guessing movie plots, but more about how badly put together this story happens to be.<br/><br/>Without giving too much away, the initial scene on the boat tipped me off right away that something was off. The scene were they arrive at the island contained some more heavy-handed clues. The dead giveaway though, was the way that later scenes did not fit together coherently. The second or third dream sequence lasted too long for a conventional depiction of a dream, and I felt that we were supposed to lose track of what was real and what was fantasy/dreaming.<br/><br/>Overall, I was very disappointed following some rave reviews. This movie has been made before, and it's been made much better."
"fredww","4","2","5","14 June 2010"," Confusing story line and erratic scene transitions
","While the hypothesis of this film is a good one to speculate about, the implementation of the story in this film generates confusion and disappointment in viewers. Various scenes jump the protagonist from one location to another with any real motivation and poor, unrealistic transition. To lay the jumble of feelings and memories presented by the characters as simply mental illness is also inconsistent with realism. Finally, no real satisfaction comes from the story ending, not that it had to be happy, but at least worthy of the buildup generated by the story line. A better treatment of this material would contain more background of the protagonist as the story winds down to its conclusion. The invention of non-existent characters to supplement the story line should be avoided in favor of better documented understanding from more objective sources such as newspaper reports or discussions by characters clearly illustrated as being outside observers."

"jzappa","9","2","5","2 June 2010"," ""There's No Moral Order As Pure As This Storm.""
","Shutter Island begins encircling us with the first sinister notes even under Paramount's logo. Like the ensuing film, they're menacing. This is Martin Scorsese's haunted house movie, given the insatiable quivering apprehension we sense when thrillers don't defuse all the suspense with action sequences. He's a master of accompanying image with music. This is one of his very most effective endeavors in music placement. He seizes the piano and strings of a minor piece by Mahler for every drop of its sensory character, waxes Kubrick with Penderecki's dissonant clusters, finds parallels with John Cage's hypnotic incoherence, the steady tonal pulse of Ingram Marshall.<br/><br/>Shutter is an obscure, jagged island off Boston, where a Civil War fort has been acclimated to a prison for the criminally insane. We close in by boat under descending skies with Marshals Teddy and Chuck, played by the strikingly symbiotic duo of Leonardo DiCaprio and Mark Ruffalo. They're to inspect the vanishing of a childkiller. There appears to be no way to escape the island alive. The evasion of one prisoner might not necessitate the involvement of Feds unacquainted with the circumstances, but we never question that element. Not after the foreboding enclosures of the prison appear, the investigators guided into the office of Dr. Cawley, played by Ben Kingsley with that ominous charisma he's gotten down cold in his career's latter half, continually deflecting all Gandhi-typecasting.<br/><br/>Experiencing the novel before the film was my mistake. It took four theater viewings to completely separate the two. The film's more lavish, much less concise than the unfolding, and especially closing, of the book, but there are stunning additions by Laeta Kalogridis that flood the film with thematic alarm bells, making it resonate more deeply and pensively than even the revelatory rattling of the novel. Scorsese chisels through the real world inch after inch. It's plain that Teddy has no notion of what he's getting into. The premise seems elementary: The woman's missing, Teddy and Chuck will search. But the frigid concrete walls ensnare them. The offices of Cawley and staff, equipped for war commanders, look thinly modernized from silent Fritz Lang or Robert Wiede films. Flashbacks convey Teddy's torturous experiences since WWII, which provided classic noir's bleak percussion. Shellshock could be seen in men struggling to appear self-assured in their veneers of undistinguished outfits, heavy smoking, fedoras worn low. DiCaprio and Ruffalo both assume this appearance. While Ruffalo purposely seems more like a disposition than a character, DiCaprio fittingly makes it feel more like a buoyant front.<br/><br/>DiCaprio commands some astonishing emotional scenes, modulating sharply between suspicion, aggression, bewilderment, agony. Had Paramount not postponed the release to a less Oscar-wary date, DiCaprio would doubtlessly be nominated. Indeed, the entire cast is outstanding in performances so unusual in substance. Many are figments, double-blinds, imposters, even mere functionaries. But all color Teddy's journey so dynamically. Michelle Williams effectively embodies a broken dream. Ted Levine inhabits an ominous duality as the Warden, who arguably may define the loonies-running-the-asylum cliché, but is he so loony? Maybe he's seeing more clearly than everyone else. Patricia Clarkson looks so unlike herself, possibly because her scene seems so convincing, yet so off-kilter. Emily Mortimer and Jeffrey Dean Morgan could be all Teddy's looking for, yet both baffle and intimidate him, and us.<br/><br/>There's a flashback merged with a dream that may be the closest Scorsese has ever brought me to tears. He uses Max Richter's tender strings, loss literally raining all around Teddy and the wife that'll only be real, in his arms, for another few moments. Scorsese's never done a scene remotely as surreal, or romantic, before. It's astounding seeing him extend his breadth into untapped territory. Indeed the film's foremost impact is on one's senses. It's a premonition of disquieting enigmas: How did this woman escape from a locked cell in a sealed ward, its panels able to endure cannons? Why do Cawley and the dubious Dr. Naering, played by 81-year-old Max Von Sydow---who I'd still dare not mess with---feel like they're lying? Why do the prison's practices spark Teddy's flashbacks to freeing Dachau? These sorts of wringers are at film noir's core. Characters never enter a noir without some major burden. They have unresolved dilemmas, submerged anguish. Nevertheless, why are the others so odd? Kingsley tastefully bleeds intimidation whenever he smiles, then mixes his signals with kindly etiquette so gracefully that he might as well be wiping off the menace with a silk handkerchief. Not to mention two supporting actors, most memorably psychopaths in Zodiac and The Silence of the Lambs, here play lawmen.<br/><br/>There's electrifying imagery in Shutter Island. There's a lighthouse, a cave on a cliff, dizzying falls to waves pounding on rocks below. A storm draws nigh. Light drips through clouds. The wind seems sorrowful. That's what the movie is: Ambiance, foreshadowing, the deterioration of Teddy's self-assurance, even selfhood. Scorsese induces pure dread, in various keys. Sculpting Robert Richardson's grandiose, angular, intensely colorful cinematography is Thelma Schoonmaker's trademark use of manipulated speeds, freeze-frames, those dang flashbulbs, as well as the ever more discriminating and poetic use of the cut from one shot to another that we always find in Scorsese's work.<br/><br/>Some either think the ending doesn't hold water or the movie building towards it doesn't. What would be more gratifying? Compared to other films with similar twists, Shutter Island is much more understated, without the urge to repeat earlier moments for redundant effect during the revelation, which instead is played gradually, dawning on us. This is all of a story, even the pieces that don't seem to click. One's inclination is to distinguish what goes before, and make rational deductions. However, what if you can't peg precisely what went before? What if there were concealed things about various characters? What if the movie's perspective isn't objective but splintered? Where can it all go? We wonder. So does Teddy."

"blacklist-1","10","2","5","23 April 2010"," A masterpiece. A conspiracy and psychological thriller that will have you hooked.
","Shutter Island for me is the years best film so far. Leonardo Decaprio gives an outstanding performance as US Marshall Teddy Daniels set in 1954. Him and his partner Chuck Aule played excellently by Mark Ruffalo are on their way to Shutter Island, a closed off psychiatric prison for the criminally insane. Teddy and Chuck have been set to investigate the disappearance of a female prisoner who has escaped though the guards or doctors don't know how she escaped from the room. Arriving at the prison Scorsese sets up the tone of a dark, disturbing and mysterious place using non-diegetic sound and a haunting music score (one of the scariest I have heard) to deliberately unsettle us and it dosen't help when Teddy and Chuck have to surrender their firearms at the main gate. As Teddy and Chuck investigate the prisoner's disappearance their investigation leads them to believe there may be a sixty seventh (being only sixty sixth) in the first place. He begins to believe that the doctors and guards are conspiring in a conspiracy when they prove less than co-operative particularly the head doctor Crawley a superb part played by Ben Kingsley.<br/><br/>Meanwhile as the investigation progresses Teddy and Chuck are shut off from the mainland due to a thunderstorm and Teddy has disturbing dreams of his dead wife and seeing images of dead children, which leaves him on a short fuse as also he is a recovering alcoholic. As the film progresses things get stranger and you know something is going on. This is fantastically told film with a complex plot (and a twist in the last half hour that shocked me to the core) superb acting and intelligent dialogue and script. Decaprio has been severely criticised by some for his acting but this is the best performance I have ever seen him give (even better than in Titanic) and he deserves at least an Oscar nomination. Shutter Island is an intriguing and complex thriller that will keep you guessing to the end with excellently acting and making. This is a masterpiece and will remain if the not the best then one of the best movies of the year and ever. If you like intellectual stimulation or a challenging mystery. I implore you to see this. Outstanding."
"jonnyfendi","8","2","5","17 April 2010"," Scorsese Scores Again! (Thiz Review Contains Spoiler)
","""Shutter Island"" seems to be an appropriate vessel for Leonardo DiCaprio to explore his acting skill. It's quite good, but yet it's not the finest, but I still can say thiz performance might be one of his best works so far. DiCaprio collaborates the fourth time with the Director Martin Scorsese, the last three are ""Gangs of New York"" (2002), ""The Aviator"" (2004) and ""The Departed"" (2006). Scorsese himself is a very good drama Director. His previous memorable classics are ""Taxi Driver"" (1976), ""Raging Bull"" (1980) and ""Goodfellas"" (1990). It's about US Marshall named Teddy Daniels (DiCaprio) comes to an island to investigate a mysterious case. The island is actually a prison facility for mental illness. Thiz movie is supported by heavy caliber Cast members such as Ben Kingsley, Mark Rufallo, Mark Von Sydow, Jackie Earle Haley and Michelle Williams. The script of thiz movie is very fine with several twist and turns. Scorsese with all his experiences successfully arranges every scene effectively. The exploration is classic, we even could see ""Hitchcock"" atmosphere here. The Score also helps a lot to build such an intensive tension. The great example when is on the opening scene, when Daniels and his partner just arrive on the island for the first time. When they observe the surrounding that is preserved with maximum securities, the gates is opened one by one. At a glance it's just an ordinary scene, but the Score multiplies it into ten times more thrill. The twist ending is meant to be shocking. But unfortunately (Spoiler Alert!), I already see the pattern where the story might goes even in the middle of the movie. When a conversation between Daniels and Rachel (Patricia Clarkson) that takes place in a cave, Daniels said angrily, ""I am an US Marshall. No one can stop me!"". That is the first time when I clearly know that he is actually one of the patients. In the end, if we have a movie that every scene is put in for a reason. That is the time when you got yourself an effective and flawless movie. Scorsese scores again! <br/><br/>Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE : http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com"

And further, going back watching his older movies they also seem way better then the first time I watched them with my younger eyes, like an escalation chart. He is some sort of my generation. Psychological simplified view related to movie ""psycho"" subject would be then - I am also getting older, so apparently somehow I hated myself when I was younger. This movie is excellent, superb atmosphere, times in 50's described just the way I expected them to be described 15 years before I was born ... in times, which are just 10 years after the WWII. Martin Scorcese made another masterpiece ! Ben Kingsley is not the guy you would typically trust (except for his role in Ghandi), neither Max von Sydow, a synonym for bad guy or at least a complex personality. However Scorcese managed to fool us with their exhaustive help. Just excellent. I am giving 9 of out 10, leaving some room for next Scorcese movie."

","Bite me for watching it only to fill my Loe-hunger! haha. And...for the fact that Leo paired with Martin Scorsese always made a good movie. Since Gangs of New York to finally set an Oscar in The Departed. Now another psychological thriller, breath-taking journey in an asylum scenes. Leo plays U.S Marshall Teddy Daniels who was in 1954 went to Ashecliff Hospital with his partner, Chuck Aule (Mark Rufallo) to investigate the disappearance of Rachel Solando (Emily Mortimer), a patient who vanished from a locked room. The hospital itself located in a cluster island called Shutter Island. There they meet the head psychiatrist, Dr. John Cawley (Ben Kingsley), who's suspicious enough to make our Marshall suspect him of doing something unusual to patients inside the hospital. Later soon they claimed they've found Rachel, but Teddy insisted they must have hid something else inside the place. So he continue his investigation, along with his strong will to find his wife's killer who was said already sent there, but nothing related to him was ever found in the hospital. Emerges to uncover the conspiracy, along with fear and the urge of finding his wife's killer, bring Teddy to the edge of his sanity itself.<br/><br/>At the end, Scorsese rewarded you with a beautiful twist which I already guessed ^^'. But as an adaptation from a famous novel of same title by David Lehane, this movie sure worth to watch. Leo's act, as usual, never failed me. He plays this fragile Marshall even more than just 'very well'. And Mark Rufallo as a sidekick isn't bad at all. In fact, almost all casts played beautifully here. One thing, I admire how Scorsese put the first person point-of-view into a great visual adventure for us. He even successfully made us questioned our own sanity, like it could happen to any of us is many ways. But I think it will be just perfect if he also develop its mysterious surrounding area a lil'bit more, or bringing even greater thrill to our throat by taking a little attention to the doctors and workers around them. But I guess since it is indeed Teddy's own journey to follow, I can take it nicely.<br/><br/>In the end, I suggest you to bring extra food as the movie is a bit slow and action-less. You who doesn't like drama or psychological thriller might get bored. But trust me, it's definitely worth the sacrifice. He's Leonardo DiCaprio afterall ^.*"
"DICK STEEL","8","2","5","7 April 2010"," A Nutshell Review: Shutter Island
","It's easy to get all riled up over the latest Martin Scorsese film starring his recent favourite actor of choice, Leonardo DiCaprio. After all, the destination is something of a big wool pulled over your eye, but as the saying goes, it's never the destination but the journey itself, and Scorsese pulls off a mighty fine psychological thriller whose horrific elements aren't what we get from the trailer with its chop-socky boo-moments, but were a lot more cerebral, tying in very closely with the entire feel of the film.<br/><br/>In some ways, Scorsese helmed this film to Hitchcockian proportions, and constructed a tight mystery thriller which to my surprise, still had a lot going despite one knowing how it would end, either being a reader of the novel by Dennis Lehane (which I am not), or through the many clues that simply pepper the film from start to finish. There were some jarring moments which I thought pared down to bad editing by Thelma Schoonmaker, or wondered if Scorsese was being very slipshod in bridging cut scenes or continuity laced with perturbing errors, but all these were played out for a reason, and by the time the final reel unspools, the dust will settle.<br/><br/>Which I felt was perfect in getting you under the skin of DiCaprio's Teddy Daniels, a US Federal Marshal assigned to the titular Shutter Island which houses a mental institution for the criminally insane, because one of the inmates, or patients as Chief Psychiatrist Dr Cawley (Ben Kingsley) insists they are called, have simply vanished through the walls, and a search has been deemed futile. Together with new partner Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo), the federal marshals soon stumble upon an uncooperative lot in the facility, coupled with the usual crazies who play on your mind with their various testimonies.<br/><br/>And to make it a wee bit complex, there's a brewing hurricane that prevents our cops from leaving, Teddy's visions of his dead wife coming back to haunt him, and a growing conspiracy that involves inhumane experiments that those in power allow to happen clandestinely to be performed for the advancement of neuroscience, and to create almost zombie-like perfect killers/soldiers ala The Manchurian Candidate. As mentioned, the narrative sucks you in and keeps you engaged, though some parts because they can get repetitive (remember, it's all for a reason), may hang you out to dry if you're not paying close attention.<br/><br/>DiCaprio has grown from strength to strength as an actor, and frankly, he almost single- handedly made this film work. Without his charismatic presence and fine performance, many elements presented in Shutter Island may not be pulled off successfully, since it relied heavily on the actor playing Teddy Daniels to really show a vast range of ability, and more importantly, to make you feel for him totally in his predicament to dig deep and discover just what hanky-panky is going on in the island, while haunted by many ghosts from the past. There were some physical scenes which were obvious a stuntman had taken over, but no substitutes can be used for his dramatic moments of course.<br/><br/>The supporting cast also put up a commanding performance, from Ben Kingsley and Mark Ruffalo, to Max con Sydow, Michelle Williams, Emily Mortimer and Jackie Earle Haley. Talk about a star-studded casting against a very gritty and scary backdrop, boosted by very nifty special effects when the narrative calls for it. And for those who prefer their horror in old fashioned terms, there are, in my opinion, eerie images enough to shock and make your goosebumps stand, thanks to anticipation being build, plus the actual deliverables that gave me the creeps.<br/><br/>So climb onboard the ferry to Shutter Island, and allow the latest Martin Scorsese-Leonardo DiCaprio vehicle to bring you on a slow brewing mystery ride that straddles the fine line between fantasy and reality, complete with plenty of discussions on the mind and sanity check. Incidentally, the next DiCaprio film out later this Summer, also deals with the cerebral, and helmed by Christopher Nolan. Now that is something I want to see, but in the meantime, an excursion to Shutter Island is recommended."

","I watched this movie in three sessions, with a day apart between each..perhaps thats the reason I could find no coherence in the story. I have this sneaking feeling that people tend to overrate movies for reasons like a famous director, a plot that many would struggle to fully comprehend (so if they couldn't fully understand it, therefore it must be a high brow movie deserving of a high rating!), a famous actor and so on. Truth be told, this movie, if honestly rated by persons to whom neither Sorcese of Di Caprico names meant nothing, would have got a far lower rating. The plot line, while reasonably original, just doesn't ring true. Also, without a strong female lead, the onus of carrying the 2hours + story fell upon the otherwise capable shoulders of Mr. di Caprico...all in all, not a movie thats going to further the reputations of either Socrese or De C. Watch it if you will, but don't go and make an evening out of it, rent a bluray and watch it if you must.

"yris2002","6","2","5","4 April 2010"," Great shooting and acting, but a disappointing plot
","Suspense and thrill will not lack (will abound, indeed) in this movie, not so much in the action performed, but in what you expect to happen: an effective and consolidated stratagem to keep the audience attention alive. But in the end, all that well built tension and intriguing atmosphere turn into nothing. The different and apparently fragmented plot levels (medical experimentation on humans, Nazi references, the death of Teddy's wife) seem to be leading to a deep final revelation, which in the end is reduced to a very cliché ending, really not deserving all that build up.<br/><br/>I have not read the novel, but know that the movie proved adherence to it, so no fault is to be found in Scorsese's work, who, in a way, put too much technical skill for a plot which did not deserve such effort. Also Di Caprio, brilliant as usual, offers too a focused, tragic and important interpretation. Good photography also gets to offer a scary and enthralling atmosphere, but in the end, every technical quality seems somehow wasted on a banal and cliché plot. Not that a movie should have an original ending twist to be a good movie, but such emotional intensity, and length (it takes almost two hours to get till the end), should come to a deeper or at least less banal conclusion.<br/><br/>As a whole, it would be not fair to judge the movie in a negative way: great quality is evident in shooting and acting (but Scorsese and Di Caprio are a certainty of excellence), but what prevails is disappointment and a sense of wasted energy, put by the director and the cast, and requested to the viewer."

That said, he can also release the odd turkey. The Age of Innocence & The Aviator spring to mind.<br/><br/>Shutter Island, I'm sad to say, belongs in the latter category! It's not that this is the worst film ever,(it's not even the worst film you'll see this year) but it's distinctly average; which for a director of Scorsese's pedigree is unforgivable! Di Caprio doesn't give the best performance of his life, but he's not helped by the slow, plodding script.<br/><br/>Even Ben Kingsley(Gandhi, Schindler's List) couldn't stop Shutter Island from labouring on, lost in its own mediocrity, until the predictable ending! So called 'psychological thrillers' are supposed to keep you guessing until the coup de grâce twist when it reaches its climax, but this 'twist' was evident(if not downright obvious) from a third of the way through. The outcome was actually so apparent, that I was convinced that Scorsese was leading us down a false path, only to blow our minds with a shattering revelation in the finale.<br/><br/>It wasn't to be though, as we were 'treated' to a pedestrian finish that left a bland taste in the mouth. If you like style over substance, & to have story lines spoon-fed to you, then this could well be your kind of film. If, however, you prefer to be kept guessing, and to actually have to think, then it may not be your cup of tea!"
"david-phillips-4","8","2","5","30 March 2010"," This will get you thinking!
","Based on the novel by Dennis Lehane (Mystic River), Shutter Island tells the story of 1950's US Marshall Teddy Daniels (DiCaprio) as he and his new partner Chuck (Mark Ruffalo) as they head to Shutter Island, a mental institute for the criminally insane, to find an escaped in-mate.<br/><br/>All is not what it seems on the foreboding Shutter Island: the staff, led by a particularly creepy (SIR!) Ben Kingsley, seem almost reluctant to help the case progress and are seem almost conspiratorial with the inmates to cloud the investigation. On top of this, Daniels himself has another agenda for being involved involving his murdered wife.<br/><br/>All of which weaves a tangled web that really get the grey matter working, especially if, like me, you are inclined to enjoy the challenge of keeping pace with the detective in a detective story. The movie is very much in a similar vein to Scorsese's Cape Fear remake, complete with a seriously imposing score, sweeping camera moves and scene compositions that comfortably straddle Film Noir and thrillers from the 50's stylistics. <br/><br/>Whilst the cast are adequate in what they do, the movie really belongs to Scorsese. The look and sound of the movie is entrenched in Cape Fear territory, but the atmosphere of the movie is much more akin to Polanski's paranoia classics Repulsion and Rosemary's Baby. It is credit to Scorsese that this side to the movie is the most apparent and helps entwine the viewer in the tangled web that is Shutter Island. There seems to me to be a real focus on Scorsese's vision for the movie and the result is indelibly stamped as a Scorsese movie much more than it will ever be a DiCaprio movie.<br/><br/>DiCaprio does cope well with his role and one thing that DiCaprio does so well that many of his contemporaries cannot is show genuine vulnerability. Although, I personally find him to still look a little too young-looking and not grizzled enough to play characters such as Daniels, this reservation was lost once Shutter Island came into view.<br/><br/>The movie will have you revisiting themes and scenes long after the titles roll and it is certainly a movie to discuss afterwards rather than file away as 2 hours of escapism. The movie also invites a second viewing, although I think a DVD/blu-ray with a director's commentary would be my own viewing choice.<br/><br/>www.writeronthestorm.wordpress.com"

","I had heard that this movie was a disappointment... I even had the ending ruined for me about a month before it came out. Both of those things kept me from seeing it until I could catch it on PPV.<br/><br/>I have to say that not only was this film not a disappointment in any way, but the fact that I 'knew' what the ending was didn't detract from the experience at all. <br/><br/>Scorcese was really masterful at weaving a story that is absolutely engrossing and thrilling without resorting to creepy effects or obvious scare tactics (which would have been the cheap and easy way to tell this story). It was wonderful and refreshing, to say the least, to watch a genuinely interesting thriller that takes place at a secluded mental institution and not have to endure shock scenes of ghoulish creatures or other overused devices like that. <br/><br/>I've read some of the bad reviews and critiques, and I honestly have to say that I don't understand what they're on about at all. Its a great movie."
"ackstasis","9","2","5","23 March 2010"," ""It's as if she evaporated, straight through the walls""
","Most psychological thrillers of late, stylistically, have been somewhat cold and clinical – I'm thinking along the lines of Nolan's 'Memento (2000)' and Anderson's 'The Machinist (2004).' The last thriller I can recall with a dazzling colour palette was David Fincher's 'Se7en (1995).' Yet, compared to this film, 'Shutter Island (2010)' has an incredible gracefulness about it. Martin Scorsese has spoken many times of his love for Powell and Pressburger (particularly 'The Red Shoes (1948)'), and this film seems like a very deliberate, and worthy, attempt to mimic the lush visual style of Jack Cardiff's unforgettable Technicolor cinematography. There's a potential problem in painting a thriller film with such warm, inviting colours; the viewer is embraced, rather than repelled, by what he sees. This, however, is exactly what 'Shutter Island' aims for. The audience is thrust into the mind of Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio), and his perception of the world becomes our reality.<br/><br/>Teddy Daniels is a Federal Marshall sent to an isolated Alcatraz-like penitentiary to investigate the disappearance of a female prisoner/mental patient. While battling personal demons of his own, Teddy must get to the bottom of an impossible mystery, all the while faced with hostility from the island authorities. A friend of mine noted that Scorsese was probably inspired by 'The Shining (1980),' and one might cite the use of György Ligeti (one of Kubrick's composers of choice) as evidence for this. However, 'The Shining' was, stylistically, a cold and sterile film, John Alcott's cinematography eerily detached from the horrors perpetrated in the Overlook Hotel. No, Scorsese's primary inspiration was The Archers, and his use of lush, brooding colours and lighting is unforgettably atmospheric {perhaps the closest same-genre reference-point would be Roger Corman's Technicolor Poe adaptations, such as 'The Masque of the Red Death (1964)'}.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, thanks to the inherent dangers of trawling the internet, I entered the film already aware of its ending. In any case, Scorsese seems uninterested in orchestrating the typical ""gotcha!"" narrative twist that is common to the genre. Even from the outset, the disturbance of the leading character is evident, the viewer frequently a party to his painful delusions. For most of the film's running time, we are quite happy to go along with Teddy, willing to believe his conspiracy theories. We expect to be deceived by the supporting characters, and resolve to see through their deceptions. Then something happens: the film tells us that we've been wrong, and we switch paths. All of a sudden, as he sat thoughtfully on the steps, I felt oddly distant from Teddy Daniels, his previously well-founded theories now dismissed as the musings of a mad-man. Are we, the audience, really that easy to sway? Have we just betrayed a perfectly sane man?"
"eli-ass","6","2","5","17 March 2010"," Well made but quite disappointing ...
","Scorsese is one of the best directors out there and since he has created some true masterpieces in the past I was so keen to watch his newest work 'Shutter Island'. My expectations for this movie were incredibly high which maybe resulted in even bigger disappointment. This movie was - in my opinion - not the next masterpiece that i wish it would be.<br/><br/>Once again Scorsese's main character is played by Leonardo DiCaprio with whom he worked the fourth(?) time in a row now. And yes - the whole cast in this movie is doing a good job. Scorsese could also provide a really well directed movie for sure. There are some great images and good camera work in this film.<br/><br/>The big problem that the movie has is in its plot. I wont give anything away from it but what really bothered me is the way the story develops. The pace is pretty slow and as I'm looking back there are not many scenes i can remember. No real highlights throughout most of the film. Also the lack of suspense - there was no time in the theater when i was frightened or anything like it ... it goes on and on with lots of dialog and some - really cool - flashbacks to the past of the main character but does not really get anywhere with it.<br/><br/>While the ending itself is pretty good again and saved some credit points for the movie it just doesn't work. What a pity because it seems like the whole movie relies entirely on it... The reason it doesn't work is simply because you already got the main ""twist"" half into the movie and you are not really impressed when it finally happens though there are some cool details and kind of a second little twist at the very end.<br/><br/>All in all it was a bit of a mess, doesn't really work as a psycho-thriller and though it was well made it did not entertain me a lot. <br/><br/>See it or skip it? Well I'm not sad that i saw it but i don't think you have to see it ... maybe rent it for less money when it comes out and give it a try. Cheers.<br/><br/>6/10"

","For American standards, this is a relatively difficult film, with an elliptical narrative, ""dead"" spaces, ornate direction, slow pacing, and so forth. It is also very uneven, tense and claustrophobic on one hand, but with lots of ups and downs on the other. At it's best, it is very intense, at it's worst, it is downright flat and predictable, and hardly helped by the anemic meaning.<br/><br/>First things first. As a director, Scorsese is probably at his finest here, which is good. Compared to, say, Coppola, he is still evolving, which is the sign of a healthy artist. He is still not an auteur, but this is overall his best direction.<br/><br/>Now, the little trick of having two realities warping around each other is borrowed by David Lynch, and is hardly causing any sort of sensation anymore. The ending with the lobotomy is also borrowed from Gilliam's ""Brazil"", as is the whole message in general, that in turn is borrowed from Orwell's ""1984"". The message here is that of a society evolving from the ghosts of a brutal World War II, that is seemingly democratic, but in reality authoritarian and artificial. The subtle references about McCarthyism are nice, but actually the whole message is rather vague, and in the end serves as a pretense for a claustrophobic existential thriller."

","As the U.S. Marshals depart from Boston Harbor towards the isolated island that houses the Ashecliffe hospital for the criminally insane, the background music of the vessel's horns, the eerie mist and the uneasy countenance on them confirms that Martin Scorcese is going to squirm our thrill seeking minds....<br/><br/>Author Dennis Lehane, whose notable works include Mystic River and Gone Baby Gone, provides the source for Scorcese's 4th and latest venture with Hollywood's finest – Leonardo Dicaprio. Shutter Island is a mind-bending, complex and multisided thriller that toys with your inquisitive side before revealing its dark form. U.S. Marshall Teddy Daniels (DiCaprio) along with his new partner Chuck (Mark Ruffalo) are heading for the island to investigate the disappearance of a dangerous patient named Rachel Solando from Ashecliffe, aided by Dr. Cawley (Ben Kingsley). They are in a time when lobotomy surgery, inhuman drug experiments, mind-control conspiracies, the threat from the Hydrogen bomb and the after- effects of world war II have become the cause for insanity among several. Their investigation through interviews of other patients is a tiring psychological exercise that divulges little truth while the autocratic approach of Dr. Naehring(Max Von Sydow) restricts access to vital information. Frustrated and torn in disbelief, Daniels confronts the doctors in a futile stand against the authority on the island asylum. Teddy's apprehensions about the island's horrifying mysteries lead him to surprises that arise after the devastating hurricane shatters the island's structured order. The ensuing chaos is where he finds strands of truth for his convictions but in this quest, do things appear as they are or is he beguiled by the Hospital's secrets?<br/><br/>Leonardo Dicaprio's renews his status of being the best in the business with Shutter Island. Playing Teddy Daniels required him to portray multiple characteristics that changed with the circumstances in the story. His keen understanding of the role and submersion into the director's vision enabled him to deliver such a stellar performance. Mark Ruffalo is commendable as Chuck while Ben Kingsley delivers the right amount of composure that looks convincing as a Doctor of the criminally insane patients. Watch them all together in the lighthouse where the truth is revealed through some very powerful performances. The rest of the cast that played Dolores, Rachel(s), George Noyce and Naehring leave quite an impact that blends with the film's turbulent theme of misdirection and evil. <br/><br/>Shutter Island is a chilling thriller. The surprises keep coming and even if one has read the book or knows its suspense, Scorcese's direction can easily hold you to your seats with a great screenplay by Kalogridis. The cinematography brilliantly captures the essence of 1954 while portraying nature's wrath on the island during the hurricane. This is one of the rare adaptations of a novel that is executed page-by-page with the same depiction of every character, building, structure, plant, color, storm, cave and cliff that was visualized by the reader. To that, Scorcese adds his distinct style in Teddy's recurring flashbacks during the war and his last moments with his wife. Scorcese's display of blood looks artistic compared to the screen splattering in Tarantino's movies. Certainly there is a reason why the 40 film old director has a Golden eye behind his black frames. <br/><br/><ul><li>8.508 on a scale of 1-10.</li></ul>"
"Jonny_Numb","8","2","5","21 February 2010"," Insanity Island
","Late in ""Shutter Island,"" Martin Scorsese's adaptation of Dennis Lehane's head-spinner of a novel, weary U.S. Marshal Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) and the Warden (Ted Levine) of the Ashecliffe Institute (which rests on the titular isle) share a conversation on God, nature, and violence while in a moving jeep. Scorsese ingeniously blocks the scene so that all we see are the two men conversing and the spring foliage passing by, as if our characters are being propelled toward the inevitable not by a motor vehicle, but by fatalistic machinations beyond their control.<br/><br/>Applying decades of film-making experience to a genre he's less known for (save for the 1991 remake of ""Cape Fear""), Scorsese uses this initial element of surprise to, well, SURPRISE us. Continuously. With modern thrillers relying on fickle, manipulative twists as the sole justification for their being, ""Shutter Island"" (which faithfully ports over a staggering majority of Lehane's characters, plot, and dialog) digs deep into the psychosis of its characters, using the isolated island and its damaged inhabitants as a greater metaphor for a world in which madness reigns (the film is set in 1954, subtly using the Red Scare to extend this theme).<br/><br/>In the opening shot, a ferry slowly emerges from a white, all-encompassing fog; on board are Daniels and his new partner, Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo), two Marshals who have been assigned to locate Rachel Solando (Emily Mortimer), a murderess who has inexplicably escaped from Ashecliffe. Through a series of imposing, wide-angle shots and knowingly ominous musical cues, Scorsese sets an overwhelming tone of dread and isolation before our protagonists even get off the boat, and almost sustains it for ""Shutter Island""'s entirety. The island is populated by a brilliantly-chosen collection of character actors (most leaving big impressions with only a few lines of dialog): Ben Kingsley (as the evasive Dr. Cawley), Max von Sydow (advocate of brain-surgery-as-clinical-cure Dr. Naehring), John Carroll Lynch (as head of island security), and Levine are quite smooth as administrators and law enforcement, conveying unarticulated jagged edges through stoic stares and subtle mannerisms. The patients themselves range from the seemingly normal males and females of Wards A and B, to the scar-faced terrors of the penitentiary-like Ward C (including Jackie Earle Haley and Elias Koteas).<br/><br/>While Scorsese's genre-crossing film-making skill is impossible to deny here (and is indeed the dominant driving force of the movie), ""Shutter Island"" marks another notch in the ladder of Leonardo DiCaprio's career. His turn as the penniless, handsome artist in the astronomically overrated ""Titanic"" really did nothing for me, and it wasn't until 2006's ""The Departed"" (his third collaboration with Scorsese) that I felt he cemented his leading-man potential. Here, DiCaprio invokes the rugged look and swagger of a '50s celebrity icon; what impresses, however, is the fearlessness with which he probes the psychologically damaged Daniels (as revealed in vivid World War II flashbacks and surreal, grisly dream sequences), going to dark corners that separate his acting skill from his boyish good looks.<br/><br/>""Shutter Island"" does such a fine job of keeping the audience unsettled, with the notion that our feet are never firmly glued to any sort of relatable reality, that the climactic events come as a slight disappointment; while Laeta Kalogridis' script is an excellent example of a literary adaptation done right, it is Lehane's key revelation that comes as a letdown. However, credit must be given for presenting it in a manner that coalesces so well with all that has come before that it enriches, rather than cheapens, the film overall. And with a thriller as classy as ""Shutter Island,"" that's merely a minor crime."

"d_art","8","3","10","23 February 2010"," 'Shutter Island' is an unsettling, haunting journey
","In the Martin Scorsese's new film Shutter Island, Leonardo Di Caprio plays U.S. Marshal Teddy Daniels, who is assigned to investigate a disappearance of a female patient in a mental hospital for the criminally insane on the remote Shutter Island. As he uncovers clues, he suspects a conspiracy involving the doctors performing mind-altering experiments on patients. When a hurricane cuts off communication from the mainland and many dangerous criminals escape, Teddy finds out that the happenings on Shutter Island are a lot more twisted than he realized.<br/><br/>Since Martin Scorsese's big Oscar win with The Departed, he returns again with Leonardo Di Caprio in a starring role. Given the fact the movie takes place in 1954, one can't help approaching the film as some sort of a biopic, helped by the similarity of look to Scorsese/Di Caprio period pieces like Gangs of New York and The Aviator. However, one would be better prepared to approach it like a Hitchcockian thriller, or perhaps even a horror film. While there are many details that take place outside the island, the focus is really on the island itself and Teddy's relation to it.<br/><br/>The ominous setting, lighting, and the attention to period detail is quite intricate, with stark shadows and grey skies giving an oppressive atmosphere of gloom. One is reminded of Hitchcockian motifs of rocky shores, dangerous cliffs, punctuated by moody score, mixed with dizzying dream sequences involving dead people reminiscent of David Lynch's work. As he does with his other films, here, Scorsese has created a world that engulfs you, as he has a special talent of getting under your skin, making it an unsettling experience.<br/><br/>Leonardo Di Caprio's engaging performance truly sells this movie, as he breathes life into Teddy Daniels with a lot of conviction and pathos. It is this character with a haunted past that pushes the plot forward, as it is important that we the audience discovers with him what he uncovers (and we do). Mark Ruffalo as Chuck Aule, his partner in the case, does a fine job as his sidekick. Ben Kingsley brings a lot of weight and sinister intelligence to the role of psychiatrist Dr. Cawley, while Max von Sydow as Dr. Naehring has a cold candor and look that reminds one of a Nazi doctor. These characters, along with the inhabitants of the hospital, help contribute to the overall atmosphere of paranoia.<br/><br/>I enjoyed this thriller and appreciated the way the suspense was built gradually, not relying too heavily on the usual scare tactics. The film is suspenseful, unsettling, and dark. It is not a ""pleasant"" film to watch, or a popcorn film—it's just not that kind of film. It demands attention. I did notice that the plot itself didn't have to be as large a scale as Scorsese presented it, but it helped. If left in different hands, the film would've been a lot different, and certainly not as strong. At 138 minutes, the film can feel like a sensory overload for some, yet it's immersive. Whatever opinion one may have of Scorsese's films in general, they aren't comfort films—they're often potent and leave an impression. I appreciated how the plot was a little different than his previous works, yet a style that's still his own. It is a haunting, unsettling thriller that kept me thinking more about it afterwards. I'll say it's even closer to a horror film, a pretty good one. I give Shutter Island *** out of **** stars.<br/><br/>You can find my updates of movie reviews on http://twitter.com/d_art"

","Martin Scorsese will continue to be worshiped by Liberals so long as they remember his profane Jesus movie.

Trust me, or suffer for it.<br/><br/>Notning interesting happens after 30 minutes except a brief climb up a sheer cliff.<br/><br/>Besides being boring, the movie is anti-American in its John Kerry-like spin that American soldiers mass-murdered the German guards at Dachau. Never happened, captain. Even though this is taken back later in the movie, the image of the lie stands tall.<br/><br/>It is also one more movie that underlines the lie that World War II was about the death camps and the Jews. It wasn't. It was about the bombings of London, Rotterdam, the invasion of Czecholslvakia, et cetera. Seriously, nobody back then was concerned about the Jews.<br/><br/>In Shutter Island, pretty much everybody goes nuts. Reality is mixed with hallucinations, but in no way is this made interesting.<br/><br/>One last pot shot: I used to like Mark Ruffolo, but not anymore. Too many of these Hollywood empty-heads can't keep their traps shut. So OK just like Sheryl Crow and her one piece of toilet tissue tirade has ruined her music for me, so Mr. Ruffolo's desire that Bruce ought marry Kevin and that Megan ought marry Mary Ann.

I just couldn't keep my eyes off Dicaprio every time he was put with another character, how he reacted around them, what things he would say. The way he slowly unravels the case and digs up clues at a calm and cool pace makes the movie smooth and well put together. Dicaprio's character acts just how you'd expect a (MASSIVE SPOILER) mentally ill person thinking they're a federal Marshall to act. How you get to see everything pieced together at the end as well is so satisfying and you don't look back at how things were done and think 'well that seemed a bit far-fetched' in fact you think 'how did i miss all that!'

If they edited out all of the scenery shots, it could have been pared down to under 90 minutes.<br/><br/>Am I the only one who has questioned the vital statistics of the actors listed in IMDb? In an early scene, actors Lynch (guard), Di Caprio (lead) and Ruffalo (supporting) are walking together. Lynch (listed at 6'3"") is half a head at least taller than Di Caprio (listed at 6'), while Ruffalo (listed at 5'9"") stands at least half a head shorter than Di Caprio. Methinks IMDb would do well to stop using vitals provided by actors' press agents. The only actor's height I believe is Lynch's."

Things become even more complicated when a storm, which they refer to as a hurricane, hits.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio is certainly good and convincing as US Marshal Teddy Daniels.

Another doctor is Max von Sydow as Dr. Jeremiah Naehring. Ted Levine with his ominous voice is the Warden. John Carroll Lynch, who was Marge's husband in ""Fargo"", is Deputy Warden McPherson.<br/><br/>As Teddy gets inside the gates of the institution we notice that his treatment by the staff is a bit unusual. Yet when he requests information, or a meeting with others, it is usually provided for him, but it appears with some reluctance.<br/><br/>This is a very good mystery, and one where seeing it a second time can give the viewer a whole different perspective.<br/><br/>MAJOR SPOILERS follow, where I explain my take on the whole movie. There probably are other explanations that are plausible. Please read no further if you have not seen the movie.<br/><br/>This is an example of a story with an unreliable narrator, otherwise it cannot make sense. Daniels is that unreliable narrator. He tells others that his wife died from smoke inhalation in their apartment, but later we find out that is a made-up memory to mask what really happened. We also find out that Daniels isn't is real name, it also has been made up to mask unpleasant memories, his real name is Laeddis. His wife was Michelle Williams as Dolores Chanal, we only see her in flashbacks. After the fire in their apartment they moved to a Lake House, where Daniels (Laeddis) comes home to find she had drowned their children, and in a fit of passion he killed her. He is not a US Marshal, he has been a patient for the criminally insane for two years. In a last-ditch effort to get him to recognize and live with reality, his ""visit as a Marshall"" was set up, and his partner was really his primary psychiatrist. In the end it didn't work, he was still not dealing with reality and what must have been an accepted procedure in 1954, was last seen headed for the lighthouse where a partial lobotomy was to be preformed. In the alternate explanation, he DID realize who he really was and acted like he didn't in effect choosing the lobotomy because he couldn't live with the reality."
"tnrcooper","9","2","6","30 May 2010"," Excellent, well-made thriller
","While I thought some elements of ""Shutter Island"" were a bit overplayed in order to superficially ratchet up the suspense (I most specifically refer to the ridiculous music at the beginning which suggests something particularly ominous is about to happen, although in how many films does something particularly ominous happen at the five minute mark?), overall, I found the film a worthwhile application of Scorese's encyclopedic film knowledge to the thriller genre. His decision to do this is comparable to his doing ""Age of Innocence"" or ""Cape Fear"" – it is a bit out of his comfort zone. But this is why Scorsese is a great director. As accomplished and critically acclaimed as he is, he is not afraid to push boundaries and attempt to tell a story in a different way, or even to work in an almost completely different genre, than he has before-and while perhaps ""The Age of Innocence"" is not his best work, it was not terrible, reminding us again how well-versed in films, and also how talented, he is. <br/><br/>Admittedly, he is certainly not a newbie to suspense. ""Cape Fear"" was a fantastic re-make. I can't think of many better re-makes of films. It scared the pants out of me and I don't scare easily. In that film, he used a terrifying protagonist (portrayed memorably by one of his prime muses, DeNiro) to increase the suspense surrounding a judge who began to fear for his life when a convict he had sentenced completes his term and returns to try and make the judge's life miserable. Scorsese in that film didn't need to use any actual violence or gore in order to scare viewers. Our knowledge that DeNiro's character was out there, determined and fearless to exact revenge on the judge who had put him away, is enough to scare us. <br/><br/>In ""Shutter Island"", Scorsese delves into an admittedly different area in order to scare us, but once again, the fear of what we don't know far outweighs the terror of some gratuitous, splashy act of violence. In this instance, the film is about a US marshal approaching the eponymous island in an attempt to find a woman who has escaped. As DiCaprio and the excellent Mark Ruffalo's marshals seek answers from warden Ben Kingsley (at his most reptilian) and Max Von Sydow (who, seeming to have discovered the fountain of youth, becomes ever more chilling) about the whereabouts and the particulars of the woman's disappearance, they become increasingly enmeshed in a murky, shadowy world in which motives and simple sequences of events become more and more baffling. <br/><br/>The cast assembled by Scorsese is fantastic, and he gets some wonderfully including some of the creepy performances from all of the leads – from Michelle Williams at her most opaque to the most detached Patricia Clarkson, from Ted Levine as an eerily vanilla warden to Elias Koteas as the lunatic Laeddis. For my money, this is not one of DiCaprio's best performances. It is fair, but his dramatic range in this performance doesn't seem to capture the true breadth of a man who is this troubled. His palette of emotions seems strangely mute for such a volatile character. That said, it is not his worst performance either. Compared to the rather thin presence he summoned in attempting to be a gang leader in ""Gangs of New York"", this is excellent work. It isn't his charismatic tour-de-force in ""The Departed"" or even his chameleon-like work in ""Catch Me If You Can"", but he does convey a man who is ill at ease. <br/><br/>That said, credit for the success of this picture has to go to Scorsese. His technical proficiency and ability to originally and excitingly tell a story are used masterfully here. The film was originally a book by Dennis Lehane (also the author of ""Mystic River"" and ""Gone Baby Gone"") and apparently (though I haven't read the book), Scorsese's re-telling of ""Shutter Island"" is quite different from Lehane's. That it is so well reviewed and not too harshly criticized by devoted Lehane fans is a credit to the originality and quality of Scorsese's interpretation of the book. Many fans have said they saw through the final twist from the get-go and I don't deny that is possible. As for myself, I'm not interested in trying to out-think a director. I watch a film and take in the action without trying too much to anticipate what will happen. Perhaps you are one of those who saw the twist coming. If so, more power to you, but if you weren't trying to figure out what would happen, and were just letting the film wash over you, you shouldn't be criticized. <br/><br/>Scorsese has originally re-interpreted an excellent piece of fiction and it's rare when a movie isn't significantly overshadowed by a picture. Again, not having read the book, I can't comment on that, but this is a well-made, somewhat scary film, so credit to Scorsese for that."

","I think Teddy was sane. I think he reverted, because he knew he was never getting off the island, and that was too much for him to live with. That explains his last line to ""Chuck""<br/><br/>""Is it better to live as a monster, or die as a good man?""<br/><br/>Teddy had lived as a monster, in both of his lives. In one, he killed his wife. In the other, he killed the Nazi officers. So now that the living part is over, he wants to die a good man. Not a physical death, per say, but once the lobotomy is over, he wont have to deal with the pain anymore. That in itself is a good reason to lose your memory. Two full lives of memorys....all the pain of two people...well, that's enough to drive anyone crazy."

","Scorsese takes us to the Shutter Island, with a help of ferry in the first scene itself coupled with the haunting background score which sets the mood for next few hours.

When he starts investigating, he finds the case to be rather strange to know the missing patient Rachel just vanished without a clue. Scorsese explains this through one of his characters as "" its like she just evaporated in the cell"". Ted starts investigating the inmates of the mental asylum, however he finds no clue. Meanwhile he starts suffering from migraines and different type of hallucinations which he is scared of. Scorsese unfolds the story in a complicated manner, which indeed adds more and more mystery as he expected. Why he suffers hallucinations? Did he find the missing patient? Scorsese explains all these with surreal, dramatic and valiant sequences to make us accept what has really happened and to a certain extent, he did convince us.<br/><br/>If you think about the movies Scorsese made of-late and watch this, you would be disappointed. Having said that, if you want to see a gripping mystery unfolds in the screen with great direction. this is the one you should be looking at. Di caprio as usual excels as expected. Ben Kingsley as the chief doctor, lived his role.The movie has quite a handful of other characters, however writing about them will be spilling the beans. The cinematography is splendid, and the editing being marvelous specially in the dream sequences and the hallucinations. As i mentioned earlier, the BGM is bang on target and creates the eerie effect with ease.<br/><br/>On the downside, towards the end I felt though the twists and turns acceptable, it seemed too much to me. Other than that, Scorsese wins hands down in holding the suspense till the end and reveals with panache. Three Cheers for Scorsese for his innate ability to deliver with substance and style in a totally different genre this time."
"manicman84","4","2","6","25 March 2010"," undone by its lazy, messy and full of its own importance script
","The latest picture from Martin Scorsese ranks among his worst. Shutter Island tries to be an engrossing mystery, but the movie is just undone by its lazy, messy and full of its own importance script. A somewhat reasonable concept gets lost in an abundance of surrealism and nonsense. Both director and leading actor Leonardo DiCaprio aren't really at the top of their game. The latter just wanders around the island trying to reveal the conspiracy and meeting strange characters whose talk is puzzling and fractured. What's even worse, less than half way through it becomes apparent that the film can only resolve in one way enabling its used-to-death twist to enliven and assure viewers that the film makes no sense whatsoever. It's only a shame that the actors involved are respectable. Another reason why this film is a misfire is that it doesn't really try to be grounded in reality of any kind. It resembles an artificial construct, sadly not very exciting to watch."
"sinncross","9","2","6","15 March 2010"," Undeniably captivating...
","Taking on the case of a mysterious disappearance of a patient in a hospital for those who are criminally insane, US Marshall Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his new partner Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo) attempt to investigate a rather absurd escape. With the help of the head psychiatrist Dr. Cawley (Ben Kingsley), Teddy and Chuck attempt to unravel how a patient, named Rachael Solando (Emily Mortimer), was able to completely vanish from the confines of her locked room.<br/><br/>Shutter Island begins with a brooding image of a ferry making its way through some heavy fog, and it is the very enigmatic nature of the scene which claws its way throughout the narrative till the thought provoking conclusion. This becomes far more evident when many scenes and symbolic gestures in the film are soaked in a hint of polysemy. Of course this would not work without a very engaging storyline and Shutter Island makes for an exciting, and never dull, thriller. This is mostly achieved through the narratives pacing being quite consistent throughout for the film never felt like it was dragging. That said, it can be a little disorientating when the narrative decides its time to bombard information upon Teddy, and the viewer, in an attempt to guide the film to the mystery of Rachael Solando's escape. The film is by no means overly complicated but if you lose track of the information which these certain scenes attempt to convey, the films real twist can appear somewhat disjointed even if it is to an extent predictable.<br/><br/>The narrative is only heightened by a group of actors who do a convincing job of representing their respective characters. The character of Teddy is easily the most important and DiCaprio does a great job of conveying the character's need to find the truth while battling the guilt over the horrors of his own past life. Kingsley provides a wonderful performance as the head psychiatrist on the island who wishes to rehabilitate the mentally ill instead of resorting to measures such as lobotomy. He has a restrained and calm manner which exudes his character's intellectual capability. Ruffalo provides good support to DiCaprio, as he assumes the role of the concerned and eager to help partner. The entire supporting cast, involving the likes of Ted Levine and Elias Koteas, to name a few, all perform at their best to assure that Shutter Island feels highly believable, though it is just a pity that some of them only appear for a few minutes. This does result in Teddy being the only character with any real emotional appeal outside the intellectual nature of the film.<br/><br/>The filming style by Martin Scorsese is an absolute wonder, especially the final scene, as he utilises varying techniques in order to construct the web of events into something meaningful but abstract. Some techniques could appear unusable in modern films but they nevertheless work to enhance the film. Another good addition to the cinematography is how a few stylised camera sequences are used on single occasions allowing the film to constantly remain fresh. The computer imagery which accompanies the work is of a generally high standard with some beautifully rendered scenes enhanced by the Gothic atmosphere. Still, the computer imagery is not entirely top tier material with some scenes lacking the polish of others.<br/><br/>There is no sex in the film though nudity does make an appearance in one scene of a couple of seconds showing some male genitalia. Violence is largely in the form of Teddy's memories which involve soldiers being gunned down and blood appearing in large pools, both for realistic deaths and for artistic reasons. Dead bodies are shown throughout, some with bloody results, and involve adults and children. Language is contained mostly to F-words and blasphemy. Neither overpower the film and are sporadically placed through the plus 2 hour run time, yet the blasphemy can come across as slightly more excessive then required.<br/><br/>Shutter Island culminates into a fascinating outlook on how truth can be both liberating and destructive. This is achieved through a combination of a tight and absorbing narrative; superb acting performances; and a film style that enhances the Gothic atmosphere required for the thematic depth to be appreciated. The film does lose some footing with the odd narrative hiccup; some slight graphical issues; and a lack of emotional pull from the general characters for some part of the film. Nevertheless, Shutter Island is an intelligently taut thriller which allows its viewers to ultimately invest in its characters and story while providing ample entertainment."
"Damian11","7","2","6","14 March 2010"," Shutter Island and the Allegory of the Cave
","Scorsese is presents us with a twisted mind bending plot with all the visual hallmarks and mise-en-scene of classic horror and psychological thrillers. Deliberate overt psychological and mythological signs and symbols are used to subvert the vision of reality we see. But whose is it Scorsese's or Teddy Daniel's. <br/><br/>From the first few frames when we see the boat emerge from the mist we are presented with a vision that doesn't seem quite real, an imagined reality that we are asked to question throughout the picture.<br/><br/>Shutter Island can for the most part be read in terms of Plato's Allegory of the Cave, which questions the way in which we perceive and believe what is reality. <br/><br/>The allegory itself establishes a cave in which prisoners are chained down and forced to look at the front wall of the cave. Behind and unknown to the prisoners puppeteers are casting shadows using fire and light (recurring themes through the film) onto the wall which the prisoners take to be reality. In the case of the film we can either take this as Scorsese creating the unreal reality of the film for us the viewer or Ben Kingsley's character Dr Cawley creating one of two possible realities for DiCaprio's Teddy Daniels character.<br/><br/>Once a prisoner is released from the cave he looks upon the fire and objects making the shadows that once dictated his version of reality. In Teddy Daniels case this can be seen as happening twice in the film, once in the visual signpost of his visit to the cave by the cliffs. Climbing from the rocks below Teddy makes his way past hundreds of rats. Rats represent unworthy thoughts and feelings of guilt, envy, avarice and so on that hide from the light. In mythology a dream of rats can mean an enemy is trying to harm you. Teddy eventually reaches the cave where he meets what he perceives to be the missing woman Rachel played by Patricia Clarkson who presents him with a version of true reality and later on in the lighthouse when Dr Cawley confronts him with another version of reality. <br/><br/>Plato describes the vision of the real truth to be aching to the eyes of the prisoners and how they would naturally be inclined to going back and viewing what they have always seen as a pleasant and painless acceptance of the truth. Teddy faces this same confrontation when in the cave Rachel asks him to question the reality of his partner and everything he has seen since arriving on the island. She suggests since his arrival he has been under control through hallucinogenic cigarettes and drugs. This leads Teddy to question this first perceived reality of Shutter Island.<br/><br/>The comfort of the unreal truth and the fear of the unrecognized outside world would result in the prisoner being forced to climb the ascent of the cave and step out into the sun. When Teddy leaves the cave in the film we notice the weather has changed as the sun now shines now that he has seemingly been illuminated to a new truth, although not the last he must confront in the picture.<br/><br/>Towards the end of the film Dr Cawley confronts Teddy with his version of Teddy's true reality. Plato and in this case Scorsese are questioning the prisoner and Teddy's newfound awareness of his own knowledge. Would they want to return to the formerly accepted reality? Socrates in discussions on the Cave Allegory and it appears Scorsese agree that the prisoner (Teddy) would rather suffer any fate than return to his previous life and understanding or lack thereof. <br/><br/>If we are to read the film in these terms, we could deduce that in the final scene of the film Teddy has accepted the true reality of his past but continues to present himself as having gone back into the cave of his previous reality (that is comfortable) to bring about consequences that will release him from living with the horror of the truth or so we think.<br/><br/>The final note of the film showing the shot of the lighthouse where originally Teddy believes Nazi style experiments and lobotomy's take place can be read as casting doubt on all we have seen so far.<br/><br/>The psychological meaning of lighthouses in dreams is said to symbolize guidance, helping you safely journey the stormy seas of the unconscious. Teddy heads to the lighthouse to find guidance and answers and it is here he is confronted by Dr Cawley with his final version of Teddy's reality. He presents himself as trying to guide Teddy out of his untrue reality. At the end of the film it appears that Scorsese is suggesting that Teddy is heading back to the lighthouse for the final solution to his ""psychosis"". Teddy's last words to his partner/psychiatrist are ""is it better to live as a monster or die as a good man?"" hinting at his awareness and acceptance of the truth and final escape from it. It could also suggest that what we thought was Teddy's untrue reality had a ring of truth about it. Is Teddy really about to be experimented on after all, was it all an elaborate trick, or is this just another red herring. <br/><br/>At times Shutter Island can come across as a little unsubtle but is this Scorsese or the DiCaprio character's unsubtly. I like to think it's the latter. Scorsese although a director not shy to throw in good measures of psychoanalytical, mythical and religious symbolism is far to adept a filmmaker not to be doing this deliberately. The broad strokes Scorsese uses can be read as Teddy Daniels imagination creating this vivid fantasy to mask his own ""apparent"" horrifying reality. Scorsese has delivered a thought provoking psychological drama that for all it's flaws at gets you thinking and wanting to revisit Shutter Island again in the search for answers."

"cliodhna2","7","2","6","4 March 2010"," Mediocre at best
","It's 1954. U.S. Marshal Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his sidekick Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo) are on the ferry to Shutter Island. The island could be Alcatraz, except that instead of criminals, it houses the criminally insane. One of their inmates has apparently escaped, and Daniels and Aule have been sent to investigate. But the investigator turns out to be the one being investigated.<br/><br/>Shutter Island gets off to a fairly good start. It does a competent job of building the apparently normal, but-you-know-something-is-going-on atmosphere. Ben Kingsley is nice and creepy as the frosty psychiatrist Dr. Cawley. You just know that he and his team are hiding a Dark Secret. However, it quickly goes downhill, and like Daniels, I was also searching for a way to abandon the island at the half-way point. It picks up again in the second half, but just around the point where you think it's going to get interesting, you realise you've seen it all before. That said, even though the dénouement is predictable, it's done well enough to stick with to the end.<br/><br/>Acting-wise, the only one worth watching is Ben Kingsley. He plays the ambiguous Dr. Cawley to perfection, and sent a little shiver down my spine each time he appeared on screen. Leonardo DiCaprio never rises above his usual 'Hello I'm Leonardo DiCaprio playing a character in a film' performance (apologies to his fans, but I just don't rate him) and Mark Ruffalo as the sidekick is unremarkable.<br/><br/>It's 20 years since Scorcese made Goodfellas (1990), 22 years since 'The Last Temptation of Christ' (1988), 30 years on from 'Raging Bull' (1980) and 34 years since 'Taxi Driver' (1976). I can't help feeling he's losing his touch. This has all the hallmarks of a film churned out just because those concerned needed to make a bit of money.<br/><br/>Shutter Island is at best mediocre. There's nothing new or original in it. Go see 'A Beautiful Mind' instead."

"RipTheJacker","9","2","6","1 March 2010"," Highly enjoyable psychological thriller
","I went to see this film not knowing what exactly to expect other than a 2+ hour goose-chase Leo and his partner have to endure. Without spoiling anything, what I saw was a completely different film which caught me off guard and completely obscured my perspective of what I expected from the film. Instead, it opened my eyes, took me to the edge of my seat, and got me thinking about what was REALLY going on in Shutter Island.<br/><br/>While the film doesn't exactly start off strong, it slowly picks itself off the floor and carries you to the very edge of your seat up until the last minute of the film. The true premise behind the film plays out very strong and it's fortunate that the great premise is also backed up by great actors who play their roles splendidly. It really shows that these film-makers and actors put skills and heart towards making this a highly enjoyable and highly intelligent psychological thriller.<br/><br/>I felt that the only weak point in the film was the music. While the score definitely had some great atmospheric pieces orchestrated to perfection, it also had a loud and persistent cello note played almost to the rhythm to that of the Jaws theme. This note was played throughout the film. While it was a bit tedious, it didn't take away from the original tension built from the film's gloomy and suspenseful atmosphere, so it was easily forgiving.<br/><br/>Fortunately, the minor score issue is the only thing that I could possibly find wrong about this film. Almost every other aspect of this film presents itself professionally and creatively. While it is certainly not a solid 10 in my book, I still gave this film a 9 because it's a highly enjoyable film if you simply learn to keep your eyes peeled and your ears open. With the exception of minor setbacks, the good(s) definitely outweigh the bad(s) and I would definitely recommend this film to anyone who is looking for that breath of fresh air from intelligent psychological thrillers."
"petit76","10","2","6","1 March 2010"," hard to define
","The way the film unfolds an interesting one, but is difficult to put into words without spoiling everything from the film. It strings you along so many different paths that guessing how the film ends is nearly impossible. While watching the film, however, nothing really made sense until the last twenty minutes or so. Between Teddy's hallucinations and what's transpiring on the island, it's almost exhausting trying to grasp what's actually happening in the film and what's occurring in Teddy's head. The finale to The Departed, another Martin Scorsese/ Leonardo DiCaprio pairing, was (and still is) one of the most talked about endings when it comes to recent films. Shutter Island doesn't necessarily top The Departed, but is along the same lines. Its ending gives new meaning to at least one repeat viewing of the film. no denying that I've been a fan of Martin Scorsese's films for quite some time. Films like Taxi Driver, Goodfellas, Cape Fear, Casino, and Gangs of New York are prime examples of some of the best films ever. I can't say the same about Leonardo DiCaprio. While I can't argue the fact that I enjoy quite a few films he's been in, he didn't really do anything for me as an actor. I didn't see this potential or charisma that everyone else seemed to. Until now. His work in Shutter Island puts his acting skills on display for the world to see. His devastation towards the end of the film is not only believable, but absorbing as well.<br/><br/>The cinematography is on a level you'd come to expect from a Scorsese picture. The way Ward C, the ward built during the Civil War that contains the island's most dangerous prisoners, is filmed in particular may be the high point as far as cinematography is concerned. The never-ending darkness makes you think something is going to jump out at you at any moment and its metal cage-like structure that constructs the walls feels claustrophobic; like you're a prisoner yourself. That ""rat in a maze"" line from the trailer really fits the film well. Everything in the lighthouse with the spiral staircase is pretty amazing, as well.<br/><br/>An interesting note about the film is that the soundtrack is used sparingly. I didn't notice one throughout the majority of the film. It seemed to only be used during dramatic moments. There's also a gunshot towards the end of the film that is going to make you jump because it's so damn loud. Seriously. It's insane. For an R-rated Scorsese film, it seemed pretty mild in the language department. The F-word is said 422 times in Casino, 296 times in Goodfellas, and 237 times in The Departed while it's only said a handful of times in this film. Just seemed a bit odd for a Scorsese picture.<br/><br/>Shutter Island is pretty confusing until the finale (basically from ""Why are you all wet, baby?"" to the end). It's pieced together slowly and is a combination of Teddy's memories, hallucinations, and what's actually occurring in reality. The way it unfolds is kind of like trying to solve a Rubix Cube. It takes time and a little bit of effort, but is well worth it in the end. Shutter Island is a film that makes you think. Remember that going in. Teddy has quite a few lines towards the end of the film that are going to stick with me for a very long time. It's a film that will only get better with repeat viewings. When it's all said and done, it was well worth waiting an extra four months for this film.Evren Buyruk from USA"

There were only a couple of ""jump"" moments in this film but when they came up on the screen they were absolutely affective. ""Shutter Island"" is what you would call a psychological thriller, those are the kind of films that keep the viewer thinking and paying attention and trust me you have to pay attention in this film. Leonardo Dicaprio was and is a phenomenal actor, he was perfect for this role. The way he showed emotion was remarkable. There wasn't really anything that I didn't enjoy about this film. But it is one of those films that you have to see more than once to understand it.

"freaky_dave","8","2","6","28 February 2010"," Scorsese delivers again
","Though not a masterpiece, Shutter Island delivers the goods and left me pretty much satisfied with what I witnessed on the screen. I don't believe Martin Scorsese has ever done a bad movie. I even enjoyed Cape Fear, which seems to be the movie which most critic's believe is his weakest film, and Shutter Island gives you what you want in a suspenseful thriller.<br/><br/>It's 1954 and Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo) are detectives investigating the disappearance of one of the inmates on Shutter Island, which is an asylum for the violent and criminally insane. THe problem is that Teddy has skeletons of his own in the closet, and it is these same skeletons that hinder his investigation somewhat because he has nightmares of World War 2 when he was involved with liberating a concentration camp in Germany. He also has dreams of his dead wife who was seemingly killed in a fire set by a person who might or might not be an inmate on Shutter Island as well. WHat is real, and what is not? THese are questions that Teddy asks himself and make him feel as if maybe he is becoming a little unhinged. <br/><br/>THe final act comes as somewhat of a surprise, but it was something that I saw coming nearly a half hour in when the first walking nightmare, as another character mentions, appears. Still, after the movie, I found myself asking some more questions, and they are questions I won't mention because I don't want to give any secrets away for those who haven't seen it. I'll just say that as a thriller filled with mysteries, this film works real well.<br/><br/>Shutter Island is a movie packed with suspense, and it delivers the shocks as well, keeping you on the edge of your seat. The score worked well with the suspense, and the acting, including two key roles by Ben Kingsley and Max Von Sydow as the doctors on Shutter Island, were all well done. Even the minor roles worked effectively to keep the pace and suspense of the film strong throughout the movie's entire run time.<br/><br/>With the exception of the finale being a little expected, I still found Shutter Island to be a very well made movie. It ratchets up the suspense and then shocks you even more. THat is the way thrillers involving mystery should always be handled. Not Scorsese's greatest film, but not a weak movie either and better than many other movies of the same caliber. THis is one that is definitely recommended."
"moviemanMA","8","2","6","28 February 2010"," Scorsese thrills and chills
","Shutter Island is based on the book of the same name by Dennis Lehane, the man who penned Mystic River and Gone Baby Gone. Needless to say this film too takes place in Boston, Lehane's stomping grounds, but this time we go outside of the city limits and into Boston Harbor. Federal Marshall Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) has been sent to investigate the disappearance of a patient at a hospital for the criminally insane on Shutter Island. He and his partner Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo) must gather the facts, find some clues, and see what exactly happened to this missing patient.<br/><br/>Dr. Cawley (Ben Kingsley) runs the show on Shutter Island. He oversees all activities with the doctors, nurses, orderlies, and guards. It is his idea that the patients on the island are not prisoners but people who are in desperate need of help through more humane means. Teddy and Chuck soon find out that not all is as it seems on the island. It's as if everyone has a secret and is scared to tell.<br/><br/>To make matters worse, Teddy suffers from nightmares and flashbacks about his wife (Michelle Williams) and her sudden death in an apartment fire. He tries to pull it together but the line between what is real and what is in his head slowly starts to blur, causing him to lose sight of what he is really on the island to do.<br/><br/>With the help of a tight screenplay by Laeta Kalogridis (Night Watch, Alexander, Pathfinder) and spectacular cinematography by one of the best in the business, Robert Richardson (Platoon, JFK, Kill Bill Vol 1 & 2, The Aviator), Scorsese is able to deliver a solid, psychological thriller. Starting with the script, I was happy that it wasn't just an exercise in exploiting the Boston accent, like too many movies and TV shows have done of late. It also does a nice job of keeping us involved with the story. Especially with thrillers, it is very easy to lose your audience if you present an idea or a plot point that is too over their head. Here we slowly learn more and more about the characters until finally at the end WHAM! The big turnaround and a very nice payoff. Credit is due to both Kalogridis and for Lehane's magnificent story.<br/><br/>Richardson, who is nominated this year for Inglourious Basterds, makes it clear that there isn't going to be a lot of sunshine both in the story and on the film. The very first frame we see a boat emerge from the fog as it rolls towards Shutter Island. Bringing with it Teddy, Chuck, and one heck of a storm. Scorsese and Richardson were obviously going for a stylized effect, carefully selecting the appropriate lighting for each scene, a crucial element to the film's success. Each shot is clear, crisp, and emphasizes just the right colors or lack of color.<br/><br/>The performances were right on the money. DiCaprio has developed quite an on screen presence. When he is in the shot we focus right on him. He gives 110% for every scene. Seeing as his character has a lot of emotional baggage, he plays it very paranoid and jumpy, unlike his partner Chuck who is more relaxed and level. DiCaprio clashes with the authorities on the island so well like Kingsley, Max von Sydow, and John Carrol Lynch. Also a great cameo performance by Jackie Earle Haley as one of the patients. His career is certainly looking brighter with each performance.<br/><br/>There are a few downers in the film. I thought the middle of the film was a little slow sometimes and lacked the pace and intensity of the first and last acts. The flashbacks for the most part were a little too artsy, almost to the point where it was literally pouring down on us. They felt a little out of place considering the rest of the film, but it felt okay in flashback/dream form. They were very well shot and had a particular look that I enjoy (artsy).<br/><br/>What I love about Scorsese, like other great filmmakers, is that regardless the theme, setting, or genre, he manages to add his own personal touch. Though there is certainly a touch of Hitchcock, the angles, composition, and overall look of the film is Scorsese. He's a incredible filmmaker who continues to make hit after hit after hit."

","As with many other Scorsese films, you must watch this film accurately and actively from the beginning to the end, preferably in the movie theater, by yourself, alone. Then, you will start to feel the intended magic of this film. I can sit here and talk about great acting in the movie, great cinematography, great direction, but I will leave it to other reviewers. The greatest part of the film is that each piece of the movie is constructed in a way to bend and manipulate your mind, and at the end, after all twists and turns, your mind is completely confused, unwilling to interpret further, and its only objective becomes to question the sanity of its beholder. When you drive home, and you feel that you just got released from the asylum and you actively questioning your state of mental health while observing fellow car drivers for the signs of deception, lunacy, and yet again deception, you kind of know that the movie succeeded and provided a great cinematic experience. As for other reviewers, who question the stability of this movie by asking why, if being this good, it wasn't released in December for 2009 Oscars, I have a simple explanation, why release it in December and be nominated and go home empty handed, after the magician Mr. Cameron rightly takes all the awards, if you can release the film in February, go for 2010 Oscars, and have a greater probability at winning a few awards. As always, very clever move from Mr. Scorsese. Don't miss this one, it Will make you ""insane"" for at least 2 1/2 hours....guaranteed."

","There is a feeling that permeates every frame of ""Shutter Island"", a feeling of discomfort and uneasiness - a feeling that suggests, at any moment, we are going to slip comfortably into insanity. That is a feeling that Martin Scorsese effortlessly wields, crafting a world that is not unlike our own and yet is so thoroughly cinematic, it can only be described as masterfully haunting. Clocking in at over two hours, this splendid film draws us into a world and story that are so compelling and fascinating, it is often easy to forget where the theater stops and the asylum begins. It would not be a stretch to say that the current state of mainstream horror is rather unfortunate; it feels as though we have not seen an original story or, at the very least, a truly innovative approach to an old story in ages. It is not surprising, then, that Martin Scorsese would be the one to remind us that horror, when done right, is not the type of genre that must be automatically forbidden to the back of the closet with PG-13 ghost stories and dull remakes. While most other horror films are thoroughly innocuous and inexplicably safe, ""Shutter Island"" is reminiscent of more old-fashioned fare, the type of film that is unafraid to be divisive and risky. After all, in cinema, without risk, there is nothing at all.<br/><br/>Please read my full review on my blog: www.thelastcritic.blogspot.com"
"pyrocitor","8","2","6","23 February 2010"," Captivatingly tense and flooringly atmospheric in spite of eventual narrative concerns
","It is always fascinating to see directors whose success is generally associated with a specific genre work outside of their usual subject matter, and celebrated filmmaker Martin Scorsese's work on Shutter Island is no exception. Despite the seemingly familiar use of police figures as protagonists, Scorsese instead contents himself from drawing instead from the realm of psychological horror thrillers rather than his usual milieu of police or gangster genres, without sacrificing his usual uncanny grasp on complex, nuanced characterisation or sophistication of narrative. As such, rather than a 'gimmicky' conscious departure from his realm of expertise, Scorsese's film instead feels like a fitting entry into his celebrated pantheon of work, only serving to further demonstrate his versatility as a director.<br/><br/>In fact, for a director generally uninitiated into the field of anything resembling horror, psychological or otherwise (unless one considers the urban mental horror of his works such as Taxi Driver), Scorsese demonstrates an exemplary flair for working within the tropes of the genre. Taking clear influence from classic, 1950s B-horrors (in particular, the recognizably jerky editing and stilted expositional dialogue of the film's ship-set opening sequence feels directly lynched from Invasion of the Body Snatchers or another film of its ilk), the film makes its mark as a laudably daring experiment in temporal genre bending, all the moreso through its devious subtlety, rather than overtly hamming it up or overdoing nods to its influences. As the film progresses and the tension rises, it is almost a shame to see Scorsese abandon his previous hat tipping and segway into more conventional standards of quality and narrative development.<br/><br/>That being said, as the overlap between reality and fiction becomes increasingly ambiguous and the psychological state of his protagonists becomes more and more frayed, Scorsese demonstrates a dazzling grasp on generating a captivating and horrifying atmosphere (most tonally akin to Lars von Trier's recent Antichrist of all things, albeit with less animal disfigurement) with its noxiously gritty 'real life' narrative and breathtaking, exquisitely stylized and horrific flashback or dream sequences equally adept at evoking piercing tension and overwhelming terror in the viewer. Thema Schumacher's masterfully neurotic editing and the boldly (yet fittingly) overbearing musical score all combine to create a stunningly Gothic ambiance, excelling in its rank filth and horror.<br/><br/>As such, it is a desperate shame when the film finally lurches along to its culmination, as, despite generating an atmosphere so overwhelmingly powerful and a narrative fiendishly complex enough to genuinely leave the viewer guessing, it can't help but all feel somewhat wasted upon the revelation of an ending twist which comes across as somewhat insultingly over-obvious and unsatisfying - a twist so obvious throughout that the viewer finds themselves continually inclined not to believe that a film so sophisticated and stunningly stylized would succumb to it, thus being almost (but not quite) taken by surprise, but in entirely the wrong way. To his credit, Scorsese remains a directorial stalwart to the end and does his utmost to sell his ending, and as such its inclusion is not quite enough to derail the entire film, but it cannot help but feel like a glaring mistake in a film previously so impeccably poised to avoid every semblance of the word.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, Leonardo DiCaprio delivers yet another flooringly powerful and nuanced performance as haunted and psychologically threatened federal Marshal Teddy Daniels. Working with the film's pivotal role, DiCaprio's firebrand, nervy energy is a perfect compliment to Scorsese's heavy handed style, and his work in Shutter Island stands as further testament to his being one of the most trustworthy and downright powerful performers in the modern industry. Mark Ruffalo keeps himself on an impressive, appropriate slow-boil of clenched energy as Daniel's partner, and his uniquely understated charisma not only proves a perfect compliment to DiCaprio's frenzied performance, but also admirably sells an otherwise uninteresting 'straight man' role. Ben Kingsley hits the 'mysterious and aloof scientist with secrets' button hard, but manages to make it work, with his perpetually gleaming eyes retaining the viewer's interest and curiosity throughout. Max Von Sydow, while seemingly having little purpose in the film apart from adding to the general sense of unease (and unearthing an interesting piece of characterisation for DiCaprio) nonetheless contributes a suitably peculiar and foreboding performance. Michelle Williams excels in brief flashback appearances with fierce passion and desperation as Daniels' dead wife, and Emily Mortimer is captivatingly frightening yet sympathetic as missing psychopath Rachel Solonzo. Finally, Jackie Earl Haley is spellbinding in a single crucial scene as a schizophrenic murderer, managing to work enough frantic edginess, and strange, perverse sympathy into his performance to make his fleeting presence one of the film's highlights.<br/><br/>As such, Scorsese's Shutter Island remains an overall masterfully assembled piece of film-making, if perhaps one destined to leave viewers somewhat unsatisfied and let down after such a stunning build up. Nonetheless, if the bulk of the film could be examined in isolation, the film would cement itself as one of Scorsese's most impactful and sublime films in a collection of many. As it stands, the film proves several cuts above most contemporary masquerades at psychological horror, but falls short of the eerie masterpiece it might otherwise have been.<br/><br/>-8/10"

If you can't figure out the ultimate plot in the first half hour of the way too long movie... you're not a fan of the genre. That's the most disappointing thing. The name's associated with the film and clever marketing get your hopes up so much but leave you waiting for the movie to end before the director's story is told.<br/><br/>Movie's in this genre (and especially as long as this one) are supposed to leave you guessing every solution you come up with during the uninteresting plots of untold characters.

"chicagopoetry","10","2","6","23 February 2010"," In Defense of Shutter Island
","Many critics have ripped on Shutter Island, calling the acting bad and criticizing the dialogue. I read so many bad reviews of Shutter Island that I almost didn't even want to watch it. After I watched it, I had to watch it again a few days later. Shutter Island is a completely brilliant film. There is not a single frame wasted. Scorsese completely plays with his audience's minds with this tribute to the noir genre, at times making DiCaprio look like Marlon Brando, at other times using colors and lighting to inspire a Hitchcockian sense of deja vu. After watching Shutter Island I had to wonder what movie the critics watched, and if they had even bothered to finish watching it to the end.<br/><br/>The only way I can defend this movie from the critics who are bashing it is to include some spoilers here, so if you don't want anything given away, stop reading this right now. The ending of this movie explains it all. The reason some of the acting is intentionally bad is because everyone in this movie is acting out an elaborate game of role playing. The reason some of the dialogue doesn't make sense is because practically everything that is said has two meanings, the meaning interpreted by ""The Marshal"" while he is living out his complex hallucination, and the real meaning that isn't revealed until the mystery is solved, a meaning that you probably won't entirely grasp until a second viewing of this film. Upon a second viewing, multiple layers of subtleties are revealed and everything makes perfect sense. Everyone's gestures and pauses and eye movements are revealed to be not bad acting but the brilliantly portrayed behavior of those who are ""in on it."" This one is right up there with great movies such as Taxi Driver or The Unforgiven. It is simply an example of superb film making."

While the movie looked amazing with amazing supporting actors and actresses the plot was of a familiar nature. While, not giving anything away, one would benefit from seeing the movie more than once. The mind bending journey the movie takes you down is enjoyable with only the ending being a letdown climactic conclusion. While in the theater I remember feeling ""that's it?""

"pulpreyes","8","2","6","22 February 2010"," Not A Very Surprising Story...But Still a Good Thriller
","We all know that Martin Scorsese is a very talented director and it will always show in his films. What makes this film special compared to his earlier work is that he connects with audience psychologically (arguably) better than any of them. Nowadays, we can always tell what going to happen in horror movies easily based on the typical movie clichés like the cheesy music and the helpless character in a scary background where the kill can be predicted. Scorsese takes it up a notch and creates the right kind of chill we should feel in such situations.<br/><br/>The music starts and stops at the right moments that make us feel truly disturbed. In some of the most dramatic and suspenseful moments, there's no music at all, all we are left with is silence in the dark insane asylum... anxiously waiting for something to happen.<br/><br/>The images were also beautifully shot and the performances of all of the talent were outstanding. The only part I feel the where the film suffers is that the story's conclusion was predictable. As you are watching the film, you will realize that there is only one of two ways the movie will end: either Leonardo's character is going to be convinced he's insane by the evil doctors when he's really not or he is really an insane patient and the doctors are right. You will be even less surprised if you have already seen the Christopher Nolan film ""Memento"" because the plot basically has the same outline. However, Shutter Island is not a total rip-off of Memento, despite its similarity. It's still a well-crafted psychological thriller telling a story that is not very commonly heard."
"grinchbkb","7","2","6","22 February 2010"," Above average, but a worrying lack of ambition from Scorsese
","Almost two decades after the release of Cape Fear, it seems that this minor opus from a major American director was more of a turning point than anybody would have thought at the time. Considered as a slight bow to the mainstream, it was in fact an entire new direction. <br/><br/>Martin Scorsese's latest studio effort, Shutter Island, a period thriller with a schizophrenic twist a la M Night Shyamalan, adapted from Dennis Lehane eponymous best- seller, sums up what kind of filmmaker Scorsese has become in the last twenty years: a gifted craftsman, a world apart from the rebellious neurotic genius he was in the 1970s. One can easily draw parallels between the two films: retro atmosphere, B-movie material, some cheap thrills enhanced by a bit of gore and a soundtrack of Herrmann-esque strings constantly on the verge of parody. In an interview given during the promotion of Cape Fear and compiled in Scorsese: Inteviews by Peter Brunette, the filmmaker ironically calls his remake of Thompson's thriller a ""real movie"", an ""A-to-B-to-C film"": the same category that Shutter Island falls into. It is what the French would call an exercice de style – a shot at making a codified, straight genre picture, a mere study of style over substance. <br/><br/>Shutter Island tells the story of Teddy Daniels, a federal agent sent to a remote asylum on a barren island, home of America's most dangerous and deranged criminals, to investigate the disappearance of a murderess. The mystery soon thickens and Daniels realises that he may be at the centre of a frightening conspiracy. The problem with Shutter Island is that, even viewed as a ""guilty pleasure"" offering from a respectable auteur, it is not entirely successful. <br/><br/>Aesthetically, the film is often gorgeous: the set and costumes are incredibly accurate to Lehane descriptions; every shot is expertly framed and an abundance of Scorsese's cinephilic obsessions will satisfy the knowing viewer: a Powell & Pressburger homage here, (the spiral staircase from The Red Shoes, the high angle shot of the cliff from Black Narcissus), a Samuel Fuller reference there (Shock Corridor is still the benchmark of all asylum movies). The dream scenes are vivid, thanks to Robert Richardson's brightly contrasted photography (he was after all the man who shot all those glaring neons and flashy suits in Casino), particularly the concentration camp flashbacks: the haunting glimpse at a pile of corpses petrified in ice and the agony of the German officer are powerful tableaux of human savagery. <br/><br/>But despite all its graphic excellence, Shutter Island fails to be Scorsese's Shinning. Mainly because of its weak material: it is hard to recognise the touch of the writer of Gone Baby Gone or the contributor to The Wire in this half-baked story, which re-use a clunky final twist already seen in half a dozen films since Fight Club and his split-personality narrator. The flaws of the pedestrian script are laid-bare by the ridiculous length of the film, clocking at more than 2 hours and half, which is over-zealously faithful to Lehane's book and struggles to sustain interest in the plot past the first act. The delays in the film post-production (Shutter Island was shot in 2008 and its release reported several times last year) seem to indicate that Scorsese did not find the solution in the editing room, where he is usually at his best. <br/><br/>Generally, Shutter Island is victim of its sophistication. Scorsese, who should know how to wrap a B-movie since he went to Roger Corman's school back in the early seventies, pushes all the right buttons but the overall seriousness of the direction kills the joy. As usual, DiCaprio is not bad but remains bland, just as the rest of the cast, who all seem so impressed to work with the legendary director that they are unable to deliver a memorable performance. <br/><br/>Sadder is to see Scorsese gradually abandoning his themes and visual signatures (the virtuoso tracking shots, the reckless editing) in favour of a studio approach to film-making – flawless but impersonal. Now an Oscar-winner for his mediocre The Departed, the maverick has joined the ranks of the Hollywood establishment. Shutter Island is far from a total failure, but with all the talent involved, it feels a bit like a waste of everyone's time.<br/><br/>ggendron.wordpress.com"
"sjb_can","7","2","6","21 February 2010"," Hitchcock-esquire, atmospheric mystery that held me comfortably in my seat for 2 1/2 hours.
","I wish I could experience the movie without having read the book. A mystery isn't very mysterious when you know the outcome. I was interested and entertained, but not enthralled. Unfortunately, except for Ben Kingsley's perfect performance (as usual), over-acting ran rampant. That coupled with the heavy, melodramatic music punctuating the brooding backdrop of a mental asylum on a rocky island with a hurricane lashing its shores, it was more typical of a movie for audiences of the 1950's than 2010. Perhaps Scorcese wanted it that way since it was set in 1954. I found it a little over the top. If it had been toned down just a notch, I think I'd have given it at least an 8. The story was complex and compelling in its own right and handled pretty well; however, I wonder if the atmosphere got in the way a bit."
"DonFishies","8","2","6","21 February 2010"," The trip to Shutter Island is worthwhile if only for DiCaprio's amazing performance
","There are only a handful of filmmakers whose work I compulsively follow and run out instantaneously on or near their film's release date to see. But there are very few filmmakers who can make a movie, not a predetermined blockbuster, feel like an event. Yet somehow, Martin Scorsese manages to do it every time. And when Shutter Island was delayed from October 2009 until February 2010, you can imagine how disappointed I felt. But it helped build the anticipation even greater.<br/><br/>U.S. Marshall Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his new partner Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo) are sent to the titular island to investigate the disappearance of a patient at Ashecliffe Hospital in 1954. The hospital houses the criminally insane in various buildings, including some of the worst offenders in the country. As the pair begins interviewing doctors, nurses, patients and the like, they quickly realize not everything is right at Shutter Island. And with a ferocious storm heading their way and Daniels suffering from recurring hallucinations, getting out intact may be even harder than discovering the truth.<br/><br/>Let me be clear on this, Marty Scorsese never makes bad films. He makes flawed films, he makes overly long self-indulgent films, he makes good films, he makes great films, and he makes brilliant films, but never bad films. Coming off his historic Oscar win for The Departed, it was clear Shutter Island was not even going to attempt to come close to repeating how incredible that film was. But in spite of that, Shutter Island comes off as a good movie but one that has flaws Scorsese easily could have corrected.<br/><br/>The film is a slow burn of a mystery-inspired thriller. There are a lot of macguffins, a lot of inconsistencies and plenty of clues scattered throughout the film (almost surpassing the body count of The Departed), but it has a lot of trouble translating into something truly inspiring. When the film really begins unravelling and eventually hits its eye-opening climax, it becomes just as awesome as we all know Scorsese films can be. But for the most part, the content comes off as alternating between incredibly boring or incredibly fascinating. There is no middle ground at any point in the film, and I found the experience to be maddening in a lot of instances because the film just could not deliver on how incredible its trailer was. To me, Scorsese has always had a problem with the length of his films (looking simply at his last four films, two are pushing three hours in length and none are under two hours), and Shutter Island makes it incredibly clear how big a problem this can quickly become. For a thriller to be as riveting as it needs to be, it needs to keep the audience on its toes throughout its runtime. And unfortunately, Shutter Island only manages to do this half the time.<br/><br/>Equally aggravating is the use of green-screening and special effects in the film. In some instances, it almost looks amateur in how badly edited some scenes are. It is fairly common knowledge that few films in 2010 feature the actors on actual sets but more often on special effects soundstages, but many of them trick the audience into thinking it is all real with some really good editing techniques. It seems these same techniques were only employed half the time for Shutter Island and with how much of a master craftsman Scorsese is, he really should have known better and put more time into ensuring the film looked perfect. And with a five month delay, there is next to no excuse for why some scenes cheapen the look of the entire film.<br/><br/>But even if Scorsese is faltering as a filmmaker, DiCaprio continues to strengthen as an actor. He carries the film entirely on his shoulders, and never once do we take his conviction for granted. Daniels is a war veteran who suffers from hallucinations, and DiCaprio breathes depth, sorrow, anger, confusion and genuine fear into every frame he occupies. He is the focus of the entire film, and he fills its running time with a complex character that nearly makes his Oscar-nominated turn as Howard Hughes feel juvenile. The man continues to grow as an actor, and with each new role he takes on, he is moving ever closer to his eventual acting Oscar. And after seeing his whirlwind of emotions on display here and his emotionally devastating role in Revolutionary Road (the real film Kate Winslet deserved an Oscar for last year), I can only hope it comes very soon.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is all excellent in their roles. Ruffalo continues to impress as a supporting actor. He has yet to truly master leading man status, but he plays off with DiCaprio better with each scene that passes. Max von Sydow, John Carroll Lynch and especially Ben Kingsley all deliver great performances as the main members of staff Daniels and Aule encounter. The three of them are just great alternating between being cooperative and sinister all at once. Michelle Williams is an even bigger standout, despite the trailer giving away her main function in the film. I would have liked to have seen a whole lot more from Emily Mortimer, Patricia Clarkson, Ted Levine, Elias Koteas and Jackie Earle Haley however. As great as they all are, they all appear basically in extended cameos. A little disappointing for how haunting their parts all turn out to be.<br/><br/>If you can look past its boring sequences, the trip to Shutter Island is worthwhile. It is a good movie, but it falls short of greatness. DiCaprio is truly amazing in his role, but I cannot help but feel disappointed in the film as a whole. It easily could have been much better, but I think the five month delay ended up being more detrimental than beneficial for it.<br/><br/>8/10."
"Reel_starz","8","2","6","21 February 2010"," Scorsese and DiCaprio keep their streak alive with ""Shutter Island""
","Shutter Island is finally here. The latest film to pair director Martin Scorsese and actor Leonardo DiCaprio opens in February, roughly five months later than the original October 2009 date. However, all concerns about the movie's quality (Paramount has said the move was made for financial reasons, anyway) can now be officially cast aside. The wait was well-worth it.<br/><br/>The source material is a (fantastic) novel by Dennis Lehane, who has already had two of his other books adapted for the screen and is no stranger to this process. As a huge fan of Lehane's work, I have largely been disappointed by the adaptations; Clint Eastwood's direction rendered the powerful and emotional drama Mystic River cold and distant, while Gone Baby Gone, though a definite improvement over the former movie, felt a little too bogged down in the seriousness of the story and moral dilemmas, losing much of the charm and humor of the book along the way. Fortunately, with the arrival of Shutter Island, I can now say that we have a Lehane adaptation done right. At this rate of improvement, the next one ought to be a full-blown masterpiece.<br/><br/>Then again, perhaps it shouldn't be a surprise that Scorsese would be the one to finally get it right. Both he and Lehane have a penchant for urban crime dramas, getting down-and-dirty in the grittiness of city life while maintaining a level of dark humor to offset the occasionally nauseating realism. Shutter Island represents a departure for both of them. It is the only time so far that Dennis Lehane has come close to writing horror, while Scorsese has only attempted the genre once before, with the 1991 Cape Fear. Inexperience matters not, as, though it is certainly different from the rest of their work, Shutter Island is the product of people who truly know their craft. Though Scorsese emphasizes the horror/creepy elements of the plot more, they seem to mostly be on the same page, down to, according to interviews, the works that influenced them and their sources for inspiration - namely, the horror and noir genres of the '50s through the '70s.<br/><br/>Indeed, Shutter Island is set in the 1950s and is more like an old-fashioned psychological thriller than the slasher-horror movies of late. The strings-heavy score, though initially a tad bit overdone, brings to mind Stanley Kubrick's The Shining at times and, combined with the cinematography, art direction and Scorsese's trademark single-camera technique, produces both an intense atmosphere of suspense and the aura of a Hitchcock film or the 1960's classic The Manchurian Candidate.<br/><br/>For his latest venture, Martin Scorsese brings together one of the most eye-popping ensemble casts in any movie since, well, The Departed. As with that movie, the actors - including Mark Ruffalo, Ben Kingsley, Michelle Williams, Max von Sydow, Emily Mortimer, Jackie Earle Haley and, of course, the aforementioned Leo DiCaprio - prove here that they've got talent to go along with their names, which are certainly well-known in the more avid film-lovers community, if not the general public. Despite their relatively limited screen time (Mortimer and Haley only have one scene each), the major players in the supporting cast all get a moment to shine and they take full advantage of it, each of them delving into his role with vigor and creating complex, three-dimensional beings, not just the flat characters that populate most thrillers.<br/><br/>But, in terms of acting, the movie unarguably belongs to Leonardo DiCaprio. Perfectly cast, he brings U.S. Marshal Teddy Daniels to life, capturing every contradiction and nuance of character depicted in the book while adding his own natural mannerisms and depth; he combines the two with the ease of a pro. There are only a few actors working today that can be fully convincing when asked to cry one minute and kill a person the next, when they must simultaneously exude vulnerability and aggression; DiCaprio is one of those few. His intensity and deftness in performances like this make you wonder why he does not yet have an Oscar.<br/><br/>However, aside from the technical expertise on display, perhaps what most elevates Shutter Island above your generic suspense thriller is the intelligence and depth of the story. Set in a time when the country was still recovering from the atrocities of World War II and the Nazis while fear of Communism was blossoming into full-on paranoia, it raises questions about the ethics and morals of the time period. Shutter Island explores the very nature of sanity and violence, reminding us how volatile the human mind really is; one wrong push and anyone could cross the thin line that separates reason from madness. How should we treat those that do cross that line? Though the field of psychology has come far since the Cold War, that is a question that still plagues us. Should we treat them as patients, with compassion and hope that they can be cured, or as prisoners, as dangerous threats that should be guarded and isolated from society? Still, at its core, Shutter Island is an entertaining and, at times, chilling thriller. The film-makers never forget that, sustaining a tone of suspense throughout the movie and never allowing philosophical musings to overwhelm the plot or characters.<br/><br/>Over the past decade, Scorsese and DiCaprio have proved to be among the most reliable director-actor pairings working in Hollywood today. Even their weakest effort, Gangs of New York, was a solid and fun, if uneven, project. All three of their collaborations thus far have earned multiple Oscar nominations, including Best Picture. It remains to be seen whether they will continue this run with Shutter Island, which is probably the most commercial and least awards-friendly movie of the four, but they should be proud of the work they've done here, regardless of what happens come awards season. Shutter Island is a high-quality film that works as pure entertainment and as something a little deeper. Guys, you've have done it again."

","SHUTTER ISLAND is based on a novel by popular mystery writer Dennis Lehane, who likes to add a gimmick or twist to many of his novels. SHUTTER ISLAND is no exception, and in fact contains several twists. Leo DiCaprio plays a federal marshal in the 1950s looking into the disappearance of a patient from a hospital for the criminally insane. The asylum is on an island near Boston. Once on the island, the marshal finds he can trust no one -- not the psychiatrists, played by Ben Kingsley and Max Von Sydow, and certainly not any of the staff. He also finds he cannot even trust his new partner (played by the affable Mark Ruffalo) who at one point warns him they could become permanent residents of the island if they don't watch out. To make matters worse, the marshal is subject to hallucinations. He sees his wife, who is dead. at every turn and has frequent flashbacks to his time in the military, liberating Dachau. Then a hurricane hits the island and the power goes out. Directed by Martin Scorsese, the movie is a psychological thriller with horror movie overtones. While on the long side, it moves at a decent pace and the special effects are first-rate. Your tolerance for this surreal and ultimately downbeat movie will largely depend on your tolerance for DiCaprio, (he is fine here, although I would have preferred Brad Pitt in the role), and the almost comical shenanigans going on in the spooky old asylum. And be warned: The movie gets pretty nasty, which Scorsese movies tend to. For those confused or disappointed by the ending, read the book. The book's ending is cut-and-dried, leaving no question as to what transpired. The movie's ending is left open to interpretation, which is certainly the director's and/or screenwriter's right."
"AwesometownReviews","7","2","6","20 February 2010"," Scorcese hasn't lost his touch!
","I love Martin Scorcese. There are few filmmakers in the history of cinema who are as capable of crafting a cinematic tour de force as he is. He is part of a great generation of filmmakers that includes Steven Spielberg, George Lucas and Francis Ford Coppola, and of that generation he is the only one who is still consistently pumping out kick-ass movies. All of the filmmakers above have each directed at least one total stinker.<br/><br/>Not Marty though.<br/><br/>For me, Scorcese's films generally fall into three categories. There are the masterpieces, this category includes the indisputably awesome Raging Bull, Goodfellas, Taxi Driver and The Departed; there are his films that while good, for one reason or another fall shy of greatness, these include Bringing Out the Dead, Gangs of New York, Kundun and Casino; finally there are the films where it seems he's stepping outside of his comfort zone and experimenting with different genres. This last category includes his remake of Cape Fear, After Hours, The King of Comedy and his latest film, Shutter Island.<br/><br/>Shutter Island is Scorcese's first foray into the horror genre since 1991's Cape Fear. The film, based on a book (which I have not read) of the same title by novelist Dennis Lehane, is set in the 1950's on an island in Boston Harbor that houses a psychiatric institution for the criminally insane. Leonardo Dicaprio and Mark Ruffalo play a pair of U.S Marshals who travel to the island in order to investigate an escaped inmate. Once on the island, the Marshals quickly realize that everyone, including the two lead psychiatrists (portrayed by the always great Ben Kingsley and Max Von Sydow) are keeping secrets from them. It is clear that there is more going on than they had originally expected, paranoia and claustrophobia ensue. This is an extremely tough film to write about without giving anything away, and I strongly recommend that you get yourselves to the theater and check this one out as blindly as possible.<br/><br/>The entire cast deliver outstanding performances, and if this film were released later in the year I would say that Dicaprio would be guaranteed a nomination for next years Oscar. I hope that the Academy, not prized for their long term memory, can keep ol' Leo in mind. This is absolutely the most deeply layered and interesting role he has ever tackled.<br/><br/>To be honest, there are issues that I have with this film. Again, I'm walking a thin line here while trying to say something without really saying anything, but I will say that in the hands of lesser talent this film could have been a silly convoluted mess. However, in the exquisitely clever paws of Scorcese, and with the enormous amount of talent on the screen, the end result is an extremely creepy, atmospheric thriller that's sure to crawl around in your brain for hours after you finish viewing it.<br/><br/>3.75 / 5 on the Awesome Meter"
"gilligan-11","6","2","6","19 February 2010"," Not Scorsese's best...
","I'm not sure exactly what is was about this film that didn't work for me—perhaps the fact that I've read the book and knew the ""twist"" at the end ruined it for me—but there was something about ""Shutter Island"" that never quite got up to speed. DiCaprio was solid, as always, Ben Kingsley did his usual classy, impressive job, the film looked great (some very Hitchcockian tones and textures), the music was good, and the script was well done. The flashback/fantasy sequences might have been somewhat over the top (Peter Jackson indulged himself in the same way in ""The Lovely Bones""), and overall this movie was just not as good as the sum of its parts. Not Scorsese's best, but even that's better than the work of most directors."

"CinemaClown","Null","1","2","17 January 2020"," Martin Scorsese At His Most Unrestrained & Unapologetic
","Shutter Island happens to be the first Martin Scorsese film that I actually loved. Considered by many to be a departure from his usual forte, this neo-noir psychological thriller isn't rated highly by his most devoted followers but I'd argue that it is right up there with his finest directorial efforts.<br/><br/>An ingeniously structured, intelligently layered & impressively acted genre delight that's dark, delirious & discombobulating, Shutter Island finds Scorsese indulging in unapologetic genre thrills, and also presents Leonardo DiCaprio in outstanding form as he adds yet another spectacular performance to his résumé.<br/><br/>Pervaded with an air of mystery & sense of foreboding, the film effectively builds on its interesting premise, and only gets more gripping, thrilling & suspenseful as plot progresses. Scorsese keeps the plot faithful to its source material while eerie camerawork, tight editing & menacing music keeps the tense aura alive n kicking.<br/><br/>Leading from the front is DiCaprio whose riveting input & magnetic presence only amps our interest & investment in his character's journey. And he's well supported by Mark Ruffalo, Ben Kingsley, Max von Sydow & Michelle Williams who all chip in with sturdy performances of their own. In short, the entire ensemble delivers and leave nothing to complain about.<br/><br/>Overall, Shutter Island is a smartly directed, cleverly scripted & strongly acted mystery thriller that effortlessly sustains its chilling ambience from start to finish and is highly reminiscent of Hitchcock's thrillers. One of the best films of its year that keeps the viewers guessing at all times and makes fab use of genre elements to keep things taut & exciting, the 4th collaboration between Scorsese & DiCaprio is another quality work."

","While everyone in the reviews section is busy talking how this movie has an amazing plot twist, I would like to stress out something else. While all of that is true, you should also note that the location on which this movie takes place could be seen like a state of mind. Whole movie is actually one psychological journey, full of suspense, discovery, denial and constant dance of truth and lie. It has an amazing atmosphere, acting and in some scenes border on pure horror with clever use of sound and visuals. There is also a sense of freedom in interpretation of the movie, and when the movie makes me think about it for a long time after watching it, it really mean's it something extraordinary.

","So I read the book, and have to say the film is 100% faithful to it, absolutely perfect. But, after finishing the book I had lots of doubts about what exactly happened, I didn't really understand the ending. Now, after watching the movie it became crystal clear.
Teddy was really Andrew Laeddis, and in the scene almost at the end (2:04:00) where he wakes up from the fainting, he really accepts that he is Laeddis and Dr. Cawley wants to help him, but he has no thoughts yet about the lobotomy. However, a few days later in the next scene he is still his real self as Laeddis, but he is already afraid that he will regress again as he always did before. Therefore when talking to Dr. Sheenan and he already decides that he wants to get healed for good and also accepts possible death (""What should be worse? To live as a monster, or die as a good man?""), therefore he pretends to have regressed so that they perform the lobotomy on him - Dr. Sheenan buys this, calls him Teddy after he signals to Dr. Cawley that the lobotomy already is inevitable."

","In a career littered with cinematic masterpieces and beloved gems, Shutter Island sometimes appears to be one of the more forgotten about Martin Scorsese films, living in the shadows of granddaddy's like Goodfellas, Casino and The Departed but there's no doubt this pulpy, over the top and entirely great thriller is one of the living legends most accessible and enjoyable rides.<br/><br/>Adapted from Dennis Lehane's book of the same name, Shutter Island is a rained drenched and atmospheric mystery with more intrigue, suspense and twists and turns than you can count, as Scorsese and his favourite leading man Leonardo DiCaprio get caught up in a missing persons case on the haunting lunatic asylum island that houses the Ashecliffe Hospital, run by its potentially devious boss Dr. Crawley, played with gleeful intensity by Sir Ben Kingsley.<br/><br/>Filled with stunning shots by DOP Robert Richardson, a moody and nerve rattling score and fantastic supporting turns from the likes of Mark Ruffalo, Max von Sydow, Michelle Williams, Emily Mortimer, Patricia Clarkson and Jackie Earle Haley, Shutter Island is a complete of a picture as one would expect from a filmmaker of the caliber of Scorsese with the bonus being Shutter Island feels almost like three films in one.<br/><br/>At first a more straight up mystery that morphs slowly into a horror like battle against the mind and potential nefarious forces that then becomes a haunting examination of trauma and grief, Scorsese ensures that Shutter Island is jam-packed with memorable imagery, unexpected detours and contemplative questions too become so much more than the film the synopsis or narrative might at first suggest.<br/><br/>It's a wild ride and one that the first viewing will take many by complete surprise that's enhanced by a terrific DiCaprio performance that must surely rank amongst some of the best work the leading man has ever done.<br/><br/>Great in other Scorsese efforts Gangs of New York, The Aviator and The Departed, for my mind DiCaprio's turn as the traumatized widower and war veteran turned U.S Marshall Teddy Daniels is one of the actors most assured performances.<br/><br/>Tasked with inhabiting a range of different emotions and character traits, DiCaprio's transformative turn as a man battling his own demons as well as the demons of the island is awards worthy and a main reason why Shutter Island is still so regarded by casual viewers to this day.<br/><br/>A unique film in both a genre sense and in Scorsese's career sense, Shutter Island may not get the plaudits that its other Scorsese relatives get but there's no reason to suggest this isn't as good or even better than many of its other highly regarded bloodline.<br/><br/>Final Say -<br/><br/>A seriously enjoyable and deeply haunting experience, Shutter Island sees Scorsese and DiCaprio on the top of their game, having fun, exploring important themes and making movies like only the best of them can dare dream to do.<br/><br/>5 magic glasses of water out of 5"

"ronakkotian","9","1","2","10 August 2019"," You may go insane...
","Martin Scorsese is a director who I've always respected. All the films that I have seen of his are outstanding. Shutter Island proves why he's such a talented director.<br/><br/>Back in 2010 when Shutter Island came out, it only got mildly positive reviews and didn't really win many awards which is something I don't understand. This movie is a gem that is equally interesting and intense.<br/><br/>The cinematography in this movie is great. This is a movie which requires the full attention of the audience. When I saw this movie, especially on my second viewing, I noticed many clever hidden clues and details that were so purposeful to the main storyline. The music is really good. It forms this ominous notion that leaves a cold feeling in your stomach.<br/><br/>Our main star, Leonardo DiCaprio, gave one of the finest peformances of his career. DiCaprio invoked a variety of emotions to his character which made us really care about him. Mark Ruffalo was also really good but I felt that if someone else would've done his role, they might've done a better job. Ben Kingsley gave a really good performance as well. Michelle Williams is such a good actress and she shows it here. The level of depth and emotion she brings out to her short but meaningful role is incredible. She is terrific here.<br/><br/>Having seen the movie twice, my appreciation towards this film grew a lot. The writer, Laeda Kalogridis, did the source material justice. Her script brought so many twists and turns to the plot that I had completely no idea where the film was headed. I loved the sense of ambiguity given to the story and its characters as it made the ending of the film much more surprising. The screenplay along with Scorsese's direction made it feel larger than life. Scorsese used this script and his approach to directing it was marvellous. The atmosphere created throughout is consistent. There is a constant sense of intensity and suspense lurking within each shot. As the film progresses, it starts to get more insane and this feeling of insanity is what goes through your and Teddy Daniels' mind. This allows us to relate to Daniels and be with him on a personal level. There are many subtleties that are included in the framing of the shot which Scorsese purposely implemented. That's what makes Shutter Island a smart film.<br/><br/>If you watch the movie once, you may notice a few editing errors. However, after seeing it again, you perceive those errors in a different perspective and realise that there is a reasoning for it. That's the beauty of Shutter Island. Each viewing gets better and better as you discover more and more. If you haven't seen this movie, I urge you now to go see it as soon as possible."
"gokselcin","9","1","2","7 August 2019"," A great psychological drama
","I've watched many movies of Scorsese. He loves picturing inner worlds of characters. Psychological context is a major element of his storytelling style.
Beyond Scorsese's general storytelling preferences, Shutter Island not only focuses on psycohological motivations of characters, but also it is a movie that directly deals with psychology.<br/><br/>It can be said that this movie's most magnificent feature underlies its ability to make viewer feel a profound emphaty with characters.<br/><br/>Who are insane? How can we distunguish if a person is insane or not? How can people assumed to be insane disprove their insanity; would we easily be convinced to them? Can you easily accept insanity diagnosis about you?
All these questions find very powerful answers in this movie."

"adamcoyne","8","1","2","26 May 2019"," Why all the 1's? Really guys???
","Martin Scorsese is without a doubt in the running as one of the best American filmmakers of all time. He is just brilliant, and I can't think of a film of his that I've seen which I didn't at least think deserved credit for it's efforts. You can always feel the labor of love in every frame.<br/><br/>Is this Goodfellas? Taxi Driver? Raging Bull? The Aviator? Far from it. But, I've always held this film in high regard because Scorsese went for something that he had never done before. You can say of course that he pulled off some thriller/suspense/horror with Cape Fear, which hinged greatly on De Niro's performance, but with Shutter Island, there's just an... atmosphere to it that is so brilliantly realized. Writing-wise, I don't think it's Lehane's best work. Marty though, he took this material and, in working with Richardson and the rest of the crew, created something truly memorable. A great cast as well, with Leo driving it home as always.<br/><br/>It was pretty predictable, and has some flaws, sure, and I understand those complaints. But, it's not so much that the plot always needs to surprise us, perhaps just entertain us and compel us. Scorsese knows how to do that. He does things with this film (especially visually) that he had never done, and hasn't done since.<br/><br/>As a film lover, I'm proud to have it as a part of my collection, -- well, I own all of Marty's films so maybe I'm just biased, ha -- but I really do think it's something special, and a must-see for any lover of cinema. Don't pay attention to some of these extremely negative reviews and give it a chance! As always, with film, keep an open mind!"

","Martin Scorsese is already a directing legend.

I don't usually take jabs at reviewers since I try to respect everyone's opinion...but frankly in this case a lot of the ""professional critics"" that panned it come across as plain ignorant in their commentary.<br/><br/>One national media outlet simply said the film is ""weird"", had some kind of hissy fit over the dead kids shown in the Holocaust scenes and then gave it a bad score. It's a psychological drama, and you don't expect it to be ""weird""? And you can't see the obvious thematic parallel between the Holocaust scenes and a character's personal tragedies? Jesus wept.<br/><br/>I digress. The film itself is about US Marshal Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his partner Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo) exploring an offshore mental institution, the eponymous Shutter Island.<br/><br/>The two agents are there to uncover a sinister conspiracy lead by the intelligent and oddly intimidating Dr. Cawley (Ben Kingsley) and I will say no more lest I ruin the movie.<br/><br/>The film contains a brilliant ending in which one sentence delivered masterfully by DiCaprio changes practically the entire meaning of the story.<br/><br/>Kingsley is at his peak playing a character full of both empathy and menace. Finally, Scorsese does a wonderful job with his direction, playing constantly with deliberate continuity errors and other such visual oddities in order to wring a potent atmosphere of confusion and delirium from the very first shot of the film.<br/><br/>It's a 10/10 for me, since I cannot think of any rightful criticism of this great psychological character drama. Wonderful film-making."

'Shutter Island' is a psychological puzzle with a terrific development of the plot.

"SofiCastle","8","1","2","7 February 2019"," The horror
","Shutter Island made me look up the liberation of the Dachau concentration camp. What a dive into insanity that was. In the film, it is supposed to explain Ted's PTSD. But in reality, it is there to remind us that insanity is in everyone. The SS that killed all those people and let them rot right next to them, living with decaying corpses and just waiting for the Americans.. And the soldiers who snapped and executed them. After reading about all that, I was so upset I couldn't go on watching the film.
So I got back to it on a different time. This was a good film. Contrary to what a lot of commentators seem to regret, this was not designed as a cheap thrills movie with a forced twist plot that was supposed to catch us unaware. Ten minutes in, we do begin to suspect Teddy is, in fact, a patient. So what. I mean, that was not the point, people. Ted (or Andrew) was a good man, a war hero, an all American golden boy who got traumatized so bad in the war that he lost it; he started drinking, neglected his wife and refused to see she needed help, thus exposing his kids to inevitable danger. I can totally see why a psychiatrist with progressive ideas would go to great lengths to try and help this kind of man. A good man fighting his self imposed delusions. Whether this whole charade could have helped, I have no idea - I am no psychiatrist. However, I find it incredible that so many commentators would actually prefer to see a film in which Ted's delusions would be true: the Nazi psychiatrist conducting experiments on criminally insane prisoners held in Bedlam-like conditions in a weird fortress on a cut-off island. Not to mention those who flaunt their knowledge of German expressionism by acting offended because The cabinet of Dr. Caligari, a silent film from 1920, also had this idea of a delusional young mental patient. That film is excellent, the twist plot is amazing if you think it was done a hundred years ago, but Shutter Island is simply not about that. This is a film on trauma."

","11 June 2010. Sometimes a movie can fool one once, but rarely can it do it twice and by the end of this movie, it's anybody's guess (though probably not). There's a number of technical, logical flaws that appear in this movie, yet by flipping it, it can also become a superb example of psychologically performed movie right to the end. It's also almost impossible to discuss this perhaps predictable, perhaps not predictable movie without offering spoilers as this movie really to be fairly experienced can't really be described in any detail. The movie must proceed on its own in a linear fashion. What will be of more finely nuanced interest is whether there is any real longer term, lasting cinematic brilliance on a second viewing. Regardless, this one time experience like its predecessors which will become evident by movies end seems to have raised the bar even further and become a tribute to this psychological thriller genre, one of the best to come along in years. Perhaps, the only real difficulties with this movie is the seemingly overt, perhaps over-use of special effects during the first third of the movie and the perhaps too finely imbalance in how the second third of the movie plays on the imagination of the viewer."
"armanairlighting","9","1","2","12 January 2019"," JUMP TO ""OVERALL"" FOR NON SPOILER SHORT REVEIW
","Shutter Island:<br/><br/>The film starts with detective Teddy (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Chuck (Mark Ruffalo) in a ferry.
Starts rather wisely, but the background seems unrealistic and acting was alright; the movie goes on and it does amazing keeping you thrilled, curious which makes you want to follow it; I never got bored in it. Even though I didn't like visionary (from visionary I mean shots taken and then merged together); Martin's work with the motion picture is phenomen(t)al. It gets you into feels, makes you be with Teddy all through the story, like you're Teddy yourself!
The story was really good at hiding a lot of stuff, it planted clues and small things that no one would think that they're useful; but the owner of the place uses every single one of them in the climax. This is another part which Martin did a brilliant job getting you into feels with picture; it sent the audience enough feelings to trick people into Teddy being actually insane, and some other thought it's just a game and they're playing with Teddy.
From my point of view; like how you probably found out a few lines before, Teddy is sane; and they didn't succeed making him insane either; however, the story has planted both clues that Teddy is insane or sane, but I chose sane side; I'm not here to discuss if he's sane or not so I'm gonna continue criticising the rest of the movie.
The ending was short and simple, shown just with motion picture, but it left audience with an ""I need more"" feeling; yet it ended smartly anyway.<br/><br/>Overall, the story is amazing; thrilling, truly mysterious and keeps you going to catch up.
Martin Scorsese gets you into the movie's feels with motion picture; and cinema IS about motion picture; so he did a perfect job creating an atmosphere.
The score was good-great, wouldn't say completely great, nor amazing. But I still liked it.
There might've been some parts that felt unrealistic (like ferry scene's background) but they weren't much.
I didn't really like how Martin ordered the shots to be taken at times; specially when two people were having conversations; but throughout the movie I think it improved.
And for acting, I think it improved throughout the movie as well.
It's a must see movie; I recommend it to everyone 👍🏻<br/><br/>Rating: 9/10"

","This is a spoiler-free review.<br/><br/>This movie's ending (which I will avoid spoiling) is EMOTIONALLY GUT WRENCHING. Do NOT spoil this movie for yourself. It is best watched without researching ANYTHING. Moving On.<br/><br/>This movie marks the return of the Dynamic Director-Actor Duo Martin Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio, which is always a good sign, what with Inception among other movies.<br/><br/>From the get-go, the film seems visually stunning, with one of the most amazing filming locations I've ever seen. The time period of our setting being the 1950's, everything fits in : The medical practices, the clothes, the language used ; it's all meticulously crafted into one hell of a story.<br/><br/>Our Main Character and Protagonist, played by none other than Leonardo DiCaprio, is a U.S. Marshall and Ex-WWII soldier with a tragic backstory. He is sent to investigate a case involving an escaped patient at a Mental Institution for the Criminally Insane, accompanied by his partner ""Chuck"".<br/><br/>However, he gets suspicious of the establishment, making discoveries, alongside his partner, that there is something much bigger than just housing for the mentally unstable. This leads to one of the most divisive, and genuinely amazing, endings I've ever witnessed. I can only use one comment to describe the ending without spoiling anything :<br/><br/>That twist will hit you so hard you could pass for a pack of Twizzlers by the end of it.<br/><br/>The script is incredibly well crafted, taking into account every detail that will lead up to an amazing finale. Every single scene in the movie offers something to the ending. It is truly one of the most remarkable executions of a storytelling I've ever witnessed. Even things you would believe to be pointless and thrown into the film just to make sure people expecting an action movie don't nod off, comes back full circle.<br/><br/>As for the plot's believability, it's crafted well enough to pass, but that would only be the case were it set in modern times. This movie is set in the 1950's, which changes everything in this movie from ""Hardly Believable"" to ""Completely Plausible"". The suspension of disbelief in this movie is used to it's maximum potential.<br/><br/>The Characters are built perfectly for the story, which only makes even more sense towards the ending.<br/><br/>And the final line of dialogue in the film is one of, if not the most, impactful line of dialogue I have ever seen delivered. It was done in such a way, that it only increases the questioning you had about the twist ten-fold.<br/><br/>The cinematography and lighting is ON POINT ! As well as the effects in the film. (Albeit a few cheesy moments in the dream scenes, but easily forgivable due to it being, well, a dream scene)<br/><br/>Overall AMAZING movie. When you can make something unimportant become important at the most crucial moment of a movie, and have it make PERFECT SENSE, you have my vote.<br/><br/>As a closing statement : Inception's ending ain't got jack on this. <br/><br/>If you don't like the ending, that's fine, but you have to give it credit, it'll leave you blown away for 30 minutes to a few hours, depending on how hard you take it."
"zkonedog","9","1","2","12 March 2017"," So Much More Than The ""Surprise Ending"" Movie Advertised
","By and large, I am a huge fan of films in the same genre of Shutter Island (thriller; big surprise at the end). A few of my favorites that come to mind are The Sixth Sense, The Others, and Identity. Shutter Island should, by all means, have had the same effect on me, but one key detail got in the way: the way the film was advertised.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, this film opens with a missing-persons investigation on Shutter Island, which houses the most dangerous mental asylum in the world. Detective Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) leads the investigation, and begins to discover that there is a lot more to Shutter Island than what meets the eye. I can't tell you any more out of fear of loosing major spoilers.<br/><br/>In terms of overall plot and acting, this film is excellent in nearly every sense. The mood is creepy, the acting is competent, and the plot throws you for multiple loops along the way before going for the KO in the final minutes. It is also one of those movies where it takes a little bit of time for all the themes to sink in. About an hour after viewing (or once my mind had finished sifting through things), I actually appreciated it more than while the credits were rolling.<br/><br/>However, the major problem with this film lies (sadly) in the way it was advertised. While watching those thriller classics I listed in the opening, I had absolutely no idea they would end with a huge twist, thus giving it all the more punch when it did occur. Shutter Island, though, was advertised as having ""the biggest mind-blowing ending ever"" (or something to that extent), and thus during the entire viewing I was guessing at what could REALLY be going on. Thus, while the ending was still shocking, it was already one of the many possible conclusions running through my head while the DVD was spinning, leading to less of a surprise. Perhaps I was just smart enough to figure things out, but I doubt it (!). I'm guessing that many attentive viewers went in with the same thought-processes as me, and maybe found themselves a bit underwhelmed by the ending for the same reason.<br/><br/>Thus, while Shutter Island is still an excellent addition to the ""Thriller"" genre, I would have appreciated it if they would have advertised it as a straight-forward cop drama, THEN thrown in the twist. Of course, the marketing crew likely played up the surprise ending to get butts in the seats, but for those thinking-viewers among us, it kind of cheapens the experience.<br/><br/>Update (7/1/17): After a recent re-watch of ""Shutter Island"", I moved it from 7 stars to 9 stars. For whatever reason, this was a movie almost solely advertised on the premise of its ""tricky ending"", and thus my first viewing of it came through that lens (I was constantly trying to out- guess the proceedings). ""Shutter Island"" is so much deeper and more nuanced than that, though, and a viewing without the hype helps that tremendously. This really is an excellent film no matter how one slices it."
"speedy-droid","9","1","2","26 August 2016"," Brilliant Psychological Thriller
","This little gem was worth an immediate Second Viewing, just to pick up on all of the ""little things"" that I missed the first time.<br/><br/>It's easy to just throw around the name ""Martin Scorsese"", and assume that the movie is going to be good. But the truth is that... sometimes... Scorsese is absolutely brilliant.<br/><br/>I haven't read the novel upon which this film is based, so all of my comments are based upon Scorsese's interpretation... not the novel, the Film.<br/><br/>The beauty of ""Shutter Island"" is that there really is no resolution at the end of the film. Was that really a guy deluding himself, trying to escape from the horrors of his own life, or was he still trapped inside of a drug-induced hallucination? Nobody knows.<br/><br/>He obviously knew, at the very end of the film, that by speaking to his ""partner?"", he was basically telling everyone that he had not been ""cured."" Was that a ""request"" to be lobotomized, so that he would never have to remember the horrors of his life again, or was it an acceptance of the fact that he would never escape from the island? Everyone assumes the former, but Scorsese leaves the question open."

It's something that messes with your brain. You're trying to find aN explanation and to put the pieces together, but at the end, you're just wrong. <br/><br/>For the people who read books; I can say that looking to this movie is kinda like reading a book and wanting to finish it in one night.

"sme_no_densetsu","8","1","2","24 July 2016"," Another quality team-up from Scorsese & DiCaprio
","Martin Scorsese's ""Shutter Island"" is based on the best-selling novel of the same name by Dennis Lehane, author of ""Mystic River"" and ""Gone, Baby, Gone"", among others. The story revolves around a missing persons case at an isolated hospital for the criminally insane circa 1954.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio plays Teddy Daniels, a U.S. Marshall sent to investigate the disappearance. However, he has already formulated his own hypothesis about the incident, one that involves secret government testing. The clues steadily accumulate, often creating more questions than answers, all the while ratcheting up the tension until we reach the final, climactic revelation.<br/><br/>DiCaprio does a good job of carrying the film in what develops into a challenging, multi-faceted role. He is given strong support from the likes of Mark Ruffalo, Ben Kingsley and Michelle Williams among several other notables in smaller roles. All in all, a talented ensemble cast.<br/><br/>Scorsese's direction is as sharp as ever and he creates a number of memorable scenes. Frequent collaborator Robbie Robertson (of The Band fame) supervised the music, selecting existing pieces, some of which are quite striking. Multiple Oscar winners Dante Ferretti (production design) & Robert Richardson (cinematography) were also key contributors to the movie's atmosphere & authenticity.<br/><br/>Having watched ""Shutter Island"" a couple of times now I feel that I have a better appreciation of the film's intricacies. Subtle touches that went unnoticed the first time around now take on new meanings with foreknowledge of the mystery's resolution. I have to admit that I was slightly disappointed by the story's conclusion on my initial viewing but the fact that the movie stands up to repeated viewings is a testament to the quality of its construction. Ultimately, ""Shutter Island"" certainly deserves to be seen once but I feel that a second viewing is key to experiencing everything that the movie has to offer."

Films that make you think and truly feel the thrill of not knowing which way the characters and/or story will head, are the sorts that are written and directed beautifully. DiCaprio and Ruffalo do an amazing job. Like in most their movies, you feel the characters and go on a literal and mental journey with them. This is a film that may at times appear slow if you do not get into it. You must be paying attention to detail and attempting to understand all the characters are trying to tell you.

","It's always a delight to see directors have a variety of genres in their careers that's one of the reasons a love Shutter Island so much it's something completely different from Scorsese. The editing and directing in this movie is fantastic Scorsese keeps the suspense and tension he was able to achieve with The Departed and uses it even better here adding a lot of mystery leaving the viewer guessing to the very last second. This became apparent in the dream sequences as they could have come across as pretentious and melodramatic but they fit in perfectly.This is definitely a movie that's best experienced knowing as little as possible because this first and foremost is an investigation movie and you want to be able to experience that investigation with the characters. Leonardo DiCaprio returns for his fourth collaboration with Martin Scorsese and he is fantastic in this movie not only is he a character the audience can get behind he is also very complex and makes sure DiCaprio can give it everything. Mark Ruffalo was also very good in this movie he was likable and subtle. Ben Kingsley isn't in the movie much but he definitely makes the most of that screen time. This was one of the best movies of 2010 and Scorsese' most underrated movie. 96% from me would absolutely recommend this movie."

","While investigating the disappearance of a murderess from a hospital for the criminally insane, US Marshal Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) comes to suspect the staff of using the prisoners for medical experiments.<br/><br/>Halfway through Martin Scorsese's Shutter Island and two possibilities crossed my mind: the first and most disconcerting was that the film would be a totally incomprehensible piece of self-indulgent surrealistic nonsense; my other concern was that, after two and half hours, it might finish with a supposedly clever but actually rather trite explanation for the events that had occurred—like the main character being one of the institute's patients, for example. But this is Scorsese, I reasoned, he surely wouldn't pull a Lynch or a Nolan on me.<br/><br/>Think again, Brett <br/><br/>After much confusion, Scorsese does indeed wrap up matters by revealing that Leonardo DiCaprio's character is a few sandwiches short of a picnic, having lost his marbles after shooting his wife for drowning their three children. It's far from the most unpredictable of twists, but—and this is a BIG 'but'—Scorsese's masterful direction (there's creepy atmosphere in abundance) and a strong central performance from DiCaprio ensure that the film is still a reasonably entertaining ride despite the frustratingly foreseeable denouement."

Leonardo is on top of the game, and supporting roles are just perfectly selected as Ben Kingsley(keep an eye on him) performed very well. Shutter island is very underrated, and it will only get more appraisals as time goes by. One of the best movies of new millennium.

"twistymantis","8","1","2","30 October 2014"," Great Movie
","In recent years, movies have been adding psychopaths or mentally unstable people into them. Shutter Island is yet another movie that revolves around that concept. Shutter Island though, is different from the rest. Shutter Island is a movie that will draw the attention of anyone who watches and it is quite possibly one of the best movies in the past ten years. It has everything needed for a great movie. The development of the characters in the movies makes it something special, something unlike any others movie. The actors are first class actors who fit their parts perfectly, and the plot is intriguing and twisted which always makes for a great film. One thing that makes Shutter Island such a great movie is the overall development and story behind the characters in the movie. This is especially true for the main character Edward ""Teddy"" Daniels, a US marshal, who is played by Leonardo DiCaprio. Teddy Daniels' story is one that continues to grow more and more intriguing throughout the movie. He is met in the opening scenes of the movie, and the viewers are given a slim glance into who he is. As the story continues to unfold, questions about Teddy and his past experiences continue to arise in flashbacks, forcing the viewer to continue watching, anxious to see what comes next. Though the main character, Teddy Daniels, is the most developed of all of the characters in the movie, the supporting characters add an eerie feel to the movie too. The patients in the hospital that are introduced throughout the movie are all, for the most part, strange, creepy characters, but the stories they tell are equally important, as they all begin to tie together and even give subtle hints to the ending of the movie. <br/><br/>The characters in the movie, Shutter Island, make the movie the masterpiece it is. These characters would be nothing though, if not fueled by the right actors. The cast for the film was brilliantly put together. Robert Cargill stated, ""The acting here is incredible. DiCaprio and Ruffalo lead a tremendous cast."" And he's right; they did indeed lead a great cast. The actors do a great job throughout the movie of fulfilling each of their roles and bringing their character to life. Leonardo, especially, does a great job of portraying the role of a US marshal stricken by grief following the loss of his family, as well as an ex-soldier plagued with the images of World War II. The superb acting makes the characters that more believable to the viewer. Other actors such as Patricia Clarkson, who played the role of ""Rachel 2"" also, do a great job of adding to the movies story. Even while only holding brief minutes on screen, Patricia's character becomes crucial in the movie's plot when Teddy meets her. She gives Teddy information which in essence serves as the turning point for the whole movie! <br/><br/>The plot of the film is most important in making it as great as it is though. ""From the opening shot, Scorsese creates an atmosphere of gloom and uncertainty that permeates the entire film."" says Jim Vejvoda. The first scene of the film is of Teddy Daniels and his partner riding to Shutter Island. The foggy mist rising up from the sea and the lack of sunshine peeking out through the clouds creates the eerie feel that continues throughout the rest of the movie. Teddy and his partner's reason for going to Shutter Island is made clear early in the movie. They are going in to help find a patient who escaped from a secured room just a few nights before. It turns out though, someone has alternative reasons for venturing to the island. Teddy is motivated by something deeper than just the missing patient. The man who killed Teddy's wife in an arson is supposedly a patient on Shutter Island, and Teddy wants to find him. Also, as the story progresses, an idea more sinister begins digging deep into Teddy's mind. He becomes increasingly weary of the Island's true intent and its operations. He believes that in the light house just on the edge of the island, doctors are performing Nazi like tests and he swears to expose and ""blow the top"" off of Shutter Island. These dark aspects of the plot make the movie that much more interesting and eventually leads to an unexpected, twisted ending. <br/><br/>There are tons of movies out there that revolve around creepy things like psychiatric hospitals and crazy patients, but nothing compares in quality to Shutter Island. Shutter Island is a movie worth watching. It's more than just a movie about crazy people in a crazy hospital. Rather, it's a movie with depth, mystery and excitement. It's a movie that contains all of the prized pieces to making a hit movie. It has nicely developed characters, a set of A-list stars, like Leonardo DiCaprio, who bring life into each individual character, and a plot, which is one that is intriguing from beginning all the way to the unsuspected end."

","""Shutter Island"" is another brilliant outing from Martin Scorsese. The month prior to the release I managed to pick up the original book, and was thoroughly looking forward to what direction the production may take.<br/><br/>U.S. Marshal Edward ""Teddy"" Daniels (DiCaprio), and his partner Chuck (Mark Ruffalo), go to Shutter Island on a ferry boat to the home of Ashecliffe Hospital for the criminally insane. Investigating the disappearance of a patient Rachel Solando (Emily Mortimer), who has escaped the hospital and apparently the island despite being in a locked cell under supervision.<br/><br/>As far as execution goes, ""Shutter Island"" is adapted to a tee. I now get the feeling Leonardo DiCaprio is beginning to pick his performances more carefully. He has always been a solid performer, and this role definitely gives him more of a chance to use every emotion under the sun considering the situation. Also it was very pleasant to finally see Ben Kingsley in a Scorsese picture, and it's a very interesting choice for the role of Dr. Cawley. But as always, Sir Kingsley delivers solid work.<br/><br/>The island overall looks like a visually perfect adaption from book to screen. The lack of lighting, weird sound effects and constant dream sequences all in all make this very exciting and disturbing thriller highly recommended.<br/><br/>Final Verdict: A very well crafted movie. It's not the best Scorsese has ever done, but decent nevertheless. 8/10."
"Reverend3000","5","1","2","2 June 2014"," Far too long, slow-moving
","I expected much better for another Scorsese-DiCaprio collaboration.<br/><br/>The movie starts out well. I was immediately pulled into what seemed like an interesting story where we'd have a super sleuth investigating a incident and cracking down antagonists one-by-one. <br/><br/>Instead it turned into a psychological thriller that reminded me all too much of other recent psychological thrillers, making it run-of-the-mill. <br/><br/>I thought the movie took far too long to wrap everything up. This could've been done in an hour and forty minutes time. Many of the long dream sequences could've been shortened, they weren't effective anyway, and fall short when compared with Bernard Hermann music-backed dream sequence of Vertigo (which is what Scorsese was going for).<br/><br/>I think this movie is overrated, and the director and lead actor involved have done much more impressive things in their careers, both respectively and together."
"phrendofdog","3","1","2","21 July 2013"," The real mystery of Shutter Island is why?!
","I will follow dutifully the responsibility of not leaving any spoilers present in my review. My review is also purely one of opinion, and may be discarded as such, if the reader finds it necessary to do so. Let any who read the following do so with a grain of salt ready, as they may surely differ in opinion in regards to this movie!<br/><br/>First off, let me state that the actors and actresses of this film are not lax in their ability to portray characters assigned them accurately. Secondly, the script is compelling in its accuracy of feelings and thoughts of people who populated the time in which this film took place. So far, I have admitted that the accuracies were pursued with laudable diligence, and all steps were taken to transport the viewer back to the time where the alleged events took place. Okay.<br/><br/>So why the three out of ten rating? Why, indeed? I must phrase my reasons carefully, lest I give away even the least of the plot goods to those who have not spent the time to experience this film themselves. I am not understating the presence of suspense, or doubt as to what's truly going on. It is rather that for who was involved in the making of this film, I was sorely disappointed in its structure- that I felt the whole style of leaving solely questions, and only so very few answers, was no way to end a movie, when it was made by who it was made by. Like some amateur throwback style of film making where we throw all our eggs into the sequel or ****ty movie basket. And make no mistake- I honestly feel without a followup movie, there is no doubt a loss in my ability to enjoy such a ""flick"".<br/><br/>I have seen many genres in my day in motion pictures. From artsy to violent action films, I've seen a few different directions a director can take. And when a director is a seasoned pro, you expect answers- you expect mother-! You expect closure. In this film, there are EASILY four different interpretations, most likely more, that a viewer can take from this bastard mixture of mild entertainment and intense puzzlement. And while I could take a direction and run with it, I'd be sorely ignorant to think my money well spent, when I had to fill in many of the blanks myself. I may as well have wrote a suspense-crime-drama. Solely for my own pleasure. Except there was no pleasure in it. <br/><br/>You, the Reader, know the state of the world well enough to think carefully on financial expenditures. Especially entertainment. It comes in many forms, most of them unreasonably high in cost. And we are not all pedantic fools, just because we want what we want wrapped up pretty. Maybe some wish for mystery in life, but that's what religion, death, and who wins the Super Bowl is for. In a motion picture, you want the concrete. If you wanted wispy possibilities, random chance, and such dramatic unexpected things, you can gamble. Play video games. Or bet on anything at all. If films were to be finished in the mind, it would amount to a medium an hour or less in length, at less than half the cost to acquire, since you have to finish the story yourself. I feel this motion picture was ultimately a slant against Scorsese, a permanent back-step for his directing career.

","**spoiler alert** -- Although the movie starts off in an interesting manner (as an old ""B"" movie classic from the 50s), the lines, designs and acting become a bit contemporary soon after which ruined a bit of the authenticity for me. Furthermore, it became apparent too soon that the hero was in fact a patient at the institution. The explanation for the ending which turns out to be an experiment wherein the institution attempts to cure the patient (hero) is to play out his conspiracy theory in real time with the entire institution (including other inmates) going along with this plan. Not only is that concept unbelievable, why was this particular patient considered so special that the institution would not only take the risk of this dangerous patient harming another person (which he nearly did in one scene), but expend the cost of doing so. He was a WWII veteran - so many were psychologically wounded from their experience in that war (and many others). He was a U.S. Marshall after the war - not a high enough or politically significant position (such as U.S. president or maybe cabinet member). That point left me scratching my head."

","Shutter Island is a best-selling novel by Dennis Lehane.A film adaptation was made by director Martin Scorsese that stars Leonardo DiCaprio as Teddy Daniels, Mark Ruffalo as Chuck Aule, Ben Kingsley as Dr. Cawley, and Max von Sydow as Dr. Naehringwas.<br/><br/>The film opens in 1954 as World War II veteran and current federal marshal Teddy Daniels and his new partner, Chuck, ferry to Shutter Island, a water-bound mental hospital housing the criminally insane. They have been asked to investigate the disappearance of Rachel Solando ,a patient admitted to the asylum after she murdered her three children. As Teddy quizzes Dr. Cawley, the head of the institution, he begins to suspect that the authorities in charge might not be giving him the whole truth, and that a terrible fate may befall all the patients in the spooky Ward C -- a unit devoted to the most heinous of the hospital's inmates. Complicating matters further, Teddy has a secret of his own -- the arsonist who murdered his wife is incarcerated on Shutter Island. Driven to confront his wife's killer, and stranded on the island because of a hurricane, Teddy must unravel the secrets of the eerie place before succumbing to his own madness.<br/><br/>The movie is a brilliant and intelligent one.It keeps the viewer guessing to the end and then it miraculously makes the guessing somewhat pay off.It tries to make a fool out of you but in the end it should be categorized as a flashy thriller and a smart one as well that maybe far comparable from any magic trick about what is real or what is delusion and what is monstrous or what is decent.Overall,it is one engaging and highly entertaining movie."
"asda-man","10","1","2","18 October 2011"," If you appreciate films, your eyes are sure not to shutter
","I saw ""Shutter Island"" for the third time last night, and even though it's still meant to be a mystery thriller, you'd think that once you know the mystery, you don't need to see it again. Well that's where you and I are both wrong. Each time I watch it, the mystery remains as strong and as complex as ever. This is much more than a mystery thriller, it's an experience, very much similar to ""Black Swan"", we meet a man who seems completely sane when we first meet him, and a mystery that sounds quite simple, but as we stay longer on the island and as the plot thickens, we turn as crazy as Teddy, which is what makes ""Shutter Island"" so utterly absorbing.<br/><br/>Probably the most important feature to note, which is what makes this film such a masterpiece, is Martin's superb direction. Right from the first shot on the boat with the obvious green screen backdrop, we immediately get the feel for what time zone we're in. Directing as careful and as attention to detail as this is extremely rare to come across nowadays. Martin puts the audience right in the middle so we can experience the horrors with Teddy, as we are quite literally placed into his mind. Some of the flash-back sequences are so emotional (particularly the last one which is amazingly intense, especially at the cinema). Martin makes everything feel real. Which is what makes it so gripping.<br/><br/>The screenplay is also first class. My family all find ""Shutter Island"" boring, and I think it's because half the time they can't be bothered to listen to what the mystery is about, so they get completely lost and bored. ""Shutter Island"" has an extremely complex and very interesting story that deserves to be listened to and appreciated. It's almost Tarantino-like in a way, as it turns everything into a philosophy and really provokes thought from the audience. It's involving and if you do actually listen you will be completely on edge the whole time, right up until the shocking ending, which clearly had a lot of thought put into it.<br/><br/>The performances are also compelling, with Leonardo probably in one of his best roles. he plays Teddy how he should be, confused, emotionally torn apart and extremely intelligent. The supports are also good with Leonardo's creepy wife, Delores, also played with flare and air of ambiance.<br/><br/>""Shutter Island"" is one of the best films I have ever seen. Almost everything about it is perfect, it's beautifully written, directed to perfection with lots of thrills, tension and sizzling suspense. Really, if you haven't seen ""Shutter Island"" you are missing out on one of the most compelling and original stories in decades. See it now!"

","I started watching Shutter Island with a slight twinge of anticipation as I am not a fan of horror movies. However, when the credits started rolling I was not speechless because I was scared. I was speechless because of Teddy's (DiCaprio's) last line. Is it better to live as a monster or die as a good man? This movie leaves you thinking. Is Teddy right in living in a fantasy world where he can be whoever he wants? Or is it wrong to live without facing the truth? Most people might argue that it is not healthy to live in a state of constant delusion where reality is whatever you conjure up in your own mind yet to some extent we do this everyday. We think truth (whatever is real; reality)can be decided on an individual basis. Martin Scorsese presents viewers with a character who decides for himself what his world looks like. Teddy lives in his own world. In reality, Teddy's wife kills their children and he kills her. Teddy feels guilty for not getting her help and then for killing her. But in his own ""reality,"" his wife died when another man set their apartment building on fire and they never had children. Teddy believes he is a U.S. Marshall helping to investigate a disappearance at a mental facility. In his mind he is doing good. Does the fact that Teddy thought he was a good man indeed make him a good man? I would say no. Teddy is making one very wrong assumption. He assumes, like most people today, that the only opinion that matters is his own. He creates his own reality so he would rather die a hero in his own mind then live as a ""monster."" No matter what Teddy thought in his mind, in his own reality, he could not change the truth or real reality. Just because Teddy thought he was a good person did not change his actions or their consequences. No matter what we think about truth or reality, we cannot change what really is. You can make up your own truth all you want but in the end, unless you have Truth (what really is), you are no better than Teddy dying as a delusional, crazy ""monster."" I highly recommend this movie for anyone really but especially if you are of the mindset that you determine what is true for you because you need to see firsthand the ramifications of your thinking and what happens when you live without knowing what really is."

"Dr_Coulardeau","10","2","7","11 April 2010"," Siperb kafkaian monstrous tale
","It is in many ways a great film. It questions the ""heritage"" of the Second World War and the horror the American soldiers discovered in the camps, in this case here Dachau. It is also more than clear on the passage of some of the researchers of Nazi Germany to the US to continue their research in peace, including if necessary with human experiments when dealing with medical research. It is unluckily well-known that prisons and orphanages were places of hellish torturing and violence in the name of research or reform. That's the first level of the film. The second level is: what can society do with the few human beings who are so bad that they can't be reformed? Various solutions are available: lobotomizing them to turn them into docile pets, pharmaceuticalizing their cases so that they become chemical zombies, or manipulating their minds to make them convinced of what they have done and of the necessary punishment called treatment they are receiving. The film goes even as far as imagining the production of human killing tools that could be used in wars. Surgery, drugs or mental manipulation, that's the choices envisaged here. The three of them are all just fully wrong. But the film is a lot more disquieting than that if we deal with the simple fact that the decision of a psychiatrist to classify you as anything psychic or psychological is absolutely irreversible and everything you may say or do to prove you are not will be turned into the evidence that you are and will be used against you. In other words the lady always protests too much. That's the Kafka aspect of the tale. But the film is even better than all that because Scorsese in his personal style builds a story in which we do not know at all at the end if the two cops were really what they pretended to be at the beginning and thus were kidnapped by the doctors to make sure nothing will seep out of their concentration camp, or if it is the doctors who are right at the end and that the two cops are what these doctors pretend, one is a killer and the other his doctor and that the whole tale was a medical procedure to reach treatment. At the end there is only one choice left: to live as a monster or to die in dignity. But what is dignity in such an environment? We are happily doubting everything at the end, which may create a feeling of frustration in the audience.<br/><br/>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Créteil, CEGID"

I cannot really say anything more without spoiling it for you. This film needs to be experienced first-hand! <br/><br/>This is classic film-making by Director Martin Scorsese. His visuals are just riveting and disturbing. His approach to story-telling is impeccable. Your brain keeps on working while you watch it. I want to watch it again to get all those small details I may have missed, and I know there are many. I think I may have already watched the Best Picture of 2010, and it is only February! <br/><br/>Leonardo di Caprio, what can I say? He is such an intense actor. Since his recent series of serious films, from ""The Departed"", then ""Blood Diamond"", then ""Revolutionary Road"", now this, he just keeps on improving his craft. I was sold about how he tackled this most challenging role of Edward Daniels. I think he is on track to finally winning his Academy Award for Best Actor.<br/><br/>The supporting cast composed of Mark Ruffalo, Ben Kingsley and the venerable Max von Sydow was very effective. Michelle Williams was haunting and creepy. I cannot even say what their roles are without risking to spoil things. It is that good that way. The film is very original. It is mentally-stimulating.

"Craig_McPherson","7","2","7","22 February 2010"," Welcome to the Mean Streets of the Mind
","There are two ""light bulb"" moments in Shutter Island, director Martin Scorsese's psychological thriller. The first goes off early in the film where the viewer concludes the film they are watching is a complete bomb. The second illuminates in the final reel where the realization sets in that one's just witnessed a minor masterpiece in the Scorsese canon, and a movie far superior to the best efforts of the majority of directors working today.<br/><br/>Though it may be hard to believe, Shutter Island careens dramatically from abysmal to genius in a couple of film reels, in what has to be the most astonishingly pleasant about face for a movie since light started being exposed to acetate.<br/><br/>Based on the 2003 novel of the same name by Dennis Lehane (Mystic River, Gone, Baby, Gone), Shutter Island tells the story of two US marshals, Teddy Daniels (DiCaprio) and Chuck Aule (Ruffalo), who are sent to investigate the disappearance of a patient at the Shutter Island facility for the criminally insane, a fictional isolated island akin to Alcatraz, off Massachusetts.<br/><br/>Daniels investigation slowly unveils that the facility is being used as a prototype ""black ops"" base whereby psychiatrists, building on Nazi experiments, are seeking to transform select patients into ""Manchurian candidate"" like killing machines.<br/><br/>Yet all is not what it seems and that serves as both the Achilles heel and beautiful lynchpin underlying Shutter Island. No sooner does the story's continual messing with the audience's head begin to grow tiresome, than it suddenly transforms into a splendid revelation, integral to the overall composition of the film.<br/><br/>Peppered with acting firepower, even in its brief supporting roles with unsettling appearances by the likes of Watchmen's Jackie Earle Haley, and Silence of the Lambs' Ted Levine, Shutter Island fails to encroach upon the turf of such Scorsese masterworks as Raging Bull or Taxi Driver, but rather is more on par with The King of Comedy or his remake of Cape Fear for its directorial savvy and acting prowess. Superior to 2006's The Departed, but short of Goodfellas, this is a slightly above middle-of-the-pack Scorsese film. Such is the body of Scorsese's work that even his middling efforts come across as gems compared to much of what comes out of Hollywood these days."
"aharmas","5","2","7","21 February 2010"," Mind Games
","When Clarisse wanders into the restricted cells in ""The Silence of The Lambs"", the tension is overpowering. It is a murky combination of danger and disgust, as the inmates are poised to attack and abuse. With Demme's intelligent and flawless hand, we are slowly descending into a world where insanity lurks and at times can overpower us.<br/><br/>The premise in ""Shutter Island"", somewhat adapted from Lehane's engrossing and mind bending book, is that the lines between sanity and insanity sometimes blur. We follow Teddy (DeCaprio) in his adventure inside a mental institution as he tries to discover what has happened to some of the inmates there. The story unfolds like an onion, layer by layer, in Lehane's original narrative. In the film, the delicate construction is taken over by a series of monotonous dialog between some of the main members of the cast, which lessens the suspense and weakens the power of the main plot line.<br/><br/>DeCaprio is one of my favorite performers , and he is in good company here, as Kingsley, Von Sydow, and Williams show amazing support. Sadly, DiCaprio's turn is out of place and miscast. ""Revolutionary Road"" gave him a chance to demonstrate how good he could be at showing psychological despair. In here his broad turn is lacking in some of the details one would expect from such a conflicted person. This becomes more obvious as we go through a parade of people who might be in a similar position. The ever present doubt and paranoia works best when one looks at the rest of the cast, and how they handle their respective roles. With DiCaprio, he seems furiously driven by an obsession that we don't share. It is as if Scorcese has concentrated more on the style of the gorgeously photographed and produced film, but he has neglected the story and the main actor's performance subtle points.<br/><br/>It should be more haunting, fuller of despair, drenched in sadness, and the best some people of the audience could say was: ""this was a creepy film..."" For whatever reason, I don't think that is what Lehane originally intended."
"ramchandar_gl","7","2","7","20 February 2010"," Am I the only one who found it complex?
","Let me clarify who I am so you can choose to put this review in perspective..I became a huge fan of Leo Dicaprio (LDC) after watching Aviator. Then after watching Departed and Blood Diamond I strongly feel he's the best out there. I also admire Scorsese but mainly because of his LDC movies.<br/><br/>Honestly this film was nowhere near the league of their previous collaborations. I am not averse to complex scripts - loved Memento, Sixth Sense, Prestige. But it becomes too complex if the viewer has to retrace the scenes and differentiate the illusions from the reality. The movie is probably more suited for purists who can try hard to make sense of everything that unfolds towards the end.<br/><br/>On the plus side, LDC gives another standout performance. I read in some site that he was extremely stressed after this movie and its not difficult to see why. Its a very difficult role and LDC is one who literally transforms himself into the character he portrays.<br/><br/>Background score is good. The movie is shot very well and has apt locations.<br/><br/>Most importantly the movie keeps you glued till the end. So its definitely worth watching once for anyone who likes a mystery.

"cadillac20","8","2","7","19 February 2010"," Although Predictable, Nonetheless Just Shy Of Being A Masterpiece
","Whenever a Scorsese film comes along, it's something of an event. Always able to entertain while also creating thoughtful film, he has a way of crafting a film that few can mimic. Sure enough, Shutter Island is another of these films. Yes, it's psychological horror is predictable, but this doesn't deter from a great film about the horrors of dementia during a time period when crazy people were thought better left ignored than treated.<br/><br/>This is certainly a different kind of film for Scorsese. While it has the same characterizations we're used to, characters who are products of their environments and must adapt, it also feel like Martin's take on psychological horror. And it works to great degree. There is plenty of suspense and the asylum itself is often times creepy, specifically Ward C. What shines most here is Leo DiCaprio's performance as the troubled Marshall Teddy Daniels. In a lesser actor, this role would have come across as too melodramatic and ridiculous. But here, we have a thoughtful character who comes off as believable. There is a scene at the end that even hits like a brick. While DiCaprio was once merely a teen idol actor showing glimpses of a great actor, this has cemented him as one of today's greatest actors. It might be hard to believe, but he certainly stands out as Teddy, something I can say about very few actors in recent films (Christoph Waltz in Inglorious Basterds being the last one).<br/><br/>Now, the film certainly has its issues. It feels like an old fashioned psychological horror, complete with hallucinations, literal closed doors we know we will eventually see opened, and obvious red herrings. The film doesn't feel very innovative and it even feels like it's taken a step backwards as far as film making goes. The ultimate truth, once it's revealed, also feels pretty obvious. Certainly, anyone who has seen these kinds of horror films will no doubt make a guess as to the truth and be correct. And, at first, it's a disappointment that the answers aren't less obvious. There are also some early issues with the music, as the overbearing score when they enter the compound, while foreshadowing the disturbing things to come, is so powerful it seems silly. <br/><br/>However, the film is saved by the directing primarily, of which Scorsese once again shows why he is a master in Hollywood. The characters in the film are so well crafted and directed, that the message here becomes clear and even the films obvious twists shine in their displays of humanity. This is ultimately a film about the treatment of crazy people. Most would rather see them dead, a testament to the mindset of the time period, while a few would rather try to cure them. And this is what Scorsese does best. He explores the building blocks of our history, delving into areas of society we think we might know, but are ultimately shown anew. And Shutter Island is no different. This is a different take on a subject explored previously, but never like this. Shutter Island is a great film, yes, but it is because of its message, because of its take on its subject that makes it a worthwhile film."

But not only that, the film plays out in a manner that makes it so obvious what the 'twist' is going to be that not only can I not believe for a second that no one guessed the ending well in advance but also it renders the film pointless. I found myself watching and thinking ""the ending can't possibly be this obvious, there must be something else going on"". But there wasn't.<br/><br/>Aside from that, I could not enjoy the process of just watching the film and letting go of the obvious ending because the acting from everyone was horrid and bizarre. I felt like I was watching a play - everyone seemed to over act and talk too loud, as if performing for an audience and being conscious that people at the back needed to hear.

","From the opening seconds of this movie, it is dismaying to observe that a) this is clearly going to be the type of movie that hinges on a big twist, and that... b) Scorsese hasn't even been able to disguise that! It's clear in less than 2 minutes that Teddy Daniels (!) is an unreliable narrator; and Mark Ruffalo's character (who has precious little to do) is obviously only there to query Teddy and keep him talking, to relay his viewpoint as a narrative workaround; until the actual truth can be revealed at some arbitrary moment. I got news for you Marty; That is simply not interesting enough, and no amount of flashy technique will help. On top of that the story arc is indecipherable. We're asked to ingest very familiar ""startling"" developments from the very start, and about every five minutes after that. So none of them seem terribly important.<br/><br/>Scorsese is not assisted in this effort by a thoroughly mediocre Leonardo DiCaprio who can barely disguise his ambition to join the lineage of Scorsese's tough guys; no matter how much he doesn't fit the mold. DiCaprio can barely convince a viewer he's an adult, let alone a tough one. Not since Tobey Maguire appeared in 'The Good German' has an actor been this out of his depth. <br/><br/>Given the pedigree of all involved, you'd think someone would have figured out this stinker had no potential. There is no merit to be found in this pre-digested, overproduced dud. There is nothing to sustain this irrelevant trip through the machinery again. Sometimes in the pursuit of thrills and and innovative imagery in an effort to be interesting, it's a good idea to just stop what you're doing and be interesting."

The ladies in this film didn't have much to work with, Michelle Williams did well as a very depressed death lady and Patricia Clarkson was impressive enough for the 5 minutes she was on, well achieved, if you ask me.<br/><br/>Technically perfect; the cinematography was beautiful, the editing was really fine, the one thing I could complain is that at times the score was over-dramatic, however, I can't say it wasn't good, the production design nailed it in all its levels, the sound was really mesmerizing and the little visual effects were good as well, the scenes were Teddy was with his wife really reminded me the graphic ensemble of ""American Beauty"", I find similarities in the visual composition of both.<br/><br/>Overall a great story that holds it in suspense from the very first minute and never loses charm throughout itself, you must take it really seriously because there are many details that you won't get until the very end, so it's a very enjoyable flick that award fans must keep an eye, despite 2010 in cinema is still in diapers, this seem like a very hard one the miss for the 83rd Academy Awards, hopefully it won't lose its momentum, being released so early in the year and far from award season."

","First of all I'm a huge Martin Scorsese fan. In my opinion he is in the top 3 best directors working today with David Fincher and Steven Spielberg. So when I found out he would be directing the film adaptation of Dennis Lehane's excellent novel SHUTTER ISLAND, I was thrilled. 1. Because he would be tackling a story and genre that he rarely gets around to, but one that he admires and respects and 2. Because the novel was a throwback to those great mystery/thriller films that Hitchcock made. Needless to say, Scorsese delivered. The film has many twist and turns and keeps you riveted all 138 minutes of the film and the soundtrack is amazing. The cinematography by Robert Richardson is also, quite possibly, the most atmospheric I've ever seen. I truly felt I was watching a film that was made in the 1950s and I really felt I was on that horrible island with Teddy and Chuck. And of course the performances. I've always thought DiCaprio was a great actor, but he nails the character of Teddy Daniels right out of the park. He truly gets better and better with each performance he gives and I believe this is his finest performance he has given yet. Michelle Williams was also great in her flashbacks as Teddy's wife Dolores with how much she is able to convey with few lines of dialogue and her facial expressions. There are just too many great things to say about this film. Don't ask anyone about the plot if you are unaware of it, just go. The less you know, the better the ride will be. Just sit back and enjoy being in the hands of a master."

","The 2009 made but 2010 released Scorsese film Shutter Island was a very entertaining thriller in similar genre to his remake of Care Fear. This film is set up as a crime thriller with two marshalls (Leonardo DiCaprio & Mark Ruffalo) sent to an island that housing around 66 of the most dangerous criminally insane psychiatric patients. Their job is to investigate 1 missing female patient with the assistance (or not) of the hospital staff led by Ben Kingsley & Max Von Sydow. Suffice to say, things get much more complex with Leos character suffering from increasing migraines & some PTSD symptoms relating to the loss of his recently deceased wife (beautifully played by Michelle Williams) & his experience as a US soldier closing down a Nazi concentration camp. This is an absorbing complex film that is technically excellent as one would expect from Scorsese. The performances are really good although it is initially difficult to take Leo seriously. He looks like a little boy clothed form the dress up box. The plot twists are interesting & the music creates a foreboding sense of doom form the opening scene. There are some plot holes or areas left unexplained at the films end. It is lengthy at almost 2hrs 20 minutes but it is well paced. I had read many negative reviews prior to the screening & found Shutter Island an enjoyable if not completely satisfying experience."

"Ahlberg14","10","2","9","15 March 2010"," Hauntingly Brilliant Film
","Being a huge Martin Scorsese fan, my expectations were high going into this film. Having been behind a camera for nearly half a century, Shutter Island doesn't feel like the work of a 67 year old, yet his signature is all over it. An overly intense throwback score (Hitchcock would be proud) plays as we approach an otherwise serene looking island off of Boston Harbor. Not even five minutes in and the dread-inducing mood is established. Shutter Island is suspenseful to the highest degree. Scorsese has crafted a vivid nightmare with a dismal atmosphere that mesmerizes and sticks with you.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio stars as U.S. Marshal Teddy Daniels in, dare I say, his most complicated and fiercely acted role to date. The supporting cast is brilliant to say the least, which includes: Mark Ruffalo, Ben Kingsley, Max von Sydow, Jackie Earle Haley, Emily Mortimer, and Michelle Williams. Teddy's assignment takes him to the foreboding Shutter Island which is home to the most criminally insane people around. His mission is to find the child-murdering Rachel Solando, an inmate who mysteriously disappeared from her cell. In the midst of a hurricane, Teddy and his partner Chuck scour the island, uncovering dark secrets along the way. Set in 1954, themes of conspiracy, medical experimentation, and paranoia linger behind every corner of the island.<br/><br/>While following Teddy and Chuck around Shutter Island, you may become a little disoriented and mentally drained. Scorsese establishes a direct connection between audience and actor by literally, making us feel what the lead character feels. There are several scenes that will have you asking, ""Did I just see that?"" Once those credits role, don't be surprised if your nerves are fried, maybe even deep-fried.<br/><br/>Unfortunately I feel like Oscar will overlook Shutter Island despite top-notch directing and a captivating performance from DiCaprio. Kudos to cinematographer Robert Richardson for capturing some of the most hauntingly beautiful imagery I've seen in awhile.<br/><br/>Ignore the cynics who say Shutter Island isn't Scorsese's best work. A departure from the gangster/crime movie we're used to seeing from him doesn't warrant a bad review. The closest Scorsese has come to the suspense/thriller genre is Cape Fear, which is nowhere near as compelling as this one. Though the movie isn't completely unpredictable, the style and creativity at work here will keep you thinking and enthralled."

","Before seeing this, I knew I was in for a treat, given that it's a Scorsese movie, but Shutter Island was even better than I expected.<br/><br/>I was skeptical walking into the theater, wondering if this twist could hold water. The film starts with Teddy Daniels and his new partner, Chuck, standing on a ferry. They talk about their assignment. What's suspect here is that there is no additional development. We are bam, smack right into the story without so much as an opening montage. All that we see is the men smoking a couple cigarettes. Though this is what begins as momentous development. As our hero smokes we that this isn't the glorified top lit smoking of a beauty or that of a sophisticated and confident gangster. We see that this is a harsher character with poor posture, someone who doesn't sleep well, someone with a deep past They are greeted at the gate by guards whose attitudes' seem immediately suspect. Soon we meet Dr Crawley, a seemingly complex and modern man who runs the asylum. However, he soon turns uncooperative with the investigation. Inmates and staff are hiding something but what? Everyone here seems off. Evidence and clues begin to appear but not before our hero seems riddled by psychosis himself. ""You act like all this madness is contagious."" Daniels says to the guard. Is it? Soon we begin to wonder, too, but not before he uncovers the tip of the iceberg and it's not only painfully intimate with his own past but also a mass conspiracy. The Nazis had concentration camps and the Americans have Shutter Island.<br/><br/>Though, it doesn't stop here, but to say anything else would do the story injustice Kingsley is in his finest role in years. Similarly, DiCaprio reaches new levels. Amongst others Elias Koteas, Ted Levine, Michelle Williams, all play small but wonderful roles. Robert Richardson captures a world all of its own.<br/><br/>While Scorsese is a master of film I'd say that his specialty has been more character than story. This is a fresh balance of both. It's a mix of noir and thriller. It's only sort of a horror movie and could be compared to ""The Shining"" but it makes it look like it's a one trick pony.<br/><br/>All this praise being said it's not for everyone. The story is complex. It takes some attention. At times it's a bit bleak and dire. Of course it all makes a little less sense when you actually think about it but then again that's film. There are a couple of moments where the story gets lost within itself. Things become a bit too complicated. At this point you might begin to lose faith in its viscosity, but don't worry because the story has you right where its put you."

","When i first heard of ""Shutter Island"", i was a little bit disappointed because i hoped that Scorsese was going to helm his mob-pic ""I Heard You Paint Houses"" next.

"cultfilmfan","10","2","9","24 February 2010"," Shutter Island
","Shutter Island is based upon the novel of the same name by Dennis Lehane. The film takes place in the mid 1950's where a United States Marshal named Teddy Daniels and his partner Chuck Aule are sent to an island where there is a maximum security prison for patients with mental health disorders and many of them have become violent and are there because they have killed others. Teddy's assignment is to locate a patient who went missing. The task seems almost possible, due to the fact that the island is in the middle of nowhere and because of all the security around and because the island is surrounded by tons of rocks and water and you would not be able to get off the island alive. While at the institution Teddy soon discovers that not everything is as it seems and he could be the next one in danger while visiting and investigating this case. Shutter Island is proof that there are still great horror films being made today that are not remakes of other films and ones that have original ideas and are made to perfection. The script grabbed me almost instantly and it is not particularly an action packed film, rather more of a character study and a psychological horror film that keeps giving you clues and building up the suspense until the final moments of the film. This is one classy horror film with tons of atmosphere to the music, direction and sets to a wonderfully captivating and twist turning and fascinating story. Leonardo DiCaprio who plays Teddy gives one of his all time best performances here and shows us a man who has his own demons that he is facing and why he comes off the way he does and why solving the mystery of the island and institution is so important to him. The supporting actors all do a great job as well and add to our curiosity of the film and exactly how it will play out. This film reminded me a lot of the classic horror films where it doesn't really rely on a lot of brutal violence, or things jumping out at you, or loud noises to get you scared. This film does it by building an atmosphere what with a creepy and brooding musical score, well developed and mysterious characters and by the script which keeps adding more and more for us to digest and piece together until we really want to see what happens at the end. The thrills come from watching these characters (Teddy in particular) in torment and wrestling with his personal problems and things that could easily make, or break this case for him and his strong determination to see it to the end and unravel what he thinks the mystery of the island is. Teddy's character alone is fascinating to watch all by itself because of DiCaprio's great performance and by how many layers there are to this character. Through the film we see things from Teddy's past that may seem insignificant at first, but in the end you will see that everything is in here for a reason and it all sort of makes sense at the end. It is one of those films that you will have to interpret in your own way and I appreciated that about the film as well. And as I was saying watching Teddy and his past traumas and the things that have brought him to be the man he is now, one with little patience and quite aggressive and how he slowly starts to get worse as the film goes on is absolutely fascinating to watch, again from DiCaprio's great performance and the wonderful material he was given to work with. I sat in utter awe of this film and what I was watching before me because I got so into the plot, the characters and wondering what would happen, that I could not take my view anywhere else other than on the screen. The audience I viewed the film with seemed to have the same fascination as I did because there have not been too many times when I have sat in a completely full theatre and to have complete silence from the audience the whole way through. Whether they all liked the film as much as I did, I do not know. However it did keep their interest and must have fascinated them in one way, or other and had some type of effect on them. Many will unfortunately, probably come into this film hoping for a violent and terrifying film like a lot of the films that come out today in the horror genre. This is one of the better ones that relies on an original and fascinating script, lots of atmosphere to build the mood and suspense of the film and great actors delivering great performances from top notch material. All the elements of a great horror film are here and they all play out beautifully. This is the first film I have seen of 2010 and I already know that it will be among my favourites of this year by the time it is over. A great film worth seeing for fans of horror, thrillers or just good psychological character studies. Heavily recommended."
"josh-langston","9","2","9","21 February 2010"," Scorcese does it again!
","First and foremost I will start by saying that this film will most likely be the most complete film of 2010 and it is more complete than any film of 2009. What I mean by this is that it is fantastic in every aspect; from the musical scores and costume designs to the acting, screenplay and cinematography, this film is top notch. The movie starts straight to the point about two U.S. Marshalls who are coming to a remote island titled 'Shutter Island', in search of a patient who has escaped. Everything about it is eerie and you can immediately sense that nothing is what it seems which helps to build the suspense right off the bat. The main musical score is fantastic at helping aid the suspense(such as it did in this scene) much in the same way as the theme for the 'Halloween' films and 'The Exorcist'. The island resembles more of a fortress then an asylum. It is made of brick with large walls that are topped with barbwire and the whole island is surrounded by a fog. DiCaprio is brilliant in his portrayal as Teddy Daniels, a man with a very haunting and troubled past. Daniels knows something is wrong immediately and has instant feelings that there is something much bigger going on then just an escaped patient. His partner Chuck (played extremely well by Ruffalo) has the same feelings as Daniels. Both are very intelligent and very attentative to their surroundings. When searching the missing patients room, Daniels discovers a piece of paper under a loose board that says ""Law of 4. Who is 67?"". The story really kicks off here as the two Marshalls being to investigate more thoroughly into it as they begin to suspect that there may be a dark secret about the asylum, one that its employees and patients know about but will not discuss. At many different moments of the film Daniels has flashbacks of his wife as well as vivid experiences of his during WWII that depict Nazi Workcamps. These moments occur in flashbacks and dreams that he has. All of this really helped with the character build up of the two Marshalls ,as Daniels discusses these instances with his partner which creates a bond between the too. As the film progresses, the suspense continues to build until finally we are dealt multiple twists to this jigsaw puzzle of a film that adds everything together in what concludes to be a very shocking ending that will take all by surprise. Keep your eyes open and pay attention because every little detail of this film counts!"
"spaced_89","10","2","9","21 February 2010"," Shutter Island is Easily Four Stars
","It has been almost twenty years since Martin Scorsese has last took on a genre film like Cape Fear but with his latest effort Scorsese has returned to the horror scape once again.<br/><br/>Let me clarify that Shutter Island is not a horror film like The Wolfman where the ""scares"" are primarily from a loud musical score at a select moment and at least thirteen gallons of blood. This is real horror; the things that keep you up at night long after watching them like The Shining, or Jacob's Ladder.<br/><br/>Marshall Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his new partner Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo)is on investigation to find out how patient Rachel Solando disappeared from the Ashecliffe Institute on Shutter Island. The only ferry that comes to the island is under control of the institute and the island is more than ten miles away from the Boston shore. Dr. Cawley (Ben Kingsley) is concerned with the safety of people on the island after the escape of Solando, but he is keeping something from Teddy and Chuck. As more and more is unwrapped about Ashecliffe Teddy's motives become clear Shutter Island is capable of more than it is letting on and someone needs to blow this out of the water.<br/><br/>DiCaprio at this stage of his career reminds me more and more of Martin Sheen during his peak runs in Badlands and Apocalypse Now. The struggle of his characters are internalized such a degree that he doesn't even know who he is anymore. The Departed was the greatest example of this, but with Shutter Island DiCaprio might have given his best performance yet. With this film and Inception out in July DiCaprio will definitely be nominated for Best Actor this year.<br/><br/>Shutter Island is masterfully crafted by Martin Scorsese. Never once does the film resort to loud scares just a slowly mounting tension that never lets you out of your chair. The cinematography, score and performances all round out the best film of the year so far.<br/><br/>http://nevermindpopfilm.blogspot.com"
"pinkliz41","10","2","9","21 February 2010"," Chilling, compelling, terrifying and completely electric from start to finish
","Shutter Island could be considered to rank among Martin Scorsese's greatest films to date. And it certainly lives up to that status. From it's compelling beginning to it's 'oh my god i didn't see that coming' finale, you will be held on the edge of your seat. What makes Shutter Island work tremendously well is it's complete lack of knowing what will come next. Every scene leads to something new and original, nothing feels dud or stupid. It's Islands psychological aspects implanted within a forever changing narrative that will have audiences always asking why?, how? or what?, and not until the very end will you at least have a small idea about what you have seen. Could it be considered one of the best of the year so far? Definitely.<br/><br/>The atmosphere is completely terrifying, as if you are as scared and nervous as Teddy himself, if that's his actual name. Scorsese further unleashes a wide inventory of cinematography that makes you go 'wow'. His perfectionism is absolutely necessary, especially for this type of film. Not once do you switch off or say 'well that was boring'. Your always left craving more."
"Red_Identity","Null","2","9","20 February 2010"," A film which never allows you to wrap your mind around it....
","Martin Scorsese. What Can I say about him. He has created so many great films, including Raging Bull, and the recent The Departed. Here, he covers some new territory, and like I wanted, it is not a film to really wrap your minds around it. <br/><br/>The film plays out in ways that are what you would expect from a regular thriller, yet at the same time, you cannot help but wonder what it will all come to be. What can be said is that the performances are outstanding. Leonardo Dicaprio gives another powerhouse of a performance, showing that when he is committed he gives it his all. With performances from The Departed, Revolutionary Road, and now Shutter Island, he has proved he is one of the best actors working today. Jackie Earle Haley is really great in a small scene he is in, and Michelle Williams really affecting in her role. The whole film cannot be described, but experienced. Throughout the film, I was thinking it has some obvious flaws, and that while I really liked it, I could not love it... and then we get to the twist.<br/><br/>When the twist came, about who Teddy Daniels really was, I was overwhelmed by it. I thought the film should have been given a much better twist. While I can admit in the novel it must have felt shocking, while I watched this twist unfold I must say I was very unpleasantly surprised. Not because it was executed badly, since a lot of the film's earlier mysteries made sense now, but because these sort of twists have been done to death that I would think anyone would stay away from it. But then as the scene with Teddy and Dolores' past tragedy unfolded, I began to have a sense of excitement because, I thought, could it be that the film would do a backflip and this not be the twist at all? Could it be that the final twist would actually be that this given twist was simply not real, and that the island's conspiracy be true? While the scene when Teddy is confessing who he really is and that he had murdered his wife was happening, I was lost. I did not know if this was real or if the real twist would happen. I was really hoping another twist and the real ending happen, because this would be a very tired and overwhelming ending. Then, when the film switched to black, I was like WOW. No answers given. The film played with me, made me first angry, then secretly happy and hoping for the real thing, and then leaves me no answers and to finally guess whether the truth is that Shuuter Island is a conspiracy or if Teddy really is insane. I figured it out! It was all about the execution of it all, and looking back on it now, whichever was the real truth did not matter, because Scorsese had messed with my mind. By this time, I simply fell in love with the film, flaws and all. It did it for me, and looking back on the film, I can say that it may join the ranks of The Departed, and even films like Mulholland Dr. or other lynch films in the future, with rewatches. This is film-making at it's most brilliant, but do not be fooled. While watching the film, you may not think this at all. Trust me."
"dpowers2","10","2","9","20 February 2010"," This Would've Been DiCaprio's Year
","I just saw Shutter island last night and if it had been released in October like it was originally supposed to, Leo DiCaprio would be the one winning the awards and going on to win an Oscar. Jeff Bridges and Morgan Freeman were great in their films, but their performances didn't have the intensity that DiCaprio does in this film. I won't give anything away, but the last half hour of the film alone is Leo's best performance since The Aviator. It is enough to win him an award.<br/><br/>If it had been released in the fall, it would definitely be nominated for Best Actor, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Director, and Best Picture. Of those four, it would definitely deserve the Best Actor award. I can only hope and pray that the Academy voters remember this film next Oscar season and at least nominate it. Like they did with Silence of the Lambs in 1991-1992.(I am not comparing the two films)It was definitely worth the wait though."

","I was able to see Shutter Island last night at midnight and let me tell you after reading Lehane's novel I was really impressed with the way that Mr.Scorsese brought this film to the big screen. Whether it was the creepy music that played in the background, whether it was the lighting used throughout the film to even enhance the feeling of what Teddy was going through on that creepy island where nothing was what it seemed, or whether it was the way that the patients looked at Teddy and Chuck who played Federal Marshalls, you could almost feel the tension between the patients and themselves. While the World War II flashbacks might have been too much for some, I feel they were necessary for character development. Throughout two hours of this film Mr.Scorsese leaves the audience questioning themselves , until that dramatic scene at the lighthouse where one of the greatest twists in cinematic history occurred."

"SimonJack","4","1","3","10 January 2019"," A thinly plotted ensemble with dreary, disconnected flashbacks
","""Shutter Island"" provides early clues that something is amiss with the lead character, Teddy Daniels. And that leads one to think that the mystery has a twist that is different than what the film purports to be about. I didn't read Dennis Lehane's novel on which the film is based. But, if he wrote it in the way this film portrays the story, it had to be a difficult read to follow. Flashbacks are a nice (and convenient) tool in storytelling and motion pictures, but they should only be used sparingly. Otherwise, they can distract from the story. In this case, their frequency and disconnectedness soon wear the film out and tire the viewer.<br/><br/>I watched this film in the theater when it came out. I watched it again recently, and have a less enthusiastic response. I particularly enjoy good mysteries. The when, and how, and who, and why of a good suspense or crime story can be gripping and hold one's attention and interest. But these psychological thrillers sometimes muddle the plot and leave one wondering if a crime actually happened. So, the mystery isn't in solving a crime so much as it is in finding out if one was even committed at all.<br/><br/>That's the sort of feeling one gets with this film. Then, it has elements that may seem like red herrings. The idea of Communist insurrectionists, plotters against the government, and some other items might be intended as red herrings, but they seem to be more overkill in the makeup of a crazy character.<br/><br/>The use of so many flashbacks is probably necessary to arrive at the conclusion of the film. But they ignore the usual aspects of good movies and storytelling. So, instead of a tight plot this film seems to be a collection of different stories and random scenes and incidents tossed together with techniques to otherwise tantalize an audience. That may be very convenient for Hollywood, but it doesn't smack of superb mystery storytelling and filming.<br/><br/>The acting is good all around and can't be faulted. Of course, the ruse of the film can raise many questions. Did the hospital use real inmates to role-play with the delusional Teddy Daniels? If so, how could professional health people justify that? If they didn't use real inmates, then they just happened to have many other folks around who would like to role-play in an asylum for the criminally insane.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, psycho thrillers of this sort don't have to answer questions like that. Or make any sense at all. Real mysteries should allow people to rely on their senses and common sense otherwise. While I do enjoy such films from time to time, when they go this far off the track of good mystery telling, they go to another genre. They still involve crime but become more horror stories than human drama. And, then, the elements of the story don't have to fit or even make sense.<br/><br/>The use of flashbacks seems to be the modern Hollywood and fiction writers' technique for getting around the historical tenets of good writing and storytelling. So, plot, plot, plot (as in solid story development) becomes plod, plod, plod (as in toss things together and hurry them along to be done with it). Give me a good old-fashioned Agatha Christie or Dashiell Hammett mystery any day."

","I guess when looking at the names of director and the cast one knows that it can't go wrong. And it didn't. I loved this movie through it's 138 minutes and it didn't even seem that long.<br/><br/>Now I can't say if the big twist towards the end was very well hidden. Unfortunately I heard it before I watched it. Which is not surprising considering that I waited almost 10 years to do so. So when watching there were moments where I would think ""Now here people should have guessed it"". Especially in the second half of the movie. But this could just be me knowing it and seeing the clues more clearly, just as people who rewatched it did. But regardless, even though I knew the ending I really enjoyed the movie so somebody who guessed it at the very beginning but still was questioning it would as well.<br/><br/>The cinematography is great. So much film noir in it. It is a movie that gives one this suspense that keeps one watching. The cast is all great. Including the small parts of guards and mental patients. And the main characters gave so much character to the movie. I won't list all their names because I literally would list all of them. If anyone of them would played by a different actor it wouldn't be the same.<br/><br/>And I loved the ending. I am not talking about the twist that I already discussed but the very ending.

It gives the movie and DiCaprio's character so much more depth."

The viewer is trapped on Shutter Island in Boston Harbor...difficult to reach and seemingly impossible to leave. Leonardo DiCaprio's character is challenged by withheld information, by mysterious and dark hallways,by warnings of dangerous elements around him. This is modern noir at its trickiest and most thrilling --- all put together by Martin Scorsese in a splendid shift of cinematic focus. DiCaprio's excellence is matched by a fine cast - notably Mark Ruffalo, Ben Kingsley, Max VonSydow, and the ever-remarkable Patricia Clarkson.

He gets send there, not because he is mental ill, but because there is an escaped patient. The protagonist is called Teddy Daniels and is a US Marshal, who is put on an seem like impossible task...<br/><br/>The movie is directed by Martin Scorsese. A man with a lot of movies on his name. He had previously made some movies with Leonardo DiCaprio (The Departed, The Aviator...). He did a good job at directing this movie, and you could see that they have worked together in the way of DiCaprio's acting (a bit over him in the second alinea). The cinematography was nice too. It had some pretty shots in it (the last shot of the lighthouse). The cinematographer was Robert Richardson. The green screen wasn't the greatest. You could easily spot when they were using one. The colors used were quite nice to look at. When it was day time it all looked very colorful, but when it was night time it were sad and somber colors. The blood, when someone was killed, was very red, and I think they did this, to accentuate it, and that you would see it well. So it looked more dramatic. In the flashbacks or dream sequences they used another sort of color, the were brighter (in his dreams) and darker (in his flashbacks. Which brings me how interesting the flashbacks and dreams were, just as the hallucinations of his. The dreams were very well edited, and handled. The flashbacks were nicely shot and showed well how a damaged person Teddy was. The hallucinations were a mix of the flashbacks and dreams, with the characters who appeared in them meting. That is also a thing that I 'liked'. The contrast between his wife and the little girl. The girl died of freezing to death, and his wife burned to death. But what I think they handled the best was the portraying of the mental hospital. It looked scary, due to the good music and the honking boat noise. But also due to the acting of the patients and the make-up brought on thel (the slid neck make up of a woman working in the garden, or the scar across the face of Laeddis. But the editing throughout the movie was just OK, a lot of the times positions of the hands changed, and I wasn't even looking for this kind of mistakes. <br/><br/>The acting was just brilliant by everyone. Especially by Leonardo Dicaprio, he played the protagonist of this story, Teddy. He really showed at times how scared he was of reality (ending) and also how scarred he was during the entire movie. In the flashbacks you really got to know him. He had a very powerful scene in one of them, in which he puts away the gun of a nazi, so he can suffer from his deeds, instead of committing suicide. He was intimidating and scary himself. Mark Ruffalo was also very good, he played the partner of Teddy. In the beginning of the movie, I thought he was a made up character by Teddy. (Teddy couldn't find his cigarettes, and Ruffalo had cigarettes, He can't put of his holster, we see his body lying on the cliffs, which isn't there in reality...) Ben Kingsly was good as well, he played the boss of the mental hospital, his character wasn't so clear for me, and with this I mean that I could never figure out to trust him or not. The rest of the supporting cast was did a good job. But the wife of Teddy stood out to me. She was very scary, even horrifying at times, in the beginning she seems innocent, but that changes...<br/><br/>The script of the movie is written by Laeta Kalogridis. It was a well written script. The movie is based on a novel by Dennis Lehane. I have read the book called 'The Drop' (this is also filmed with Tom Hardy). This book was written by Lehane, and I liked it, so I was just more excited to go see this movie. But now back to the script. There was some interesting dialogue, especially between Teddy and the woman in the cave, you were so interested to here what they were going to say next. Just one min in the script is that it is confusing at times. But it is also very compelling. I was trying to figure it out myself, which made the movie just more tense. The dialogue between George Noyce was good, and scary too the accentuated sound of the matches, and the whispering of the patients made it more scarier. The ending was not too bad, but also not amazing, you are left with a lot of questions, but this was the meaning of the writer.<br/><br/>Anyway I think this was a good movie and that is way it gets a 9.5/10 from me. I would recommend you watching it, if you like scary and tense full movies!"

","Shutter Island is a masterpiece. It is inarguably one of the greatest psychological thrillers I've ever seen. But then again, with Scorsese and DiCaprio, what could go wrong? <br/><br/>The scenery is crisp and beautiful, the use of camera is like art. I loved the sinister music because it was perfect for this movie. The ominous feeling was continuously there, keeping me on the edge of my seat. Leonardo DiCaprio was a perfect choice for this role because of his style of acting. This movie has some elements of The Shining (no more of that so I won't reveal anything).<br/><br/>The story was great and I liked how it is very subtle. You can't be sure about anything. This movie is a great example of the ""rule"" that says a movie should always make you ask: ""What happens next?"". The ending was utterly creepy and really messed with my mind.

","I'm a huge fan of Martin Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio and an even bigger fan of them together. This psychological thriller leaves the viewer guessing from start to finish. Two Federal US Marshals investigate the disappearance of an inmate at a prison for the mentally insane. The ending is the best part, one of the marshals is told he is actually an inmate at the prison and it was all an intense roll play to try and cure him. So we never know if the ""marshal"" is actually a federal agent or an inmate. The ending is suspenseful and a typical cliff hanger, but it the viewer is satisfied at the same time. There is enough evidence to support both theories and I personally enjoy movies that offer a debate after it ends. So was he a prisoner, or a marshal?"

","Writing this review weeks after watching Shutter Island, you would have thought I could now grasp exactly what happened. However, I still remain the same as the night I finished watching... dumbfounded. With sterling performances from all the actors and a twisted complex plot, this was truly a movie that made me sit up and listen.<br/><br/>Shutter island is the story of a US Marshal investigating the escape of a patient on the island which is revealed as a hospital for the criminally insane. At the beginning of the film I thought I had it pegged - a simple investigation where a terrible truth was uncovered. Although, as the plot unfolded viewers begin to peer into the life of Teddy Daniels the investigator for the case. This added layers to what I thought would be a simple plot. Disturbing dreams and recollections paint Teddy's confused and strange past calling the viewer to question his sanity. As the film went on I became more tense and at many points terrified of what was coming next. I admit to watching through my fingers at various points but my sheer curiosity took over as I needed to know what happened next.<br/><br/>As I have previously stated the performances given from the cast were amazing and truly convincing. I felt each character was very well cast and the intense nature of DiCaprio's character was perfectly portrayed. I especially liked the performance from Michelle Williams as Teddy's dead wife, Dolores. She is a haunting presence on screen and made me feel truly uncomfortable at points.<br/><br/>Vivid and disturbing imagery made Shutter Island hard hitting and therefore, stayed with me for days afterwards. It was difficult to distinguish between what was real and what were hallucinations. This put me on edge and queued a stream of unanswered questions running through my head. Just as certain questions were answered more were sent running through my mind. This kept me interested through the duration.<br/><br/>I don't wish to spoil the ending but all I can say is that it's a real curve ball. I still to this day am not sure what to think! The end left me craving more as if two hours wasn't enough.<br/><br/>Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed Shutter Island. It evoked strong emotions and kept me on my toes. I would highly recommend this film to any mystery lover. I leave you to draw your own conclusions as to what the truth really is."

","Shutter Island (2010): Dir: Martin Scorsese / Cast: Leonardo DiCapro, Mark Ruffalo, Ben Kingsley, Michelle Williams, Max von Sydow: Psychological thriller about isolation. It stars Leonardo DiCaprio as a federal Marshall who arrives by fairy with his partner to Shutter Island where he is to investigate the disappearance of a dangerous inmate. Things are not as they seem as DiCaprio questions the methods of the institution as well as confront his own visions. Director Martin Scorsese's fourth collaboration with DiCaprio. Previously they were responsible for Gangs of New York, The Aviator, and The Departed. It is no surprise that Shutter Island carries on the trend. Great performance by DiCaprio who grows haunted and suspicious with every clue he discovers. Mark Ruffalo plays his partner who goes for reason when DiCaprio becomes frustrated and heated. Ben Kingsley steals scenes as the head doctor at the institution. DiCaprio doesn't trust the doctor due to lack of cooperation nor is the staff any help. Michelle Williams is seen in flashbacks as DiCaprio's deceased wife. We learn through DiCaprio that she died by an intentional fire where the guilty wasn't found. Her flashback scenes are bright with life while the rest of the film deals with dark shadows and lighting that enhance the corridors of the prison. Max von Sydow is featured briefly as a mysterious doctor who dominates his scenes. With the exception of its ending, this film presents the eerie side of the human animal as well as present the reality of gloom within a prison. It is enough to make you shutter. Score: 9 / 10"

He and another office come to the island because a woman, Rachel, is missed. It seems like she's insane and kind of disappeared, but when they talk to other people that live on the island they find out that there is something completely wrong about the information they had been given by the doctor. Rachel broke out of the ''jail'' she had to live in, even though there was nothing wrong with her. It is a story about brainwashing.

"sandnair87","9","1","3","26 April 2015"," Scorsese Embarks on A Journey to The Mysterious Island!
","As Martin Scorsese's impeccably assembled thriller Shutter Island opens, we see a ferryboat emerging out of a Stygian murk so impenetrable it might well be taking Orpheus to the Underworld. On board are two U.S. Marshals fittingly attired in a trench-coat and fedora - frazzled WWII veteran Teddy Daniels (a resilient performance by Leonardo DiCaprio, delving into the psychological depths of his character) and his affable new partner Chuck Aule (a wonderfully understated Mark Ruffalo) heading towards Shutter Island, a storm-battered, rugged fortress occupied by Ashecliffe hospital, a high-security federal asylum for the criminally insane, where they have been summoned to investigate the disappearance of an delusional, infanticidal inmate Rachel Saldano. Daniels immerses himself into the investigation with unhealthy abandon.<br/><br/>But he has quite a few demons of his own rattling around in his head as his dogged determination is undermined by crippling migraines, disconcerting memories of his recently dead wife Dolores (played with a detached coolness by Michelle Williams) and haunting visions of the horrific scenes he witnessed during wartime. The asylum staff and the patients are equally edgy and disturbing - almost comically sinister, so are the twin leaders of the clinical staff: the courteous but steely Dr. Cawley (Ben Kingsley) and the ironic, provocative German, Dr Naehring (Max von Sydow). The paranoid marshal's fractured psyche soon begins to unravel a web of lies and conspiracy as the storm rages outside, and a succession of curious encounters suggest the sanatorium is being used for noxious experiments by the federal government in furtherance of the cold war, and he has been drawn there as an intended victim. But as Teddy's nightmares become indistinguishable from reality, we get a brilliantly constructed psychological thriller that threatens to upend our protagonist's grasp on veracity.<br/><br/>What starts as a locked-room crackerjack mystery soon transforms into a trippy, psychological freak-out as doubts are cast over our protagonists sanity, with enough red herrings and unexpected twists to keep the mind engaged - eager for the next surprise. What Martin Scorsese does best is set the mood, an atmosphere of impending doom. Based on a tightly plotted, willfully schlocky pulp thriller that novelist Dennis Lehane penned, Scorsese injects the movie with an air of ambiguity - every moment is charged with suggestion and, frankly, insanity - forcing you to pay attention. As you are wrapped up in the wonderful characters, disturbing pathos, and taut pacing, Scorsese has fun indulging his cinematic sleight of hand. Scorsese packs the film with so many thrilling details, surreal asides and masterful set-ups that we can't help but enjoy the ride. And the cast is having fun as well, diving into their characters and ladling on the innuendo with arched eyebrows and shifty glances.<br/><br/>Resembling a psychotropic reverie or unhinged fever dream, Shutter Island finds Martin Scorsese at his most technically accomplished as he triumphs with a powerful noir pastiche that sends the audience into a world of psychosis and paranoia. A luridly enjoyable ride!"

Brilliant performance! I was expecting to be a little more scary, but it was OK.

","Am I real? Or is everything around me is true, who am I? Yup these are some weird doubts that pricked my mind after watching this 2010's Psychological thriller ''Shutter Island'', initially this movie seems to be moving from neurotic to the psychotic, but it's only at the end we come to know that Edward Daniels aka Andrew Laeddis (DiCaprio) is suffering with some serious psychotic illness.<br/><br/>This film is about the formation of new identity in order to disclose the previous unpleasant events happened; the movie begins with US Marshal Edward Daniels and his investigation partner Chuck Aule come to the Shutter Island (an isolated mental asylum for criminally insane) on the investigation of disappearing in-patient Rachel in the course of his investigation he never get the proper cooperation that he expected from the Hospital authority, this make him to think that something is wrong in that place meanwhile his hallucinated image of his wife tells that Andrew Laeddis the one who was responsible for killing his wife is also in the same island, he also tries to find him, in the course of finding him he also encounters some unexpected characters like George Noyce and ''the real Rachel Solando'' from them he learns that the hospital is conducting the experiment on the patients in a very barbaric way using the method of lobotomise and even he is under their experiment, knowing this he comes to the lighthouse the place where he believed that operation takes place and there he finds Dr.Cawley who tells Daniels that he is not in any kind of investigation he is been in that island from two years under the treatment for killing his bipolar wife who killed their children, and his real identity is not Edward Daniels instead he himself is the Andrew Laeddis, and his so called partner Chuck was his doctor who treated him and the entire plot was the part of their treatment to make him cure, he initially don't believe these and faints, when he is woken up he accepts the truth that he is Andrew Laeddis, but after sometime when he tells his Doctor whom he believed as his parter about escaping from the island they think he is not cured and they decide to lobotomise him and at last with the statement of ""Which would be worse? To live as a monster or to die as the good man'' he goes to be lobotomised.<br/><br/>The entire tricky plot is so interesting that every bit of the movie is very curious, the must watch flick for every Psych-thriller fan, it's been neatly made without any flaws to be found (though some could be exempted) DiCaprio is fabulous with his performance, his neat portrayal of an investigator and the psychotic patient were mind-blowing, Mark Ruffalo and Ben Kingsley are the best overall its curious plot holds you up to the end, the cinematography and the unique BGM's are some other +point of these movie."

","Really, Scorsese should just give it away for anyone. The man is one of the most brilliant directors of our time. Anyway, let me get to the actual movie; I just saw it at a early screening and have to write this while I'm thinking about how stunning it was. Shutter Island is certainly not a typical film, not even for Scorsese. It is a different take for the director, and he does it, as he does every film, perfectly, so much as to be in his own league of film-making. I don't want to give anything away, but I will say this: Shutter Island was completely unexpected, and a great start to 2010. It had all the components of a great film, and then some. The acting is spot on from every character; none of it seems forged or out of place. The script is fantastic; it has one of the most intriguing plots I have seen in a while (exception being Tarantino's Basterds). Everything, down to the set's lighting, was perfectly executed. I will say that not everyone will like this; Shutter Island, again, isn't your typical movie. To those, though, who do choose to see this film, be ready for a compelling, gripping, thought-provoking experience, so much so that you might think to see it again for further clarity (I know I will; it was so entertaining and my mind was blown!). Don't be surprised if you see this at the next Oscars... a must watch for everyone"
"firatkahraman","6","1","3","20 December 2012"," Not enough
","The world would be stupid if this movie is to be considered a very good psychological thriller/ twister. Come on, there are so many better ones. Let's compare this with Tarantino's Inglorious Basterds (about the same time), though not exactly categorized as a psychological thriller but similar to Shutter Island, relies heavily on the suspense/twist factor to win the crowd. Inglorious Basterds was successful in that regard, as I was not able to predict the next outcome because the sequence of events happened in an almost random manner; even if someone can predict it, he would find it difficult to catch up to the quick pace of the movie. Shutter Island, regrettably, gave off TOO MANY HINTS from the very beginning. I, at the very least, already foresee the truth during the 1st quarter of the movie. I know this is based on a novel, but Shutter Island's ending lacks the kick that Inglorious Basterds had, probably because the desired effect is sure to be tuned down once you figured out what was going on. If i were to edit this movie, I could easily remove certain 'spoiler elements'.for example, and Shutter island would be more better. Fortunately, the abundant amount of twists (thanks to the convenient use of hallucinations) kept me watching even when I already knew what is going to happen."

Leonardo DiCaprio is our eyes, ears and hope in this thriller that gets unlocked in pieces with the help of the various doctors on Shutter Island. We had some clues, but this reviewer would say not enough of them. ""Which would be worse to live as a monster - or die as a good man?"" Scorcese tried noir and failed at something he usually aces: respecting his audience."

I felt the same way about J Edgar and Inception, but I've just now realized it consciously.<br/><br/>LD was, from this perspective, a bad choice for the lead role in Shutter Island, because I ended up not really caring what happened to him. I was intrigued, confused and ""creeped out"" by his surrealistic fantasy experience, but I didn't feel invested in the outcome. I was merely interested -- merely a spectator. Of course it's unreasonable to expect a movie to do more -- to trick you into becoming personally involved in the story -- after all, it's just a movie.

It would take, I would argue, someone like Hotspur to sever this Gordian knot which is as complex as anything David Mamet ever wrote. Usually where labyrinthine plots are involved most, if not all inconsistencies are explained in the last reel but unless I missed something that is not the case here. This is what I saw. An opening scene in which a Federal marshall, awaiting a ferry to transport him to Shutter Island, meets for the first time, his assistant. Both men are in civilian clothes and carrying both i.d. and guns. Having reached the island, which houses an asylum for the criminally insane - they are going there specifically to investigate the 'escape' of a female patient - they show their i.d. at the gate of the prison and surrender their weapons. The best part of two hours later the psychiatrist in charge tells the Federal marshall that he is, in fact, a patient and has been for the past two years, further, his 'assistant' identifies himself as the psychiatrist in charge of the Federal marshall's case. If this is in fact the case, why allow an insane man to leave the prison in civilian clothes - all inmates wear white uniforms - and furnish him with (presumably) fake i.d. and a gun?

He is probably Master of this Genre, and then he pops up with the movie Shutter Island, a Psychological Thriller / Mystery Movie.<br/><br/>Shutter Island is about a US Marshall and his partner investigating the mysterious disappearance of a patient who escaped from a hospital for the criminally insane. When he arrives at the island all sort of strange things begin to happen and he later doubts his sanity while some horrible secrets of the island are revealed.<br/><br/>The two US Marshalls are played by Leonardo DiCaprio & Mark Ruffalo, both brilliant actors and living up to the reputation of being in a Scorsese film, not that it is anything new for Leonardo. Other cast joining them is Ben Kinsley (Creepy), Michelle Williams (Ghosty), Emily Mortimer (Mental) and Jackie Earle Haley (Crazy).<br/><br/>The visual effects are superb, the cinematography is great, the story is well written, and to be honest there isn't much wrong with this movie.

"Zen-2-Zen","Null","1","3","13 April 2011"," Inconsequential Pileup, Misleading Advertising and Scorsese as a Technician but not Artist
","First reason for giving this film 1 is misleading advertising. It's declared as a drama about a US Marshal investigating a disappearance case but it's actually a psycho horror movie far away from a case investigation drama by any standard and that is completely different and not particularly respected genre. So, unless you actually like psycho horror genre (with creeps and disfigured faces) you might as well save yourself time and grief.<br/><br/>A greedy rookie looking for a quick score might be forgiven for cheating but for experienced director like Scorsese it's undignified gimmick persisted as a false description here on IMDb which is supposed to be truthful.<br/><br/>Second reason is that it leaks water left and right and wastes enormous time to drag viewers through completely inconsequential pileup of scenes as if director couldn't make up his mind what to do or couldn't bear to give up scenes just because he had them. That's a trait of a technician who just collects scenes, not an artist who does scenes with a goal. Again, forgivable for a rookie but not for Scorsese.<br/><br/>Writing something negative about Martin Scorsese is risky business these days but understanding what, how and why went wrong with this film may help to explain why after raising to early prominence with ""Taxi Driver"" Scorsese never managed to become the artistic force that people expected and rooted for him to be.<br/><br/>He doesn't seem to know where to stop when faced with inconsequential pileup of anything or to say no to a horror affectation in a film that's not declared as horror. Reaching for a horror affectation is always the sing of a director lost, and the place of easy slippage for a director trying to do a film noir and forgetting the line that can never be crossed.<br/><br/>This problem becomes very clear in this since Scorsese started with a mystery novel which is choke full of pointless red herrings but the novel can't be blamed since for it's genre that's normal. People don't buy these books for artistic value but to spend disproportionate time reading throw-away red herrings.<br/><br/>Director is the one who bears the responsibility for taking apart both the book and the leaky scrip which forgot the nature of the film as a form, reduce clutter and polish up till he has a coherent form. That is where the principal failure of Scorsese lies - not expending any artistic effort and acting as a technician greedy for more and more scenes which lead nowhere.<br/><br/>This is again a thing that a rookie on a thin budget can be forgiven for but not Scorsese who is expected to refuse a script when it's too leaky to be worth fixing and is above all expected to have his films honestly declared as belonging to a genre they actually belong to.<br/><br/>Mind you that this is not an academic point - when a film is as leaky as this one that destroys aspects that could have worked well. Clear example is how it ruined otherwise excellent concept of nested dreams. <br/><br/>It uses conceptual structure of a nested dream that Nolan used with great brilliance in ""Inception"" and the two films were produced during roughly the same time frame but with Scorsese starting and finishing first and DiCaprio playing in both. So it's fair to assume that the nested dream concept was the fashion of the season and that Nolan was a copy-cat so to speak.<br/><br/>Nolan however made the nested dream concept fully consequential and held the whole structure of his film tight and fully functional. At the same time Scorsese allowed it to disintegrate into inconsequential mess of not even red herrings but completely sideways fluff. In hindsight one can say that Nolan saved the concept of nested dreams from being ruined forever by Scorsese's careless use.<br/><br/>It's hard to say if this is the worst film in Scorsese's opus, because fragments do have technical quality if considered in isolation, but it is the most disingenuous and incoherent."
"cuppa_tetleys","5","1","3","3 April 2011"," Great source material, unsatisfactory adaptation
","Firstly, if you haven't seen the film, before you do, do not try and learn anything about it or ask anyone if it's any good, stop reading and just watch it- you'll enjoy it more. Secondly, I see this a lot these days; great source material that has good potential is often wasted when translated to another genre, and unfortunately this is the case with Shutter Island. <br/><br/>The story and characters are both very good, with a well-paced narrative that never feels rushed or awkward despite being adapted from a book and with DiCaprio doing a good job as the protagonist we sympathise for him and we come to understand that he is rather complex. However, my gripes lie, unfortunately, with the writing and the acting. Perhaps it's because I'm spoiled by gems such as The Social Network that are fantastically well-scripted and convincing, so anything that falls below my expectations I deem as bad. But there were some moments in Shutter Island where I was really taken out of the experience by how hollow and one-note some of the characters were. Conversations were spoken as if the actors were in different rooms for the most part, with no characters thinking or reacting to what's been said, they're just spouting what they've been told to say. Of course this isn't present for the entire film, but frequently enough for me to be pulled out of the story and start glancing at my watch.<br/><br/>Another issue I had with it being adapted from a book, is that in a novel, all exposition is through dialogue or introspection - nevertheless, with words. Film also holds the visual element, but here often fails to use it. Many of the important plot points that could have been briefly explained visually with possible narration were told just through characters standing and talking to one another for lengthy periods. The film devolves into non-naturalism on multiple occasions so why it couldn't have in those instances baffles me, because it would have made the story so much more involving. <br/><br/>The writing in general is not terrible, but it occasionally feels awkward when characters are forced to switch rapidly between two emotions, as if the script was written in sections by different people; one second they could be sarcastic and calm - the next extremely angry and aggressive with no clear sign of irritation. Which brings me to the directing. I know Scorsese is a legend, but here it's below average with pans that feel out of place and cuts feel unnatural, as if they were pointless, or they feel like we've missed something. This is probably also due to bad editing, with cuts being too early or too late, or characters movements being repeated from a different angle that disrupts flow. My problem with character interaction maybe that reaction shots were simply edited out, making performances feel wooden when they were not. Some parts, also don't gel well with others; there is a sequence in which DiCaprio comes across a man who offers him a ride to somewhere on the island. He accepts and they begin to drive to their destination, but the driver starts philosophically rambling on about a major theme that was previously mentioned, and I felt as if I was being hammered in the face with a message. It had no story relevance, no character development, just a big fat message slapping me across the face that was integrated so extremely poorly that I couldn't help but cringe inside. <br/><br/>On the positive, however, the film was at its best when it diverted from realism to a more symbolic and dream-like style that could either be memories or foreshadowing or something else - and that ambiguity is engaging, it keeps you guessing and sometimes you're never sure what is reality and what is not. The ending was good also, as it brought together all the little traces from around the story and brought them together in a shocking and satisfying way, and although I guessed most of it - there will definitely be moments when you go 'so that's what that meant!'. <br/><br/>Overall, worth a watch, but I'd recommend the book over the film as the plot and characters are the most interesting parts which are just airlifted from it anyway."

","Good actors, good location, good directing and good soundtrack makes this movie tolerable. But luck of original idea, unfortunately. It started quite promising - eerie island, strange people, confusing hints. But there was no progress within story, it was all the same, just repeating. And after a while it was quite disappointment to realize - after seeing 1/3 of movie - that you know exactly how it goes on and what is the point. I was a little bit sad because some movies of Scorsese have been real masterpieces. But from other hand it is understandable that it is extremely hard to produce every movie like 10-point-masterpiece."

","Films similar to Shutter Island rely upon the viewer's strict attention because it is important at the end and sometimes it is easy to guess the conclusion of the film before the end. What makes Shutter Island so good is that you know as much as the lead character does and it never feels like we, the viewer are going over old territory that has been used before in films. <br/><br/>This is one of those film where I can name the people involved and you can instantly decide whether you will want to see this. Its directed by Martin Scorsese, the cinematographer is Richard Richardson, edited by Thelma Schoonmaker and stars Leonardo DiCaprio, Mark Ruffalo and Ben Kingsley. Everyone and everything in this film is fantastic. <br/><br/>What some films similar to this try to create but fail to do is atmosphere. Shutter Island is dripping in atmosphere and can become quite disturbing in places, particularly during the flashbacks. To go into detail would spoil the film.<br/><br/>Shutter Island is dark and will not appeal to all because of its content. If you are a fan of Scosese's work or of any of the actors then this is unmissable. The film is brilliant and I look forward to watching it again."

","I gave this movie only 2 stars as the actors did a good job however the whole story was promising until whoever the director or the scriptwriter or producer who ever decided that this was going to be the script. The mistake was made when they intertwined the holocaust into the story. How many years have to go by until we won't have to see at least 20 of those types of movies on the screen per year? Like that was the only major massacre in the history on the whole wide world. Why could not they just make the story about a plain madness of a man with just plain memories of a horrible killing. Why did not they mention let's say Gulag or we could name a few.This really spoiled De Caprio's and all the other good actors effort as this way it seemed unrealistic, so forced to me like they were forced to play in a high-school musical just because politically that is correct and it is necessary to do so for everyone at least once a year like a mandatory appearance in a overly worn story."

","I am one who is hot/cold when it comes to Martin Scorsese. More times than not I am on the cold side. However, with Shutter Island, for me, this is one of Scorsese's best ever. Decaprio was in two of the best films that were put out this year. Inception, and this early year gem. Decaprio is absolutely brilliant, as is everyone in this film.<br/><br/>The fun of this film is trying to figure it out as it goes. You think it is going one way and then you are not sure and you start thinking it is going another.The island itself becomes a character in the film. It is almost like it comes alive.<br/><br/>I really don't want to give away too much of the story. Read the synopsis, but stay away from spoiler filled discussions and/or reviews. The less you know about the film, the better. My best piece of advice; don't try too hard to figure the film out. It is really easy to start trying to guess what is going to happen next. You are going to have an inclination of what is going on, but don't try and start guessing what is around the next corner. The fun of Shutter Island is figuring it out on the way to an ending that you may or may not have figured out. Either way, a highly enjoyable thriller."
"Magenta_Bob","8","1","3","7 January 2011"," Solid exercise in style by Scorsese
","Shutter Island is a solid exercise in style and a largely successful psychological thriller with a few horror elements (and clichés) thrown in for good measure. In terms of genre and style, it is a bit different than what I usually associate with Martin Scorsese, but he still manages to make it very much into his own. While it's not his usual style, it is stylish as usual with a terrific score and cinematography, particularly in the dream sequences.<br/><br/>Many people have been complaining about the twist being easy to foresee, but I think that holds little relevance in Shutter Island. What is still clever about it is how the film puts the viewer right in the middle of the conflict; everything the hospital staff says could be interpreted as another lie and part of the conspiracy, whereas everything Leonardo DiCaprio's character says could be seen as denial of his condition, which seems like the most reasonably explanation by the end, giving it a surprisingly emotional impact.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio is also worth praising. Lately he seems to have been playing a lot of these heroes with damaged minds, and he does it with bravado here; his fascinating character, along with the good direction and the thrilling plot, makes Shutter Island one of the best films of 2010."
"cinemaniac_x","10","1","3","28 December 2010"," A beautiful film that changed my life
","Continuing their string of box-office hits and critical successes, legendary dynamic duo Martin Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio are back together again in their fourth collaboration, Shutter Island. DiCaprio plays Teddy Daniels, a U.S. Marshal investigating with his partner, Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo), the disappearance of a murderess from a maximum security hospital for the criminally insane located on sinister Shutter Island. The hospital staff, headed by Dr. John Cawley (Ben Kingsley), seems to be hiding something, and with increasingly eerie occurrences and a fast-approaching storm, it is apparent that time is running out and that there are ulterior motives for all on Shutter Island.<br/><br/>Flawless, powerful performances from DiCaprio, Kingsley, Ruffalo, Michelle Williams, and the rest of the cast, as well as a quick-paced, no-nonsense screenplay adapted from the novel by Dennis Lehane, make for a gripping, dark thriller. The music, none of which was written specifically for the film, remarkably, is one of the most noticeable aspects of the film. Music plays an important part in establishing the tone, at times taut and ominous and at others beautifully tragic. These elements combine with director Scorsese's incredible attention to detail to produce pure poetry on screen.<br/><br/>The psychological thriller is a considerable departure from Scorsese and DiCaprio's usual repertoire, but together they have redefined the genre and expanded its boundaries. As genre films go, Shutter Island is not at all a typical movie but rather an experience, an honest, elegant, and heartbreaking portrayal of the human mind and memory that means so much more than the story or twist ending itself. And this twist ending, the hallmark of the thriller genre, has disappointed some viewers because it was not intended to be shocking in the way of The Sixth Sense's ""He was dead the whole time!"" or Psycho's similarly scandalous revelation. Instead, the ending was meant to shed some light on the beautiful enigma that is the human mind.<br/><br/>Despite this quiet contemplation of life's big questions that Shutter Island entails, the film is still enthralling, a thrill ride from start to finish. It does what many other films of its genre fail to do: achieve a perfect balance between the psychological and the thriller aspects. The film seemingly transports viewers to the island and allows them to walk in the protagonist's shoes like no other movie has done before. However, the plot moves in so many different directions that it becomes mind-bending and, at times, difficult to follow.<br/><br/>DiCaprio, front and center in the film, steals the stage with his beautiful portrayal of an anguished man searching for answers and piecing together his own fractured past. The film itself is also like a puzzle; viewers gather pieces of it as the film progresses, and some (who feel that the ending is not enough of a twist) may put it together more quickly. However, by the end, when the puzzle is completed for everyone, the image that is finally presented will still differ for each viewer, for the pieces may fit together in any number of ways. It is a film that connects deeply with its viewers and completely engages them; because it is relevant on so many levels, it allows for each person's own interpretation of its true meaning.<br/><br/>At the same time, Shutter Island pays tribute to the great Alfred Hitchcock, master of the psychological thriller, and is also suggestive of Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece The Shining. Like the latter's secluded hotel, Shutter Island's insane asylum is the perfect place to depict shattered lives and crumbling reality. This very tender, complex, and human film will leave viewers bewildered and overwhelmed with the contemplation of how some actions can change our lives forever, how we can never quite escape the past."

","This film works well in a number of ways: It is gorgeously photographed It is beautifully acted It is intriguingly well-plotted<br/><br/>DiCaprio had a chance to show off here and he displayed talents I didn't know about. Actually the skeleton of the film dates back ninety years with ""The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari"", the famous German silent. The story is handled quite well and will keep the audience gasping or panting but not out-guessing. This is quite a departure from Scorsese's other films and he handles his materials very well. Personally, I wasn't entirely happy with the musical score. There were too many elements that diverted our attention. Mahler was in his sub-Brahms period and that didn't play very well in this context. Too much of a musical hodgepodge is rather like having too many directors at the helm. I hope this doesn't become a trend. Aside from that I thoroughly enjoyed the whole thing.<br/><br/>Curtis Stotlar"

","I am not a psychiatrist, but I think the Mr. Scorcese and Mr. DeCaprio have put on the screen a remarkable story of personality change resulting from denial. Today's shrinks might scoff at what the doctors were trying to accomplish, but remember that Shutter Island is fiction and set in the early 1950s, a time of much less sophistication in mental disorders and treatment. The way this film moves from reality to the unreal as the DeCaprio role requires is a magical bit of film making. There apparently is a lot of ambiguity for some, but after the viewing and the surprising and dramatic conclusion, I found that the picture didn't miss a beat in confirming that the patient, DeCaprio was brought from prison two years ago to the mental hospital for an experiment in treatment of one who had lost connection with reality because of the trauma and consequences of past violence on his wife and perhaps others within the walls of his prison. The experiment ends in failure as he's led from the hospital, to he boat and back to internment in prison, still a prisoner of his mental state. Congratulations to the director and Leonardo DeCaprio for a fine and thought provoking movie."

Rather confusing film until the very end, with subplot extras just add to the confusion.

Good use of camera shots and filmography too."

","Not much will spoil the experience of ""Shutter Island"" since it seems meant as a psychological riddle that once you know its clues and have an answer, you instantly have to watch it again to experience how it unfolds psychologically. The story takes place at Ashecliff Hospital for the criminally insane (Boston harbor, 1954), but if that doesn't tip you to its mysteriousness, then just wait for the deep tones of the music and the bloody-charred dream imagery.<br/><br/>The build up is similar to arriving at Skull Island in ""King Kong"", but perhaps a closer comparison is to imagine arriving at the Overlook Hotel in Stanley Kubrick's ""The Shining"" while in a B-movie. The mixture is a bit silly, but it doesn't matter since it has 'such delightful sights to show you'. It's also a Martin Scorsese film adaption of Dennis Lehane's 2003 novel, so you get the benefit of crafty camera shifts and an almost lustful embrace of the absurd. The story doesn't seem quite worthy of his efforts at times, but perhaps that's the whole point of comparing it to horror, film noir, and B-movies as some reviews have done. It's meant to go to extremes and perhaps hide a few of its subtler secrets in shadows, fog, and rain.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio stars in his fourth collaboration with Martin Scorsese (""Gangs of New York"", ""The Aviator"", ""The Departed""). We enter the movie from his perspective. He's a U.S. Marshal named Edward ""Teddy"" Daniel, working with a new partner Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo). As he's arriving to the island on a boat, his face is white as a ghost and he's sick from the water around him. Is it seasickness or is he paranoid about water? Why are the guards in full force? Why does his partner have so much trouble handing over his gun and holster? Why do the prisoners/patients look at him oddly?<br/><br/>Outwardly Teddy (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his partner are investigating a prisoner/patient escape of a woman by the name of Rachel Solando. She developed elaborate defense mechanisms and psychological problems after she drowned her three kids. In fact, almost all of the ""patients"" have committed serious crimes and the hospital doubles as a specialized prison. John Carroll Lynch plays the Deputy Warden, McPherson, who is often charged with showing the federal Marshals around, and Ted Levine plays the unnamed Warden in a lesser role.<br/><br/>However, the head psychiatrist, Dr. John Cawley (Ben Kingsley), prefers to treat his patients with respect under the maxim of a ""moral fusion between law and order and clinical care"". His hospitality extends only so far to Teddy. He allows Teddy to interview the patients and investigate Rachel's room, but he refuses to let him see the patient files. Another doctor, a German Dr. Jeremiah Naehring (Max von Sydow), sharpens the denial of Teddy's second request for the files with cryptic talk of defense mechanisms and a knowing look beside a fireplace. But you have to wonder why the doctors are so reticent to help recover the patient. Teddy rages out of Dr. Cawley's office intending to end his investigation, but a violent storm and bad migraines force him to rest for the night with the orderlies. Teddy's dreams take on a life of their own. Scorsese seems to really enjoy these dream scenes. Teddy dreams of embracing a woman with her back charred through like wood and her front leaking blood. He helps her set the three drowned children into the lake. Intermixed with these images are flashbacks to his time as a soldier, entering a German concentration camp, seeing too many bodies to count, and taking revenge on the German guards. Something in his dreams triggers him to stay on the island and continue his search. He becomes obsessed with finding Andrew Laeddis, a man he suspects of burning his house with his wife in it. (In fact, he suggests that he took the investigation to hunt the man.)<br/><br/>Violent extremes are central to the style of the film, and perhaps symbolize the violence of nature and its lack of morality. After the storm knocks out power, Teddy is free to roam the hospital grounds. His main fascination are two places where he hopes to find Andrew Laeddis: a lighthouse where he believes experiments and lobotomies are performed in secret, and Ward C where the most dangerous prisoners/patients reside. He visits tombs, caves, and the dark halls of Ward C. The wind picks up so violently you could swear it looked like ""The Wizard of Oz"" outside (during the tornado sequence). The Warden summarizes the mood: ""There is no moral orders as pure as this storm. There's no moral order at all. There's just this: can my violence conquer yours?""<br/><br/>""Shutter Island"" is lucky it came out before ""Inception"" because it doesn't have nearly as deep a maze of ideas. But the movie definitely challenges you to figure out Teddy's psychological state through subtle puzzle pieces. It also uses dreams to the point of confusing reality and fantasy. We don't always know whether Teddy is hallucinating some of the people he meets or whether they are actual people. As noted above, it has witty lines and excellent atmospherics. The experience of the film is more quizzical than mysterious and more strange and quirky than creepy. However, the best part is that it gives you a chance to reboot with a different mind set and re-watch it to get its full benefit. On re-watching the film it becomes more of a meditation on the human psyche: a few varieties of madness and, through subtle suggestions, Teddy's subconscious desire for violent extremes (did we miss the best comparison, as Leonardo DiCaprio's character embraces his bloody-burnt wife, with the pleasurable-horror of ""Hellraiser""?)."
"janeinvan","9","1","3","8 October 2010"," Film Review: Shutter Island
","Shutter Island, officially released in Feb 2010, is the fourth collaboration of Director Martin Scorsese and movie star Leonardo DiCaprio. Different from their previous gangster movies, this one provides us a fresh style.<br/><br/>The film is adapted from Dennis Lehane's 2003 bestselling novel. The story starts with Teddy Daniels (played by DiCaprio) as a U.S. marshal with his new partner Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo) launching ""shutter island"", where is an asylum for the criminally insane located on a rocky island in Boston harbor accessible only by ferry, to search for a prisoner, or rather a patient. As they approach, a hurricane sets in. The beginning already set the atmosphere of the movie as mystery, thrill and oppression.<br/><br/>As Teddy continued investigation, we saw that Teddy suspects brain experiments have been done on the patients on the island. We follow the perfect logic of his mind and everything looks reasonable and convincing until the big twist of the ending. It's actually Teddy himself who murdered his insane wife after she had killed their lovely kids. He can't face his guilt and the family tragedy, and then created another himself living in his own fancy world. He is seriously insane. To heal his mental illness, his primary doctor used ""group role-play"" treatment method and pretended to be ""Teddy's partner"" - Chuck into his imaginary world. The course of seeking the truth on the island is also the process in which Teddy finds real ""himself"", his healthy mind.<br/><br/>The original amazing plot was constructed excellently by the film maker team. The characterization was performed brilliantly by DiCaprio showing both muscularity and vulnerability, and by other supporting roles, like Mark Ruffalo and Sir Ben Kingsley. Director Scorsese is very successful in playing around the combination of illusion and reality, making the audiences to see two different versions of story woven in the same movie. This also has us to recall Hitchcockian elements. On the whole, the well-done job demonstrates a worthwhile watching movie for audiences.<br/><br/>Several genres were presented in the trailer. First, the trailer includes the hardboiled fiction and film noir of the 1950s. Next, additional genres of conspiracy theories and psychological thrillers were involved. Each frame shot and designed by Robert Richardson and Dante Ferretti along with music elements conveys the complexities of the human psyche. When Teddy was on his way finding out the truth, the audiences also see his flashbacks, dreams and hallucinations - including the death of his wife, Dolores (Michelle Williams), in an apartment-building fire and what he witnessed at the liberation of the Dachau concentration camp when he was serving as an American soldier during World War II. These seemed confusing at first, but actually are all building up to the climax. People believe or doubt memories sometimes and think dreams must mean something or be a reflection of subconscious. When we look back these details, we now can complete the puzzles, explain the suspense and understand why the protagonist became insane.<br/><br/>Teddy found the truth eventually, but whether to accept the truth and how to face the reality is his free choice given that he mentally returns to normal. The dilemma of ""to live as a monster，or to die as a good man"" leaves us an open ending as well. Once again, Scorsese and his skillful team show the magic in their work which triggers our deeper thinking."

","Quite enjoyed this but the twist is fairly predictable. Thats not a bad thing necessarily, but the problem I had (and this is something I'm surprised not to read on other reviews) was that the supposed reality revealed within the ending was simply too far fetched to be believed.<br/><br/>When presented with an existential tension in a story of this ilk, Occam's razor should be a good guide to what reality is. In this case of Shutter Island the opposite is true; the idea that this amount of risk, expense and effort would be entertained for some elaborate roleplay to try to rescue the sanity of ""the asylum's highest risk patient"" is simply not credible and left me thinking that no one sane would actually believe it.<br/><br/>Far more believable is that the conspiracy theory is the true story, and a ""double twist"" might have been far more satisfying outcome (at least for me). Regrettably, this was not the case.<br/><br/>I thought this slight plot failure was shame as the atmosphere and performances are excellent and other than this the film is very enjoyable."

The element of surprise is somehow weakened by some elements that ""warn"" the experienced viewer of what will eventually folllow. The obvious of some observations or conclusions prevents you from really identify with the main character in his emotions and approach. In some scenes the characters appear pretentious or simplistic . The film is also ridden with many thriller/horror clichés.

Besides the on going investigation, Daniels has pushed for an assignment to Shutter Island for some time as he believes an arsonist who burnt down his building (killing his wife) is located somewhere in the facility. After much snooping around he realises that all isn't exactly how it seems and he believes illegal, brain mushing experiments are happening on Shutter Island which Daniels thinks are linked to Nazi's. Throw a hurricane into the mix which causes some more dangerous criminals to escape as the clues stack up and you really only have opened the front door to Shutter Island. To go into any more detail here, would be classed as a spoiler, so I'll leave well enough alone! DiCaprio's acting here, starts well and by the end he puts in a really impressive performance. And as the movie continues, his performance just keeps getting better and better and better. The real show stopper though, is Ben Kingsley. As the Dr. who is one of the few responsible for what happens on Shutter Island, he is truly convincing and regardless of what he may do or say, this is one character you will love to hate! <br/><br/>Some might find Shutter Island a little predictable at times, and to be fair on occasion it can be, but your still not entirely sure whether or not the predictability is actually genuine, or is it a little distraction to throw you off what you think you know! The visuals in Shutter Island are, in true Scorsese fashion, quite stunning and varied. The actual hospital itself is quite a contrast with beautifully kept gardens on the outside to the madness that lives on the inside. <br/><br/>On another note though, at times though, the soundtrack which uses various modern classical piece's can be over powering and while it should add to the tension, at times it's too loud and over shadow's what's going on, on screen! <br/><br/>Soundtrack criticism's aside, by the time Shutter Island comes to it's thrilling finale, you'll actually feel like you were kept prisoner by Martin Scorsese. This movie will mess with your head for the first half as quite a number of scenes, to me anyway, look quite experimental for Scorsese, as flashback's and nightmare's surround Teddy Daniels. Then around the middle, it level's out and as an audience you get your bearings and then off we go to the crazy house again as the movie twist's and turn's around in your mind in the final chapters. When Shutter Island closes it's door and the credits roll, you won't be running out the door of the cinema. Far from it, you'll slowly wander out thinking about what has just taken place. Did Martin Scorsese really climb inside my mind with his movie? Was his movie an almighty head trip? Was I actually a patient in Shutter Island for 138 minutes! One word answers the above questions. And it's not No or maybe. It's a resounding Yes! Shutter Island, while its not Scorsese's finest work and it's not for everybody, it's certainly one of his better and is thoroughly enjoyable! And the weird thing is, it's even more enjoyable when it's over as your brain attempts to figure out what's just happened!"
"dvdgb","10","1","3","4 August 2010"," Extraordinary psychological thriller!
","From all the films I've seen of Martin Scorsese I would say this one is the best! Visually it's beautiful taking care of the colors following the movement of the wind drawing by tree leaves and the music is so perfect, so hypnotic. In some scenes I could remember Luis Buñuel, specially the parts of the dreams of course, messages coming from the subconscious building fictitious characters to masking the truth. I really felt the pain and anguish of that tormented man very well interpreted by Di Caprio. God loving the violence, what a thesis eh? Yes, we can see Love and Hatred sharing the same space none is better than the other, both are necessary to put in to movement the world, the world in which every human being has to be connive with all the beauty and horror of our souls. All this magnificently constructed with crew of actors and producers that left no space for errors. I even couldn't avoid the tear coming out from my eyes at the end of the film.<br/><br/>Thank you Scorsese this was brilliant!"
"alejandrozoo","5","1","3","4 August 2010"," Lynchian flop
","This movie has an expensive cast, expensive production, good camera, and a decent plot. It's the necessity to make an entertainment piece of work 'artsy', which brings it all crashing down to make it almost unbearable and slightly ridiculous. The attempt to bring a surreal and fantastic atmosphere to a straight up thriller just does not work in this case, although I respect the attempt. The thickness of the plot in Lynch's 'Blue Velvet', or the wonderful well thought through events and props in Guillermo del Toro's 'Pan's Labyrinth', for instance, have to be committed to all the way, and not a half-attempt as it is done here. All that happens here is that the actors seem forced and their lines scream out 'I am so poetic' at you throughout the whole movie! Even the blood which may have been an attempt to create some sort of color play and effect just seems like someone dropped a bucket of acrylic paint all over the place."
"lovemelovemyflares","9","1","3","31 July 2010"," A trick of the mind
","Shutter Island is essentially two films in one. The story starts with Teddy and his partner 'Chuck' investigating the disappearance of Rachel Solando, who has escaped from her cell. After the first viewing, the audience are under the impression that the staff at the mental institute are the 'bad guys' and that Teddy is trying to undercover something sinister. The film begins like a horror film with the chilling and dramatic music that booms during their arrival at the Institute. The tension increases with the ferocious storm that is seemingly holding Teddy captive. When Teddy first arrives, it seems he has an aggressive stance in his conversations with the professors and they note his excellent 'defence mechanisms'. However at the same time there is an underlying current that something is being held back from Teddy and that he is actually under the microscope himself.<br/><br/>As the film progresses, we learn that Teddy has a turbulent past. He suffers from regular flashbacks to scenes from the Holocaust as well as flashbacks involving his late wife, who apparently died in an arson attack. His subconscious is peppered with feelings of guilt and regret as he is faced with piles of corpses and an execution style scene. Teddy soon begins to start his own investigation as he suspects that the man responsible for his wife's death is a patient at the institute. However he is suddenly struck down by a series of mysterious migraines. The viewer is led to believe that the professor is drugging Teddy as he apparently administers him aspirin for his pain.<br/><br/>Teddy's world quickly becomes more distorted as he begins to have hallucinations of his dead wife, urging him to kill the man who set their apartment alight. The film explores his heightened levels of paranoia as he feels that everybody on the island is plotting against him, even his own trusted partner. The twist at the end is truly gut-wrenching and you really feel the utter sense of bewilderment for Teddy as his current existence is shown to be total fabrication and that the 'bad guys' are playing along in his fantasy world. This is only film your see where you will feel absolutely compelled to watch it again almost immediately so that you can see the true reality and not the one that Teddy has created.<br/><br/>This film also makes some interesting observations about mental illness and the lack of understanding about people who reside in these institutions.A film like this demonstrates that the mind can have a distorted interpretation of situations if presented in a certain way. Therefore Shutter Island actually performs a trick of the mind, where the viewer can relate to Teddy's utter confusion and feel like they're going insane themselves. This begs the question to whether seemingly 'normal' people all have a tendency for insanity if the right buttons are pressed?"
"Lejink","6","1","3","25 July 2010"," To the lighthouse
","Not quite sure what genre this piece of psychodrama schlock from Martin Scorces belongs too, but it's an interesting piece, straining perhaps after the heights of say Hitchcock's ""Spellbound"" or Clouzot's ""Les Diabolique"", but falling a little bit marooned on its own shore by the time we reach the conclusion.<br/><br/>For one thing it's too long and frequently disappears up its own backside in its clever-clever exposition, plus, I guessed the ""twist"" very early on in the piece. Also Leo DiCaprio is no Gregory Peck and for me never really engaged my sympathy or even general interest as Scorcese explores the canyons of his mind.<br/><br/>The symbolism throughout is a little heavy - handed too, the bleak, isolated Shutter Island itself akin to DiCaprio's tortured mind-scape and the lighthouse as his shining way-out, although I suspect Mr Scorcese doesn't really want us to get too metaphysical here. If anything it comes off best as a homage to that strain of movie psycho-horror usually peopled with Vincent Price or possibly the comic pulp fiction of the same era.<br/><br/>I enjoyed it and applaud the director's left-field excursion away from the mainstream - interestingly the last time he ventured near this territory was in the unashamedly populous ""Cape Fear"". I got into it more once I realised Scorcese was presenting entertainment over art, but felt it could have been drawn tighter together into a more coherent and exciting whole."
"axismladen","7","1","3","22 July 2010"," A good movie with an ending that lacks some imagination.
","The movie alone is good. It's not great but it's good and well worth watching. The script is well structured and the story really draws you in. The characters are well placed and the entire course of the story development is nicely done and it definitely keeps your interest going all the way until the end. Unfortunately, the ending makes it way too usual and clichéd. We've seen it a hundred times before and obviously we'll see it a hundred times again. The movie would have been worth a lot more if the ending was done with a bit more imagination. I mean, really, what where they thinking? The entire movie is brilliant and than they ruin it just like that. Come on! As i said, it's seen a hundred times before and i really have no need to see it again.<br/><br/>Martin Scorsese, contrary to everyones suspicion, again prooves him self as a director that can direct any genre and make it look good. I would dare to say that this is one of his best directed movies. Not one of his best movies but one of his best directed movies. He manages to keep the mood going and it really works with the audience. I also liked the lighting. It was brilliant. He achieved the great atmosphere with this one. That's really what i liked the most.<br/><br/>Acting was good, though, i believe the star of this movie wasn't Leo DiCaprio but Ben Kingsley. I really enjoyed his creepy performance.<br/><br/>All in all, this is a good movie that would have been great if the ending was different and more imaginative. But it's still, definitely, well worth watching."
"theHAMster999","8","1","3","17 July 2010"," A Good Film (but not his best)
","I loved this film. It starts out as a old, classic mystery but ends with a twist. The acting by DiCaprio and Ruffalo is right on target. They take you through a gripping story and you never lose focus. The direction of course is great I mean it is Martin Scorsese has he ever made a bad film. You are gripped from beginning to end even though it slows down in the middle, you still want to see what happens. My only problem with the movie is that I saw the twist coming. I called the end of the film. Most of my friends had no idea what was coming but I knew. I actually thought it was obvious. It is still a great ending and has great underlying themes within it that Scorsese is trying to get through to us but I knew it was coming. The film kind of reminds me of Memento. I think I like this film more but Memento I had no idea how the ending was going to turn out. With this I did. It is a great film you should watch it, you should buy it when it gets cheap. That is when I will purchase it when it is a year old and ten dollars at blockbuster. It is not better then The Departed but it holds its own ground. I enjoyed it and would watch it over again. If you would like to talk to me about this review or others I have done send me an email at uwanttoknome@aim.com and I will get back with you. Please tell me if this review helped or if it did not."
"planetthoughtful-1","8","1","3","10 July 2010"," Good, but not quite great...
","I missed the opportunity to see Shutter Island during its cinema release, and it has been on my list of movies to catch up with ever since. <br/><br/>Last night, finally, I managed to settle back and immerse myself in the sinister world of the remote asylum for the criminally insane that dominates Shutter Island. <br/><br/>Let me begin by saying that there is brilliance in this film -- Martin Scorsese's visualisation of the island, of the asylum, and of the period pieces that compromise the main story and the flashbacks in the film, are nothing short of stunning. Equally, DiCaprio spins an impressively immersive character, one you can't help engaging with on a number of different levels; and this is made even more impressive, for me, as DiCaprio is not an actor I generally like. <br/><br/>But where this movie slightly let me down was in the storytelling. <br/><br/>Shutter Island attempts to tell a fairly large story. Not only do we have the mysterious events on the island, but we have contextual flashbacks to several points in the main character's life, all of which build toward the shocking realisation of what is truly taking place in and around the asylum. <br/><br/>Because of the scope of the story, the movie felt a little 'staged'. Certain key elements of the plot were revealed, presumably due to economy of time of a movie experience, in ways that felt forced, as when in movies you find yourself thinking, ""Oh, you just happened to go down that corridor and have that conversation with that person, isn't that convenient?"" To give Scorsese credit -- and probably even more so to Dennis Lehane, author of the novel -- even these ""convenient"" episodes are not necessarily building you towards a better understanding of what is really happening on the island. <br/><br/>I can honestly say that at very few points during Shutter Island did I feel dragged into the storyline. I kept waiting to feel the menace of the story on a personal level -- instead, for the majority of the movie, I felt like I was... watching a movie. A brilliantly executed one, but still just a movie. <br/><br/>Even so, I'd still happily recommend this movie to fans of the thriller genre. There is every chance that the fault with not being captivated by the storyline lies with me. If nothing else, you will be rewarded by an exceptional vision and performance."

","SHUTTER ISLAND, Directed by Martin Scorsese, big deal! It's obvious I really don't give a crap about this movie. Why? I cannot actually give one reason. It may be because that I really don't give a crap about Leonardo Decrapio. Actually I hate his guts. Leonardo seems as always so unnecessarily dramatic in this one also.<br/><br/>People said this movie is kind of hard to comprehend. Really the plot is not that hard to understand and not that complex as its accredited. Much like the movie "" A beautiful mind "". This one does seem spooky at some places. That is the kind of idea I had before I watched this movie. That there's gonna be some ghosts involved and stuff. But at the end that was just a false wish. It's just a mind game. The director has committed unnecessarily hard on bringing out the crazy stuff. Maybe that's why some people feel like crazy watching this one. Clearly some parts just doesn't make sense at all. While watching you get the feeling all these things happening must have something to do with the story, But at the end only you realize how little the instances are actually correlated with the storyline, ergo feels a disappointment. Nevertheless, the plot is interesting, vivid and deserves some credit."

","Don't forget that a lot of things that seem like continuity glitches to the viewer (such as the position of the lighthouse) may be because the character is insane.... think about it... would Scorcese really make all those goofs? Nope.<br/><br/>I stopped caring ""what was really going on"" pretty early on in this movie. I didn't care who was insane, or what was real... I just wanted an interesting story... and didn't really get one.<br/><br/>I did enjoy the way Leonardo said ""excaped"" to plump up his attempt at sounding like a Bostonian cop, and the movie looked really good.

"fwomp","9","1","3","8 July 2010"," Scorsese Scores!
","If you don't like watching films twice, then I suggest you not view SHUTTER ISLAND even once. But if you do, you need to click over to the extra features on the DVD and watch ""The Making of Shutter Island."" It is here where you will begin to realize how important it is to restart the disc from the beginning.<br/><br/>Shutter Island is a film-within-a-film, about a character-within-a-character. The multiple layers and textures are unbelievably inviting in a very twisted sense. The entire film screams thriller, but after you view it a second time, it'll scream ...something entirely different.<br/><br/>Dividing audiences and critics, Shutter Island reveals itself to probably be too dense for many, but a revelatory success for others; I'm obviously in the latter category.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio (THE DEPARTED) has rapidly become director Martin Scorsese's muse (and rightfully so). The two have been nearly inseparable since GANGS OF NEW YORK. ""Marty"" saw something inside Leonardo and knew that he had the acting chops needed for some fairly tough roles. And here, on Shutter Island, Marty gives him his toughest role to date.<br/><br/>As soon as we see Federal Marshals Teddy Daniels (Leonardo) and his partner Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo, WHERE THE WILD THINGS ARE) arrive on Shutter Island to investigate the disappearance of a mentally deranged prisoner, we get the immediate sense that things are off-balance. The guards look at Teddy and Chuck with great apprehension; their weapons pointed in Teddy and Chuck's general direction.<br/><br/>And as Teddy's investigation winds up, so do clues that don't match up. The possibility of a 67th patient being on the island, even though the warden and his charges claim there are only 66, tips Teddy (and the viewer) off that something is amiss.<br/><br/>The dark edges surrounding the island also leads Teddy into flashbacks of his time in WW II, and into other muted corners of his past that he'd rather not see.<br/><br/>It is these dark corners that intrigue Dr. Cawley (Ben Kingsley, YOU KILL ME) and his partner Dr, Naehring (Max von Sydow, THE SEVENTH SEAL), themselves being psychiatrists. But we quickly garner that these two men are at opposite ends of the same field. And are they fighting each other over Teddy? If so, why? It is here that I'll stop any further possibility of spoilers for those who choose to read this review. And it is also here that I need to reaffirm the requirement that you watch this movie twice. If you do, you'll come away feeling as though you've seen two movies instead of just one."
"perry-theodore","7","1","3","21 June 2010"," Pretty Predictable
","I'm a huge Leonardo DiCaprio fan. That being said, I don't feel like this was one of his better films. The entire movie was one crazy, shocking turn of events followed by the next, however none of it seemed all that shocking. At no point during the course of the movie did I have that 'OMG' moment. When the end finally came around and we got our big twist, I was a bit annoyed to find out that the guess I had whispered to my fellow movie goer forty minutes into the film turned out to be 100% correct. In my opinion, if you think you know what the twist in this movie is going to be, the odds are that you're probably right.<br/><br/>Overall it wasn't a bad movie. It may even fall into the ""good"" category. However, it is far from DiCaprio's best. It lacks the true drama of a Titanic or the fun of a Catch Me if You Can. Gritty and intense ala Departed? It tries hard but comes up short. I'm hoping that inception brings one of the last truly great actors back to form."

","I never watch previews. There was one film long ago where I'd seen the preview a couple of times and then in the cinema watching the film I came to realize that I'd already seen the best bits and there's not more coming...plus, a film has to tell a story as it goes along, without introduction.<br/><br/>So, I came to Shutter Island ""virginal"", you could say. (Believe me, only in a cinematic way...;-)). And didn't it start promising? A retro thriller, I thought, let's see what the hero uncovers/goes through, suspense expected, interesting story please.<br/><br/>Turns out - he isn't a hero at all - duh!!! Huuuuuuuge let-down. Remember, I didn't know anything about this movie, so I came in believing. So they fooled me (until the storm and that chapel scene - was it a chapel? At the cemetery) - was that their intention??? Hmmm, not nice, then....and then I completely lost all interest in the movie, I was really a bit angry, thinking: What a disappointment, how lame!!! What a letdown for the hero, too (I think I felt more for him than for me...lol)<br/><br/>I think this could have worked told in a straightforward way (starting with their marriage etc...), but then of course all the mystery with the experiments and crazy scientists would have to have been cut.<- I guess I wanted to see THAT story (personally believing doctors capable of hideous crimes - even today everyday in our hospitals...). Glad I did not waste money on this. <br/><br/>6 stars because there was good acting and atmospheric cinematography, but in the end, as it was such a disappointment, I can understand the people who gave it just one or two...<br/><br/>At least the ending was fun, because it's a nice finish whichever way you read it..."

","These days it's unusual to leave a movie feeling perfectly satisfied and glad you came. Thank you, 'Shutter Island'. I won't relate story here; no need. Nor will I say much about Scorcese except that, thank God, he had a fine story to work with, and that's all he needs to be masterful. The performances are uniformly excellent, too. What I want to address are the critics - some respected and erudite - who seem to feel that any shifting of a necessarily complex tale at the end is a 'cheat'. Trust me - SI brings it all home and almost exactly right. So too do these same critics love to have fun with Ben Kingsley and Max Von Sydow playing, it seems, any roles at all. Reviews have had much fun with Kingsley's mysterious persona, and Von Sydow's austere presence. This is garbage. Both men never overplay, certainly not here, and deliver top work. I suppose they're guilty of looking and sounding like...well, who they are. Never mind, though. This is a marvelous, enjoyable, at times gripping movie. Bravo."

","this was scary as all hell. this has got to be the first Scorsese film that can be labeled a horror film. it was definitely one of the scariest things i've seen since Kubrick's 'The Shining'. i scare pretty easily but i still love horror flicks, but most horror flicks are based a lot on menaces that are not plausible. like Kubrick's 'Shining' the scares here feel very real and...well let's hope not, somewhat plausible<br/><br/>Scorsese is one of those rare Hollywood directors who can always justify a large budget and big film making. when a film is this good it's hard to quibble about how it came into being. the obviously large budget provides this film with a glossy, slick look to it and near perfect professionalism in all categories. the script is excellent and the acting, from everyone in the cast down to the bit players as nurses and guards, are outstanding.<br/><br/>this film actually gave me a nightmare the night i watched it. the ending of the film will probably give us all nightmares for the rest of our lives. i've never seen so many horrifying images of cadavers and torment and death since Ken Russell's shock fest ""The Devils"". one shock moment in particular had me reeling. but i won't spoil it and tell.<br/><br/>this is first class Hollywood story telling. even though it incorporates all the latest technology of cinema, and is excessively gory, it looks and feels like a Hollywood classic from the 30's or 40's. it was even better than Hitchcock's film classic 'Spellbound'(one of Hitch's more overrated classics)<br/><br/>at the end the story might feel somewhat obvious and predictable to some, but getting there is most of the fun. and it still leaves it up to the audience to solve it for themselves. what happened? why is the 67th patient there? you decide. pure story telling genius. and i hate to over trumpet things."

As it turns out, this is the ONLY simple thing about the film.<br/><br/>This is an intriguing, thought-provoking, visually captivating tapestry that explores the recesses of the mind in an intensely driven psychological torture chamber the likes I haven't seen since ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"".<br/><br/>Looking at this also brings to mind the awesome acting chops of Leonardi DiCaprio. Here he is off the chain as the federal investigator whose life is crumbling all around him and his performance here evokes memories of the positively flawless performance he gave in ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape?."" I simply forgot how good an actor DiCaprio is! Top-notch film exquisitely directed and containing beautiful dream sequences that reveal the source of DiCaprio's angst.

"jazza923","6","1","3","9 June 2010"," Good, but not Scorsese at his best.
","The cinematography is very impressive and the supporting cast is exceptionally good. Patricia Clarkson and Mark Ruffalo stand out. Ben Kingsley's role is very stereotypically him, perhaps a little offbeat casting would have made the role more interesting. Very well produced in all areas, and the attention to period detail is exceptionally well done. But I have to agree with the critics on this one, although it is good, it is not up with most Scorsese films, it is distant emotionally and has one too many dream fantasy sequences for it's own good. The two hour and eighteen minute length is a bit excessive and unnecessary. Still, along the way there is much to entertain."
"DKosty123","7","1","3","9 June 2010"," Comes Close But Perhaps the Wrong Comparisons Being Made
","This film is set in 1954. During that year, Hitchcock was making Rear Window. Supposedly the crew for this film was shown Vertigo (1958) when getting ready to make this film. Perhaps this film is closer to Topaz. The critique of Topaz in that it would be considered a good film in the 1950's, but not such a great film in 2010.<br/><br/>Still it is a good film, one of Leonardo DiCaprio's better performances since Titanic. 81 year old Max Von Snydow is along in support. It does follow a logical if not original plot line & carefully leads the viewer along through a story. Actually, when compared with other works from Martin Scorsese it is better than Gangs of New York which kind of went over board in my opinion. <br/><br/>The story is of 2 US Marshalls going to an Insane Asslyum known as Shutter Island in 1954 to investigate the escape of a female inmate. The island setting is well done. The cliff sequence & the dark settings in the film do give it a murky environment. The story is really quite logical & it becomes quite easy to realize your being tricked at the beginning of the movie.<br/><br/>The question is do you mind the trick? Some folks will like it, & some folks (like myself) will realize early on what the trick is. One thing definitely like Hitchcock in this is 2 of the main actors riding in a jeep that is traveling in obvious moving background rather than on a road. That is a method of travel Hitchcock used often. Scorsese must have studied Hitchcock films & employed it here on purpose.<br/><br/>To me, even if Martin Scorsese was trying to mimic Hitchcock here, when you compare it with Martin Scorsese, it is better than most of Martins latest efforts.<br/><br/>If you really want that type of suspense though, I suggest sticking with Hitchcock. This film does not get to the master of suspense standard, but is a good movie."

Disappointment is not a word that I ever thought I'd use to describe a Scorsese and DiCaprio collaboration.<br/><br/>The actual movie never delivered on the thrilling trailer. It wasn't what I was expecting, which isn't the problem. It was a much more psychological and cerebral movie than I thought it would be, but once again, that's not the problem. The problem was that I didn't find it to be particularly compelling. The story is relatively well told...it's just not a story that I could muster much interest in as I was watching.<br/><br/>As for the cast, we have a absurdly talented group of actors and actresses, who all give serviceable efforts. Nothing really to complain about, but nothing particularly noteworthy, either (though I thought Emily Mortimer was great in her short amount of screen time).<br/><br/>Shutter Island is a case of my expectations being much too high for the movie to live up to. It's not bad by any means, but I'm accustomed to excellence from those involved...not mere competence.

This movie binds you till the end and keeps you thinking with moments mysterious and thoughtful... Basically the plot based on a book is well executed.NO IT IS NOT a horror flick its a psychological thriller ,there ve been recently many baseless , too much exaggerated psycho movies but this one packs a solid punch, i am still waiting for a blu ray of this movie to come as some scenes are really worth it..<br/><br/>Watch this movie nd believe me you would surely love it..."
"KineticSeoul","7","1","3","11 May 2010"," Not horrifying or psychologically thrilling, it's alright though to some degree
","When I found out about Martin Scorsese directing a psychological horror film, I was actually thrilled. But after actually seeing the film in some degree it was actually a bit disappointing. Now if you read the novel this film just isn't going to be as good, so I heavely recommend anyone to see this movie without reading the novel cause it really does rely on the twist and turns although it's fairly predictable. Although the plot wasn't amazing or anything it was a decent movie, the acting was top notch and the cinematography and CGI was very well done. To some it up it's a pretty good noir thriller but nothing very special or anything, especially since the movie relies heavily on the twists and mystery but it just wasn't that great. And it just wasn't that horrifying or psychologically thrilling either, but still despite it's flaws the other stuff it done well. <br/><br/>7.5/10"
"rocky_quick","9","1","3","10 May 2010"," Scorsese does it again!
","First of all, WOW! What a masterpiece by Martin Scorsese. The previews for this movie make it seem like it would be scary but it's not scary just suspenseful. We launch into the mind of someone who has been affected by a crime and develops an alter ego. The flashbacks keep you guessing until the end.<br/><br/>The ending was amazing too. I kept wanting to root for DiCaprio's character but in the end you find out you've been wrong the whole time.<br/><br/>I would recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in a movie that makes you think. This movie doesn't give away a whole lot. You have to keep piecing together the pieces throughout the movie. Go see it!"
"dorian-finkelstein","10","1","3","7 May 2010"," Puts Mr Scorsese firmly back in the driving seat
","Before we went to see this film I didn't look at which actors were in it, I only looked at the director and what the film was about. I am was not always a big fan of Leonardo DiCaprio but this film showed how well he has matured and found his footing, I think maybe Catch Me if You can was his last really good movie. I do not often write reviews about movies but in this instance I was glued to the screen as were the other people in the cinema, yes the film starts a little slow but with some exquisite camera angles and lighting it is hard not to become engrossed in just what is going on. I found myself in the film for most of the show only sometimes popping back to reality to have a drink Although in the film Teddy Daniels has flashbacks you are not sure what they are of or why he is having them and even at the end of the film it is still not crystal clear exactly who he is I must admit the whole film was brilliant but the ending was stunning definitely going to be a classic for generations to come and be in top 20 films of all time for several years, and we should not forget that this film is competing with ultra modern computer made films such as Avatar So in conclusion, if you have not been lucky enough to see this in the cinema it will be just as enjoyable on DVD please see it"
"Chris_BS1212","7","1","3","25 April 2010"," A genre film that doesn't work quite as well as Cape Fear
","Martin Scorsese obviously had a great time making this film an adaptation of the novel by Dennis Lehane. The film has a haunting and suspenseful tone throughout which fits perfectly with its psychological thriller/film noir tone. Set in the 1950s Leonardo DiCaprio and Mark Ruffalo are investigating the disappearance of a prisoner from Shutter Island. It is a classic mystery set up with the prisoner having escaped from a locked room within this institution for the criminally insane and disappeared. Of course not all is as it seems and there are many twists and turns throughout the film.<br/><br/>The two leads are on good form as new partners working together for the first time on what appears to be an unsolvable mystery. There is also good supporting work from Ben Kingsley, Max Von Sydow and many others in more minor roles. However despite universally good performances the film does not seem to be able to make the plot as exciting as it should be, having read Dennis Lehane's novel I was gripped from very early on and while Shutter Island is never boring sometimes it does not hold your attention as you feel it should, indeed some of the revelations and climatic scenes are a little underwhelming, I presume they would have been more effective had I not known what was going to happen and I am looking forward to revisiting this film as I think it warrants a reevaluation on my part.<br/><br/>Despite these issues there are some extremely powerful scenes where DiCaprio remembers his time in world war II and when he dreams of his late wife. These dream sequences in particular are shot fantastically by Scorsese and are so vivid that they are some of the best in the film. There is one scene near the end that is particularly powerful even for me knowing what I knew going in, the actors did a fantastic job. Perhaps I would have appreciated Shutter Island more had it come from another director but from Scorsese, even in a genre film, I expect a little more."
"ben-1815","6","1","3","21 April 2010"," The good, the bad and the ugly
","The Good, excellent cast, extremely atmospheric locations and at times the tension is managed to be racked up to high levels. The last 2 minutes of the film leave an interesting question that can be debated.<br/><br/>The Bad - Slow, slow, slow - the movie is over 2 hours long and boy did it feel it and just when it feels like it's about to explode in a superb final ending it goes on some more.<br/><br/>The Ugly - The twist, after hearing about this clever twist that takes you unaware I was anticipating something un-obvious. So on knowing that the film is set in a mental asylum my first thought, before Teddy had even left the boat was that he was actually the mental patient, I however dismissed this as being too blatantly obvious to be the twist and assumed that it must be a play on this theme. It isn't, the ending is so obvious, so stereotypical I defy anyone not to get it. As a note I preferred this style of twist in 'Identity'. At least that film didn't take itself too seriously."
"minhal92","10","1","3","9 April 2010"," Amazing!
","I have to say, this movie was excelling, it was mind blowing to say the least, amongst the top 20 movies I've ever watched and I've watched quite a few. Brilliant movie making small hints about the plot were dropped through out like subliminal messages, making the movie just the more brilliant. The actors acted really well, another hit movie by Leonardo DiCaprio who's movies always seem to be brilliant. One thing that must be said is that this movie must be watched with concentration and in one go, its not worth it watching it in parts cause if you miss any of the plot and fail to get it the whole movie won't make any sense.. Try not to get spoilers about the plot of the movie, it'll ruin it."
"ruston","6","1","3","3 April 2010"," Scorsese's Rubik's Cube
","To me, psychological thrillers are endlessly fascinating for the multiple-layered ways they engage with the viewer's mind. They work best when they succeed in accessing the viewer's curiosity and emotional involvement. Think of Hitchcock's Marnie, Christopher Nolan's Memento, Dominik Moll's With a Friend Like Harry, David Lynch's Mulholland Drive, and François Ozon's Swimming Pool. Shutter Island ably managed to pique my curiosity, but it did not recruit my empathy for Teddy. The film is a compendium of cold images, albeit beautifully composed and photographed, which at very few instances secured my engrossment by Teddy's predicament.<br/><br/>Watching Shutter Island was similar to attempting to realign Rubik's Cube: a challenging distraction, but ultimately of little lasting value. I believe the viewer's detachment is largely due to casting: although DiCaprio has overcome the boyish charms he emitted in the 1990s, he does not exude sufficient distress for the viewer to care for him. Another actor (Mark Ruffalo or John Turturro, for example), might have met the challenges of the role more skillfully than does DiCaprio."
"paudie","7","1","3","30 March 2010"," Go with the flow and enjoy it!
","I don't think I'm giving much away by saying that it shouldn't take you long to come to the conclusion that everything isn't quite as it seems.<br/><br/>Based on the novel by Dennis Lehane, who has had a few of his novels filmed in the last few years (Gone Baby Gone and Mystic River) the film opens as US Marshalls Leonardo DiCaprio and Mark Ruffalo travel to the institution for the criminally insane on Shutter Island. A female inmate who murdered her children but refuses to accept it has disappeared from a locked cell. They meet the doctors and some of the prisoners. Soon however DiCaprio's character starts having strange dreams and flashbacks to his time as a soldier when he was present at the liberation of Dachau.<br/><br/>To tell any more might spoil the ending. It's obvious that renowned film buff Scorsese had fun making this film. There are nods to a few genres – supernatural thrillers, whodunits, prison/asylum stories.<br/><br/>The film has an old fashioned feel to it. From the 1950's costumes to the institution with it's dungeon-like cells for the most disturbed inmates Scorsese nicely brings the story to the boil leading up to the climax.<br/><br/>The performances are good, although DiCaprio's constant intense frown does tend to get on my nerves. Ben Kingsley and Max Von Sydow (great to see him) are excellent as the head doctors. Mark Ruffalo is good as DiCaprio's sidekick.<br/><br/>I liked the film a lot. My advice would be not to think about the plot too much but go with the flow and enjoy one of the all time great filmmakers showing off his talents in a new genre."
"Attila_the_gorilla","5","1","3","24 March 2010"," It's a conspiracy!
","It was good for passing time, much more entertaining than watching paint dry or something similar. So can't complain.<br/><br/>The so-called twist was telegraphed at the very beginning of the movie, which is OK, cos at least it made some sense. Much rather have a little predictability than some totally outlandish ending that is not supported by anything you have been shown.<br/><br/>The general premise of this film is not too interesting unfortunately. Mental illness, illusions, effects of past trauma. Not very engaging. You do keep watching though cos you wanna pat your own back that your hunch in the beginning was correct, even though you hope it wasn't.<br/><br/>The ending is not satisfying at all. Overall not an uplifting experience."
"gary-444","8","1","3","23 March 2010"," A Satisfying Beautifully Crafted Psychological Thriller
","A fine psychological thriller which sees both Director Martin Scorsese and lead actors Ben Kingsley and Leo Di Caprio on fine form. The fact that this film was released almost a year after it was finished gave rise to rumours that something was amiss with the artistic merits of this project. Those rumours were misplaced.<br/><br/>The plot is somewhat formulaic. Although the screenplay and direction hint broadly at what is coming next, the delivery and impact of the twists and turns is always compelling. Federal Marshall Daniels, Di Caprio,and sidekick Chuch Aule, played by Mark Ruffalo, arrive on Shutter Island , a secure psychiatric facility, to investigate the escape of a patient as storm clouds gather in the sky. Yet as his investigations advance, so questions about why he is there, what is happening at the facility and what his role is mount. Scorsese reprises his use of the weather, nature and scenery, which he skilfully exploited in his remake of Cape Fear to great effect.<br/><br/>Kingsley is superb as Psychiatrist Dr Cawley. His measured and assured tones perfect for the role. Even when Daniels blows up his car he simply remarks that he was ""quite fond of that car"", one of the few moments of humour in what is quite a dark film. Set in 1954, and with flashbacks to both wartime, and personal , trauma, there is an air of ""other worldliness"" about proceedings ,which has an insidious cumulative effect of all pervading paranoia. Robbie Robertson's foreboding score excels in supporting that discordant atmosphere.<br/><br/>The two hour and twenty minute running time never, drags and climaxes with a convincing and powerful final act with directing and acting talent at full throttle. All is revealed, contributing to a satisfying finale whilst still leaving a few elements of doubt. Recommended."
"FlashCallahan","9","1","3","20 March 2010"," 'Run........'
","It's 1954, and up-and-coming U.S. marshal Teddy Daniels is assigned to investigate the disappearance of a patient from Boston's Shutter Island Ashecliffe Hospital.<br/><br/>He's been pushing for an assignment on the island for personal reasons, but before long he wonders whether he hasn't been brought there as part of a twisted plot by hospital doctors whose radical treatments range from unethical to illegal to downright sinister.<br/><br/>Teddy's shrewd investigating skills soon provide a promising lead, but the hospital refuses him access to records he suspects would break the case wide open.<br/><br/>This has to be the most non-Scorcese Scorcese movie ever made, and it shows that he can master any genre he tackles. From the upstart, the film is startlingly grim and has a cold, dirty feel to it, and you immediately know from the mood the film exudes, something isn't right.<br/><br/>Dicaprio proves again he is a magnificent actor, moving further away from his teen heart-throb status he once had, to becoming a convincing leading man. Gone is the boyish charm he had in recent movies.<br/><br/>The sets of the movie are fantastical and do sometimes hint to the shining in places, and the subliminal hallucinations Teddy has, are as unnerving as any conventional horror. The trailer did look like this was going to be some sort of psychological horror, but this could not be further from the truth.<br/><br/>This is a film about wanting to forget past traumas, and putting on a facade when you cannot face reality, and this is intricate to the films plot.<br/><br/>As the film progresses, you get a claustrophobic feel, and begin to empathise with Teddys helplessness, as he and his world begin to spiral out of control.<br/><br/>By the end, you realise that Teddy takes the ultimate sacrifice by wanting to forget something that affected his life so much.<br/><br/>All of the cast are splendid, and although some of the editing is dire, this is still a must see."
"Ratsonrop","8","1","3","21 March 2010"," Thrilling, but predictable
","I came into this movie expecting a horror type movie based on some of the commercials on television and the previews, but I was very mistaken. This movie was very much a psychological thriller. Leonardo DeCaprio fans will absolutely love this movie, as he is excellent in it. Mark Ruffolo is also very good in the movie, but by far, Ben Kingsley steals the show, I believe with his portrayal of a doctor for the insane. While I was at the edge of my seat for most of the movie, I did find that the end of the movie was very predictable. Many reviewers have stated that it was shocking, but for some reason I found it almost to easy to predict. Perhaps, it is due to viewing so many Martin Scorcese films in the past and preparing myself ahead of time for the unpredictable. I highly recommend the movie, I would have probably given it a perfect score if I was not so disappointed with the ending."

","SHUTTER ISLAND could have been one of my greatest movie experiences ever..<br/><br/>Could have! The ending was very expected..

"Jules45","8","1","3","19 March 2010"," DiCaprio and Scorsese prove a incredulous duo yet again.
","Having only seen one of the double acts now a total of four collaborations (The Aviator) the pressure was certainly on for DiCaprio and Scorsese to produce another masterpiece that exceeded their previous work in any and every way possible to prove they were still as capable as ever since their first outing in 'Gangs of New York'.<br/><br/>Shutter Island which is arguable Scorsese's most chilling film to date despite being labelled as a psychological mystery-thriller is a clear monument to one of the greatest directors around that he is as close to his celebrated status as he is in his synchronized partnership with DiCaprio.<br/><br/>Teddy Daniels (DiCaprio) is a U.S. Marshal whom with his partner Chuck (Mark Ruffalo) investigates the disapearance of a mentally ill patient from the island, which unfortunately proves a giant emotional and physical effort for poor Ted. If he isn't being haunted by his dead wife in his dreams then he's pulling at strings about trying to work out how a patient escaped a locked cell with no shoes. Bummer eh? <br/><br/>But as expected one mystery leads to another then another giving this more twists than a Curly Whirly and plot that leaves you forever guessing the unguessable. So as you can imagine the ending is an indulgence that's both immensely satisfying and one in keeping with the surprise element of plot shocks and the shocks guaranteed to scare."
"juiceman10712","7","1","3","19 March 2010"," Aesthetically pleasing, Great performances. Shallow ending.
","A beautifully shot, visually stunning and very tense psychological thriller. The visuals combined with the daunting score create a very frightening and claustrophobic experience that keeps the film afloat for it's lengthy 2 and half hour run-time.<br/><br/>It's very talky with lots of down-time and while the writing is certainly competent, it can drag at parts. Even this, however, is saved by the excellent performance by Leonardo DiCaprio.<br/><br/>The film's failing is in its textbook cop-out ""all in his head"" ending. I thought it was so obvious that that was the case that when it did happen, I was shocked and for the remainder of the film I was waiting for the second twist. It may be clichéd and one of the sloppiest twists in films but it's used with more intelligence and depth than usual here. But still... it's hard to believe that such great talent couldn't produce something more original and intelligent."
"montera_iulian","8","1","3","17 March 2010"," The Law Of 4... Who is 67?
","Shutter Island is in my opinion another Memento in different circumstances. The plot is basically the same as Memento only difference that this is happening on an island which is like a prison or facility for mentally ill killers in which doctors and psychiatrists try to cure their mental instability.<br/><br/>Besides that the storyline is great. Not only interesting, but intriguing, scary on a psychological level, full of twists and very well built. Leo's character is played very very good because it really shows his inner conflicts, it shows his emotions, his multiple states of mind, he shows his confusion, his anger, his calm, his temper and his violent side and so on. It's a movie that is based on the entire development of this character, Andrew along with the story itself. The island is shown to us in a very dark way and you have the feeling that the island is bad, that the people who are working on this island are some crazy ass lunatics but at the end you realize it is that way because you only see it through Andrew's perspective.<br/><br/>The editing of the movie was done very well, especially the sound editing and the cinematography is very 70's mixed with some new ways of capturing an image or cutting a film. This movie is strongly recommended for people who are into puzzle-solving mysteries and into big twisty drama thrillers but not for a regular film fan. It's a little bit long and might seem dull for someone who enjoys for example ""The Tooth Fairy""... You get the point.<br/><br/>The point is the film is brilliant, by the way Ben Kingsley is a matador, he takes his role and just makes you believe this second a thing about it and the next second another thing. It's great to have movies like this again and great to see people really enjoying it. About the soundtrack of the movie, it's catchy and it sets a wonderful mood of ""what the hell is happening here... what am I watching?"" which is important for this kind of movie. What could I say Scorsese is a genius. Not one of his best film but a good example of how a good mind-puzzle film should be made."
"k-imdb-3","7","1","3","16 March 2010"," Not bad but expected more from the plot
","The plot was obvious but could be salvaged up till DiCaprio runs up the lighthouse finding empty rooms after empty rooms. Is he sane or not? That's about to be irreversibly unraveled. If instead this is kept to the very end where both answers were plausible, this would have been a great plot.<br/><br/>Maybe with DiCaprio staring out from a cell's window in the final scene, thinking out loud: How can I get out of here?<br/><br/>Now that might drive everyone insane. But they might come back again and again to seek sanity...<br/><br/>As I walked out commenting to my friend, Scorsese did 90% of the job, I was impressed by the directing and acting. Now I give it an 7 because ultimately, I much prefer keeping the conspiracy proposition alive. Maybe Scorsese was bound by the rights to the novel. But what a pity, the plot could be as good as ""The Departed""."
"ecstatic-tickle","8","1","3","14 March 2010"," You won't forget your stay at this particular island resort
","Not gonna lie, this movie scared the sh*t out of me. As once he did back in the 80s with the lesser known After Hours, Scorsese has ramped up the tension in a warped cinematic world of high tension, albeit in a very different location. From the ultra psychedelic dream visions to the blustery heart of the island itself, he uses eerier device possible to enrapture the audience in this camp Gothic hell. DiCaprio is on very good form, more vulnerable than in Revolutionary Road, more blistering than in The Departed - and he is ably supported by a stellar ensemble - featuring some great names...Kinglsey. Ruffalo. Clarkson. Williams...they all shine in their respective warped roles, not to mention Jackie Earle Haley and Emily Mortimor as two seemingly broken souls. For nothing is as it's seems on Shutter Island. This story, my god...the definition of a mindf!ck.<br/><br/>Scorsese doesn't let up for a minute throughout, there is no breathing space for the audience - you really spend the time there, from the beginning up until the bitter finale. I didn't know the secret, and was fully invested in finding the truth of it. If there are criticisms to made it surely would fall on the fact that some of the stylistic choice are a bit heavy handed, that Scorsese throws it at you gale force rather than mysterious draught...and to contextualise the story in post-war Communist paranoia, likening the practices of the institution to the death camps of the Holocaust - Scorsese is treading very dangerous water. But then there is nothing really safe Shutter Island - for the entire running time your at the mercy of a master filmmaker, and there are worse way to spend two hours or so. Go see it."

OK in a few places you can get a little lost but you slowly get put back on to track and everyone is happy.<br/><br/>The cast is really good most the time though Leo has a few odd points were i wasn't sure what he was try to portray, and all the support actors are A class, from the German brain surgeon to the gun hoe ex general.<br/><br/>Does seem like the director watched a few Hitchcock films before doing this film as there seemed a few similarities from the type of camera angles to some very dramatic orchestral music.......all making the island feel very sinister.<br/><br/>Now to explain my summary: this is a very good suspense film, easily the best i have seen in a while, but is nothing really new in the genre. I have never read the book, but for me the major plot twist was predictable - this is being done so often in Hollywood at the moment its actually getting a little boring. If this film had been around the time of sixth sense no problem but so long after and seeing so many films use the ""same formula"" its just good."
"harry_tk_yung","Null","1","3","11 March 2010"," Coming from Scorsese, respectable but not spectacular
","Fully recognizing that to some it is sacrilege to express any emotion less than total awe and elation to Martin Scorsese's pictures, I must express not so much disappointment as the lack of any particularly strong feelings after watching ""Shutter Island"". It's a solid piece of work and an entertaining movie but that's about all, coming from Scorsese.<br/><br/>While there are red herrings in abundance, a seasoned moviegoer should not find it difficult to recognize this movie to be what it is – a psychological thriller. The setting is a familiar one: the protagonists are trapped in a mini universe closed off to the outside world, and things start to happen. The classic case is Agatha Christie's ""And then there were none"" (a title evolving from a couple of politically unwise ones that were abandoned), the tale of ten ""guests"" invited to spend a night on an isolated island. While the venue can be anything that fits the bill (e.g. the space ship in ""Alien""), it is here also an island, the titular establishment that houses a hospital for the criminally insane. There is also the almost mandatory motif of a location signifying final horror (such as Mount Doom in Mordor), actually two successive ones here: first ""Ward 3"" and then the ominous lighthouse.<br/><br/>Federal agent Teddy (Leonardo DiCaorio) together with a new assistant Chuck (Mark Ruffalo) has the mission of investigating the mysterious escape of an inmate, a woman that has been put there for killing her own children. It goes without saying that there are more that meets the eyes. For a start, Teddy has his own haunted memories of a wife who died in a fire started by an insane criminal who is now purportedly on the loose. There are various other plot lines and the fun for the audience is of course in trying to pick out the true scent from the red herrings. The final revelation is neither brilliant nor dumb, but just serviceable. There are of course some who insist that there in one more layer of truth beneath. There will always be – after all, one is entitled to believe that one gets extra value for the money paid.<br/><br/>This movie provides a good platform for displaying some excellent acting, although not quite Oscar level (but who knows?) It's good to see DiCaprio maturing to a point where you almost forget completely the pretty boy image with which he was once associated. Ruffalo has proved to be solidly reliable in just about any role he takes. Ben Kingsley and Max von Sydow dominate the scenes, whenever they appear, with the enigmatic and intimidating the roles of authority they portray. The three women Michelle Williams, Emily Mortimer and Patricia Clarkson, all first-rate actors, demonstrate why they are with the three characters they play, imaginary or real, each with its own brand of neuroticism."

He couldn't accept that the woman he loved ended up murdering their children & so he ultimately died due to being in denial of it)<br/><br/>She said a good day ain't got no rain (Water was a huge theme in the film and at one point it was said that ""Rachel"" was worried about the storm)<br/><br/>And I know a father who had a son He longed to tell him all the reasons for the things he'd done He came a long way just to explain He kissed his boy as he lay sleeping Then he turned around and he headed home again (When there was a flashback while Andrew was remembering what actually had happened and why he was on Shutter Island, after he lay the deceased children out he kissed each of their heads after they had said that he came from Oklahoma City)<br/><br/>Whoah God only knows, God makes his plan The information's unavailable to the mortal man We're working' our jobs, collect our pay Believe we're gliding down the highway, when in fact we're slip sliding away (After Andrew had slipped into denial, the place he was comfortable at mentally was being a U.S. Marshall and so he stayed in that role, oblivious to reality)<br/><br/>I don't know... I had heard this song just before going into the theater and afterward made a connection - Curious to see if anyone else had connected the two..."

","If you liked Kafka, Identity or Slaughterhouse 5, you will probably dig this movie. This movie starts out with DiCaprio's character going to some nut house island jail to investigate some escaped criminal. People working in the criminally insane jail start to become uncooperative and suspicious. The story is mostly a ""what is going on here"" after that.<br/><br/>First I will tell you what I liked. I liked the set design, lighting and cinematography. The movie is shot on a island fortress/nut house. There is a wonderful mix of color and lighting for the scenes and the flash back scenes look great also. I liked the top notch actors doing a great job Ben Kinglsey, Max Von Sydow, Jackie Earle Haley, Ted Levine, John Lynch and others. DiCaprio and Ruffalo did OK. Most did a brilliant job of making you not trust them. Things I did not like. I did not like that the movie over stretched to 2 1/2 hours. There are some scenes that go on too long or some that do not fit at all. I did not like the storyline of the second half...it felt kind of thrown together and the ending was weak and inconclusive. I did not like twisting characters roles and not giving any back story.<br/><br/>I liked it...but will not watch it again. Worth Renting"

","This film did what few films have; it made me think.<br/><br/>I had higher expectations of this film for many reasons. One, Scorsese directed. Two, great cast. Three, the reviews on IMDb have been high.<br/><br/>About half way through this movie I was glad that Scorsese was at the helm and not M. Night Shyamalan. It has that kind of feeling that you get watching one of M. Night's movies, but since Scorsese was directing, I didn't know that there would be a great ""twist"" or just an ending. Scorsese usually holds onto something to reveal at the end, but you can't ever anticipate the outcome.<br/><br/>DiCaprio was outstanding, and Ruffalo did an incredible job portraying his character. And I think Scorsese outdid himself with this one. This wasn't a project that you would immediately point out that it was a strong point for him to direct. But he guided this dark tale to a great ending.<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to anyone who likes to be taken in by a movie and anyone who likes to be provoked into thought."

","From the writer of Terminator Genisys and Atila: Battle Angel and directed by Martin Scorsese, Shutter Island is one of IMDB's top rated movies and i was indeed puzzled. Whilst it is a good film, it's not a standout one at all, not even within the sub genre of psychological thriller.<br/><br/>Let's get the third act twist out of the way because that was the crucial lynch pin with snapped. I found it to be far fetched and though it was telegraphed well enough, the twist was near absurd. Dicaprio's character being a mental patient and the whole plot being part of an elaborate psychoanalytic experiment just simply was not sold to me. The amount of risky situations the patient went through and put others through were too many i found for Ben Kingsley's character to allow. He might be an eccentric psychiatrist, but he himself is not psychotic and anything short of would mean he would have called this whole thing off a while back.<br/><br/>So what though? Did I like the film up to that point? Well, the references to MK Ultra and Mccarthyism i thought were really cute and added some much needed spice to a story that i thought was tethering on becoming cliche at times. Decaprio is not on top form, but I still found his performance to be bold. Not intentionally phoned in, just unfocused. Performances are decent, but none are really that good either. The only emotionally affecting scenes I found were the concentration camp flashbacks which i found to be the most effective of the entire film, whether they were illusions or not. The bodies frozen in ice, that arresting tracking shot, the best of the entire picture, showing the camp guards lined up and gunned down by incensed GIs. However, this is probably due to the historical context. When Daniels' kids are drowned and he kills his wife. I don't know, it just didn't have the weight it should have.<br/><br/>Overall, Shutter Island is a good effort, but it's not one that matches up to the reputations that Scorsese and Dicaprio had previously set for themselves in their respective careers. This is one of the weakest of their collaborations I find. Stereotypes of the mentally ill, dated cinematic devices and a forced period setting makes for an experience that is underwhelming considering the talent involved."

"brianberta","5","1","4","2 December 2015"," This may not rank with Scorcese's best works but I still enjoyed it.
","While this is nowhere near the quality of Scorsese's best films, Shutter Island is still able to make good use of its source material to make a haunting mystery thriller.<br/><br/>2 detectives investigating a disappearance at a mental institution find that the island may be more than they imagined. They soon realize that there may not be a way off of the island and they might be killed if they continue to stay on it.<br/><br/>Firstly, this is nowhere near the quality of some of Scorsese's best films. However, it still manages to provide enough to keep the viewer interested. Although the pacing is slow for the most part, it never feels boring at all and the movie keeps you engaged throughout. This is an ultimately soul-crushing and thought provoking film which you will constantly maintain a certain amount of suspense which doesn't get lost anytime soon in it.<br/><br/>The acting is overall solid on all parts. Leonardo DiCaprio gives a great performance as always. It may not be one of his best performances but he is still able to play a convincing character. All the other actors give great performances as well but most of my attention was focused on DiCaprio as I felt that he was the only one I noticed and he was the only one who stood out to me.<br/><br/>Scorsese tries to make an unpredictable plot twist but after Teddy Daniels starts questioning things, it's clear what direction the movie is going in and I wasn't as blown away by the plot twist as I was with other movies with great plot twists. I felt that Scorsese gave too many hints to it and some of them were too obvious. This is why I feel that this is a weaker film compared to his other works.<br/><br/>I know that I've said this twice already but I'm going to say it one last time. This is a good movie but it is nothing compared to his other masterworks. The plot twist is hinted at too much and I wasn't completely blown away by it as I hoped I would be. However, this movie was able to keep my attention throughout and I would say that it's worth a watch. Just don't expect it to be anything special."

","Not a ""Horror Flick"" as far as I'm concerned,but a Hitchcockian exercise in delving beneath the surface of a routine Cop story. Much the same as ""Psycho"" in many respects then. Clearly Mr Scorsese has studied The Master's oeuvre and come up with a smart tribute hiding behind the schlock - horror label and the trappings of slasher - flickdom. It is 1954.Traumatised cop Mr L.de Caprio is called to what used to be known in less sensitive times as an Insane Asylum when a patient goes missing. He has his own agenda as he believes the arsonist who killed his family may be detained there. With his partner he starts making investigations that lead him to believe some kind of ""Reds under the beds"" conspiracy has taken place. The Superintendent,Mr.B.Kingsley,is less than helpful,adding credence to the cop's suspicions. A convoluted plot ensues whereby - aided by liberal use of flashback - Mr de Caprio is drawn more and more deeply into the mystery of the missing patient and its wider significance for him. Twist follows twist until the ultimate turn at the end which is open to various interpretations. After about 15 minutes a vague memory was nagging at me and eventually I recalled that I had read ""Shutter Island"" in novel form two or three years ago and it says much for Mr Scorcese's skill that I still found the ending brilliantly ambivalent. Mr de Caprio plays the deeply troubled detective quite brilliantly. He is a man who has seen things no person should have to see,both in wartime and peacetime.Just how much more can he take?"

","In 1954, two U.S. Marshals, Edward ""Teddy"" Daniels and his new partner, Chuck Aule, travel to the Ashecliffe Hospital for the criminally insane on Shutter Island located in Boston Harbor, as part of an investigation into the disappearance of patient Rachel Solando, incarcerated for drowning her three children. The sole clue is a note left by Solando, which reads: ""The law of 4; who is 67?"" Shortly after arrival, a storm prevents their return to the mainland for several days. Daniels finds the staff confrontational: the lead psychiatrist, Dr. John Cawley, refuses to hand over records of the hospital staff; Solando's doctor, Dr. Sheehan, had left on vacation after her disappearance, and they are barred from searching Ward C and told that the lighthouse on the island has already been searched, so there is no need to search it. When a patient is being interrogated by Daniels, with a subterfuge she sends Aule away for a few seconds and scribbles ""RUN"" in Daniels's notepad.<br/><br/>The unpleasant air of the Ashecliffe Hospital causes Daniels to start having migraine headaches, waking visions of his involvement in the Dachau liberation reprisals, and disturbing dreams of his wife, Dolores Chanal, who was killed in a fire set by a local arsonist named Andrew Laeddis. In one dream, Chanal tells Daniels that Solando is still on the island, as well as Laeddis, who also went missing months ago. Daniels later explains to Aule that locating Laeddis was an ulterior motive for taking the case.<br/><br/>As Daniels and Aule continue their investigation, they find that Solando has been found by the staff with no explanation. With neither the staff or patients helping, Daniels decides to break into Ward C, and eventually meets George Noyce, another patient, in a solitary confinement. Noyce warns Daniels that Ashecliffe is performing questionable experiments on its patients, and sends the incurable to the lighthouse to be lobotomized, which is why they were banned from searching the lighthouse. As Daniels leaves, Noyce asserts that everyone on the island, including Aule, is playing in a game designed for Daniels.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Daniels regroups with Aule and they make their way to the lighthouse, but as they attempt to traverse the cliffs, they become separated. Daniels has a glimpse of a body that has precipitated on the rocks, and climbs down the cliff but finds no sign of Aule. Instead climbing back he finds a woman hiding in a cave, who claims to be the real Rachel Solando. The woman asserts she was a former psychiatrist at Ashecliffe until she discovered the experiments with psychotropic medication in an attempt to develop mind control techniques. When she attempted to alert the authorities, she was committed as a patient to prevent her from escaping. Leaving the woman, Daniels returns to the hospital where Dr. Cawley claims that Daniels arrived to the island alone, with no evidence of Aule ever being there."

","Summary: A massacrer disappears from Shutter Island's hospital for the wickedly insane. Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) an appointed WWII veteran and his partner Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo) are called upon to solve the case. Unfortunately, as Teddy becomes deep in thought in a cyclone of mystery and clear privacy, he becomes bit by bit more haunted by his alone demons, from his disturbing encounters in the war to his own sorrowful personal life. <br/><br/>While being visited by nightmares both appearing in his sleep and throughout his daily schedule. Teddy battles to move onward from his dreary past. While the nightmares are alarming in nature and tramples on Teddy's strength to carry out business. Scorsese positively accomplishes peace between the thrilling and often times disturbing dream cycles and Teddy's ""reality"". In fact, the bizarre dreams are some of the capable moments in the film . <br/><br/>Acting: Once again, DiCaprio clearly proves himself to be one of the greatest actor of our time. DiCaprio plays a man who is loaded by close demons but struggles to stand by an eye-catching look of the man he once was. His skill portray a man overpowered by the circles of human emotions is what makes him a rock solid in some of the greatest films to appear in the last decade or so. DiCaprio's alignment of extremely acclaimed films includes Gangs of New York, Catch Me if You Can, The Departed, Blood Diamond, and Titanic. <br/><br/>Keeping in equal with the standard set by DiCaprio's credited performance are the many other actors/actresses that made the film both dependable and at the top of the chart. Michelle Williams cunningly plays the role of Teddy's deceased wife Dolores, a woman struggling with uncontrolled depression. The actors who play the psychologists at Shutter Island do a superb job of filling up the already troubling and frightening nature of the film, particularly Ben Kingsley and Max von Sydow, playing the roles of Dr. Crawley and Dr. Naehring. Even the quick scenes bringing interviews with the patients of Shutter Island are described by strongly hair raising performances. Mark Ruffalo as Chuck does a fine job as playing as an investigational partner for Teddy. <br/><br/>Overall: Shutter Island embodies the end-all of a true thriller, from its engaging mystery to its plot twists. The energy to discover the true good guy and bad guy will keep moviegoers involved from the very beginning to the final scene. The movie is not Martin Scorsese's best but I do consider it to be one of DiCaprio's best performance."
"thewillt08","8","1","4","30 July 2012"," Scorsese blows my mind
","Shutter Island was a mind blowing experience to say the least. Twists and turns in the story kept me guessing and this film had a lot of strengths like the story, directing, acting, character development, plot twists, and music. Yes, music. Music is the most underrated part of a movie. Music can make a movie and in Shutter Island the music was scary and it fit perfectly. It was suspenseful and appropriate. Leo DiCaprio did his usual fantastic job acting but his character was one a member of the audience could love and rout for. I felt sorry for his character and thought his experience was tragic. His acting was commendable starting as a skeptic marshal. His witty comments towards patients and psychology fit his character. Eventually he became obsessed and crazier as the film went on. Leo played a crazy man perfectly with the shaking and paranoia. Scorsese did an awesome job keeping the audience guessing and a little puzzled as to what was going on. That is a positive and a negative. Confused viewers are never good and could turn them away from the movie but it made me more curious to see what was going to happen. After seeing the movie twice you notice hints and clues to the ending result and that is brilliant. Little Easter eggs that make you feel foolish for not noticing the first time. The 1st dream is probably the most important scene in the film. It gives everything away but portrays it so you think what the director wants you to think and it works perfectly. That was the best part of the movie. You thought you knew what was going on and you thought you figured it out then it turned around and you are back at the beginning. The ending to the movie is very open-ended and I usually hate open ended movies but this worked very well. I like for a director to pick an ending and stick to it but this move allows the audience to kind of choose their own ending. Is Teddy Daniels real? Is Dr. Cowley right and he is really Andrew Laeddis and criminally insane? These are questions the viewer can answer themselves. Anyone can think of an ending and be happy. Me personally, I think he did kill his wife and she did drown her children. Andrew Laeddis is real and he was on Shutter Island for two years as a patient. Did Teddy Daniels believe he was Teddy Daniels at the end? I don't think so. I think he didn't want to live with the fact that he killed his wife and live as a ""monster"" so he decided to die as Teddy Daniels, or a ""good man."" Rachel Solando was not a patient but I do believe the lady in the cave did exist and she was a doctor and everything she said was true. That's my opinion and I love the fact that I can put my own spin on the movie. Shutter Island was also realistic. This movie didn't literally happen but the ideas are true. Your mind can really shut out negative thoughts and drive u mentally insane. It is possible to think you are not in prison and are at home with your children. That is what made the story believable. Lobotomies actually happened and ""ghosts"" actually existed. The idea of medicine for the time period, new methods, and the power of the mind, all made this movie even better. Scorsese clearly did his homework for this movie nailing every detail. To fully understand this movie I had to watch it two or three times and fully pay attention. This is not a movie you casually watch, you have to commit to it to enjoy it and that hurts the movie. Overall I lived it and could watch it again and again and still be surprised what I find. I give this movie 8 out of 10."

I thought this was going to be an ordinary US Marshal movie. Instead we get interminable flashback after flashback. And what's worse? They're not even flashbacks per se.<br/><br/>Di Caprio can't be said to struggle with his on screen emotions, he's only got one. And frankly he just needs a good pair of contact lenses. That puzzled ""I can't make this out"" look wears very thin after an hour or so.<br/><br/>Bumbling and stumbling to the inevitable and oh so predictable conclusion leaves the viewer with a remarkably intense feeling of loss. The loss of more than two hours of their precious life.<br/><br/>On more mundane matters. Why does a lighthouse on a rock in the sea need a fence?

","Whenever the topic of the best movies of 2010 is brought up, I nearly always forget to mention Martin Scorsese's powerful psychological from February. It's moody, it's atmospheric, and it's carried by a fantastic cast. The story is set in 1954, and U.S. Marshal Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) has been assigned to investigate an inmate's disappearance at the isolated criminal asylum on Shutter Island. No one saw her escape and her room remained locked...it was as if she'd ""evaporated straight through the walls"". Based on the novel by Dennis Lehane, screenwriter Laeta Kalogridis has done an awesome job weaving a suspenseful story that drops enough hints to keep you drawn in until the big reveal at the end of the film.<br/><br/>If you can, try to avoid spoilers before seeing this movie. I had the misfortune of having the end ruined for me before I had a chance to see it and it killed a lot of the suspense. I was still entertained but I didn't have as much to look forward to at the end. Despite my pre-existing knowledge of the climax, it was still fun to watch and see how the writer and director managed to weave hints into the story. It's a great twist on the ending but I admit that I still don't grasp how feasible such an ending actually was. Without going into spoiler details here, I'll merely say that I'm still questioning how some of certain aspects of the big ""reveal"" worked.<br/><br/>2010 was definitely the year of DiCaprio, with powerhouse roles here and in Christopher Nolan's INCEPTION. The man knows how to pick the right projects and continues to impress me with his work. He is supported with great work from Mark Ruffalo, Ben Kingsley, Jackie Earl Haley, and Max von Sydow. I really no few complaints with the film, with the exception of the ""what-ifs"" left behind with the twist ending and the music's occasional habit of swelling up a bit louder than necessary and drowning out dialogue (particularly in the opening arrival sequence)."
"davggsco","9","1","4","25 September 2010"," Shutter Island - A Wavy Davy Review
","When this film was announced, some movie-fans were baffled as to why Di Caprio and Scorsese would team up for seemed like a silly thriller that usually belonged to people like Dennis Quaid (sorry Dennis). The reason is that this is not an average thriller - it is an intelligent and dark piece made fantastic mainly due to the excellent direction and acting. <br/><br/>The film opens with US Marshalls Teddy Daniels (Di Caprio) and Chuck Aule (Mark Rufallo) travelling to the mysterious Shutter Island - the location for a seedy mental institute. The policemen are brought to investigate the disappearance of a patient, Rachel Solondo (Emily Mortimer). The US Marshalls soon meet the head of the institute, Dr John Cawley (played brilliantly by Sir Ben Kingsley), who comes across very suspiciously indeed. As the plot unfolds, Daniel's motives for being at the island become clearer, as does the peril both cops find themselves in. <br/><br/>The success of this film is the whole aura that Scorsese creates in his music and filming. The constant rain and grey skies gives the film a 'grey' feel that is translated in the themes throughout. Some of the scenes, particularly Daniels' nightmares, might have come across goofy from a poorer filmmaker, but Scorsese makes them chilling and horrifying, making for a very effective film. Di Caprio, too, must be given credit for this aspect, since his acting is thoroughly convincing - he looks, talks and acts like a man with a dark past, a man with a mission, and a man who is slowly losing his sanity. Mark Rufallo is convincing too, as a worried partner, while Kingsley as the sinister Cawley.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a perfect psychological thriller, with significant similarities to 'The Sixth Sense' and 'The Others'. <br/><br/>Scorsese has created another classic in a genre that was in need of fresh air."

","There are a number of films I've seen more than once, and if they're good (the only reason really, to watch them again), they become a richer experience and one gains a greater appreciation of them. ""Shutter Island"" might be the only picture that on subsequent viewings, becomes a DIFFERENT film from the one originally seen. I say this because the first time around, there's no way to take the character of Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) other than at face value. He's a detective investigating a missing person case on an island. Not your normal island, but one that's home to an institution for the criminally insane. Every interaction he has with a character in the picture is one between himself, Detective Daniels, and that character. As we come to learn, all that changes when Dr. Cawley (Ben Kingsley) reveals the twist near the end of the story, at which point, one is left either totally disillusioned or utterly blown away.<br/><br/>What's unique and brilliant about the writing here is evident upon a second viewing. What we now know to be true about Teddy Daniels becomes even more evident. We're able to understand that in Teddy's first meeting with Naehring (Max von Sydow), Naehring is actually speaking to Laeddis. Yet those references to Laeddis/Daniels' 'defense mechanisms' could have been offered and taken either way. George Noyce (Jackie Earle Haley) was speaking to Laeddis as he had no reason not to. The vision of Rachel Solando in the cave was warning Teddy that he had no friends, and that there was no way off the island. This was a way for the viewer to understand that in some small way, Teddy/Laeddis was conversing with himself, sometimes with clarity and other times delusionally. The Warden (Ted Levine) is clearly speaking directly to Laeddis when he picks up Teddy after his night in the cave. This is all so masterfully done that even watching the picture multiple times, it's amazing to pick up on the nuance that went into developing the story.<br/><br/>Now I have to admit, the first time I saw the picture and it became apparent that Teddy Daniels was Laeddis, I wanted to blow it off as one of those cheap constructs that film makers are prone to indulge in just to play with the viewer's head. But somehow, this was different. This was a study, a grand two day experiment if you will, designed to force Laeddis to come to terms with himself and what he had done to become confined to an institution. The way the whole story evolves is fascinating to watch, almost like watching the making of the movie instead of the movie itself. I've seen ""Shutter Island"" three times now in the space of about a month, and I know with certainty that I'll be watching it again. There's not many films I can say that about, but this one just begs it, almost like a patient requiring your uninterrupted attention."
"Reef-Shark","9","1","4","21 August 2010"," Get taken away with a two-step viewing
","'Shutter Island' is a suspenseful thriller that holds up to films such as 'The Sixth Sense'. Of course, that should be the very least you get when you put a legendary director like Martin Scorsese on the job. This is a film that will have you thinking and guessing even after you've left the theater. An amazing mind trip that takes the viewer into the surreal labyrinthine hell that is Shutter Island in the eyes of Edward ""Teddy"" Daniels, a U.S. Marshall investigating the strange disappearance of a patient at the Ashecliff Hospital for the criminally insane.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio is brilliant in the lead role of this film. It is easily his best performance since 'The Aviator' in 2004. His performance is one of the most down to earth, believable ones in recent memory. When he emotes he doesn't downplay or exaggerate for the sake of the film. He reacts in ways I could easily imagine a real person. DiCaprio may not have starred in a movie nearly as successful as 'Titanic', but as far as acting is concerned he is 10x the actor he was in 1997.<br/><br/>Scorsese is a genius. That goes without saying it. Martin Scorsese ranks up with the likes of Stanley Kubrick, Alfred Hitchcock, and Orson Welles as far as influence of cinematic techniques is concerned. Some were disappointed by Shutter Island, saying that it doesn't live up to Scorsese's reputation. I don't think there is anything wrong with the directing in this film.<br/><br/>The decision of composer and Scorsese-collaborator Robbie Robertson and Scorsese to use only classical music for the film is very Stanley Kubrick, but it also works very well in Shutter Island. Every piece of music manages to capture the scenes. It is a marvel how they make these pieces almost seem as if they were written for the film.<br/><br/>Make sure to give 'Shutter Island' two viewings, and don't let the first viewing define your view of the film. You will learn most from the film after two viewings spread out over a period of time. After seeing this movie for the second time, having thought over the first viewing for a period of six months, the film took on a new dimension of greatness. Somethings become more clear, while others remain a mystery.<br/><br/>Don't write this film off after one viewing. If you do, you're missing out on the power of Scorsese's fresh masterpiece."
"evilgus77","9","1","4","24 July 2010"," Hitchcock and Lovecraft fans rejoice!
","If you are looking for that classic Scorsese film in the vain of Goodfellows, Raging Bull, or Casino this is not it. Instead what you will find is a Hitchcockian/ Lovecraftesque superb psycho-horror drama that stands as a testament to the brilliance and flexibility of Martin Scorsese.<br/><br/>I will not go into the Hitchcock parallels, I believe they are fairly obvious, but let me just say that this movie is atmospheric. Let me say that again, Atmospheric! The location, sets, and everything about the island makes one feel as if they were transported directly into a Lovecraft story. No, Cthulu does not leap out of the misty waters surrounding the island, but that eerie atmosphere of Arkham is definitely felt throughout this movie. That fine line between sanity and insanity that is found in so many Lovecraft stories is also found in this film. I realize that Lovecraft did not write this story, but Scorsese portrays that unsettling Lovecraft vibe better than any other filmmaker, even those who have adapted Lovecraft stories to film.<br/><br/>This film does not try to outsmart you in a way similar to the Sixth Sense. Instead, it gives many clues as to what is actually going on. You may feel that you have it figured out, and you probably have, however, you continually do not want to believe what you think you know is true. That is where this movie shines. One becomes so immersed into Leo DiCaprio's character Teddy, that you refuse to see anything through anyone else's eyes except Teddy's, even though you are given opportunities to do so. Therefore, two or three viewings may be required to fully appreciate the genius of this film - and trust me, it's worth it. One might find Leo's portrayal of Teddy slightly awkward in the beginning, but trust me, the genius of this portrayal will be realized (and I'm normally not the biggest Leo fan, Titanic - Pooh!). <br/><br/>I also love the ending of this film. It does not end in a confusing hail of bullets or an excessive Hollywood bloodbath, but rather ends in an intense psychological showdown rarely present in modern major studio produced films. This film is a breath of fresh air in an era Hollywood excess CGI inspired blockbuster trash and, for the most part, equally bad independent films. I must admit that I am confused as to why this movie has received so many bad reviews; it would appear the you either love it or hate it. Either way, watch this film. If you love it, you're really going to love it. On the other hand, if you hate it... well, at least you rolled the dice."

","I've always believed that within piles and piles of crap, no matter how big the piles, gems can definitely be found. This movie has proved this in respect to modern Hollywood. Where most movies mostly turn out to be generic, rehashed, remakes or just plain stupid, movies like this show some hope for the future of Hollywood.<br/><br/>US Marshal Teddy Daniels is investigating a case of missing patient in an institute for dangerous mentally insane people. Along his investigation, he discovers that he is in a midst of a deep conspiracy. I won't go too much into the plot but I'll say this: The execution is nearly perfect. Shocking moments are delivered suddenly and swiftly. The twists and turns will keep anyone guessing throughout the movie. Intense, thrilling scenes which will keep a viewer's heart thumping are scattered throughout the film. Even after the final twist is revealed, the viewer can't help but suspect it due to the many deceptions before.<br/><br/>My only complaints would be the use of really loud music and pointless nudity which could've been easily avoided. If you're looking for a good thriller look no further. It's not 100% original but it will keep you intrigued and entertained, which is more than I can say for 99% of the movies Hollywood is blowing out of it's butt currently."

","""Shutter Island"" is the best film I've seen in a long while. While the subject of human insanity can hardly be described as fresh, never before had it been as well explored as it is in Scorcese and DiCaprio's shared effort. With a haunting beginning that brings Kubrick's ""The Shining"" to mind, ""Shutter Island"" is a roller-coaster of paranoia and claustrophobia, wonderfully directed from its first minute to the very last -- and let's not forget the amazing sound effects, which underline a feeling of suspense worthy of Hitchcock himself.<br/><br/>While you may be convinced that the ending is easy to foresee, you will find yourself proved wrong over and over again by the thousand plot twists thrown your way, all of them surprisingly believable and possible in essence. Also remarkable are the dream/hallucination sequences, which are visually mind-blowing and incredibly well thought-out. This is a psychological thriller like none I've seen before, one that will leave you feeling uncomfortable and linger in your mind for a very long time after viewing it: it will put you in the protagonist's place, and, as a human being, you will be terrified.

"wdashton43","10","1","4","24 April 2010"," Shutter Island - Live like a monster, or die a good man??
","Martin Scorsese's latest installment Shutter Island is a challenging yet fantastic Gothic thriller that not only entertains, but forces us to ask questions about the duality of humanity and the incredible power of the human brain.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio, Scorsese's favorite partner in crime, stars as U.S. Marshall Teddy Daniels, a widower, and a smart and rugged detective that smokes like a chimney and always gets his man. Set in 1954, DiCaprio plays to a T that confident, tough police detective of classic hard boiled, pulpy noir films. The opening scene of the film puts us into familiar territory with DiCaprio: on a boat. As it emerges steadily out of the mist toward an island, Daniels stands on the edge of the deck with his partner, U.S. Marshall Chuck Aule, played brilliantly by Virginia native Mark Ruffalo. With it's razor blade cliffs, monster waves and numerous straight lace, heavily armed guards, the looming Shutter Island makes Alcatraz look like a Hawaiian vacation spot.<br/><br/>The pair has been sent to the secluded location to investigate and potentially capture Rachel Solando, a patient at the island's Ashecliffe Hospital for the Criminally Insane who murdered her three children and who has apparently vanished from her cell out of thin air. Upon arrival at the hospital, the detectives meet Dr. Cawley, the head doctor and overseer of the institution played beautifully by Academy Award winner Ben Kingsley. Cawley first comes off as pleasant and eager to assist the investigation, but his unwillingness to release important information, and his general creepiness, lead us to believe there is something dark and sinister hiding behind closed doors that he does not want us to see.<br/><br/>Strange coincidences prevent them from getting specific background history on doctors and patients, and the arrival of a powerful hurricane only complicates things further. It doesn't help that one of the head doctors has ties to Nazi Germany and the head guard follows them all over the island like an overly-determined hawk.<br/><br/>As days pass and eerie events continue to unfold (a patient slips him a note that says ""run""), Daniels begins to voice to Aule that something isn't right on the island. Daniel's suspicions prove to be true after an informative, and equally strange, chance run in with a patient. It is then that he comes to the haunting realization that the hospital is in actuality a cover up for unethical human brain experimentation involving radical surgeries and drug treatments.<br/><br/>But as Daniel's sinks deeper into the hospital's dark pool of secrets, his own devastating personal issues begin to be revealed. We are informed about his past through a series of flash backs and dream sequences. Vivid hallucinations involving his dead wife, as well as some involving painful memories from his soldier days in WW2, begin to increase in frequency and lucid intensity as the investigation becomes increasingly frightening. Much in the vein of The Shining and Mulholland Drive, the line between fantasy and reality becomes blurred, and in a shattering yet stunning climax we see how Daniel's dark past is linked to the island more than we could have possibly imagined.<br/><br/>This film is unquestionably a must see. The cast is a smörgåsbord of some of the finest actors in the business that also includes Michelle Williams, Patricia Clarkson and Ted Levine in key supporting roles. And I mean, come on, it's Leo! Scorses's directing is not flawless in this film (I have an eye for continuity errors), but nonetheless the editing, lighting, special effects and structure of the story are all combined to create something that is very impressive both in visual style and narrative coherency. Most impressive though is the pacing of the film. Slow enough to develop characters and establish the plot, but with enough twists and turns to keep you from snoozing. So kudos there (I can't believe I just said ""kudos"", but whatever).<br/><br/>Towards the conclusion of the film, Daniels rhetorically asks Aule, ""Is it better to live like a monster, or die a good man?"" It is this existential question that challenges us to peel back the layers of the film and look at our own lives; to weigh the duality of our own existence.<br/><br/>This is not a film for everyone. Not every question is answered and it does in fact involve a slight bit of thinking. To a certain extent, you can draw your own conclusions and make your own interpretations. And in some regards, the film leaves it up to us to decide the fate of the main character. But fittingly, these aspects run parallel with the film's themes of fate, searching for truth and choosing the ""reality"" of our own life. Or, if you don't care about themes or deeper meanings, and enjoy playing with Legos, just go relish it for sheer entertainment purposes! Actually, I kind of like Legosso never mind.<br/><br/>Shutter Island is certainly the Oscar front runner for 2010, and one of the best psychological thrillers ever, so don't miss out!"

","When I went to see Shutter Island I didn't know what to expect, seeing as I knew very little about the plot and hadn't even heard of the book. But it's probably better to know nothing, because I could never have predicted the outcome, or, for that matter, the thrilling chain of events leading up to it. To begin with it seems you are watching an everyday, run of the mill detective movie - all be it an incredibly engrossing one. Then everything changes. The moment you think ""Oh, I know where this is going now"" the rug is pulled out from under your feet time and time again. DiCaprio is actually very good in this role that does require somebody who can act, and all the supporting actors are also on good form.It also looks fantastic, with some stunning visual effects and a delightfully gloomy setting.

","In modern days, it's hard to make a movie that can impress an audience. Themes are always the same, and the word ""innovation"" seems not to affect the movie industry. This movie is not any different. Mental hospital's a theme that's been approached many times, since ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" to ""House on Haunted Hill"", etc... <br/><br/>In these cases what counts is the way it is directed, the people acting in it, the argument and most important, the imagination that keeps us attached to the screen. And Scorcese hit the bull's eye once again, since ""The Departed"". DiCaprio seems to be one of Scorcese's favourites, and i don't blame him. For the last few years he's been in such movies as ""Catch Me If You Can"", ""The Aviator"", ""Blood Diamond"", ""The Departed"", and now, ""Shutter Island"", all of theme with a distinct participation in my opinion. <br/><br/>And now, about the movie itself. The only word that pops in to my mind is... brilliant! I believe Scorcese out did him on this one. The way he drives the audience in to believing everything's real, and in the end, the last taglines from DiCaprio leading me to assume that he was cured after all... It seems he was inspired by ""A Clockwork Orange"" since the ending type is almost the same!<br/><br/>Nice job Martin!!"

","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br/><br/>It's 1954, and Federal Agents Teddy Daniels (Leonardo Di Caprio) and Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo) have been sent to the titular island mental institution to investigate the mysterious disappearance of a female serial child killer. It's made very clear from the off set that they may do their job, but they are not in charge and must co-operate with the warden and the guards on the island. As slow progress is made, Daniels and Aule start to conjure up wild conspiracy theories to what is going on on the island and their real reason for being sent there. Things aren't helped when the chief doctors on the island Cawley (Ben Kingsley) and Naehring (Max von Sydow) aren't being very forthcoming, and the pair are left further to their own devices. But as Daniels suffers flashbacks to his time in the war liberating a Nazi concentration camp and his perception of reality becomes blurred, everything starts to become less clear and everything looks set to become not how it seems.<br/><br/>Martin Scorsese has returned with a film that is an unusual branch out from his usual gangster movie schtick, and is a fresh approach for him to experiment with. It's also another adaptation of a novel by Dennis Lahane, after the superb Gone Baby Gone and the very watchable Mystic River. But while Shutter Island is a very well made and tense film, somehow for me it just didn't match up to the quality of those last two films.<br/><br/>This plays as a very long and drawn out, what typically gets called nowadays a 'mind f*ck' film, showing a lead character becoming increasingly claustrophobic and isolated, and being pushed to question his own sanity in the light of increasing evidence everything is not how he sees it. It's not afraid to push boundaries, showing the blood splattered bodies of murdered children, for instance, even harder to fathom for a 15 certificate film. Typical of Lahane's work, it's unflinching and goes straight for the jugular, unafraid to delve into the darker side of human nature and playing for a more mature audience. And there is a complex and carefully structured mystery to fathom through out that you have to pay attention to. Yet somehow it just feels really hard to get in to, and all feels a little too much to take in at once. It feels like one of Lahane's more ambitious works and it works having an expert like Scorsese on hand to oversee things, but somehow their respective styles clash, the tone feeling less riveting and more plodding. There is a tense and decent score, which drives a lot of it and gives certain scenes a more dynamic edge, but it all just fails to come together as a whole.<br/><br/>Performances wise, Di Caprio is suitably intense and unrestrained in the lead role, as a man being pushed over the edge, with sturdy support from Ruffalo. Meanwhile, Kingsley and von Sydow are a well cast double act as the educated but dodgy main doctors, and there's a lively supporting cast in the shape of Jackie Earle Haley, Elias Koteas and Patricia Clarkson.<br/><br/>Shutter Island has worked with some and been a more average affair with others. Like a lot of films nowadays, it may be a 'need to see it twice' affair, but personally Scorsese's last film The Departed really showed his flair a lot more successfully to a 21st century audience. ***"

","I like, with some special affinity, scripts about decomposing minds, about disintegrating human beings, scripts like SHUTTER ISLAND has. And SHUTTER  is a good movie, less good than many do claim, but engrossing, suspenseful, strong as; the defects are obvious—the characters are abstractions, the directing has that Scorsese feel of slapdash. The emotions it elicits are obtained by quite rudimentary means. But then again, you could also maintain that, had this movie been discovered as an unknown diamond, its qualities would of appeared strongly.<br/><br/>The movie has assets:--Scorsese's effective though crassly unsubtle sense of the uncanny, of the strange, of the menacing, that almost strident artificialness, deliberate and grim;--the pacing;--the score;--some wrenching atmosphere;--a sense of the space. I liked the sense of the epoch as well, the '50s; Scorsese shows an able and light hand at creating the effects he wishes. SHUTTER  certainly shows a lot of directorial talent; it's an awesome comeback for Scorsese. Di Caprio doesn't surpass himself, how could he, how could in fact anyone; his partner looked better and was perhaps the better actor.<br/><br/>Sensations—wise, I liked SHUTTER  very much, and it has a lot of fun to offer; no arguing about that. The pace, as I said, is flawless and breathtaking. So, SHUTTER  is a likable, even delightful movie.<br/><br/>There are Scorsese movies I detest; there are others I rather enjoy, SHUTTER  belongs to this 2nd class.<br/><br/>There is, though, an aspect I feel like objecting to. To me, it felt like mimicking the making of a good thriller, and it also felt like the work of an incredibly rudimentary director; because everything aimed at creating some appearances. But I also confess having nothing but disrespect for Scorsese. I also mean nothing but disrespect to him. I acknowledge that his slapdash can be interesting; even exciting. In his long career, it rather seldom was. As a matter of fact, Scorsese isn't Bergman, I'm not Ebert, so I guess we might as well shake hands.<br/><br/>What stricken me, though, in SHUTTER , was the unbelievable lack of depth; like some glorified HALLMARK production, or like a blown video, the lengthy trailer, the consummate teaser for a flick HALLMARK didn't yet make—the pedantic and unsubtle HALLMARK slapdash as known, perhaps, to you. The consternating air of make—believe, of mimicry, of slapdash mimicking.<br/><br/>The dream sequences were especially unconvincing and cold.<br/><br/>Now if you consider Cruise a good actor, then you might as well claim that Di Caprio is another good actor; he didn't' look that tough to me, but still baby-faced."

Though the storyline was partly revealed in the trailer itself, I have to say, the twist and it's presentation was excellent. No one can expect how the story finally turns out to be. This was a completely different role for Di Caprio and he has performed in style. All artists, in the movie, have done their part very well, especially Ben Kingsley and Mark Ruffalo. The dialogue's simple and uncomplicated. The dialogue presentation and cinematography have been executed brilliantly. The background scores are great and it keeps you much involved in the story.<br/><br/>The film Shutter Island, is about a U.S Federal Marshall Teddy Daniels (Leonardo Di Caprio) who lands on the Shutter Island with his companion Marshall Chuck Aule(Mark Ruffalo) to investigate about a missing patient Rachel Solando(with the kind of patients kept there at the island, there’s not much difference in calling her,like Ted,the escaped ""prisoner"").But Teddy has more plans than just an investigation. Who else or what else is he after? After all, what is this island all about? I shouldn't be spoiling the thrill. Dr.Cawley (Ben Kingsley) is the chief psychiatrist at the Ashecliffe (in the island), who has his own ways of treatment with patients . He too has an important role till the end of the story. <br/><br/>You really get the whole excitement about this movie in the end, when all the characters turn to their true selves and when you link them to how they had played their part before, in the story. Shutter Island surely deserves a 9, out of 10. Hope Scorsese comes up with more good pictures like this in the coming years. I would say this is a ‘must watch’ movie."

Several elements emphasized too much, many things pointing in the same direction, few other -satisfactory- options left open ... I don't know, really, but I am so MAD for being stripped of the pleasure of THE GREAT TWIST IN THE END. I mean the big-shock was obviously a major goal of the movie and yet it was so OBVIOUS what was going to happen and more and more elements to support the theory kept piling up.<br/><br/>Otherwise everything was very cool, hence the 8 note.

This was the first time I ever did this in a movie theater. I woke up with 15 minutes left. Turned to my friends and asked, ""Did we find out it's all in his head yet or what?"" This movie is identical to other mind-jacked thrillers in so many ways, it just isn't fresh. I re-watched this movie in theaters to see if I missed some crucial detail in the about 2 hours I missed but was sadly disappointed. However my boredom of this story being retold once again in a slightly different way was quenched by the final line which was interesting. Overall: Movie was predictable, same old story told again, and has a mystery easy enough for a grade school child to follow."

","Shutter island is a very good movie. It is visually striking, it is well casted and the story is told in a fascinating way, taking care of the the dynamic of the development as well as the message. You can watch it as pure entertainment and yet take something home with you to think about. The visuals are striking and the colors are exceptionally beautiful. The visions/hallucinations are intentionally treated by adding more color so they are more lively and intense than reality itself what actually is one of the important issues in the movie. I felt that the movie was well paced and I didn't think that there were made any mistakes in editing. Scorsese did everything aware of its purpose and certainly not as a result of accidental errors or sloppy work. The whole movie is shown from the perspective of the main protagonist and his point of view (or state of mind) bearing in mind that it isn't necessarily the truth. There was also a controversial debate on the musical score which I find fascinating and also absolutely well applied. This movie shouldn't be reduced to its plot twists or to compete who'll guess it first because it's so much more than that. The quality of this movie is that it can be interpreted in a lot of ways and people shouldn't fight about who's right. That's what makes a good movie – a lot of talk, a lot of ways to look at it and a lot of genres it can be put in. I personally will watch it again."
"IheartCali5882","7","1","4","27 March 2010"," Scorsese is brilliant as usual, but the story is a bit overdone
","This is something a little different from Martin Scorsese. I'm not sure that his style of directing is a good match for this type of story but he still manages to make a competent film out of the overly complex material. The story deals basically with insanity, a lot of it. U.S. Marshal Teddy Daniels (DiCaprio) is assigned to a missing persons case on Shutter Island regarding a patient from Ashcliffe mental hospital who has gone missing. Along with his partner, Daniels arrives at the island, only to discover that there is much more to the patients disappearance than he could ever have expected.<br/><br/>Much of the film meanders this way and that, seeming pretty drawn out at times. The atmosphere mostly makes up for the dragging because even if nothing is happening, it feels like it can at any moment. There are lots sinister faces, dark corners, hidden meanings, ulterior motives, and so on. But after awhile you just want to get to the crux of the incident already. People are obviously not what they seem but who is right and who is wrong? Are they hiding something? Is the main character paranoid? To the writers and Scorsese's credit, the ending does in fact validate all of this meandering because what seemed aimless before now becomes very important in light of what is truly going on. They are like random puzzle pieces that are meaningless by themselves but, when joined together, create a whole picture. I'm thinking this is one of those films that becomes more interesting on second viewing because the viewer is able to appreciate all the occurrences that before just seemed haphazard and meaningless, but were actual pieces to the puzzle.<br/><br/>Scorsese handled the material quite well, but I wish he had chosen a different story to bring to the screen. This one didn't do it for me as much as I would have liked. Leonardo Dicaprio, Scorsese's new muse I see, is pitch perfect as always. As an actor, this guy is phenomenal. Can he do no wrong? His performance in the final act of the film is enough to make the whole thing worthwhile.<br/><br/>Overall: Really good film, just not really in keeping with my personal tastes. Top notch directing, camera-work, and acting. My rating: 7/10"
"jamist316","10","1","4","26 March 2010"," A Breathtaking Experience
","It's not always a movie can keep you involved after a hard day's work. The duration of this movie did make me feel I would not be able to keep awake for the 125 odd minutes. But the combined brilliance of Scorcese and DiCaprio made me overcome it. What a performance by DiCaprio ! An intense portrayal of the protagonist. However one cannot forget the abundance in acting talent the supporting cast of this movie houses namely, Sir Kingsley, Max von Sydow and Mark Ruffalo. Awesome supporting performances by them. A brilliant screenplay by Laeta Kalogridis. A great story by Dennis Lehane. Having seen the movies, 'Mystic River' and 'Gone, Baby, Gone', yet another adaptation of a Dennis Lehane novel, I knew this movie would be an intellectual treat. And it did not disappoint at all. To conclude, A Breathtaking Experience !!!"
"MarcusJ13","9","1","4","24 March 2010"," Very compelling
","Contains mild spoilers.<br/><br/>Going into this film I knew little about it merely the fact there's a mental institution and the Police are called in to investigate. However I was quite optimistic having heard some of the things that had been said about it already and went in with a great deal of optimism. I was delighted that my faith had paid off as it conjured up a hugely compelling and interesting physcological thriller that had me guessing and speculating at near enough every opportunity. With every scene brought about new questions some of them small some of them vital but every single one of them is nonetheless very interesting. The plot itself involves marshal Teddy Daniels and his partner Chuck called into investigate the disappearance of a patient and then we watch it all unfold. The negatives and there are some, the hallucination sequences got quite over the top after a while after being extremely gripping at first. As well as this the score was a little much with the music more or less trying to shout at us, 'ok we understand the place is fishy.' These being said they don't detract from the high amount of positives the film offers. I feel as though I can't go into any more detail as I don't want to give anymore away the film very much speaks for itself as I was gripped for whole thing. The 138 minute run time didn't feel too long and I thought it had the potential to do so. All in all this is a thriller well worth a watch for some very good compelling viewing."

"valueanalysis","9","1","4","20 March 2010"," This movie is not a thriller. It tells a very very very sad story.
","Teddy Daniels was a soldier and he witnessed the dead bodies of Jews in the death camp, and he also killed many German soldiers out of hared. He was deeply mentally traumatized by what he saw and what he did during the war and this was implied by the lines in the movie when Teddy first met Dr. Cawley and asked about Solando Rachel's husband(Teddy) and Dr. Cawley said ""He died. On the beach of Normandy. She is a poor widow."" After the war Teddy came back to Dolores Chanal but started drinking because of the war trauma. He also ignored Dolores' mental problem partially because that he loved her so much that he didn't want to put her in a mental institution and partially because of his drinking problem. His ignorance finally led to Dolores drowning their three kids and his killing of Dolores. He couldn't face the reality so he was sent to the Shutter Island where Dr. Cawley was working on a more humane project(role-playing) on curing mentally-challenged patients and Teddy was chosen as the subject. Because Teddy didn't accept the reality so he thought that he was somebody else. He hated himself so much that he imagined Laeddis,his wife's killer(himself), as a very ugly man. The movie also explained that why he didn't kill himself---he saw the German officer was in great pain after he didn't commit a successful suicide. And the other reason could be that he didn't believe his wife was dead and he couldn't let her go. Two scenes truly saddened me: one is in the apartment when Teddy holds his wife but she is burning away; the other one is when Teddy found out his wife drowned their kids and shot her.<br/><br/>At the end of the movie, I believe that Teddy was cured(he was cured before but regressed), however he still couldn't face the truth so he chose to go to the lighthouse. Dr.Cawley's method works but it just didn't work on Teddy. I think the movie presents us a question: can we save humanity?"
"jdkraus","9","1","4","19 March 2010"," Another great film by Scorsese and his team, but I wouldn't call it a masterpiece
","For starters, I'll say that ""Shutter Island"" is not a horror flick that the trailers have painted it as. Rather, it is a psychological thriller. I won't delve too deeply into the film's plot but I will say that it is unique, and from what I've heard, is pretty accurate to the novel by Dennis Lehane, (whom I was blown away by his novel ""Mystic River""). <br/><br/>What makes the movie so unique is that you don't know what's coming (unless you've read the novel), very much like ""The Usual Suspects"", but without Keiser Soze. Needless to say, it makes the movie interesting, but you know, I just have to get this off my chest, about half way into the film, I guessed the ending, and sure enough, I was correct. This isn't a bad thing, but when you have feeling on how the story is going to end, you want it to get from point A to point B without dragging it out. Other than this personal feeling, I enjoyed the movie.<br/><br/>Once again, Leo Dicaprio has proved himself a talented and awesome actor that illuminates the screen. It was also nice to see other, coming of age actors such as Max Von Sydow, Patricia Clarkson and Ben Kingsley dazzle on the screen. Even Mark Ruffalo, whom I'm not a huge fan of, did a great job. <br/><br/>And the technical aspects, such as the beautiful, low-key lighting, cinematography, haunting score, visual effects, and a dim set design adds more to the flavor of the dark, disturbing, and intense atmosphere of the film's plot. I could also tell that this was definitely a Scorsese film, even without his name plastered on all the television previews by the sharp quick pans and edit cuts, the attractive static shots of buildings, and the sudden low and high levels of sound effects and music pitches. That is Scorsese's style, and I love it, though the musical score could have been turned down a notchit does not need to be blaring. We know it's a suspenseful movie, don't remind us. <br/><br/>""Shutter Island"" is another great film by Scorsese and his team, but I wouldn't call it a masterpiece like ""Goodfellas"", ""Taxi Driver"" or even ""The Departed"". And be forewarned, this is not a movie for everyone. Though it's not a horror flick, there's a lot of disturbing content throughout the film that is not for the faint of heart. Then again, every other film by Scorsese isn't for the faint heart, but it's much more shocking to see in this movie, because it's not a typical mafia shoot em up bang em up that Scorsese is prone to making. <br/><br/>***1/2/****"
"moviesleuth2","9","1","4","19 March 2010"," A great thriller
","Martin Scorcese's movies have always placed character above plot. Lately, however, Scorcese has been leaning towards a reversal of this. That's not to say that his talent for film-making has diminished as a result, far from it in fact (in my opinion, it says more about the decreasing taste for subtlety and serious drama in American cinema and the surge of talentless tabloid gurus, but never mind...). Scorcese is still one of the greatest filmmakers around, even when he's not making a movie that's a part of his forte. And ""Shutter Island"" is about as far away from a ""typical Scorcese film"" as you can get.<br/><br/>Federal Marshall Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) has been called to investigate the disappearance of a prisoner at Ashecliffe, a mental institution for the country's most dangerous criminals. But once he arrives, he realizes that there might be more to the island than he initially realized...<br/><br/>This doesn't sound like the type of movie Martin Scorcese would make, and it isn't. ""Shutter Island"" is all story, and it's exceptionally well told. The atmosphere is thick and dark, and there are some scenes that are genuinely creepy. Both in style and content, calling ""Shutter Island"" a horror film wouldn't be too far off base.<br/><br/>""Shutter Island"" has something that no other Scorcese picture has: inventive visuals. I'm not talking about papers falling in a room like snow (although that scene is pretty cool). But just looking at the setting is visually arresting, recalling such films as ""Dark City"" or ""The Crow."" The film is top heavy with stars, and all of them are at the top of their game. DiCaprio, Scorcese's latest muse, doesn't have the most challenging part, but he makes it work. We feel for Teddy, and most importantly, we are with him every step of the way (mentally and emotionally). Mark Ruffalo is amiable as his new partner, Chuck Aule. Ben Kinglsey is deliciously creepy as the head of the facility, although not as creepy as Max von Sydow, the mysterious head doctor. Patricia Clarkson, Michelle Williams, Emily Mortimer, Elias Koteas and Jackie Earle Haley are in top form in brief, but very important performances.<br/><br/>Dennis Lehane's novels always have a morality question at the heart of their stories, and while the one in ""Shutter Island"" isn't groundbreaking, it's asked in a compelling way. The same thing applies to the ending; it's been done before, but Scorcese leaves the answer ambiguous (however there are some questions and continuity issues in the film that should be resolved but aren't), and all the while you're asking yourself if you're going to be right about the ending. That's just as good, isn't it?"
"rmrdenovic","9","1","4","18 March 2010"," Not an ordinary movie
","I don't normally comment on movies but this one got my attention. First person to give credit is Dennis Lehane because he wrote the book this movie is based on. Without him there would be no movie. So what is so special about it? It starts as a crime investigation story where two U.S. Marshalls investigate escape of one women out of institution for criminally insane on Shutter Island. The story mostly revolves around this investigation conducted by Teddy Daniels and his partner. To tell anything else I would have to give away parts of the plot. I can just say that this is not another crime story. This movies will mess with you and your expectations. I you firmly hold on to what you expect you might be disappointed. Good thing is that this film will ask for your engagement. It will drive you to think and ask many questions. Your intelligence will definitely not be insulted. It will get you out of your seat and remind you that there are still movies that are not predictable and require you to use your head. It will also move the ground beneath you. I am sorry I cannot discuss parts of the plot because it would ruin your experience of this movie. Main actors Leonardo DiCaprio, Mark Ruffalo and Ben Kingsly did a great job in playing their parts. Scoresese has done good in setting up the atmosphere in the movie a securely and boldly led the story to an end. But when the movie finishes it is not over, it still lives in you and you never forget it. I dare to say that it is pretty original. I have not seen some similar film. Maybe Hitchcock would make this kind of movie. Or some other great director from the past. If you are a great movies buff you cannot miss this one. I warn you, you could be disappointed with the way it unravels but this is the risk you have to take because you will probably love it. Go see it. In theater if you can."
"jpschapira","8","1","4","15 March 2010"," A freakin' nightmare
","For all the movies we've seen this last decade about men with mental problems, delusions and so on, Martin Scorsese's ""Shutter Island"" is the first one that doesn't try to be too cool and modern. In fact, it inhabits its time so well, that if it weren't for some of the main character's recurrent dreams, we could easily think it's happening in this time and age. But the year is 1954, and there's still this little contradiction. Scorsese, a wise and experienced director, doesn't intend to make a period piece in which we should feel 'as if we were in 1954'. No. Because this is the adaptation of a novel, and because he knows cinema and genres like few out there, he gives U.S Marshals Teddy (Leo DiCaprio) and Chuck (Mark Ruffalo) a couple of film-noir type classy hats when we first meet them and also charges the film with a musical feeling that, without being to invasive, takes us back to classic eras. However, the truth is that he is just plain interested in setting the premises for a freaking nightmare; and that's an idea that ultimately makes him and the movie more modern than anyone else.<br/><br/>No one is pretending in ""Shutter Island"". This is not a movie that has been improvised, shot with some kind of 'let's see how it goes'. It's not the director's usual territory, but that doesn't mean that he's going to step on new territory with trembling hands. No, the one who does that will be Teddy, in a ride that haunts and frightens the viewer, confusing him at the same time. Teddy and Chuck arrive to the Island to resolve the disappearance of a demented patient, but once Teddy finds out about a conspiracy, there's no way back. ""Shutter Island"" grabs you and never lets you go until the last minute. Scorsese's always been good at that.<br/><br/>Still the territory remains new and unexplored for the viewer: it's Scorsese's slowest (yes, it's the word) film in years; there are few specific sets and locations, there's few action and very few characters to meet. We realize when leaving the theatre that the camera doesn't leave Teddy for an instant and that the director's highest interest is to keep track of everything that goes on in his conflicted mind. It's almost claustrophobic, but in the end it works because the interest the film has for Teddy is genuine and there's never an intention of fooling the viewer. No mind blowing script trick to generate an unforgettable ending, no speeding things up to jump into easy conclusions; ""Shutter Island"" is the first movie of this kind that ends circularly and because of character. This means the film starts the end credits and we know it hasn't ended but we believe it, because of the things mentioned above. This is easier to understand if you've seen films like ""The I Inside"", ""The Butterfly Effect"" and ""Secret Window""; the last two not bad films, just movies that reached its conclusion in a convenient and abrupt way, not gradually. <br/><br/>Every aspect of the film is handled with the most of care so Teddy's journey really seems gradual. Even the recurrent dreams in all its different shapes, which are bound to upset and tire you, appear as completely necessary. There's no trick there; just great film-making by a fantastic crew. The cinematography of Robert Richardson, Thelma Schoonmaker in the editing room. And DiCaprio's performance (another giant work) helps a lot, considering that he continues to hold the title of ""Hollywood's most intense look"" and that he might be, right now, the only Hollywood star capable of delivering a tour-de-force with complete conscience of his range; of where it starts and where is the limit he shouldn't exceed. I go crazy with Clooney's abilities, but I know it's himself and it's effortless; I love Depp's eccentricity but I admit that this decade in movies he's been long gone from the real world as we know it; I admire Day Lewis' excesses, but I still can't be touched by a performance that's so intentionally over the top (I could go on with the names, believe me). <br/><br/>But DiCaprio...He always seems to be trying really hard and his face a lot of times looks like suffering itself. And that's what makes him real. That's why we choose to believe the things he experiences here and in so many other movies could be happening to him. He's not so out of reach; he doesn't even start to buy what's going on himself. Someone like Jack Dawson with the chance of boarding the Titanic? Really?"
"vailsy","9","1","4","14 March 2010"," Very weird but ultimately fantastic
","While I haven't been so impressed with some of Scorsese's other recent works, this one is a real creative triumph <br/><br/>I won't mention much about the story as it would be easy to spoil it. I also urge you to refrain from reading about it, but they capture the time period incredibly well and the genre is detective/horror/psycho-thriller <br/><br/>Lots of very artistic camera work and scenes here to enjoy - really liked the quick pan outs when they are getting oriented with the prison layout A/B/C sections. Also the dream sequences are brilliant, each one like a separate piece of art<br/><br/>Initially I was quite confused about where they were going with it, but then I was completely reeled in by the story. The film works like that, gradually pulling you further in <br/><br/>The score for the movie is amazing and I doubt the film would be nearly as good without it. Quiet percussive, almost ambient based and subtle at times, while at others very loud and dramatic like an old b/w movie. Loved it. For those interested - the sound in the movie was also very cool. Weather is a really important feature in the movie, and I loved the rain especially the indoor sound that they achieved for some of the scenes - a really minimal but very effective tapping sound. Not many people will notice it but it's hard to do, and very nice <br/><br/>To top it off a highly emotionally charged performance from Dicaprio, which is definitely where his strength lies - reminded me of his early work on Gilbert Grape for intensity. Ben Kingsley is amazing as usual, he achieves a character somewhat like a posh Don Logan! Sometimes darkly humorous, which is a nice break from the movies otherwise dark tones. All other major performances in the movie are top class. I myself didn't realise going in but Michelle Williams (Heath Ledgers former partner) is in the movie and delivers an amazing performance <br/><br/>I found the whole movie Lovecraft-like, and would love to see Scorsese try his hand at something along those lines <br/><br/>Highly enjoyable"
"uncleben1","8","1","4","12 March 2010"," Fabulous storytelling... mediocre film making
","After having just seen Shutter Island i feel compelled to write this review... I'll keep it short. The storyline is extremely intricate, which most regular film goers may find both dreary and boring, however, this is imperative to the story telling. Leo is extremely convincing and appropriate within this role as are the rest of the cast, which enhances the psychosis of the film. The film itself, whilst beautifully shot, is nothing too special. It is the storytelling within the narrative that makes this film great. If you can bear with the story the climax is well worth the wait, however, if you expect an all action suspense thriller, this may not be for you. Patience is a virtue!"

","From this suspicious beginning of the film (Teddy & Chuck standing on a ferry on the way to the island) to the chilling end (""which would be worse, to live as a monster or to die as a good man?"") this film remains a totally stunning experience. A scary descent (similar with those in Kafka's stories) to the catacombs of memory, insanity and loneliness, a lot of haunting dream sequences, a complex story of pain & tenderness (for the main character) which reminds me Parker's Angel Heart. Most of all another great film from Marti (incredible open sequence, a very frightening ferry's approach to the island). Admire also the consequence of the performers to the characters (even though what is obvious about them collapse at the end), especially Ruffalo and Kingsley (a near safe-bet to the next Academy Awards). Marti still directed films for the audience (and not for the critics or film buffs) and deserves our applause"
"antoniotierno","7","1","4","9 March 2010"," not up to Scorsese's masterpieces but enjoyable
","Directed by Martin Scorsese, ""Shutter Island"" has a very convincing atmosphere as well as a deep emotional scar tissue, feeling like a straight up Gothic horror picture. It's similar to the last two Scorsese films (""The Aviator,"" and ""The Departed"") Leonardo DiCaprio starred in. Leo is very tense, actually a walking bundle of nerves, and gets to play convincingly his character, a really difficult task. A few absurd scenes are some of the movie's best, also due to Scorsese using subtle special effects to disorient the viewer. There's also a twist allowing to catch the breath breath and the overall story feels real, in addition to making sense. The ending plays like a tragedy and shows an emotional truth of the sordid affair. On the whole a good movie, well directed, though not a masterpiece."

"anthonyadamo","8","1","4","4 March 2010"," Scorsese's Insane Flick
","After about a year later from first seeing the trailer this movie finally released, and came out with a bang! Shutter Island may not seem as your typical Scorsese picture - aside from the fact that it starred Leonardo DiCaprio - but definitely delivered a creepy, suspenseful, thriller of a 1950s insane asylum. Every single performance is amazing, especially DiCaprio's, who delivers an Oscar-worthy performance (as usual). Even though I read the book and knew what was going to happen this movie still kept me on the edge of my seat thinking what's going to happen next. I wouldn't consider this movie a horror which I liked because most horror movies nowadays are rushed and forgotten about a week after its release. It gave the audience the right dosage of blood, and kept them interested until the bittersweet end."
"kennychaggerty","6","1","4","4 March 2010"," A mediocre film with a superior setting
","The main reason I was looking forward to viewing Shutter Island was not that Scorsese was directing it (although that was part of it), but it was the fact that from the moment I viewed the trailer I was captivated by the environment of the island itself. The idea of Shutter Island is the same as Alcatraz, and it makes for a very interesting concept. Even if the inmates escape from their cell, they are still in prison. You can only leave Shutter Island if the guards allow it. The setting of the prison itself is what makes this film worthwhile. With this in mind I believe Shutter Island would have been better if Scorsese had focused more on the history of the island instead of on the mind of the main character.<br/><br/>If you are considering going to see Shutter Island I would strongly recommend heading to the theater with a clear head. This film is one hell of a puzzle to say the least. Fortunately the film has a clever ending, which saves it from becoming a maze with no way out. Although there are a lot of scenes and characters that I felt were not necessary to the story, the twist at the end and the strength of the first 45 minutes, in which the audience learns about the history of Shutter Island as well as Teddy Daniel's (Leonardo Dicaprio) disturbing past are worth the price of admission.<br/><br/>The film begins with Federal Officers Teddy Daniels and Chuck Aule arriving by boat to Shutter Island, a location reserved for only the most dangerous mentally disturbed convicts in America. They have been assigned to investigate the disappearance of a disturbed murderer named Rachel, who became a patient at Shutter Island after she murdered her three children. From this point on every sequence is part of the puzzle and I don't want to risk giving anything away. Similar to any puzzle, Shutter Island can get frustrating at times, but once you put together the missing pieces you feel satisfied after it is complete.<br/><br/>Overall, Shutter Island is a beautifully shot film by perhaps the best director of our time. Unfortunately, the plot of the film throws too much at the audience to be considered a classic psychological horror film. Filming the human mind is a complex task which few directors have ever been able to pull off and despite making the hallucination sequences interesting, Scorsese fails at intertwining them within the story itself. So despite not being in the same league as some of Scorsese's other works (Raging Bull, Goodfellas, The Departed), Shutter Island is still better than most recently released thrillers."

","I was really excited to see this movie, and in many ways it did deliver. The acting was excellent on all accounts as was the directing and cinematography.<br/><br/>My main 'beef' is with the twist at the end which is virtually impossible to predict because of the POV the story chooses to take. I get the point the twist is making, but I felt cheated because virtually anything could have happened (a cameo by Elvis, a trip to the moon...) and it would have been explained. If it weren't for the scene in the cave, I think I would have felt better about the ending.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, it's a good piece of dark, intriguing entertainment that will leave you pondering it after it's over."

Still, I will say he held his own and pulled through. Although, in the WWII flash backs he seemed out of place.<br/><br/>The story is pretty basic, but the twist will throw some into a loop, but others, like me and my family, not so much. Still, I felt that the movie was a good movie to watch when there is almost nothing to do.

"randolphpat","6","1","4","28 February 2010"," Good job with tough material
","This was a tough film to watch and, I'm guessing, an even tougher film to make.<br/><br/>First I think it's important to point out that the the director really had a lot of obstacles to overcome. Mainly a story that all at once combines the mellow-dramatic want to shoot myself depressing back story elements of say a Crime and Punishment, while trying to maintain the terror of The Shining. In many ways the story was in fact so similar to The Shining, that I thought it was a bit of a rip-off. But then to torrents of back-story roll in upon us. All of which has to be wrapped in a bow by the end of the film and it made this quite frankly, a little tedious.<br/><br/>The story, in case you've been living under a rock south of the equator since last November, is about the investigation by a Federal Marshall (played with his normal over the top aplomb by Leonardo DiCaprio) of an escaped patient at a hospital for the criminally insane on an Alcatraz like island. Mark Ruffalo plays DiCaprio's partner well. Performances by Ben Kingsley, and Max VonSydow as the doctors on the island are good, but wish they spent a little more time with VonSydow, and a little less time forcing Kingsley to tie the story together like a one man Greek Chorus. Michelle Williams makes what I think is the only real stand out performance as the female lead.<br/><br/>The island itself was darkly beautiful. The sets were true to period and dark and scary also. Not surprisingly the film was shot beautifully with a great variety of camera angles and lighting that set just the right mood.<br/><br/>It just seemed like this film tries too hard. There is only so much you can do with an adaptation. So I guess amongst the big budget adaptations this one falls squarely in the middle between Bonfire of the Vanities and LA Confidential. Not terrible or terrific, but a good investment of ten dollars and two hours on a rainy Saturday afternoon."

","Scorsese is far from home off the Massachusetts coast, but he's not gone far thematically, and SHUTTER ISLAND is actually a refreshing return to self-reflection, following the amoral romp THE DEPARTED, a film full of highly-entertaining kills, with a minimum of meditation on them. In this asylum for the criminally insane, however, Marty's found himself an ideal setting for a study of the brutality that's defined his career. Is violence the ultimate logic – a gift from God himself – as one character puts it? Or is violence simply madness – and are all those who commit it, if they're not mad already, driven irreversibly mad by it? It's a potent question, and one the director addresses here with care, if not subtlety...<br/><br/>Though SHUTTER ISLAND is something less than perfect, its effects are lingering, the questions it raises not easily dismissed. And the conclusion drawn by this brutal funhouse of a movie, ultimately, is a disturbing one: violence can't be undone. To put faith in human recovery in the face of sadism – either global, or personal – is to play a losing game. Once the crime's committed, the case can never be truly solved.<br/><br/>Check out my full review (and more) at STEVENSPIELBLOG.COM ...<br/><br/>-Greg"
"oskisa","9","1","4","28 February 2010"," Another intelligent movie from Martin Scorcese
","Since this is a science/ suspense/ thriller, I was looking for clues right through and in the first half hour, I guessed, its the story where the hunter becomes the hunted! But was that right? I don't think so!<br/><br/>The movie flows through fine but with a few hiccups. There were different phases where an intelligent fed marshall (Di Caprio) is ably supported by his side-kick (portrayed exceptionally by Mark Ruffalo). Ben Kinglsy as the shrink is worth a note here. He does not let his emotions reach anyone (including viewers) and plays a perfect fit for a psycho analyst! And the visual effects were captivating especially in the scenes where the fed has his nightmares with his late wife. It was a cake walk for Di Caprio but there weren't many scenes which required him to portray his emotions. He was always shown in a confused state as to whom he should believe. <br/><br/>Talking of which, this was the movies biggest asset - Martin Scorcese kept the viewers guessing. You can expect a twist in every other scene and you might not be let down. The climax does pack a couple of punches and before the viewer could come out of it, the movie is over. And you get a feeling that you have just watched an intelligent movie which again is a success for the director.<br/><br/>On the flip-side, the movie lacked the running pace through out. The movie came to a jog in a couple of scenes with long dialogues. And to expect the average movie-goer to concentrate on every detail for more than 2 hrs is a bit taxing. Its a critics movie where the attention to the details is maintained well. But does that mean, this is a boring movie? I don't think so! <br/><br/>Summing up - this is a movie worth the watch. Don't overload yourself trying to concentrate too much. Just ease, sit back, relax and let the mind flow with the movie. You would encounter a couple of edge-of-the- seat scenes. Enjoy the sudden dip in the roller coaster and it is worth it."
"bobsgrock","8","1","4","27 February 2010"," Is it possible Scorsese can make a bad movie?
","Shutter Island is a Martin Scorsese film no doubt about it. The atmosphere is very dark with raging storms outside and serious psychological problems on the inside. Teaming with Scorsese for the fourth time, Leonardo DiCaprio continues his ascent as one of the finest actors in Hollywood today. Taking place in 1954 on a remote island off the coast of Massachusetts, DiCaprio is Teddy Daniels, a US Marshal assigned to solve the mystery of a woman who supposedly disappeared from the seemingly impenetrable island.<br/><br/>Without giving anything away, I must address the shock and somewhat disappointment this film has received from many critics and Scorsese fans alike. Some say the film loses its way at the halfway mark, some say the story doesn't work at all and its just filled with scenes of this great cast doing bad Bostonian accents. It certainly isn't one of Scorsese's best compared to the classics of Raging Bull, Taxi Driver, Goodfellas or The Departed but this taut thriller for the most part still delivers.<br/><br/>The main problem people seem to have with Shutter Island is that the story goes way off keel in the last half hour and it does, that cannot be denied. However, the first 100 minutes are vintage Scorsese: dark, moody, and psychologically effective. DiCaprio is solid as a man tormented by demons that will eventually overtake his life. The supporting cast is very strong including Ben Kingsley, Mark Ruffalo, Emily Mortimer, Ted Levine and Michelle Williams, all who get their scene to shine and take advantage. The cinematography is very stunning and Scorsese's direction is effective in keeping us off balance so as to not know what to expect as the story unfolds.<br/><br/>The main twist this whole story hinges upon is one that might be frustrating for some film lovers, especially those who have had more than enough of their share of twisted plots. Nevertheless, despite the overdose of twists and revelations in the final 15 minutes, it seems Scorsese is more concerned with the buildup to the final conclusion and it is quite a trip. The acting carries most of the story and DiCaprio and Williams make their scenes believable despite teetering on melodrama and overacting. This is the kind of film that depends on the mindset you take into it. If you have seen the trailer, you must not expect the best film Scorsese has ever done. But, keep an open mind and don't try to figure the plot as I did and you might just enjoy your time. It certainly isn't instantly forgettable and that is the true mark of a Martin Scorsese film."
"deacon_blues-3","8","1","4","27 February 2010"," Reality is up for grabs throughout this convoluted adventure.
","Gripping, but ultimately unsatisfying (unless you are sold out to Scorsese's textbook brand of existentialism), Shutter Island is a beautifully crafted film that vacillates between looming paranoia and self-loathing psychosis, never allowing the audience to actually become convinced of either situation. <br/><br/>The cast is perfectly wonderful at contributing to the atmosphere of dread and paranoia that surrounds the Island and its inhabitants. The banter between DiCapiro, von Sydow, and Kingsley is a knot worthy of a troop of Eagle Scouts. Is Teddy the hunter or the hunted? Are the administrators of Shutter Island the monsters, or is Teddy/Andrew the real monster, running from himself? A show is being staged for Teddy's benefit, but is it to cover up a monstrous secret about Shutter Island, or to force Teddy to face his own psychological demons? Is Delores a guide, or an enemy to his sanity? Is Chuck real, a delusion, or an enemy in disguise? The tension never lets up as the viewer is sent reeling from one enigmatic scene to the next. As more information is revealed, less and less is really understood with any degree of certainty. Until finally we are left tottering between believing that Teddy is either a self-deluded monster or a victim who is playing along with his captors to avoid destruction. His final choice to perish as a man of honor, rather than live as a monstrous psychotic makes objective reality irrelevant and human moral choice the only ultimate authentic reality. <br/><br/>While Shutter Island shows a brilliant filmmaker at the height of his craft, I find the idea that objective reality is ultimately irrelevant as merely an existential cop-out. <br/><br/>Objective reality is the very thing that gives human moral choice any relevancy whatsoever. To abandon its importance and say that an honorable delusion is better than facing a monstrous reality is the wholesale overthrow of any hope of meaning or civil human society. <br/><br/>We see the same dreadful problem in the recent film Atonement. To choose what is right according to objective reality is once again considered unimportant; what matters is creating moral meaning within our own subjective existence, no matter how much actual human misery our actions cause. <br/><br/>In Scorsese's existentialism, the self-promoting delusions of a serial murderer have the same moral value as the actions of a real hero such as an Oskar Schindler. The claim that meaning is only found in subjective experience destroys any hope of authentic meaning whatsoever.<br/><br/>This is the the very same monstrous philosophy that allows us to imagine contentedly that certain classes of people are simply less than viable as human beings and therefore eligible candidates for extermination for the good of the rest of humanity's quality of life, or the alternate delusion that we are somehow ""saving the planet.""<br/><br/>As brilliant as Shutter Island is as a film, its underlying philosophy is decrepit, insidious, and destructive to the meaning of human existence. Appreciate the objective reality of the talent and craftsmanship shown by the director and his actors, but reject the conclusions of its long-bankrupt underlying philosophical foundation."
"Monotreme02","8","1","4","27 February 2010"," Much more than just an atmospheric psychological thriller
","Martin Scorsese is one of the greatest directors to have ever emerged in the history of film, and it is a joyous miracle that such a legend is still working today. Not only that, but these last few years Scorsese has really reached the peak of his career: he finally won an Oscar and his last few movies have been the most financially successful of his entire career. As a direct result of his legendary status and lengthy career, Scorsese has definitely earned the right to make whatever movies he wants to – If he shot excrement for an hour-and-a-half I would probably watch it. Luckily for us, though, his advanced years and many films, some of which are masterpieces of modern cinema, have not hampered or decreased the quality of his film-making in any way – in fact, his last few films were made with uncharacteristic energy and vitality for a director nearing his 70th birthday. His latest film, Shutter Island – his first narrative feature since his Oscar win for The Departed four years ago – is perhaps a bit of a departure from his usual fare and style. But it is still undeniably a Scorsese picture, as it transcends its genre and features many of the characteristics that identify his previous films. It's just a little harder to find them this time.<br/><br/>Before delving into the more debatable aspects of the film, I first want to mention its undeniably successful aspects, which are mainly cosmetic but are most prominent indeed. Scorsese's visual language has always been highly stylized, but this movie puts even Goodfellas and The Aviator to the test, and serves to be one of Scorsese's most hyper-stylized films yet. And with the aid of one of the greatest and most unique cinematographers working today, Robert Richardson, it also becomes what is ultimately probably Scorsese's best-looking film. Richardson's trademark style of direct-from-above spot-lighting, diffusion lenses and overexposure work overtime on this film as we drift between reality and dreams with a wink of an eye. But it's not just the cinematography that's at work here: we are treated to fedoras and trench-coats, characters puffing on cigarettes every chance they get, dripping sewers, rusty iron gates, flickering lights, creaking wood: This is Scorsese's ode to the old film-noir mystery thrillers from the 40's and 50's that he probably meticulously studied and analyzed at film school and that no doubt influenced his film-making from the beginning. Accompanied by an impressive collection of creepy and ominous musical selections, the whole thing plays out like a grand old-fashioned, highly stylized detective movie. But that's too simple for Scorsese, and the film quickly reveals itself to be far more than just that.<br/><br/>Another greatly impressionable element of the film is its acting, specifically the lead performance by Leonardo DiCaprio. Leo was always talented – there's no need to look any further than one of his earliest film roles in What's Eating Gilbert Grape for a testament to his abilities – but he has truly blossomed as an actor under Martin Scorsese's wing. His performance in Gangs of New York was a little uneven, but no less than two years after that film came out he delivered the finest performance of his career, in The Aviator. This is his fourth collaboration with Scorsese and in it he delivers one of the finest performances of his career: it is a ferocious, bombastic and intense performance that despite its grandiose is still filled with subtlety and finesse: DiCaprio has a complex character to play and he nails every gesture and every motion. Like his other recent films, Shutter Island is blessed with an incredible ensemble cast filled to the brim with famous names as well as lesser-known but immensely talented character actors who really bring an extra quality when Scorsese lets them go all-out. In terms of the major supporting performances, both Mark Ruffalo and Ben Kingsley do a fantastic job at playing simple but crucial characters whom we learn know more than we may have thought, and who keep that knowledge subtly under wraps all throughout. There are also a number of character actors who only have one appearance but who really stand out and totally steal their individual scenes, including Jackie Earle Haley, Patricia Clarkson and Elias Koteas.<br/><br/>At first glance, Shutter Island seems like an excuse for Scorsese to demonstrate that he is also capable of delivering highly stylized genre cinema: A good, old-fashioned, moody, atmospheric psychological thriller in which the fedora-and-trench coat-wearing detective finds himself caught up in a massive conspiracy. But fairly early on, when the World War II flashbacks begin to kick in, we already start to feel that there is something more at work. At first I was a little turned off by the film's finale, but the more I thought about it, the more I realized that it served a greater purpose. Scorsese is too good to have his film revolve around a ""twist"" ending: rather, it becomes a direct continuation of and sheds important light on the nature of the main character. So ultimately, what starts out as a particularly thrilling and stylish piece of genre fiction, eventually reveals itself to be a fascinating and resonant character study. I knew I could count on Scorsese to deliver something more profound than just another exercise in style. And while not quite on the level of his most powerful films, it's still good, and definitely better than any other director could have done with the source material."

","Just when it seems like Hollywood is out of good, original movie plots, a film such as ""Shutter Island"" comes out and proves me wrong. I know that it was a book originally, but they did a wonderful job adapting it to fit the big screen.<br/><br/>This is a movie that I really enjoyed. The majority of the film plays as a mystery where the audience, as well as the main character, is trying to figure out what is really going on on Shutter Island.<br/><br/>I was glued to the screen throughout the movie. There was a lot of mystery, but there was a lot of intensity and anticipation as well. At first glance, I thought that I had this movie figured out, but later found out that I was wrong.<br/><br/>The look of the film was really cool too. The dark, frightening structure that was Block C overlooking everything from high on the bluff was nicely done. We knew that the action would eventually lead us there and it served for a good looming destination. A lot of times when a movie is set in dark weather, such as a hurricane, I find it a bit obtrusive to see exactly what is going on with the action. This was not the case here. The weather added to the plot of the movie and was not distracting at all.<br/><br/>The acting and characters were all very good as well. The lead psychologists all add to the mystery of the island and you never know the true motives of anyone.<br/><br/>This is an awesome mystery movie and anyone who likes a movie in that form will really like this one."

","Last night I finally had a chance to see shutter island. I was really looking forward to see it, after it was initially announced to be released back in fall 09. Long story short I liked the movie, but it didn't live up to the high expectations I had from a Scorcese movie and it's astounding ensemble cast. The cast of the movie is really good, and i liked pretty much all performances throughout. But as much as I like and appreciate DiCaprio as an actor, he will always be a baby-face actor to me, which is strange when we first meet him as the hard boiled US Marshall Teddy Daniels, throughout the movie it gets better though. He seems more and more appropriate, without going too much into detail. The crafting and cinematography were top-notch and had it been released last fall it would probably one of the contenders in this year's academy awards race. At least for cinematography, editing and maybe direction. Scorcese is pretty much a save bet for a nomination. Given it's release date I assume it'll be forgotten at the Oscars 2011.<br/><br/>Back to the movie. My Problem with it is, that it's basically 10 years too late. Reading further might spoil the ending for some, so I suggest you skip this paragraph. If you've never seen a movie about a person going crazy are into suspense movies, you'll probably love it too pieces, but if you've seen movies like, fight club, secret window or identity you'll know how it's going to end pretty much from seeing the trailer, but this didn't spoil the fun for me too much, it felt a bit like watching 'Lost' on TV. Make theories in advance and see how it plays out.<br/><br/>Just based on crafting and cast this movie is probably an 8 or even a 9, but storywise it lacks originality, so i gave it a 7. Good movie, but not great."

"inkblot11","9","1","4","24 February 2010"," Don't shut yourself out from this beautiful film! It's a masterpiece, marred slightly by an imperfect edit, but still very fine indeed!
","Teddy (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a federal agent sent to investigate the disappearance of a female inmate at a prison for insane criminals. Located off the east coast, the island is accessible only by ferry and is surrounded by icy waters and a rough, rocky coast. Going with him is ""green"" agent Chuck (Mark Ruffalo) who will be working on his first major case. When they meet the security officers on the island, Teddy and Chuck are dismayed to have to surrender their weapons but the facility's rules rule. The chief trick cyclist, Dr. Cawley (Ben Kingsley) explains that their goal is to rehabilitate these folks, for, although they committed assaults and murders, they can be reached by therapy and pharmacology. Whew. The person missing is Rachel (Emily Mortimer), who disappeared while orderlies were having a card game. But, where did she go? She left behind her shoes and the terrain of the island is difficult. There is no explanation, so far. Another doctor (Max Von Sydow), a German immigrant, upsets Teddy, for the agent was part of the American army that liberated Dachau. Unhappily, Teddy begins to have horrific flashbacks. Also troubling Teddy is recurring nightmares about the death of his young wife, Dolores (Michelle Williams) in a fire. As they begin to look for the missing person, they have to inspect all three buildings on the island, including ""C"", where the most dangerous inmates are housed. Will they find the lady? Will they lose their own lives doing so? This is a masterpiece, slightly flawed, but an major achievement in film nonetheless. A better edit would have made a difference, for the pace is slightly off kilter and a ""mixing and splicing of scenes"" would have resulted in more interesting sequences. Nevertheless, Scorcese should be commended for making a thriller that genuinely thrills, and a beautifully, artistically crafted one at that. For example, a scene that falls apart into ashes is out of this world! The setting itself is a reason to see this one, for it is one of a kind. All other production values, including costumes and camera-work, are of the finest. On that note, DiCaprio and Ruffalo look so good in fifties-style coats and hats! The cast, too, is superlative, with all of the principal players doing great work. Special mention should go to Leonardo, for he is terrific and demonstrates why he is one of the premier actors in America. In short, get thee quickly to this amazing film. It is an overwhelming thrill ride of beauty and imagination."

","I've been a huge fan of the book by Dennis Lehane. Mystic River, Gone Baby Gone, now this. So far, both Clint Eastwood and Ben Affleck have done a brilliant job in adapting his work. Now up to bat, one of the greatest directors of the past 100 years: Martin Scorsese.<br/><br/>Taxi Driver, Goodfellas, Cape Fear, Raging Bull, Casino, Gangs of New York, The Departed, The Aviator, and Mean Streets. I can say this man is a genius film maker, and can tell stories in multiple ways. Going into this film, I have felt confident in making a great film and a great tribute to film in general.<br/><br/>Now before you start to question the review, this movie was brilliant. It was perfect as both a adaptation and as a movie in general. I've haven't been blown away from a book adaptation since watching Fight Club in 2006 for the very first time after ignoring it due to bad reviews. I have regret that decision, since its in my top 5 movies ever made.<br/><br/>Now 2 for 2, Lehane's Shutter Island is out. Whats to say? Its top notch in all categories. Dicaprio gives a stunning and a haunting performance that tops all his previous performances, and IMO only the Aviator has yet to fall to this film. He was subtle and when time came for the emotional reveal (which is one of the best delivered twist I've ever seen), he was golden. The flashback scenes alone make this film a must-see. Great cinematography and set design show the horror that is Shutter Island. And the music: left me with my mouth open.<br/><br/>Overall, without dragging on, most critics and people on this board got this film wrong. If they discovered the twist via-the trailer, I highly doubt they saw the other sides Scorsese was trying to show people. Also, for the critics who gave this film low ratings, most of them were comparing it to Scorsese's other works. OF COURSE THIS ISN'T GOODFELLAS OR RAGING BULL, IDIOTS! AND NO, ITS NOT HIS BEST FILM! SO SEE IT AS Something NEW AND DON'T NIT-PICK SMALL PROBLEMS IN A ALMOST FLAWLESS FILM. Without some scenes dragging out longer then they would have been, this would have been a perfect film. Lehane fans like myself can breath lightly now we have a great film at hand.<br/><br/>Rating: Really a 9.5/10."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","8","1","4","22 February 2010"," Scorsese's experimentation elevates a decent thriller
","Many people questioned acclaimed director Martin Scorsese choosing to helm a pure genre film in the psychological thriller ""Shutter Island,"" but the marriage of one of the masters of crime drama and a Dennis Lehane (""Mystic River,"" ""Gone Baby Gone"") novel is as close to an ideal match as it sounds. Although Scorsese is capable of applying his skills to more meaningful work than a mystery, he's able to play around a lot more with technique, style, light and color to turn a somewhat predictable mystery into a captivating thriller.<br/><br/>Many great thrillers have taken place within the walls of an insane asylum and ""Shutter Island"" takes this to the max. The isolated east-coast island is home to the most dangerous of the criminally insane. When two U.S. marshals (DiCaprio and Ruffalo) come to the island to investigate the mysterious disappearance of one of the inmates, they find themselves up to their necks in an even bigger mystery involving the hospital and everyone in it.<br/><br/>As Daniels investigates, we learn he is somewhat intimately tied to the case and the facility. He's lost his wife in a fire and the man who set it is locked up somewhere on the island. Daniels has dreams of his wife coming to him and speaking to him, turning to ash in his arms. He even starts to hallucinate while awake. Scorsese certainly hasn't had a lot of opportunity to play with false reality in his films, so he relishes these opportunities. Dream sequences are often pointless, but Scorsese makes them intriguing, beautiful and haunting all at once despite their excessive use. He picks powerful images that might make you shake your head at times, but they enhance the mystery in the long run.<br/><br/>Numerous scenes give Scorsese a chance to show off. When he investigates the mysterious Ward C, Daniels has nothing but matches. As he speaks to one of the prisoners, someone he knew off the island, he continues to light matches to see -- a new one every time one burns out. Scorsese develops a rhythm of creepy dialogue from Jackie Earl Haley and quick shots of the match striking flint then lighting the actors' faces. Dull moments are extremely rare in ""Shutter Island.""<br/><br/>Scorsese gets the most out of each scene, but the film doesn't conceal its hand all that well. A few lines of dialogue connect some if not most of the dots, so the impact of the last several minutes (aka the big reveal) is not as effective as some of the great thrillers out there. Without Scorsese and the talents of DiCaprio, however, ""Shutter Island"" might've ended up just a decent film as opposed to a very good one. It's too impressively executed to be bunched in with the bulk of decent thrillers out there, but not clever and original enough to be among the genre's elite. Scorsese might be capable of better, but ""Shutter Island"" proves his versatility more so than take anything away from his legacy.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Visit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com"

","My partner and I both read Dennis Lehane's book so went along cautiously, expecting this might be another case of a film not matching Dennis Lehane's reader experience—like Clint Eastwood's ""Mystic River."" Fortunately, Scorcese had a better idea of how squeeze film juice out of book pages—he surprised me, from the opening shot, with the noirish and at times, Gothic gloom. Scorcese makes the story his own, and there's no need to worry whether the adaption is either faithful or energetic.<br/><br/>We were both happy with the use of CGI special effects only to enhance the story and the audience getting into the head of Leo DiCaprio's Teddy Daniels character. In pre-computer days, a director such as Hitchcock didn't have this particular kind of paint in his paint box. We noticed the younger-than-us-audience was completely gripped by the film and we were also highly entertained, finding ourselves discussing it at length afterward—one sign of a good movie.<br/><br/>Any quibbles I have with the film have nothing to do with Scorcese's movie, really, and more to do with how Lehane's story promises at the outset a fresh and perhaps subtle look back at mental health and its treatment in earlier days but in the end, never rises above certain contemporary stereotypes and fixations about what makes minds fall apart.<br/><br/>Who won't enjoy it: the people who want to see the action-packed special effects movies pumped in the trailers before Shutter Island.

Not Silent Hill - like, which was what I was expecting from the previews, more like a psychological thriller/mystery, but pretty creepy still, and really depressing. Not creepy with the horror and effects, so if that's what you need don't see it, you will be disappointed. If you do like non-gore occasionally or just wait for it to come out on video, DiCaprio is pretty awesome, and the plot's steady and written really well even though its a little slow and confusing. Think of the anti-hero aspect of Taxi Driver, very intelligent, layered, and sophisticated. Unlike other mysteries and most movies the ending is actually amazing and incredibly satisfying, probably my favorite part. To give an idea without giving anything away, let me vague it up, you'll understand later; totally not what you were guessing even if you do get part of it half way through, it makes you review everything you've just seen in your head again just to understand it. Hence beware, it's a little hard to grasp in whole without re-watching it.

Well, since I've never seen Gangs of New York (yet,) I can't honestly say. But, I will say it was much better than The Aviator and The Departed, despite the fact I'm certain to get backlash on that comment. (For the record, I thought Aviator and Departed were good, but I enjoyed Shutter much more.) Was it great? By no means, but it was interesting and visually stimulating. So much so, I do hope for a Best Cinematography Oscar nom next year.

They land on ""Shutter Island"" to investigate the ""magical"" disappearance of inmate/patient/criminal Rachel, only Daniels has his own ulterior motives revealed throughout the film on accepting/requesting this particular assignment.<br/><br/>The movie plays out as a film noir mystery, set in the 1950s. Many of the sets, locales and moods are very 1950s in both setting and film-making. It's almost as if Scorsese acted out his Tarantino-like impulses and made homage to film noir past. And, believe it, it worked.<br/><br/>Though, again, the average moviegoer will see where there people fit into place in the ""mystery,"" the movie didn't bog you down on the ""big M. Night Shyamalan"" secret. They had a serious detective story to show with believable acting, great scenery, buildings and dialogue.<br/><br/>My only problems with the film were minute. Easily 20-30 minutes could've been cut. Sure, a lot, if not most, scenes were necessary to advance the plot, yet a good majority of them were drawn completely out to the max. Also, most of the movie did not have a score, but when it did, it was too loud and overbearing – for example: the camera follows both Daniels and Aule, amongst others, into the asylum for the first time, and the score was so incredibly deafening, it was distracting. And finally, I have not seen this many flashbacks since ALL of the Saw films (combined) or as many nightmares as the Freddy Kruger films. No doubt they were integral to the plot, but, BOY, every few seconds you had to do a double take on what reality – nightmare, memory, foreshadow – you were witnessing.<br/><br/>That all said, I would still recommend this movie. Thankfully, Leo didn't overact (AS MUCH, that is) like he does in 90% of his movies. Most of his features, you can see him yearning to win an Oscar, much like what Denzel Washington does in the majority of his movies. He did a good job. All three other main characters, played by Mark Ruffalo, Ben Kingsley and Max von Sydow, were not only believable, but did a great job.<br/><br/>I don't see this as a 100% repeat-viewer, but you should still see Shutter Island. At very least, take in the sights."
"Barky44","8","1","4","20 February 2010"," Great little mind warp of a movie
","I'm gonna try to write a completely spoiler-free review of ""Shutter Island"". Movies like this absolutely demand that you do NOT know what's coming next, and I really hope folks don't read spoiler reviews before seeing SI.<br/><br/>Let me start by saying this is NOT a horror movie, contrary to what the trailers suggest. This is Martin Scorcese's take on the Hitchcock suspense thriller, and a thumpin' good one. It follows a lot of Hitchcockian beats: unsettling beginning, that feeling something isn't quite right, with enough action sequences to keep you distracted from what's REALLY going on. Hitch would be a fan of this movie.<br/><br/>Let me also say that Leo DiCaprio does some really good acting here. He plays a U.S. Marshall dispatched to an insane asylum to track an escaped prisoner. He ends up wrapped in the madness himself, trying to separate madness from reality, conspiracy from banality, truth from fiction. DiCaprio is incredibly convincing even when you're not convinced what you're seeing is real.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is quite stellar: Ben Kingsley, Mark Ruffalo, Jackie Earle Haley, and that master-of-the-creep Max von Sydow. There's even a surprisingly gruesome cameo by ... well, that would be spoiling :-). Now sometimes their acting is flat & unconvincing, or is that exactly the effect Scorcese wants?? Hmmmmm.....<br/><br/>I have to throw in some kudos to the location scouts and set designers. Shutter Island itself is wholly part of the cast and crucial to the success of the film. How they managed to find this place ... incredible score on their part! So now for the negatives, the reasons I don't give this a full 10. The script does have a couple of plot holes, but because the theme is ""truth or madness"", they're mostly forgivable. There's also a definite sense that you've seen this story before (this is not ""Memento"", a film that was truly unique). And they did struggle a bit at the end (honestly, I don't know if there COULD be a wholly satisfying end for the story). But even this is forgivable, because films like this are DEFINITELY about the journey, not the destination.<br/><br/>8 out of 10."
"ZenaeFilmZ","7","1","4","20 February 2010"," Would this have gotten a 10/10 if it was made 30 years ago?
","When I initially watched this film last night I wanted to say ""this is an awful film, something is missing from it."" There comes a time when it is best to take a step back from the movie, and think it over, over night. The more I think about this film the more I actually like it. This movie has all of the ingredients to make a wonderful and memorable film. The direction, look, acting, story, the look of the dream sequences alone was very well done. There were parts of this film that reminded me of The Shining and other parts reminded me of a classic masterpiece. There were definitely several slow movement parts of the film which makes me wonder. With todays age, does the new technology with over blown special effects, fast pace cuts, movies that feel like a video game instead of an actual genuine story do these make us forget about what great story telling truly is? Do we forget how to sit and truly watch what's going on instead of having everything seen within the first 3 minutes? I thought this was a seamless and perfect film from beginning to end. The special effects weren't over done just to compete with who can do what. The effects worked well with the film. There were a few parts where it did get slightly redundant but then again, it was all in the mind of the paranoia. Everything actually made sense. So when you first see this movie, think about it don't instantly go to rate it a 5/10 or under etc... Think it over and you will see that the film did work together. The twist was fantastic and it wasn't like an M.Night Twist, it did not remind me of the ""Village"" or anything like that. This twist worked well on it's own and I thought it was beautiful how things could just start over like a clock. The trailer makes you think you are seeing a thriller/horror story but in the end... it is so much more than that. So feel free to see the movie, rent it, buy the bluray! Enjoy the film don't bash this one."

","Engaging if overlong film from Martin Scorsese based on the novel. Leonardo DiCaprio is a U.S. Marshal in 1954 who travels with his partner (Mark Ruffalo) to a heavily guarded mental institution for the criminally insane, far off on a creepy island. He's there to investigate the recent escape of a female patient who drowned her three children, and to possibly uncover what he feels are some unorthodox brain treatments on some of the inmates. He may even have a chance to confront and get revenge on a convict who was responsible for killing his wife two years earlier. Scorsese really handles this material well, but the viewer needs to pay close attention because there are so many twists and turns during DiCaprio's journey that things may sometimes become confusing. However, everything manages to make sense in the end, which is always what's important in a maze of a movie such as this. Leonardo's character is complicated because he plays a cop who had to kill many men during the war, and as a result has to contend with flashbacks which affect his work and better judgment. The rest of the cast is splendid, among them Max von Sydow as the elderly head psychiatrist, and especially Ben Kingsley as the mysteriously evasive and multi-layered head doctor who DiCaprio must deal with during his investigations. The ending wasn't really anything I couldn't have figured out, which is partly why I haven't rated the movie higher (that along with its excessive length and some possible lingering plot holes). But on the plus side, this is a film that I think may reward with a second viewing, and could conceivably come out with a slightly higher score next time. *** out of ****"

"ClaytonDavis","9","2","13","21 February 2010"," The best thriller since ""The Silence of the Lambs""
","Martin Scorsese has done it again! He has crafted one of the best psychological thrillers to hit screens since The Silence of the Lambs. Shutter Island sizzles with pure excitement, tension, and powerful performances. Starring Academy Award Nominee Leonardo DiCaprio as Teddy Daniels, a Federal Marshall visiting Shutter Island in order to find an escaped patient, Rachel Salondo, who vanished without any trace. Along with his partner Chuck (Mark Ruffalo), the two uncover a web of lies and corruption that may have taken more a toll on them than initially expected.<br/><br/>Shutter Island is one of the rare occurrences captured on film that I've seen in my lifetime, which could land its way into a cinematic classic in years to come. Scorsese has taken liberties and chances we haven't seen of him before and in this latter part of his career, he shows no sign of losing his touch. Teaming with writer Laeta Kalogridis to adapt this chilling novel by Dennis Lehane, Scorsese has set the bar for the rest of the films of 2010, and that bar is set extremely high. The film succeeds so masterfully thanks to three of Scorsese's crew. Cinematographer Robert Richardson shows the most beautiful camera work to grace the screen since Roger Deakins' The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford. His artistic choices in shots institutes the most immense amount of tension and elegant work of his career. The great film editor Thelma Schoonmaker, one of Scorsese's great tools on his belt, shows once again, she is one of the best in business. She chops shots together as she was dicing up onions, never cracking under the pressure and keeping it all at a well constructed, sublime piece of art. The last pillar in the arrangement of the film is Composer Robbie Richardson, who goes back to the root of film encompassing the fierce brutality of Kalogridis' screenplay.<br/><br/>Besides the heavy hitters of the picture behind the scenes, the performances of the cast are all top notch. DiCaprio has given one of his strongest works yet. He fights his way through the screen, taking no prisoners along the way and digging deep into a role where no sign of Leo is to be found. Ruffalo, definitely one of the most underrated actors in Hollywood nails his role. He strings us along with him, where the more we know, the more we don't want to let go. Ben Kingsley, as naturalistic and effortless as he can be, still proves he's one of the best working actors of the last generation. Kingsley as the mysterious and deviant Dr. Cawley, keeps us at arm's distance and doesn't let us in until it's under his own terms. Michelle Williams has her finest moments captured on film of her career. She's untouchable, intangible, and nearly unrecognizable as a haunting wife in the life of Teddy. Williams proves to be seconds away from becoming the biggest thing that Hollywood has to offer. Max Von Sydow and Emily Mortimer are both memorable and adequate in their respective roles. Even with the brief performances of Academy Award Nominees Patricia Clarkson and Jackie Earle Haley that blaze their way through the screen, they leave a massacre of audience members only wanting more.<br/><br/>The question of the minds of many viewers is, should this film have been pushed back from its original October 2009 release and be in contention for next year's Oscar ceremony? I can't for the life of me think why this wouldn't be pushed as the big juggernaut of the studio's awards season. With the Academy Awards keeping the ten Best Picture nominees for the ceremony of 2011, this may be the first spot taken in the lineup before this year's ceremony hasn't even occurred. It's a brilliant piece of cinema, with the sheer tenacity and gumption to stand the tests of time as one of the best psychological pictures created in ages. Some may argue that's predictable, some may argue it wasn't ""scary""; like they thought it would be; it's a surprise view but one worthy of the highest praise.<br/><br/>****/****"
"tavm","9","2","14","25 February 2010"," Shutter Island is another very good collaboration of Martin Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio
","When I agreed to watch this Martin Scorsese/Leonardo DiCaprio film with my movie theatre working friend today, the ""Skip It"" reviews of Michael Phillips and A. O. Scott were still on my mind but since I'd like to make up my own mind about anything, I thought, ""What the Hell."" I'll admit also up front that while I almost fell asleep sometimes during this, by the time of the Big Revelation, I was wide awake and wanting to learn more. Also, despite my almost sleepy demeanor, I was enthralled by DiCaprio's lead performance, by Scorsese's direction, as well as fine supporting performances by Mark Ruffalo, Ben Kingsley, Max von Sydow, Jackie Earle Haley, Emily Mortimer, Patricia Clarkson, and Michelle Williams. Nothing much more to say except this was another very compelling opus by the great director and his frequent leading man that I highly recommend."
"carbuff","5","1","5","19 August 2019"," Well-done, but predictable from the beginning, except the twist at the very end.
","""Shutter Island"" is a mystery movie that I'd put off watching for a long time. As a person, I find DiCaprio beyond insufferable. Therefore, I tend to hold off on watching his films, even though I have to admit he's been in a few I'd call good or better.<br/><br/>In the case of ""Shutter Island"", the basic plot premise turns out to be one that's very old and hackneyed by now. On the positive side and unsurprisingly, this film has very high production values, but is still just a tired riff. The plot moves along in a predictable manner, except for the twist at the extreme end, which did catch me by surprise. Still, two hours of film time to get to this one moment wasn't worth it at all. At least this film confirms my bias against DiCaprio, so I can't call it entirely a loss."

","This is a movie for those that are movie goers. Also, if you see this you must watch it again to fully appreciate the direction and acting that goes into pulling off this film. All of the players in this film do a masterful job with their roles. To understand what I'm saying, watch the movie one night and then think about it and then watch it the next day. Then pay attention to what everyone is doing. This type of acting scheme doesn't happen on it's own. The director has to make the actors pull off his vision. Anyway if you love movies this is your type of film. Martin Scorsese is a master director and continually challenges himself with each movie and genre he tackles, this being a Hitchcock homage."

","Once again we were told to hate this by dumb-ass reviewers in the press and on TV. Once again, actually applying your brain to the viewing process rewards one with a fantastic experience. The best thing I have seen since Mullholland Drive, and like that film, this one plays with your head until it hurts. This is what a good auteur film should do. If you want something easy go and watch the latest Car Chase movie, you won't be disappointed. What do you get when a mad policeman is asked to investigate himself ? This was simply brilliant. Especially the claustrophobia that built up towards the end as DiCaprio realises that 'perhaps' he is the bad guy. All kudos to all the cast for superb acting. Especially Ben Kingsley in the best thing he has done for years."
"jrwygant","5","1","5","29 December 2010"," simplistic B-movie
","Ignore the celebrity status of Scorsese and DiCaprio and this is an otherwise simplistic B-movie. DiCaprio's acting is uneven, like his Boston accent, and Ben Kingsley seems to be going through the motions only to collect a check and get back to real drama. Like much American cinema, you could experience this movie with your eyes closed. There is nearly constant dialog, explaining everything we ought to be able to figure out on our own. The shifts in point of view, from exclusively DiCaprio's for most of the film, to omniscient near the end, only emphasize that the producers didn't trust the audience's ability to understand what was happening, even though it's neither complicated nor original. To avoid any confusion, the flashbacks and delusions are clearly labeled. A few nights before viewing this film I watched ""A Prophet"" (""Un Prophète""), a French film about confinement and crime. It too used delusions, but relied upon the viewer to recognize what they were, rather than simply identifying them. That film was thrilling, suspenseful, grim, in ways that ""Shutter Island"" did not come close to achieving."

I don't want to spoil anything but you will remember this movie and it's ending. Acting: Top notch. Everybody is A-game here. You are really connected to the protagonist and feel for him. Camera: Nice shots with good work from the shadows keeping everything you need to see and at the same time giving you an ere feeling. This is truly a masterpiece. Recommendation: See at the movies.

"PippinInOz","10","1","5","27 August 2010"," Thought provoking: Foucault!
","I have just watched the film last night on Foxtel and so pleased that I did! Only very disappointed that did not get my act together and see this on the big screen and would not pass up this opportunity if any of our Luna cinemas decide to show it again. Hint hint!<br/><br/>Martin Scorsese is probably my favourite director and as another reviewer so aptly said, this is something different from the great man - and once again he excels. The narrative is just fantastic and will have you on the edge of your seat and the edge of your mind. I kept thinking of Michel Foucault, the French theorist who wrote so much about the discourse of 'madness' and there is a scene where Foucault's ideas (once you are 'named' insane, anything you say afterwards is always just the ramblings of a delusional mad man) are voiced. I have taught introductory media studies and any student out there looking for a good example to illustrate the theories should definitely get hold of this film.<br/><br/>Not only is this a great tale, wonderfully directed, it is also uniformly (pardon the pun) brilliantly acted. There is no weak link here. Which says so much for the actors, because this is not a black and white narrative and - thinking about it now - so much would have been lost in depth if not for the emotional intensity of the performers. One of those rare films where nail biting edginess combines with emotionally charged performances. In other, lesser hands, this could have been really awful. <br/><br/>Spoilers Coming Up!!<br/><br/>There is so much I could say about this film, but will try to cut to the chase: A couple of major things that struck me apart from the Foucault 'madness' stuff:<br/><br/>The Wicker Man: I am talking about the original by the way. If you have seen the 1970s Edward Woodward film, see what you think about this. The 'pretend' missing woman, the island where you can't get off, the lure to the lighthouse on the rocks - all suggesting allusions to The Wicker Man. There is only one ferry that joins the mainland to the island in both stories. Both films interrogate the notion of 'belief' and how particular belief systems become 'fact' and 'beyond question' (paganism, psychiatry and Woodward's protestant Christianity). <br/><br/>The Civil War Prison: North versus South but also the lead protagonist's Sanity versus Insanity. The battle within. Is it real? Or is it just the place where the lead protagonist must go to face his demons? <br/><br/>The Liberation of Dachau: The lead protagonist is correct to see the links between psychiatry, power and oder he witnessed here and the Island. In both places, 'doctors' using the language of 'science' decide who lives and who dies. (the Lobotomy is a kind of death)<br/><br/>Discussion question: If he did kill his wife after she killed the children - and even this is still up for grabs to me - should we completely trust these 'experts?' - is it so bad that he creates a fantasy in order for his brain to deal with so much trauma? Is the 'Truth' of his situation - and saying it out loud to people - so important, that by not speaking it he deserves a lobotomy? Mmmmm....this brings to mind a strong element in American cultural history - the 'speaking publicly of your sins' (a central tenet of the early puritans' religion) is still a major factor in programmes like 'Oprah' for example. <br/><br/>I see a thousand Phd papers coming up on this film - and would love to read them! Why can't all films be this layered and thought provoking?? <br/><br/>Once again: Just wonderful. Already planning to watch it again."

","Leo never stood out to me as a great actor. Before it hits the fans, I always thought his movies were lengthy and overrated. Though I decided from the trailers and reviews from this film, that it would be different and more of a complex physcological thriller. It definitely is. This is a very confusing film, with that being so various twists and turns come about and it's hard to give a legitimate answer for a plot. I will make it as simplistic as possible and try to go more in-depth with my opinion to expand this review.<br/><br/>Two Federal Marshalls, Teddy Daniels (Leo) and his partner, Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo), go to the Ashecliff Hospital for the criminally insane on the remote Shutter Island. They try to investigate and piece together the mystery of what happened in the disappearance of Rachel Solando (Emily Mortimer). With her being in a locked room it's as if she evaporated through the walls.<br/><br/>The head psychiatrist, Dr. John Cawley (Ben Kingsley) harasses the Marshall's and plays mind games on the two as well, being a major pain. While continuous twists and turns overwrite the movie, the film has no holes and really leads up to the suspense moments. The film's tone is very dark and creepy just like the book it represents.<br/><br/>Many would say that this movie is too confusing, rightfully it is, but still, when followed with a third eye you can see more twists unfold by the second. Every little detail builds and adds to the resolution at the end. I will definitely re-watch it to see if I could point out more curves I may have missed in my first viewing of the film done back in February.<br/><br/>Another thing that made this film great was the excellent charisma and bonding relationship between Martin Scorsese and Leonardo Di-Caprio. They worked previously on the 2006 Academy Award show stealer The Departed so no doubt that they no what they are doing together. All in all, Shutter Island is an absolute blast of Suspenseful action combined with the excellence of true beauty in film-making. An early candidate for the best film of 2010.<br/><br/>Starring: Leonardo Di-Caprio, Ben Kingsley, Mark Ruffalo, and Michelle Williams. Directed by: Martin Scorsese."

","Shutter Island A Leonardo DiCaprio, Martin Scorsese Movie, set in 1950's on the back drop of war and Psychiatry. It looked some time as a horror movie but in fact there was no hammering horror in it, but a naive suspense and twist that shocks you at the end.<br/><br/>Perhaps the unexpected twist at the end was not received properly by many viewers. Yes! Certainly that's what exactly is the suspense in the movie. But unless you watch this movie with great attention you cannot make it what the story is all about? Those who gave it up half way watching(that's exactly many did and even I attempted once)I believe they lost a wonderful movie forever.<br/><br/>At least after reading my review you can once again sit back and watch it from the beginning to end in a relaxed mood.<br/><br/>The pace of first half is slow, confusing and gives an impression as if there is nothing in the movie, except a dragging investigation in to a missing patient in the Shutter Island asylum. There is a strong reason for getting this impression. Dr Cowley and his staff, the nurses, and other doctors behave in such a suspicious manner Teddy (DiCaprio) wonders and all his disbelief further grows deep in mystery as things start unwinding one by one. The missing lady could not be traced as yet and when succeeded it opens up the Pandora's Box.<br/><br/>During Investigation Teddy loses his temper and shouts many times. Why an Investigator loses temper so frequently? He shouts at Dr Cowley and Dr Nehring on many occasions. The investigation goes on in a slow pace.<br/><br/>The first few minutes of the movie, takes your memory back to 'A few Good Men"" and DiCaprio made a frail attempt to mimic Tom Cruise, but no match. But I should admit that DiCaprio acted well and did justice to the role.<br/><br/>OK what's the story and enormity of this movie is all about? <br/><br/>Remember the opening scene when Teddy and his assistant Chuck arrives at the Asylum in the Shutter Island by sea, and starts investigation about the missing female patient. Teddy slowly finds the secret behind this chilling gang of Doctors and their staff and realizes how patients are drugged and confined in cells under the guise of treatment (?) A stereo type one? No not at all. Watch it.<br/><br/>Teddy encounters several times his family tragedy in dreams. His dead wife and murdered children often come in his dreams and makes him nervous, while the investigation was on.<br/><br/>Teddy was finally given some drugs by the Doctors as he develops migraine head-ache due to intense investigation and quizzing of the staff. However he realizes that he himself was drugged by the Doctor's as the tablets he swallowed was not Aspirin but a prescribed drug supposed to cure or worsen the mental illness.<br/><br/>Teddy gets the information that the Light House on the shore was the secret den that was being operated by the gang of Doctors. Teddy rushes towards the Light House, and finds Dr Cowley (Ben Kingsley) sitting pretty and cool in the Light House tower.<br/><br/>Not only Teddy was shocked but Teddy shocks the viewers too. The first twist in the movie.<br/><br/>Another twist was in store for viewers by then, before the end comes to an end.<br/><br/>When Teddy and Chuck were discussing sitting on the steps, Teddy slowly drags in to discussion. Teddy calls Chuck in his usual tone and Chuck responds his boss(?) Later Teddy say's a few words like a SAGE. Chuck takes aback. By the time, it is all over! Watch it and find out.<br/><br/>The shock on the face of Chuck ought to have been filmed in close up shot instead of long shot. This is the blunder the Director committed. Again this scene ought to have been filmed in a dramatic manner, to high light the suspense. Director again fails.<br/><br/>A perfect thriller story better filmed, but could have been filmed even better, had the Director taken a little care. As Indian Directors are master of Dramatization a Hindi Version can make box office record here.<br/><br/>Watch this movie with patience and enjoy.<br/><br/>Krishna Baalu/30-06-2010"

I read Lehane's novel,and Lehane,being the genius that he is(also wrote Mystic river),had me engaged in the novel within 3o pages. The film is just as engaging.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio delivers one of his best performances as Teddy Daniels, a U.S. Marshall who travels down to a mental hospital with his partner Chuck(played well by Mark Ruffalo) on an island on Boston Harbor. They are searching for Rachael Solando(played excellently by Emily Mortimer)who seems to have vanished. <br/><br/>Teddy is also there in search of his wife's(played by Michelle Williams)killer too. Teddy has these flashbacks and dreams involving her and Nazis. He soon finds out that nobody on this island is what they seem.<br/><br/>This film wasn't very successful. With critics that is. So it most likely won't be an Oscar nominee. But if it is nominated for one thing, that is Dicaprio. Dicaprio is a good actor. It's about time that he wins an Oscar.<br/><br/>Why did I love this movie so much? The music played throughout is perfect. The casting choices are well chosen. Ben Kingsley is terrific as the evil doctor. Even the cameos are terrific. Especially from Jackie Earle Haley(Little children) who is the king of being creepy. But I can't forget to mention Emily Mortimer. For the brief couple of minutes that she is on screen,she is electrifying.<br/><br/>The film had me easily as engaged as the novel did,and that was a lot. Scorsese does a terrific job with the creepy sense used. He does a good job here. And the twist is a good one. It's not a twist that ends on a confusing level. It actually makes sense.<br/><br/>Scorsese is timeless. This is not his best film but it's one of them in my opinion. All of his films have a little difference. Though most of them are mob related. I like it when he tries something new though. Like with Cape fear and The color of money(which I didn't like)and The Aviator. Shutter island is the best of those films just mentioned,and it's my favorite film so far this year.<br/><br/>Shutter island:A+"

Shutter Island is the latest from Martin Scorsese and apart from being a great psychological thriller, it also serves as an excellent example of what it takes for a movie to be a film.<br/><br/>From the very first opening credits, this film draws in the audience and firmly holds them in place. Set in post-WWII 1954, Scorsese uses foreboding and ominous tones for the opening credits, setting a mood of impending tragedy and uneasiness from the very beginning. After the title credit passes, we meet Teddy Daniels, played seamlessly by Leonardo DiCaprio, a U.S. Marshall aboard a ferry boat experiencing the joys of sea-sickness. After becoming ill and facing himself in the mirror, he pulls it together and returns to the deck of the boat where he and his new partner smoke the first of many cigarettes. Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo) is introduced to both Teddy and the audience at the same time and together we accept his character...but with some hesitation, of course. Both U.S. Marshals have been summoned to a remote island off the coast of Boston to investigate the disappearance of a child murderer / patient from the Ashecliffe Hospital for the criminally insane. The ferry creeps closer to the island and as the fog dissipates, we get our first glance at Shutter Island. The physical geography of the island perfectly matches the tone and feeling of the film so far. Sharp, jagged rocks surround the perimeter of the island, barbed-wire fencing separates the perilous outer edges from the inner grounds, and a lighthouse can be seen in the distance on the far side. Before becoming a prison / hospital, Shutter Island was the home to a Civil War-era fort. Now what once housed soldiers and generals has become the living quarters for the patients. Three main buildings stand out in the main interior of the island; Building A for the female patients, Building B for the male patients, and Building C for those deemed to be the most dangerous and disturbed. Building C is off-limits except under extreme circumstances and always with approval and presence of Dr. Cawley and the Head Warden. The entire island seems cut-off from reality, as if to suggest that you may even wish to question the air you breathe. It seems only natural to feel a sort of gloominess and despair when first seeing Ashecliffe. Upon entering the main building, Teddy and Chuck are introduced to Dr. Cawley, the leading psychiatric at the island played flawlessly by Ben Kingsley. At the same time, Cawley is both specific and vague regarding the details of the missing patient, like he's dancing to a tune that only but he can hear. To add to the confusion, the entire staff seems to be dancing to the very same tune and none of them are sharing more than what they had been told. Even the island itself has a history and reputation that suggests there is more going on than meets the eye. Cryptic messages and inexplicable warnings only fuel the fire lit underneath Teddy and he pushes further and further until something finally pushes back. Then we see what happens when too many unanswered questions pile up and the cold, clammy walls of the hospital begin to close in on Teddy and his partner. Scorsese masterfully tears away at reality, piece by piece, utilizing flashbacks to suggest that Teddy may be harboring some trauma of his own. Leonardo DiCaprio is almost too good at being full of hopeless curiosity. He fights for answers and endures riddle after riddle until, at the climax of the film, his reality (as well as the audience's) is turned upside-down and twisted so greatly that up becomes down, black turns to white, and what has seemed to be fact is now nothing more than Teddy's own unraveling certainty. Scorsese does a great job keeping the audience in sync with Teddy the whole time. As the mystery unfolds and the truth is finally revealed, the shocked look on Teddy's face is identical to those of the faces in the audience.<br/><br/>Shutter Island is a fight with reality and perception from start to finish. Rarely has a film played with the minds of its audience so deeply and so cleverly. This film is beautifully directed, artfully edited, and very well acted. DiCaprio, Kingsley, Ruffalo and even Ted Levine (as the Head Warden) all give outstanding performances in their respective roles. Martin Scorsese has shown us all, once again, why his name continues to be at the forefront of film-making. After some of the bombs that Hollywood has recently produced, its refreshing to see that some movies really do live up to all the hype. But when it all comes down to it, sometimes its just nice to be reminded what watching a film feels like."
"Bunuel1976","8","1","5","20 March 2010"," SHUTTER ISLAND (Martin Scorsese, 2010) ***1/2
","Martin Scorsese's fourth consecutive feature film to have Leonardo Di Caprio in the lead is one that I felt was slightly superior to their Oscar-winning predecessor, THE DEPARTED (2006); undoubtedly, it is a vast improvement over Scorsese's previous movie with definite horror overtones i.e. the unsatisfactory and unnecessary remake of CAPE FEAR all the way back from 1991! Having said that, the film is ostensibly a mystery thriller set inside a mental institution and, reportedly, Scorsese drew inspiration from several noirs directed by Jacques Tourneur and his earlier horror output for producer Val Lewton (whose own last effort in that genre, BEDLAM [1946], shared a similar setting to this one). Although Robbie Robertson's brooding assembled score tends to be over-emphatic, this has to be one of Scorsese's most intricately crafted works, replete with suffocatingly gloomy visuals (courtesy of cinematographer Robert Richardson and production designer Dante Ferretti). Leonardo Di Caprio's performance – as a Federal Agent investigating the 'impossible' disappearance of a female inmate – is arguably his most confident yet under Scorsese's mentoring; however, from the outset, his character clearly belongs to the ""nuttier than thou"" variety and the much-touted identity twist in the film's latter half did not inordinately surprise this viewer! Without wishing to reveal anything of the labyrinthine mazes in Dennis (MYSTIC RIVER) Lehane's source novel, suffice it to say that the film's plot turns from an imbroglio a' la THE WICKER MAN (1973), by way of elaborate charades akin to THE GAME (1997), into a personality crisis in the A BEAUTIFUL MIND (2003) mould. Aiding Di Caprio in bringing his character's inner turmoil to the surface – and, consequently, appearing to hinder his investigation at every turn – are an impressive array of actors all of whom rise impeccably to the occasion: Ben Kingsley (as Shutter Island's radical head honcho), Max von Sydow (splendidly sinister in the handful of scenes he is featured in), Mark Ruffalo (as Di Caprio's 'partner'), Michelle Williams (as Di Caprio's dead wife!), Emily Mortimer (as the missing patient), Patricia Clarkson, Jackie Earle Haley, John Carroll Lynch, Ted Levine, and Elias Koteas. Apart from Di Caprio's harrowing flashbacks to his part in the liberation of the Dachau Concentration Camp (which, we are led to believe, were the reasons for his later alcoholism and disturbed state of mind), there are effective nightmare sequences aplenty (perhaps a mite more than required, actually) abounding with bloodied corpses or dissolving ghosts. Topping everything up, we have a deliciously enigmatic ending that, again, leaves the door open (ironically enough for a movie set on an island prison) for more than one clear interpretation: did Di Caprio fake a relapse and welcomed lobotomy to pay for his grave, alcohol-induced fault of not committing his mad wife at an earlier stage and thus sparing the lives of his three childrenor, was he the murderer of his entire family all along? Because, were it otherwise, why else would he have been institutionalized in this most forbidding of mental hospitals in the first place?!"
"dimitrisalomao","10","1","5","15 March 2010"," Surprising!
","Though I think Martin Scorsese is the one of, if not the best director of all time, I was not secure about this one, it seemed like Scorsese had failed, well, he proved me he is versatile, by making another great movie, and I just don't say masterpiece, because it's too early to tell.<br/><br/>Throughout the movie I thought the screenplay wasn't going anywhere, but it already impressed me, with its technical brilliancy, an amazing sound mixing and editing, and an art direction that is not less than splendid (note when the rain falls on a written paper and the ink vanishes). And Scorsese shows how he knows about cinema, by creating an admirable atmosphere , inspired in other great movies, that remembered me of Kubrick's ""The Shining"". The movie, beyond being an incredible suspense, it's a great thriller, the mystery grabbed me on the screen, till the end of the movie, and boy, what an end! <br/><br/>Another element that really impresses in this movie is its casting, although DiCaprio never impressed me so much, he is mesmerizing in this one, and the supporting cast that includes, Mark Ruffalo, Ben Kingsley (Incredible), Max Von Sydow, and Jackey Earle Haley (Who deserves Highlight), is brilliant.<br/><br/>Verdict: Scorsese proves his versatility, with this incredible Psychological Thriller, listen to me!"
"decoconnor5","10","1","5","14 March 2010"," Scorsese's new venture keeps you guessing until the very end and long after that too.
","I gave this 10 out of 10 because I genuinely thought it was an excellent film. I had seen the trailers and read the reviews, something many film fans avoid in the fear of over expectation. When seeing the trailer I seen clips of scenes that came across as almost ghostly and supernatural. This threw me a little as I have become used to Scorsese's type of film and never have I seen him use ghosts or any supernatural element. Trust me when I say, DO NOT LET THIS THROW YOU! If you want to see a type of film like Casino, Goodfellas or Gangs of NY just go rent them because this is nothing like those films. This is something completely different. This is a new side to Scorsese that hasn't been seen before. For a Director of his reputation this was a big risk to take but it really did pay off. Di Caprio is simply brilliant here and plays his role to perfection. The supporting cast all do a fine job and in particular Ben Kingsley who is excellent. Fantastic performances, excellent direction with great use of flashback and overall a storyline that will keep you thinking ""what if?"" until well after you leave the theater. Don't be put off by Scorses's new direction. It works unbelievably well and you wont be disappointed. Without giving anything away I recommend that you go watch Shutter Island. Having seen it, I still wonder if what we actually saw was what really happened? <br/><br/>Highly Recommended"
"imonthetoiletnow","10","1","5","12 March 2010"," Teddy Daniels falls under some of the great Scorsese Characters
","This was truly a great performance from Leonardo Dicaprio. To bug out through the entire movie, and at the end you bug out even more. Brilliant entertainment. Teddy Daniels is Dicaprio's first type cast role. As we seen throughout his career now, at least once a movie he is going to freak out. Shutter Island is an Hour and Forty minutes long, throughout that time it's an acid trip for Teddy Daniels. Hallucination, Walking nightmares, fights, arguments. He is like the Dark Randal McMurphy or the even darker Travis Bickle.<br/><br/>As for Scorsese. He certainly threw a lot of homages in there, at least from my eyes. It was shot similar to The Exorcist: The Beginning. Now of course Shutter Island wipes the floor. But it was also not hard to see the comparisons to One Flew Over The Kuc Koo's Nest.<br/><br/>Scorsese just does it again, this time with Leonardo Dicaprio. At first the collaboration was a little green. But it is shaping to be a classic combo."
"sddavis63","7","1","5","6 March 2010"," Great Suspense From Start To Finish
","What this movie does well, it does very well. Essentially, what that is is setting the right mood. From the very first scene, there's a feeling of suspense, fear, foreboding and even dread. There's something about this island. We know that, of course, but for a movie to strike that tone from its very beginning is unusual to say the least. And that feel is never really abandoned. It stays with the viewer from beginning to end - and that's absolutely essential, because for about three quarters of the movie I was feeling a bit lost. The story wasn't making any sense; there seemed to be too many different things going on inside Daniels' head - from the liberation of Dachau to the death of his wife to some suspected connection with the Red Scare to trying to piece together the mystery of this woman who's gone missing from a facility for the criminally insane, even though there was no way for her to escape and nowhere for her to go if she did. That island setting was brilliantly used by Martin Scorsese, and the scenes filmed inside ""C"" Block are positively claustrophobic. For all the mystery involved with that, though, the movie suddenly comes into clear focus the moment at which Daniels encounters Dr. Cawley in the lighthouse. At that moment (even before the twist was formally revealed) I knew what was happening, and yet - a sense of uncertainty still remains. Is there going to be a double twist? You're kept on your toes until the very end.<br/><br/>There are very good performances, especially from Leonardo DiCaprio as Daniels (although he struck me at first at least as a bit too youthful looking for the role) and from Ben Kingsley as Dr. Cawley. What pulls you in, though - and remains with you afterward - is that atmosphere so brilliantly created by Scorsese. 7/10"
"davdecrane","6","1","5","1 March 2010"," You saw the trailer, you know what it's like...
","A guilty pleasure to be sure, but worth genuine kudos for attempting and succeeding in lurid B-movie, drive-in fashion the almost-always baroque tale (in movies at least) told by an unreliable narrator. The movie offers strong acting, especially from De Caprio, but little else in the way of real production pleasures. Music, production design and Scorsese's look-at- me camera work are all over the top. <br/><br/>The story unfolds in clue-dropping fashion, and it's our job to figure the silly thing out. Major twists may be discerned but the nasty details are fun to guess at too, and harder to perceive. And there's always the very last twist to speculate about. Here it proves a good one. Again, you've seen the trailer, you know not to expect a serious take on cops looking for a missing mental inmate; you're expecting a gumbo of noir, horror and thriller. The 1950s setting takes us immediately into the Snake Pit world of lobotomies and Freudian-drenched dreams and situations – it's surprising Faulknerian castration scenarios don't appear – and signal us to have some fun. Despite the noise and histrionics, you can. A better storyteller than Scorsese would have realized the story is really the dead wife's: how did she manage to go so crazy and do what she did? She didn't see the horrors of Dachau. And Scorsese might have added some comic relief, graced us with a real score, and been able to tell the tale in a more efficient, horror-thriller manner (the jump scares are laughably bad). But the story's a Grand Guignol take on a mental breakdown: subtlety is not an option. Eat your popcorn, laugh at the thing for being so atavistically earnest and play along."
"preppy-3","7","1","5","27 February 2010"," Very good but you need patience
","This takes place in 1954 on an island off the coast of Massachusetts that has a hospital for mentally disturbed patients. Federal marshals Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo) go there to find out how a mentally disturbed patient escaped from her cell. The head doctor (Ben Kingsley) seems to want to help--but bars them too. As the search increases Teddy has hallucinations and horrendous nightmares. He slowly starts to suspect that there's a LOT going on that he knows nothing about.<br/><br/>Martin Scorsese's thriller has received rave reviews and is a big success at the box office--but this demands a lot from viewers. To be totally honest I was getting bored after the first hour. The constant hallucinations and dreams that DiCaprio has came at you nonstop with no explanation. I realized later on that there was a REASON for this but it's frustrating at first. Then, during the last 45 minutes or so, the twists and turns come fast and furious and totally mesmerized me. I realized the slow pace and images at the beginning where that way for a reason--but you have to force your way through it (at first). The acting is superb--no one is bad but DiCaprio and Kingsley are excellent. DiCaprio has played this part before but he's just excellent in a VERY disturbing sequence toward the end (you'll know it when you see it). The directing is excellent (of course) and the cinematography is perfect. So--it is slow and a little too long--but that's all needed for the story. This might actually improve with multiple viewings. I give it a 7."
"happyclown93","Null","1","5","24 February 2010"," A ride, full of twists and turns!!!
","From prior reviews, I was not expecting much. But it was fantastic. This was never meant to be Scorsese's ""Masterpiece"", this was him trying a genre he has never worked with before. And it was a success. Full throttle ride with endless plot twists, not that the story gets bogged down by twists though. If you're looking to see the new Taxi Driver, then you will come out disappointed. If you looking to see a psychotic movie about the criminally insane, you're on the right track. Enjoy all of the metaphoric scenes of art, of what some people have called "" Slack Rubbish "". Of course it's a far cry from Scorsese's best work, but join with him and celebrate a classic film maker indulging in the arts."
"Ric-7","10","1","5","22 February 2010"," It's not ""like"" anything
","Please, please do not read this if you have not seen the film already. I am not going to disclose anything major, but the less you know about the plot, the more I think you'd enjoy it.<br/><br/>From the time I first saw the trailer for this film, I was amazed that this was by Scorsese. A horror film? Okay. The film certainly establishes the mood and tension of a classic horror film, without dwelling too much on gore or relying too much on surprise cuts and sounds (the ""Boo!"" effect).<br/><br/>My recollection of the film is that the actors all gave extremely subtle performances which in light of the several plot twists in the end, all still rang true. I enjoyed the film so much on the first viewing knowing nothing, that I must see the film again to see if the earlier scenes still add up.<br/><br/>The exterior shots are fascinating. I am not sure if this was a location someone found, or whether it was all created digitally or on a back lot. Even the cemetery scene, almost obligatory in a great horror film, was perfectly devised and filmed. Even the few ""daylight"" scenes seem dark and gray, and the reference to a hurricane assaulting the island is an excellent explanation for the gloomy atmosphere to begin, which quickly deteriorates into an extended dark and stormy night when the storm causes a power failure.<br/><br/>What is this like? It's not really ""like"" anything. There are familiar elements: being cut off from the civilized world due to the weather (The Shining); haunting inexplicable dreams (Spellbound); crazed doctors on deserted islands experimenting on humans (Island of Lost Souls). An occasional similarity, but not a copy of anything.<br/><br/>I didn't know the supporting cast before seeing the film, and then I saw Patricia Clarkson giving the best performance by a hallucination that I have ever seen. After you've seen the film, try to figure out what that was all about.<br/><br/>Not entirely perfect. But very very close to it. After seeing the film, I have quite a lot of questions. But if absolutely everything was explained in detail, we'd have an 8-hour film. I loved it. I'm going again.<br/><br/>* * * * *<br/><br/>I've seen the film a second time. I don't think anyone can fully appreciate what Scorsese has done without seeing the film twice. Once you know the ""secret,"" you can see how the earlier part of the film is so totally consistent with that secret. All characters act and react exactly in accordance with that secret. The secret is not just a bizarre computer-generated plot twist. The only potentially implausible thing is whether the government would have had the interest or the resources to underwrite what happens in this film, but this is not a film about government financing. This film is absolutely amazing. I upped my rating to a 10."
"PhantomLord_78","5","1","5","22 February 2010"," Great Acting but everything else is bland
","All the actor's gave very strong performances and kept me interested, but this 2hr+ movie left me feeling very disatisfied. There's a big twist which I won't spoil, but I figured it out a few minutes before th reveal. The twist isn't very fun, and not very mind blowing. I was ready for the film to be over after the reveal, but then it went on for another 20-25 minutes. Flashback scenes were slow paced, not particularly interesting and really took me out of the movie. I kept feeling like I was watching The Departed, because of Leo's accent I'm sure. Leo is fantasitc and is reason enough to RENT this film. I regret paying to see this in the theater. Wait for Netflix."
"DJAkin","7","1","5","20 February 2010"," Alcatraz meets Hitler
","I wanted to give this a 10 but was forced to give it a seven. This was a good movie and I was expecting it to be more of a period piece as Marty's movie's usually are. However, aside from the hat that Leo wore there was not much to this, ya know? The movie subject is interesting. I was expecting this to be some kind of Ghost movie but it was more of Alcatraz meets Titanic. Robert DeNiro has a very brief cameo as one of the prisoners in the civil war wing. There is a fair amount of violence but it's mostly where you have these flashbacks about Hitler's Germany. All in all not bad. Good cinematography. If you are expecting to see Goodfellas I would suggest renting that movie or Casino. This movie is not quite what I was expecting but it was still good,"
"hottiehawke","9","1","5","20 February 2010"," Works great as an adaptation and as a movie in general!
","I really enjoyed Shutter Island. The movie and the book! The movie follows very closely to the novel, and I was glad to see that the story wasn't changed a lot. Of course there are many details and some elements that couldn't be included, as in any movie based on a book, but the movie had the same creepy and tense feeling as the book does.<br/><br/>If you aren't familiar with the story, however, you're not going to see what most think of as a horror movie. That's not what this is, even though the commercials make it seem that way. You're going to have to think, and you're going to have to sit through a 2 hour and 20 min. movie, less than half of it being action. The good part of that, however, is that it's not some cheap and simple movie that is only there to gross you out. It has a good story, well developed characters, and gives a very disturbing look at fictional yet completely realistic events.<br/><br/>There are many jump scenes, but thankfully they aren't all ""false alarms"" that we can see in just about every movie. There is a reason for pretty much everything that happens in the movie, which is a result of a great book being made into a great movie.<br/><br/>Overall, I'm very happy with how the movie turned out. The colors and depictions of the island and scenery are great. The story flows for the most part. If you let yourself think about what is actually happening, and become involved in the plot, then you could even consider it fast paced. The acting is also very good.<br/><br/>Some people are going to think that the story and twist(s) are predictable, but even if you figure out how it's going to end, I think most would have to admit that it goes so much more in-depth than most movies made these days. So give it a try, and try to be open minded about it. It's not perfect, but no movie is. It is great in my opinion, especially compared to most all of what they're showing in the trailers for upcoming movies. After reading the book last year, I've been waiting a long time for Shutter Island to come to theaters, and it did not let me down!"

"christomacin","10","1","6","24 March 2010"," Scorsese Ode to Stanley Kubrick
","The way I see it, there are three interpretations of the film, which I will call The Doctor is Bad, The Doctor is Good, and The Doctor is God.<br/><br/>The Doctor is Bad (Teddy is sane and there really is a government conspiracy) The Doctor is Good (Teddy is insane and the Doctor is trying to give him therapy) The Doctor is God (Teddy is dead and the ""Doctor"" is trying to get him to acknowledge where he really is and what he has done in his life). <br/><br/>Let's consider the third possibility for a moment. Ben Kingsley's character was a benevolent person, and he spoke repeatedly by cure his patients with love and understanding. The ex-military Warden, too, is fighting for his soul. He offers Teddy the observation, that we are all evil, and nature itself is not full of God's love, but violence. He asks, ""The only question is, whose violence is stronger?"" This is basically a materialist, satanic world view as it is understood from a Christian perspective. I find this a possible reference to Christ's forgiveness. He gave Teddy repeated chances to admit his guilt, but his pride won't allow him to do it.<br/><br/>Teddy has to go the process all over again, and he must be turned over to ""the Warden"" (war, violence, lust for power) who gets to torture him by living through it again. Only this film seems to suggest that ""hell"" is merely being tied to the illusion of the world. He can't get past it because he won't admit he is a sinner. He will keep doing it over again in the ""real world"" (perhaps for eternity) until he repents. Auschwitz, Shutter Island, and Purgatory (?!) all have a gate and a sign outside. What if this isn't Shutter Island at all? What if the German Commandant is really Teddy? The evocative soundtrack seems to suggest much more is going on here than meets the eye on first viewing. <br/><br/>As for the Oedipus myth, we do see Greek statues in the Doctor's study during the storm, perhaps making reference to Oedipus/Teddy's search for the truth, which will only destroy him by finding it. Like Oedipus, he is ""blinded"" by the ice pick during the lobotomy.<br/><br/>I can honestly say I was pleasantly surprised by a recent film for the first time in a long time. Even though I immediately picked up on the Warden/Satan vibe, and even though I noted the Greco-Roman references, my mind just couldn't break free. It wasn't until you made the connection to purgatory/hell that it all hit me like a flash. I think even though intellectually people can ""get it"" we are so resistant to metaphysical ideas that we subconsciously discount them...at first. I didn't see what this film was, even though it was right in front of me. I needed to connect the dots. I never really pegged Scorsese much as a deep thinker. Only a few of his films have attempted deep metaphysical themes, Last Temptation, Kundun, and now Shutter Island. His films I have always found very gritty and earthy, but just as often flashy, hedonistic, and even a bit mean spirited. I do think he is a great director, but not my favorite by a long haul. I watched thinking it was a simple matter of sane/insane, but with a decided lean towards insane. <br/><br/>Scorsese in his films has rarely touched upon whatever Catholicism or religious beliefs he may hold, with the obvious exception of The Last Temptation of Christ. I mentioned Kundun before. I always wondered what attracted him to that material, as his films are very Western and usually pretty earthy. Looking back now after seeing Shutter Island, this is interesting, because of the parallels with Buddhist concepts like karma. The illusion of reality is the ultimate cause of ego, pride, what have you. This creates an endless cycles of suffering until the illusory nature of the world is broken. The other film, Last Temptation, as everyone knows was a highly unorthodox and controversial depiction of the Gospels. If the references to Greek mythology are also present in Shutter Island (as I suspect they are), then this also touches on the suffering caused by the human folly of pride from a non-Christian perspective. One thing Buddhism, Christianity and Greek Tragedy all have in common is that pride goes before the fall. All of this suggests that Scorsese's interpretation of Christianity is very different the official orthodoxy. Unlike Catholic teaching, God does not give us the chance to be saved only while we are alive. His mercy is endless, and more in keeping with Buddhism, we are given many chances in Purgatory to break the hold of worldly illusion on us. One more link to Buddhist karma for me: Teddy's friend in Cell Block C said ""Let it go!"" in reference to his dead wife/past life. Dr. Cawley speaks of a ""new way"" of treating patients/sinners. This isn't a one shot through the pearly gates or into the Lake of Fire you go. Cawley has great patience, although you could argue that the end of the film might indicate that time has run out for Teddy. I personally think his memory of coming to Shutter Island is merely wiped clean again. Not for the purpose of punishment as giving Teddy yet another chance to let go of his illusions of the world. Teddy isn't there for the purpose of punishment, though. His suffering is a consequence of his inability to let go his ego. I find this a very humane and enlightened version of Christ's forgiveness."
"avargas4","10","1","6","22 March 2010"," Ending
","I think there are several things at the very end that many people are missing, honestly the movie leaves a pretty interesting twist to confuse everyone, however there are certain aspects we all have to keep in mind.<br/><br/>During the movie, there are several transitions that occur from real events to insane events. For example, blood. Teddy experienced a lot of blood when he finds the nazi bleeding to death on the floor. At one point, his wife died from smoke in a fire, but when he first meets his wife in his delusions, then water and blood come in effect. Why? Is part of his trauma at one point being used to consider that the blood of the nazi could transform into delusions of his wife's blood. Could the narcotics be kicking in? He was traumatized, to the point of watching a little girl transformed from a stranger in a pile of dead people to soon become his daughter, once again, another effect of delusions that could be created by narcotics, especially for someone with such terrible life and experiences.<br/><br/>One of them is the lighthouse. It was the place for lobotomy, the place he got in and nothing was found, empty with the exception of the top part, where he found the doctor.<br/><br/>Now, you all remember the famous phrase about dying a hero or a monster. Deep inside he considered the option of the patient, the delusions, however he knew he was sane, he knew he was Teddy, he saw the guards walking with the tools required for the lobotomy, now, how many people realized that the movie ended with the lighthouse. Why do you think if the twist was for him to be insane, why if he was taken to a lobotomy, the lighthouse was the last scene shown in the movie? Doesn't this prove that the conspiracy stated that the lighthouse was the place of ""transforming"" the person to a state of calmed behavior? mmm...But when he went in the lighthouse, it was empty, then why when he is taken to be ""cured"", the lighthouse appears again? In other words, Teddy knew he was not coming out of the island alive, so, if you get to the point of facing your own death, would you rather die a hero or a monster? I think he decided to choose Teddy, the hero.<br/><br/>Let me know your thoughts."

","Scorsese scores again! Shutter Island is a great mystery thriller deserving even of Hitchcock, though Scrosese is a great director. IMO Decaprio has become a great actor. Was skeptical of him 12 or so years ago, but he is in many excellent movie since then. In SI you are observing point-of-view from within insanity. What you have to figure out in this movie is which person(s) are insane. While I checked the ""spoiler"" box, the outcome will NOT be spoiled here. Altered mental states make for difficult understanding especially when that POV is expertly directed. This is a favorite technique of David Lynch (Mulholland Drive prime example) but IMO, Scorsese has done it so masterfully in Shutter Island that even at the end when all the ""evidence"" is in, you will still find it difficult to believe. Depcaprio and Ruffalo are superb in this film. Methinks Scorsese and Decaprio deserve Oscars. This is a VERY excellent film."
"imdbvip","10","1","6","6 March 2010"," This movie will give you shivers.
","I am Glad to watch shutter island online at IMDbVIP. Movies that depend on turns and twists often leave audiences groaning. Too often, sudden illuminations and revelations feel convenient or rushed, bows tied round a box to keep the whole thing together. Such is not the case with Martin Scorsese's taut psychological thriller ""Shutter Island,"" a movie that keeps you guessing to the end and then -- miraculously -- makes the guessing pay off. Working with a stunning ensemble of actors, Scorsese has crafted a work that reeks of classic film-making: It takes place in 1954 and looks like it was made in 1954. From its opening shots -- our hero, sick at sea as he approaches a remote island -- the film fairly brims with existential noir anger and angst. For reasons unknown ""Shutter Island"" was moved past traditional Oscar season and into a February release slot; hopefully, it won't be forgotten come next year's campaigns. It's the sort of film that's tough to pull off, but Scorsese and company manage the trick beautifully. This movie will give you shivers."

","I saw Shutter Island yesterday.It was based on a book which I have not read, all I knew going into it was that it was directed by Martin Scorsese and was a thriller.After watching it, I can say that this is an excellent film.This film is a bit different from director Martin Scorsese's previous films, the majority of which involved the mafia and criminal activity(Mean Streets, Goodfellas, The Departed, etc).Shutter Island is a story about two field marshals who investigate the disappearance of a mental patient from the secluded ""shutter island"", a place where the most dangerous mental patients reside.One of the field marshals(played by Leonardo Di Caprio) was a World War 2 veteran who experienced a few horrors as he was there.His wife was also killed in a fire a few years back.After some investigating, him and his partner feel that there is something wrong about the practises that go on at the island, and they set out to investigate that.Shutter Island is filled with various surprising twists and suspenseful scenes. The film definitely feels much shorter than 2hrs 20min.The acting is also top notch.If you are a fan of suspense, you owe it to yourself to go check out Shutter Island."

","Without a doubt, Shutter Island is a film I've been waiting for for so such a long time. This psychological thriller will leave you breathless at the end. Hitchcock is giggling like a schoolboy from the grave.<br/><br/>I was hooked and reeled in ever-so-slowly with this story. The acting is top notch, the cinematography out of this world, the script is brilliant, and the directing is flawless. When watching any film, I am always trying to stay ahead of the story, figuring out the details, taking notice of the foreshadows, understanding payoffs are coming. Shutter Island teased me at every turn and just when I thought I knew the truth - BAM! Guess again, Bronco Billy! If you like movies like Vertigo, North By Northwest, and Psycho then you'll love Shutter Island. This is what a thriller is all about. Good show!"
"dstanmyer","8","1","6","26 February 2010"," Entertaining & fascinating thriller!
","Going into this film, I knew it would be difficult to get a true sense of how good a movie it was, seeing that I was such a big fan of the book and knew every twist and turn that was coming. I was locked into a state of trying to view it as someone who went in cold. I can say that the movie was very faithful to the book, only leaving out certain scenes in the interest of not wanting a 4 hour movie. So, while watching the film, it was hard to separate from the book and truly view it as only a film without all the back knowledge. I guess my point is that it's easier to be more critical on a film when you were such a big fan of the book and more difficult to just sit back and judge the film for what it is.<br/><br/>That being said, and after reflecting for a few days, I've come to the conclusion that the movie was largely well-done. The acting was first rate. Dicaprio rarely does a bad job and seems to be gaining skill and nuance to his characters as he ages. He played the dark & brooding character quite well. You definitely sensed he was on the verge of possible losing it. Mortimer, Kingsley, & Michelle Williams are all outstanding. I found Mark Ruffalo, who I have liked in previous roles, to be somewhat flat; though this may be more a function of his character he was supposed to play than it was of his talent.<br/><br/>The atmospheric quality to the whole movie, combined with some interesting cinematography, worked well. I seem to remember many short jagged shots intertwined with other shots (both in flashback form but also in a single scene where the camera went back and forth between characters). I think such a style lent to the schizophrenic feeling of the movie and made the viewer feel a little of the confusion & anxiety that Teddy Daniels was feeling. That was done quite well I thought. The island, partly CGI generated, felt very real and like quite a scary place to be. You definitely felt the mystery and anxiety throughout the whole film and, even though I mostly knew what was coming, felt myself tense up and sort of bites my nails at different times.<br/><br/>The story, though a bit hard to fathom in real life, hung together well and answered most all questions that would have been asked by anyone who had not read the book. I felt there were times when a viewer going in cold would be on the verge of catching on to what may be really happening. But then I thought that this was a mental hospital for the criminally insane so anything that didn't make sense could be chalked up to that. This was a top notch thriller that had the viewer guessing and ends up asking a thought-provoking question (or two). The questions offered in this movie in reference to 1950's America, mental hospitals, how we treat our mentally ill, and how human beings respond to trauma are all relevant and quite interesting. <br/><br/>Shutter Island is short of a classic though. The story worked but did have some jagged and hard to follow sequences intertwined with some forced or hokey parts that may have detracted from the final product of the film. Such an up-and-down and complex story can definitely ""work"" more easy in book form. Also, the ""reveal"" wasn't as quite as powerful as the book. Bottom line: while this won't contend for an Oscar in '11, it is a very entertaining and satisfying story with great acting in a world where the viewer can truly get lost in."

","Martin Scorsese – the man, the myth, the film-making legend – returns to the big screen with 'Shutter Island', his fifth feature film in ten years. Reuniting himself with his on-screen son Leonardo DiCaprio for a psychological thriller based upon Dennis Lehane's 2003 novel of the same name which follows US Marshall Teddy Daniels (DiCaprio) and his partner Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo) as they are sent to investigate the disappearance of a patient on Shutter Island, home to the Ashecliffe Hospital for the Criminally Insane. Scorsese and Robert Richardson (two-time Academy Award Winning Cinematographer) are, as usual, in fine form building the solemn atmosphere one brick at a time; however it is the story and the acting of the films ensemble which restrict this film from being yet another masterpiece.<br/><br/>The year is 1954. US Marshalls Teddy Daniels and Chuck Aule are sent together to the mysterious Shutter Island, home of the Ashecliffe Hospital for the Criminally Insane which houses the most deadly and unstable patients the world has to offer. There to track down the escaped patient Rachel Solando (Emily Mortimer) who has, somewhat impossibly, vanished without a trace Daniels and Chuck start to become entangled in the web of lies and the mystery surrounding the real nature and purpose of Ashecliffe. With their investigation being constantly blockaded and restricted by the Hospital's Chief Psychiatrist Dr John Cawley (Ben Kingsley), Senior Psychiatrist Dr Naehring (Max von Sydow) and the Deputy Warden (John Carroll Lynch), it seems that the patients aren't the only dangerous people within the electrified walls of this secretive Institution.<br/><br/>Directing his first psychological thriller in nearly twenty years, Scorsese shows that he still knows how to keep the audience on the edge of their seats, while covering their eyes, and cowering slowly. The tense, creepy, bleak visual atmosphere is what keeps 'Shutter Island's' narrative continually ticking over. From the location of the Wards, to the darkness of the hallways, every scene after the early establishing sequences is littered and fraught with deepening suspense and fear, reminiscent of a certain Scorsese film released in 1991. If the characters, criminals and location don't convince you that Ashecliffe is a place where you would never wish to be, then the dark, menacing and incredibly desolate visual aesthetics should, especially that of Ward C. The housing complex of the most dangerous criminals on the island, which is comparable to that of an Old London dungeon, with no lights, windows or colour of any kind, the criminals are left to rot in their own self-depreciating darkness and despair.<br/><br/>Despite the brilliant atmosphere which Scorsese and his cinematographer Richardson cook-up, the films narrative lacks the essence of a Scorsese film and a Lehane novel. At times the extended sequences seem to be dragging the film out, for the sake of dragging it out rather than extending our knowledge of the on-screen surroundings. While DiCaprio is continually on-screen for almost two hours, and during this time his performance starts to wear thin. Which is a consequence of the fact that despite the subtle and quite well refined performances by Ruffalo, Kingsley, Lynch, Levine and Williams, nobody steps forth and offers DiCaprio a supporting hand and because of this, by the end of the film it seems as if he utilizing every last acting bone in his body to complete the film.<br/><br/>It's pretty much safe to say that Martin Scorsese has not done a 'bad film' – subjective phrase - in decades (even if some will debate that he has not created a 'bad' film in his entire career, or others that his whole career has been a proliferation Hollywood and the notion of selling-out), and with this film, this principle again applies to his career. While it has its flaws, and is clearly not up to the cinematic value of 'Taxi Driver' or 'Raging Bull', 'Shutter Island' has its own visual essence that resonates throughout two hours, providing the audience –who wish to engage – with a thrilling ride down psychological lane."
"DaveDiggler","7","1","6","24 February 2010"," A World of Confusion
","Martin Scorsese has set out to make a film in a genre he's never attempted with ""Shutter Island."" As usual, the greatest director to ever live brings new life into the psychology thriller genre. ""Shutter Island"" is essential Scorsese. At the heart of the movie is Andrew Leadis. Leadis is brought to us by US Marshall, Teddy Daniels. Scorsese takes ""American Psycho"" to a whole new level of insanity by depicting the film through the eyes of a delusional man. It is an unrelenting character study and one of Scorsese's finest. One cannot review the film without talking about the second act, which means there are going to be spoilers. <br/><br/>Scorsese depicts ""Shutter Island"" through the eyes and the lens of its protagonist. Every scene, every shot is a world most people have never seen, but one that haunts Teddy Daniels. This is a film you experience. You experience what its like to be a man so full of delusions that he literally has no idea the people he's talking to might not exist. Daniels is a man obsessed with finding the man who killed his wife (played perfectly by Michelle Williams). What Daniels doesn't know is that he is looking for himself. ""Shutter Island"" does not rely on a twist ending that is supposed to shock and awe audiences. ""Shutter Island"" is told through the eyes of Daniels and we as an audiences go along for the ride. We play along as Teddy Daniels vigorously attempts to find the killer that is somewhere in Shutter Island. <br/><br/>We see how Teddy is haunted by his past through his dreams. He does everything he can to suppress those dreams, but his subconscious refuses to let go of the past that Andrew so dearly wishes never existed. Like Teddy, we suppress the fact that he is a patient there because we simply don't want to believe it to be true. We believe there is something more going on. We believe that the hospital is there to repress thoughts of its patients despite all the hints by doctors and partners and patients alike that Teddy is actually Andrew. Teddy refuses to see those hints, but we as an outsider pick up on it, and I suspect that Teddy does as well.<br/><br/>""Shutter Island"" does something that has never been done before. It takes a delusional man and shows how he exists in a world of delusions and confusion. Most films, ""American Psycho"" the most prominent, have snippets of characters going in and out of a delusional state of mind. Patrick Batemen becomes increasingly more and more delusional as the film progresses. That shows the decent into habitual delusions while ""Shutter Island"" shows the constant state of mind that Teddy Daniels is in. From the storm not actually existing to Teddy's dreams, we are completely and totally submerged into this mans mind and the maze he has created for himself. Andrew has created a persona named Teddy who is a good man who is attempting to solve the murder of his wife. Andrew at the same time creates a person for the man who actually did kill his wife... a scarred man that killed his wife in a house fire, he's a monster and that's how Andrew sees himself. Two persona's of Andrew Leadis at two different times in his life. Teddy is the good Marshall that he believed he once was. Andrew is the monster that killed his wife after she drowned their three children.<br/><br/>All that I didn't even get to the performances, which are all first rate, the score, the cinematography and the haunting tone and tension created by the set and costume designs. This is a film that takes you into the mind of a man that has gone insane. It takes you and puts you in his shoes, and surprisingly, as a sane person, you seem to think just like the man that is insane, which brings up some interesting ideas. ""Shutter Island"" is a complex and layered film that is full of ambiguity. It has haunted me and stuck with me long after seeing it."

I saw this movie in a completely full theater and not once did I see someone talking, sending text messages or doing anything but being completely enthralled with this movie. DiCaprio's and Kingsley's acting is pure perfection. This is not a feel good movie and the images are very disturbing and will stick with you. This movie is full of twists and turns.

Violent and insane patients reside there, where there is not only a presence of doctors, but of police force as well. There are 3 wards. One for males, one for females, and Ward C for the extremely dangerous and violent patients. Two US marshals (DiCaprio and Ruffalo) are hired to investigate the disappearance of a patient from ward C. Slowly they uncover a conspiracy.

","It amazes that anyone could say that Leonardo Di Caprio is a horrible actor. Maybe YOU should go to an island for the insane because that is a crazy notion. I understand everyone has a right to his/her opinion, but really? You act like we are talking about Keanu Reeves. I read the book and he portrays Teddy Daniels perfectly. How many actors are that in touch with the human condition and are able to BECOME his character they play - unfortunately there are a lot of OK actors out there. Leo is great. If he is not nominated for an Academy Award I will be shocked. Why else would one of the greatest directors make him his new muse. Once again he has performed superbly,by far one of the best actors to ever grace the screen. What film has he ever fallen short in? Basketball Diaries? The Aviator? The Departed? Revolutionary Road? Leo is a true artist a master at his craft..not to mention ""easy on the eyes."" The film will not disappoint you - in fact I think the ending makes you wonder even more than the book."

"daryl42-1","9","1","6","21 February 2010"," Bold around the edges, Scorsese paints another fine picture.
","8.9<br/><br/>Shutter Island is the first Scorsese film that I've seen in theaters. It may be hard to believe, but it's true. I would describe seeing a Scorsese film as a bold experience. Shutter Island is such an experience, but only around the corners. With that said, it's still a very good painting. Even though there are some objects in the painting that may not be as good, there are other objects that are great, and the overall tone of the painting is very good. <br/><br/>The atmosphere in the film is top-notch. The music and sounds serve this purpose very well, also. The haunting, yet beautiful strings match the also haunting, yet beautiful scenery very well. The film also uses weather to set the mood. The setting had a stormy tone, a dark and violent mood, to fit the characters on the island. The final shot of the film is one of my favorite shots out of any film, ever.<br/><br/>So far that's the overall tone, and some of the greater objects in the painting. But there are elements to the painting that are not so great. This is namely some parts of the film towards the middle that don't have much of the boldness discussed earlier. Some scenes don't come off with the same grace, and some dialogue heavy scenes don't really do a very good job of painting the whole twilight zone, psychological thriller theme. It feels a bit dry, or weak, whereas some key scenes in the film are... wet.<br/><br/>Shutter Island is a story that needs peeling. There's more to it, there's a twist. The problem is, not only is the twist poorly veiled, but it was ruined for me and some friends during the trailer. This has nothing to do with the movie, but it's worth mentioning because it affected the movie watching experience in the end. The trailer presents the plot/problem, and hints the solution to the point where you want to experience that type of film, but when you finally do, it won't be as good, because it was all ready ruined. It's like marrying a woman who lost her virginity a long time ago. Even then, the ending is great, and left some viewers with a feeling of ambiguity. When seen from that point of view, it is a very good film. When seen from the traditional perspective, the ending still delivers.<br/><br/>I greatly enjoyed Shutter Island. I loved being on the island, and I never wanted to leave. I never wanted Teddy to leave, either. It can be described almost as a lasagna. There's a lot of pasta, but those other components are so good that so me of them end up being amongst my favorite and most powerful scenes in cinema. Shutter Island will welcome you with open arms, make you feel at home. Then suddenly creep you out as you realize that it's maybe not as great a place as you initially thought it was. But you will be glad you payed a visit. And after all, Scorsese's paint strokes transform this film from mediocre to great."
"mesircow","8","1","6","21 February 2010"," Scorsese Having Fun
","I love Scorsese. In fact, who doesn't love Scorsese? The man has got to be one of the most reliable directors working in Hollywood today and is a true movie legend. The most recent work he has done with Leonardo Dicaprio, including Gangs of New York, The Aviator and The Departed, have all been standout films in the individual years that they were released. If you look further back to Taxi Driver, Raging Bull and Goodfellas; well, these are just some of the greatest films of all time. My personal Scorsese favorite is The King of Comedy. This film has such twisted, dark, black humor, and Jerry Lewis and Robert De Niro are so good as comedians with polar opposite levels of success (and sanity) that the film is a masterpiece.<br/><br/>Therefore, a new Scorsese film is a big deal to many people. Being a huge fan myself, a new Scorsese film is a big deal to me. Hearing that he had a new film coming out with the story concerning Dicaprio playing a Federal Marshal investigating a spooky asylum, my first response was excitement. However, after then hearing about the delays of Shutter Island without a decent reason (doe the GFC cop it for everything?), I became a little concerned. Then came the reviews. While they certainly weren't panning the film, there was definitely not the same enthusiasm given to Shutter Island in comparison to the majority of the director's work. I was now definitely worried. Has the master finally lost the magic after all these years? Luckily, it only took the first few minutes of Shutter Island to make me feel reassured. With ominous, creepy music playing on the soundtrack, Leo is introduced as detective Teddy Daniels by splashing water on his seasick face, being determined to ""keep it together"". Meanwhile, the ship he rides on sails through muggy, atmospheric fog, headed for the films titled destination. Already I had a huge smile on my face. Scorsese is having a blast playing with the film noir conventions. You can feel it right from the get go that he knows what he's doing and I knew just from this scene that this movie was going to be really fun to watch.<br/><br/>I think, in some ways, that's why this film was greeted with some of the lukewarm reviews that it received. When your filmography is as impressive as Scorsese's, people expect that everything you do will surpass the limits of film, comment on the human condition and discuss topical issues. I'm not saying that Shutter Island isn't deep and complex, far from it, but it is also a genre film. If you think that a director of this caliber should only be making high brow art, then this film isn't for you. However, if you want one of the masters of cinema to blow your mind with scene after scene of spookiness and suspense then strap yourself for the roller-coaster and have a nice ride.<br/><br/>That being said, despite my enjoyment for the majority of the film, I couldn't help but feel let down by the ending. Well, at least at first. Without giving anything away, a twist occurs in the plot that felt so cliché that I felt like they were ruining all the good work they had done prior to this moment. Despite this, the final scene in the film still blew me away. I may not have liked the twist but I liked the way that they followed through with it, all the way to the bitter end.<br/><br/>It wasn't until afterwards that I began to think a little bit more about the film. While watching the movie I thought I understood the plot and the twist, but maybe I was wrong. Maybe there are clues that could lead you to a different conclusion and a different interpretation of what really happened. Could it be that I was fooled? It was then that I realized that the twist was not cliché, it was just expecting me to question what I was seeing in every scene from beginning to end. I must have been too wrapped up in the enjoyment of each scene to realize it at the time. In fact, I retract what I said before, this film is high art, I was just enjoying myself too much to realize this while it was playing."
"sam-thatsmyname","9","1","6","21 February 2010"," Movie Review: Shutter Island (2010)
","If you have no idea what kind of film you'll be watching when you go and see Shutter Island, you'll be in for a treat. Set in 1954, U.S. Marshal Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his newly appointed partner Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo) are assigned to investigate the disappearance of a murderess (Emily Mortimer) who escaped from an asylum for the criminally insane on the mysterious Shutter Island. Also starring Ben Kingsley, Max von Sydow, Michelle Williams, Patricia Clarkson, Jackie Earle Haley, Ted Levine and John Carroll Lynch, Director Martin Scorsese should appeal to more than just his fans with his long awaited Thriller-Mystery hybrid.<br/><br/>As we're introduced to a boat coming through the fog to the tortured chords of the opening music, it's apparent what the rest of Shutter Island will be like. Academy Award winning Cimentographer Robert Richardson sets the melancholic and somewhat depressing mood, making sure that that this island radiates a bleak and colourless atmosphere for miles around.<br/><br/>I had confidence in all of the actor's abilities, and I wasn't let down. Leonardo DiCaprio's acting gets increasingly better as the film wears on, and Mark Ruffalo was surprisingly good for what he had to do. Mega-versatile Ben Kingsley was unique as Dr. Crawley, Max von Sydow was perfect for the aging Dr. Naehring, and Ted Levine played intimidating in his fairly brief appearance as the Warden.<br/><br/>To talk about the plot without revealing any major plot points will be a challenge, but I will do my best. When I first looked at the premise, then compared it to the runtime, I wondered how Scorsese would do it. Well, the trailer doesn't give a whole lot away. Laeta Kalogridis adapts Dennis Lehane's novel into a great screenplay, one which translated very well onto the screen. The whole of Lehane's plot was excellent, and anybody who criticises Shutter Island for being predictable has either read the book or has no idea what they are talking about, because the twist comes as a real shock.<br/><br/>Shutter Island is, I suppose, easy viewing, but requires some level of concentration to take everything in and appreciate the bigger picture. The flashbacks to Teddy fighting in World War II may seem rather pointless, as will his dreams about his deceased wife, but they are both pivotal to the puzzle, which comes together in the final 30 minutes. The 108 minutes before that will rush past.<br/><br/>Martin Scorsese, commonly associated with his beloved Gangster genre, has another go at a Horror/Thriller (although Shutter Island falls more into the latter genre), his last attempt being the 1991 remake of Cape Fear. I could see that Scorsese's inspiration for Shutter Island was definitely Hitchcock. He uses combinations of sweeping and rotating shots, close ups and, along with Cinematographer Robert Richardson, arouses fear in his use of lighting. Shutter Island only offers a few good scares, instead mostly falling into a habit of building up tension and suspense to get the heart racing.<br/><br/>If you've read that Shutter Island is slow, then read the opinions of those who think differently to gather a better understanding. Simply because there isn't the usual Scorsese profanities and violence throughout, it doesn't mean that it gets boring in parts. It seems like a lot of time is taken to establish the premise, character relationships, settings and the mood, but all of this is highly interesting as things start to get turned on their heads.<br/><br/>If you are crazy for Scorsese, there is no guarantee that Shutter Island will be your cup of tea, since it's really an opportunity for him to try a different look. Said look is that of a very well-rounded, complex, multi-layered and rather dim piece of cinema. For many, the best part will be when everything clicks in the brain, but the ending may leave some points to be cleared up and more explanation to be desired, but it's all about the interpretation."

The ending, however, is disappointing because we've seen it before. <br/><br/>The movie is set in the 1950s and takes place at Ashecliffe, an institution for the criminally insane. Ashecliffe of course sits on the remote Shutter Island. The movie never lets the audience forget when and where we are. We see chilling shots of the cliff's edge, crashing icy-cold waves and the big old buildings that make up Ashecliffe. (The beautiful old brick buildings are perfect for the institution, especially the old military fort that makes up ward C, the most dangerous ward.) Everything from the dialog to the wardrobes are perfectly dated. They really nail the era, down to the filter-less cigarettes, the antique record players, the female orderlies' starched white dress uniforms and hats, the cars and much much more. All of these things keep us planted on the island and aware of the time.<br/><br/>Along with an incredibly sound setting there is also an incredibly strong cinematic style that perfectly conveys the mood of mystery and psychosis throughout the movie. For example, the opening scene shows Teddy (Leo) and Chuck (Mario) on a small ferry headed to Shutter Island. The background is filled with a dark sky covered in looming storm clouds. The background almost looks too contrived and would be off-putting if it wasn't so visually attractive and somehow appropriate for the scene. The ferry ride is the perfect opening scene because the background is so surreal not to mention the obvious implication that things are going to get intense from the brewing storm. This sets the stage for all of the bizarre and dreamlike things to come where reality changes and our protagonist gains momentum, like a building storm, to uncover the truth behind Ashecliffe. Another great scene that subtly portrays the mood of psychosis is the cave scene where Teddy meets Dr. Rachel. There are parts in this scene where we see Rachel through the flames of a fire that's burning in the cave. I believe that the fire represents a veil through which the audience is to see and interpret this character. As the story unfolds we learn that what Dr. Rachel says is a lie, if the encounter ever really happens at all (I'm still kind of unsure but I think it's imagined). The blur of the flames that we see Rachel through shows us the blurred reality of the scene. It's very subtle, and as you see the film for the first time you never question if the encounter is really happening or if what Dr. Rachel says is the truth. There are many other great scenes and small, almost invisible details that maintain the tone, like a disappearing water glass that makes us question, just for a second, ""Did I see what I think I saw?"" We follow Leo's character every step of the way, his reality is our reality. When his reality begins to crumble it's crumbling for us too, not before. Although we may have a slight idea that he could be patient 67, we believe more that he is involved in a conspiracy and we are rooting for him to uncover it and make it out alive. That we are so sure of one reality then discover something entirely different is true is pivotal to the success of the movie. This happens because Leo is such a great actor. I was convinced every step of the way. The entire cast was great, in my opinion. A few times I thought Chuck (Mark Ruffalo) was slightly contrived, but realized later on that was part of the story. The ending isn't really a surprise ending and left me a little disappointed. There are more than enough hints along the way and foreshadowing that give us an idea of how things will end, and personally I found myself saying all along ""please don't end this way"". I would have preferred that the conspiracy was real- but that would have been a whole different story. Overall I liked the film and I'm going to recommend it to friends."

I had to try so hard not to laugh out loud... conclusion: people are to serious and cant see this masterpiece true genius..."

","A mental hospital close to Boston in 1954. OK nothing really new. Who is there? USA's most insane murderers, victims of McCarthyism, people being used for experiments by OSS? Never mind. You anyway get your usual share of dripping cellars, jump scenes (not very good) and DiCaprio as a crusader, trying to find out what is really going on.<br/><br/>Let's face it. He has his limits as an actor and here, he certainly keeps within them. Surely the turning point in the end could be surprising for those who aren't used to the usual thriller intrigue tricks, but I'm sorry to say that this is a big Scorsese failure. And for the first time, you are tempted to laugh at many wrong places."
"kako3291","8","1","7","22 February 2010"," Martin and Leo Belong Together...
","I was 50/50 about this movie when I began watching it. This is obviously a great director/lead actor duo (which is obvious in Gangs of New York, The Aviator, and The Departed), but this just didn't seem like a typical movie for either of the two. But Scorsese's creativity and talent really shines in this thriller. There are turns and twists that, even though I knew I should be anticipating some, I truly did not see coming. Leo makes his role believable and Kingsley really adds to the suspense. I could have done without Ruffalo, but he was decent, if not kind of good. If you're not into these kind of movies, I still suggest you give Shutter Island a chance. It's a great movie and definitely will be one of the best thrillers in our time. Lastly, the ending will blow you away."
"michael11391","10","1","7","21 February 2010"," One of Scorsese's best work & the best film of the year so far.
","Just saw it 30 minutes ago or so and I absolutely loved it. Martin Scorsese is one of the best and most intelligent directors of all-time and proved it once again in this, his new movie ""Shutter Island"". The movie is interesting, crazy-minded & creepy from beginning to end. Leo Dicaprio gives another Oscar-worthy performance here and it's one of his best performances of his career. The score is also Oscar-worthy. The cinematography is superb. Now, a lot of people thought coming in this was going to be a scary, horror film based on the previews. It is not, it is a psychological thriller that messes with your mind and keeps you guessing a lot. Shutter Island is an amazing achievement from Martin Scorsese who redefined the genre that Alfred Hitchcock created. Despite it's confusing, seemed forced ""twist"" ending that didn't work, Shutter Island is an instant thriller classic in my books. The movie should get nominated for Best Lead Actor Performance by Dicaprio, Cinematography & Score. Can Shutter Island not be forgotten by votersof Oscar chances for a year?"
"matreyia","9","1","7","20 February 2010"," This movie is going to be a classic.
","You know there are some movies that you have to buy to watch again and again. Whether they are slapstick craziness (like The Jerk or Dirty Rotten Scoundrels), sci-fi dopeness (like Blade Runner), or cry your eyes out dramas (like Whale Rider)...this is going on my shelf in bluray when it comes out on disc. Unfortunately, I can't say anything about the movie itself without giving it away so mum's the word. I don't even remember breathing during the whole movie because I was so sucked into the story and creepiness of it all.<br/><br/>It keeps you on edge trying to figure out what's going on. Anyways, don't listen to those fancy-pants movie critics who bash it, go see it for yourself. It's a good one."
"lotrjaz","10","1","7","20 February 2010"," An instant Classic!
","First off let me say any review I could ever possibly write could not do this film justice, so go watch it and you will find out what a masterpiece it is. <br/><br/>I went into Shutter Island expecting a great movie, I mean can you really go wrong with Scorsese and Dicaprio, well I walked out of there knowing I had seen more than a movie, I saw a piece of art one that will stay with me forever. <br/><br/>I won't get into the details of the story as I wouldn't want to spoil anything for you, but as the movie opens with a heavy fog you know you are in for a hell of a ride. Leonardo Dicaprio once again proves to us that he is one of the finest actors working today, and there is not a scene of bad acting from anyone in the movie, Ben Kingsley is excellent as the foreboding and sinister Director of the Institute and Max von Sydow is great as the German Doctor, but the real spotlight is on Leo Dicaprio and Mark Ruffalo, and they both pull off their performances with such integrity and ferocity. <br/><br/>When the Oscars role around next year, I would bet a lot of money this movie will have more than one nomination to its name. <br/><br/>A note to sensitive viewers and woman, there are some very touchy subjects and scenes, which could disturb a lot of people, so watch at your own risk.<br/><br/>10/10 is my rating for this movie, and it has easily fallen into my top ten movie list."
"Rachelle_Puckett-1","10","1","7","20 February 2010"," I am NOT crazy! Or am I?
","Every positive review that has been written here is going to be reiterated with this one. This film is what a horror/suspense film is SUPPOSED to be! I always felt that you can have all the blood/guts/spooky moments you want in a film but without a valid script/director/cast it will mean nothing and only last temporarily. This is timeless. First off, let me say after seeing this movie last night I went out today to get the book and am now in the process of reading it. As a current film student I paid particular attention to Scorsese's film style (which is superb). Although, he does the classic establish shot --> zoom in --> shoulder over shoulder combo, his cinematography makes it completely acceptable and purposeful. When we still believe that DiCaprio is Teddy, the island appears grimy/dirty/uncomfortable, but when he is Andrew it is recaptured as beautiful/serene/simplistic. The full island/set shots are exquisite and beautifully (both during the ugly views and the gorgeous views) captured. Secondly, let's move to acting. Although, I have to admit I am NOT a Mark Ruffalo fan I felt he really lucked out with being trusted with this part, because it is (in my opinion) one of the most important. Also, Ben Kingsley is just an incredible actor and I love how you never quite know what to expect from him. Is he good or is he bad? i guess I avoided DiCaprio long enough. Uhmm, he is AMAZING. No, his Boston accent ISN'T the best, BUT that being said his facial expressions, mannerisms/gestures, and character choices were superb. Nobody could have done it any better. Finally, this story really has a lot to say for our generation despite it being placed in 1954/52 (which is the perfect time period in my opinion for this story). I personally believe that it tried to teach us that we have to make a choice like the last line says, between ""dieing as a good man or living as a monster"". This is why I love these movies, they make you THINK! I mean just look at the debate going on with the FULL EXPLANATION spoiler's review of the last line. In my opinion, no one person is right and that's the beauty of cinema that we can have our own opinions and respect the suggestions of others'. All in all a first class film and a must see on the big screen for all of the elements. GO SEE IT! :)"
"dfadviento","10","1","7","19 February 2010"," Best movie of 2010 so far!
","This one will be short and sweet. The majority of people will fall into two camps. The first being those who kept up with the twists and turns and found the movie to be a truly deep, disturbing, powerful movie. The second being those who won't catch all the minor details and piece together the conclusion even at the end when it is all laid out. Unfortunately I had the displeasure of being in a theater full of the second camp. The entire movie I heard remarks such as ""but wait I don't get it"" and ""I thought he WAS a U.S. Marshall."" and then the best one at the end of the movie from the group behind me ""What?! That's it? That doesn't make any sense!"" Let's see some more people leave their reviews and give this movie the score it deserves."
"sastheking","10","1","7","19 February 2010"," This is how Hitchcock would have done it
","I'm the type of movie goer that goes into a movie expect it to be a movie of its kind. If I'm going to watch Terminator 4, I'm not expecting Shawshank Redemption, neither am I expected Terminator 2, I'm expecting a well made action flick with a solid story line. The same is true with Shutter Island. Having read the book I was not expecting a horror film, or a ""jump out of your seat"" movie, being that some of the trailers made it seem as though it might be so. Instead I expected Scorsese to try and experiment with a psychological drama, a genre he has only played with rarely, Cape Fear and Bringing Out The Dead. But instead, I got more out of it. This movie really shows off Scorsese's film knowledge. He restored 3 of Hitckcock's Films, all of which start with the letter ""S"". The movie has a sequence similar to North by Northwest, climbing the rocks, diving into the sea, and Vertigo, the staircase. The music is similar to that of Hitchcock's films. The characters are dressed like they do in the film Noir era. This was a great movie, with a great story line, great acting, and great for any film fan that loves the classic Hitchcock and Film Noir films. Again, great when you compare it to films of the same genre and of the same type of film. Is it Scorsese's's best, no, but it does not have to be. Defiantly watch this movie, and if you're a film buff then you will defiantly enjoy the movie because you will pick up on all the subtle parts."
"krishna-sriram","10","1","7","19 February 2010"," Brilliant, Disturbing, Full of Surprises
","Shutter Island is definitely one of the best movies I've seen in the past few years. And It probably is one of the best psychological thrillers out there. At first, the movie looks like the usual, clichéd detective story full of mystery and investigation, but watch out for surprises.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio is great. Probably not his very best performance, but still worthy of a few nominations or even wins. Ben Kingsley, as always, delivers a stunning performance, and should be nominated for the 2011 Golden Globes and Academy Awards in the best supporting actor category. The movie is very well directed, with no major flaws which I could notice. It is faithful to the book at the best it can be, and every element of the movie has been mastered (Hey, it's Scorsese we're talking about!). I liked the soundtrack a lot (reminds me of old school thrillers/ horror movie soundtracks) and the cinematography was really good as well.<br/><br/>I'll give this movie a 10. It was incredibly suspenseful, and I see no reason why it deserves anything less than a 9 or a 10."

I wish I knew why his wife got so ill, what made her so crazy, and what exactly he loved her for. Somehow they've got 3 children! I mean they should had have some happy family stories too. No? She couldn't got crazy just across the sudden.
As for the trick played with audience where the story goes as he was real Marshal, they opened cards too soon. I wish they played the way we suddenly find it out only at the end."
"blackmamba99971","10","1","8","1 March 2010"," Nice twisted movie
","Martin Scorcese really surprised me with this film. Having a patient who thought of himself as a state Marshall trying to find a woman who has a name much like his dead daughter. The twists and turns in this film made me think that the staff of shutter island were the patients portraying themselves as the staff. Gaurds, orderlies, nurses, even Ben Kingsley as the head director of the asylum. But what got me going was the fact that a few of DiCaprio's past memories kept clashing within himself giving away small clues which made re-think the story altogether. I loved how Martin used some very exquisite Avante Garde' memory flashbacks to the second world war or his home, being with his wife. But the fact that made me think he was the patient, was the good Doctor Rachel Solondez. When he found her in a cave who was portrayed by just a nurse. This was what done it, when she started to explain the procedures of psychotropic drugs being used on patients. And how using orbital lobotomies to sullen the insane people so they can be controlled better, how she explained this was too factual almost as if she was telling him too much in detail. And also the fact that the staff on the island tried to keep away from the caves because of the so called poison ivy or other plant life. This is pretty much a lame excuse for finding someone on a remote island. I loved this movie, what a great refreshing approach from a great director of mob films. the attention to clue details was astonishing. A must see."

","Not unlike Richard Matheson's 7 STEPS TO MIDNIGHT (itself a cross, of sorts, between SHUTTER ISLAND and THE BOURNE IDENTITY), SHUTTER ISLAND keeps one guessing. We've seen these kinds of questions dealt with throughout the history of Hollywood (and beyond), from THE CABINET OF DR. CALIGARI and BEDLAM to (sorta) CARNIVAL OF SOULS (and, hence, David Lynch's MULHOLLAND DR.) and JACOB's LADDER to ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST and TITICUT FOLLIES (the latter a documentary) to Scorcese's own BOXCAR BERTHA, TAXI DRIVER, and RAGING BULL. An uncle of mine fought in the Battle of the Bulge during World War Two and it had a lasting effect on him- as it no doubt had on any man who fought there (or anywhere else during that war) (or any other, for that matter). Both Martin Scorcese's brilliant direction and Leonardo DiCaprio's performance make SHUTTER ISLAND an important movie. See it."

","I saw this movie last night and am waiting to see it again. There is truly no other movie like this. I could come up with none.<br/><br/>Leo and Mark do a fantastic job in their roles of Teddy and Chuck, innocent bystanders in a less than innocent island. The two of them are looking for a prisoner, Rachel, who has escaped. All of the staff will not give them any answers or files that will have evidence to help the case. The longer they search for evidence, the more suspicious everyone becomes.<br/><br/>The plots constant, yet believable, twists keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time.

","I have been waiting for this movie since I read the book back in September 2008. I was very disappointed that it was pushed back from October 2009 to February.<br/><br/>The movie is suspenseful, not very scary though I did jump once. It is just creepy. It stays true to the book, which I always appreciate. I don't want to go too much into the plot, as I'm sure it would be pointless as most have already read what can be read without it being spoiled.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio gives the best performance of his career (and that is saying a lot with a resume that includes The Aviator and The Departed). He became this character and this is truly acting at its finest. I can't imagine the difficulty of pulling off what he did. If nothing else, see this movie for his performance. It is truly astounding. I really hope he is recognized next awards season.<br/><br/>Mark Ruffalo was great as Teddy's partner, Chuck. A perfect pick for him.<br/><br/>The beautiful Michelle Williams was haunting as Teddy's wife,Dolores, and she delivered a knockout performance as well.<br/><br/>Sir Ben Kingsley was wonderful.<br/><br/>If you have not read the book, watch throughout the movie for things that will help you to better understand the ending. Otherwise it is worth a second viewing to see everything you may have missed (I read the book, saw the clues and STILL want to watch it again!) This was a perfect thriller. Suspenseful and creepy right from the start but never truly horrifying. Scorsese delivers with a great cast.<br/><br/>See this movie!"
"namob-43673","5","1","9","5 May 2019"," Well acted, but extremely predictable. Scorsese´s worst, and very forgetable
","After getting asked why I had not seen this movie I decided to give it a try. Sadly it was not nearly as good as mention by friends, but still watchable and the acting really saves the movie.<br/><br/>The first 5min of the movie reminded me a bit of the start of The Shining. Same hunting music, same feeling, and similar start heading to this weird place with weird people. But I also immidately starting to notice a few things and after 7min I had already figured the movie out, and with the first flashback I could almost recite the whole movie without having seen it yet.<br/><br/>The movie is (mostly) well made, and the acting mostly superb. Sadly, and strangely, it is the directing that feels off - and since the story is very predictable, it lowers the movie quality considerably. The film also feels a little pretentious since it want to be a deep Oscars-winning-mystery-of-the-mind sort of a movie, but since the story is very easy to figure out and is not even close to original, and since the directing is not top notch (yea, I am still surprised) it does not work. The movie comes off more as a university student attempt to re-do Jacob´s Ladder.
I tried to twist the movie around in my own head, perhaps it really was true, perhaps they are trying to make him see things and think things because he really did see the truth, but nah, it did not work. IF that was the intention, I would be much more happy with the movie, but sadly I gave more thought to the movie than the movie makers did...
The movie is still worth a watch since the acting is so good, but my 5/10 is actually kind of generous. One of Scorsese´s worst, perhaps THE worst movie that genius has ever made.<br/><br/>If you want to see a similar attempt to explore the human psyche, but much better made and also very original, then I would suggest that you look at Sucker Punch which is a masterpiece, this is not."

","FOR MORE REVIEWS FEEL FREE TO VISIT http://rantsreviews4filmnuts.blogspot.com/ The dream team of Scorsese and Dicaprio deliver their most thrilling and original effort yet in the form of the physcological mindfield that is Shutter Island.<br/><br/>US Marshal Teddy Daniels is called to a remote island to investigate the disappearance of a murderess from an institute for the criminally insane. Upon arrival Daniels soon begins to realise that nothing is as it seems, nobody can be trusted and danger lurks around every corner.<br/><br/>Like Shutter Island the location, Shutter Island as a film is a rich tapestry of intrigue in which the viewer never feels safe in it's presence. Also like the island itself you never quite know what to expect from the film or even how to define it. As the story unfolds the genre you think you are watching is constantly evolving. Is it gritty film noir, closed circled crime fiction, cop drama or sensationalised pulp? Nobody knows genre better than Martin Scorsese and this very gift enables him to mess with the viewers expectations as he presents us with convention and then turns it upside down.<br/><br/>When it comes to suspense Shutter Island by far surpasses all other cinematic offerings of the past decade. From the opening scene to the rolling of the credits the viewer is bombarded with a plethora of plot twists, red herrings and interconnected sub plots as the narrative grows deeper and more intense. To discuss said narrative would merely spoil the experience for the viewer as the total unpredictability of the films plot is one of it's finest assets.<br/><br/>Dicaprio once again turns in an awards worthy turn as the films damaged protagonist Teddy Daniels. Few actors can emote so much in such a subtle manner without chewing the scenery. The pain expressed in Dicaprio's eyes will haunt you for long after the lights come up. Daniels narrative is complex but Dicaprio handles the progression of his character like the pro that he is. It is hoped that Dicaprio doesn't follow in his directors footsteps in being relegated to always being the bridesmaid for the coveted Oscar. Fingers crossed that Shutter Island remains in voters minds for the 2011 awards ceremony as Dicaprio's performance is one of the best of this or any year. Mark Ruffalo lends excellent support as Daniels partner Chuck Aule. It's definitely Ruffalo's best performance to date and one hopes that he will be offered more roles of substance after this outing. Rounding out the supporting class is the suitably intriguing Ben Kingsly as the resident head physcologist, a scene stealing Ted Levine as a suspicious warden and Michelle Williams as Daniels deceased wife. Brief cameos by Jackie Earle Haley as a patient and Patricia Clarkson as a mystery woman are masterclass acting at it's finest and enrich the quality of the picture.<br/><br/>Cinematographer Robert Richardson does a superb job of making Shutter Island the foreboding and maze of fear that it appears to be. All other departments also seem to come up trumps with the epic musical score of the picture in need of a notable mention.<br/><br/>Shutter Island is one of the most original, unsettling and thought provoking film experiences you are ever likely to get. The intricacy of the plot plays out like clockwork, showcasing film making at it's finest. One of the must sees of the year and definitely worthy of being considered a modern classic, here's hoping the Dicaprio/Scorsese partnerships continues for years to come."

Extra Information - The first half is good and the second half is okay, however this movie is one of the movie had lots of twist which there is an reason that will be revealed at the end, but second half is okay as we do not expect this twist from this movie as this story starts to get complicated and bit confusing, but it is an thriller movie, also first half, every actor did good and the dialogue was good, but second half, the performance and dialogue were okay in this movie."

","The first half of the movie always makes people nervous. It seems like a crime detection movie. Until Leonardo DiCaprio broke into the lighthouse, everything changed roles. The plot turned to be in a hurry. It turned out that everything was a kind of cooperation, a kind of illusion and a kind of lie. But what puzzled me was what happened to the ""real"" Rachel solando I met in the cave? That lighthouse seems to be doing brain surgery, and that's all true. However, Leonardo DiCaprio's last sentence is thought-provoking: ""which would be worth? To live as a monster, or to die as a good man."""

"truemythmedia","10","0","1","27 November 2019"," The Dark Side of Scorsese
","Shutter Island may not be Scorsese's magnum opus but it is certainly a refreshing change of pace for the director, showing us that he is capable of just about anything behind the camera, giving the audience an unrestrained, thrilling crime story, with just enough horror elements to leave goosebumps during the dark scenes. The social commentary on mental illness isn't just important, it's essential and still has a lot to say a decade later, and blends together perfectly with the crime story being played out. While it's not exactly scary, Shutter Island can be deeply disturbing with its subject matter, with scenes and imagery that will haunt viewers long after the end credits. The performances are top notch as we come to expect from Scorsese, DiCaprio once again transforming into his character, becoming nearly unrecognizable, just watch his facial movements when Kingsley's character reveals the big twist in the lighthouse, it's real and raw acting, solidifying Leo as one of the greats of this generation. I wholeheartedly recommend Shutter Island if you haven't seen it already, it's not for the faint of heart, but it's provocative filmmaking from a director who has always been at the top of his game."

","Melodramas set in loony bins (or which might be, like 'Last Year at Marienbad') date back as far as the silent era. So Martin Scorsese is following in distinguished footsteps bolstered by a superb cast (including Max Von Sydow, whose presence immediately evokes Bergman mind-benders like 'Hour of the Wolf') and plush production values to give us 'Shutter Island'.<br/><br/>The much-discussed 'surprise' ending won't come as such a surprise to anyone familiar (as Scorsese doubtless is) with 'The Cabinet of Dr Caligari', 'Shock Corridor' or more recent psycho-dramas like 'Don't Look Now', 'The Shining' or 'A Beautiful Mind'. It's always a relief whenever Scorsese temporarily abandons his penchant for Catholic gangsters swearing at one another hour after hour, from which this one provides an agreeable respite; although employing imagery from the Holocaust is more than a little tasteless. But nobody has ever commended Scorsese on his taste."

","Even though this film is pretty lengthy like most of his projects, I didn't even notice it ran for nearly 2 and a half hours. Leonardo DiCaprio's role as a man whose wife killed his three (our four) children, can't remember which has traumatised him which leads to mental breakdowns sometimes and seeing things that really aren't there. This film just has Martin Scorsese written all over it, different story but his same unique style. Ben Kingsley portrays a convincingly nice character, Mark Ruffalo plays his psychiatrist/U.S. marshal.
Martin Scorsese has a cameo in the film and this film is darn amazing.

","There seems to have been a consensus (there's no way I can see to search user reviews, such as for the word 'evidence', and only one 'hit' came up for the search on Google ""teddy daniels andrew laeddis anagram evidence"", so I can't be absolutely sure how strong this consensus is) that Andrew Laeddis is who the protagonist really is, in the film. Well, playing 'the devil's advocate', so to speak, and wondering what really establishes this, we can look to a number of sources, for specific evidence and basically ask where was, and what is the burden of proof, which establishes such? Although we are all aware that this has nothing to do with actual reality, in the fictional world of this movie, I dare posit, people would not want to underestimate the chances that a sinister cadre of individuals is wielding a great deal of power, and that America is, ultimately, no better than its two greatest foes of the twentieth century. I will cut straight to the chase. ""Andrew Laeddis"" was a term that first surfaced in the observable plot by the character whose identity is debated as being either ""Teddy"" ie. Edward Daniels, or Laeddis himself. Basically, come the plot's climax, viewers see a coincidence as overwhelming evidence that Teddy is a construct of the mental patient Andrew Laeddis. That coincidence being apparently that not only is ""Andrew Laeddis"" an anagram of ""Edward Daniels"" but ""Rachel Solando"" is likewise an anagram of ""Dolores Chanal"". The questions that might otherwise be at the heart of the story, or its interpretation, seemingly becomes reduced to the issue of whether or not these names actually are anagrams. However, according to the plot's other alternative, should we fail to rule this out, all that was needed was to construct an anagram of ""Dolores Chanal"", who is the deceased (according to whichever interpretation one embraces) wife of the protagonist, to replicate what would be a sole anagram-relationship between the names of Edward and Andrew. Perhaps, it's considered somewhat valid, also, that Daniels is a known name and Laeddis, if plausible, is much more akin to a construct of an author (in fact a Linkedin search for the name 'Laeddis', today, only provides one individual by the name Laeddis, ""Mr Laeddis"" with one connection, not that it affects the fictional world necessarily, but it could be considered to be something that might be viewed as contributing to the likelihood of any reality in a fictional world that has many similarities with reality, such as WWII if based on a fictional island off Massachusetts). Leading to the an interpretation looking at the validity of Laeddis the 'firebug' as related by who was plausibly Daniels being a constructed name, in the fictional world, for a person who somehow became a building manager at the apartment Daniels lived at, if he wasn't there when Daniels moved in (something the film doesn't reveal). Thus, the vision of Laeddis (played by Koteas) sitting in the chair that Dr. Naering was, if only a vision of either Teddy's or the delusional Andrew's himself, properly identifying what would be Laeddis' arson which would have been what took the life of Dolores. Why the individual who would be going by the name Andrew Laeddis would have done this is another concern. Someone somehow in league with these doctors who, of course, freely enter and exit Shutter Island, unlike the character played by Di Caprio. So, if we move on from the question 'why attempt to ensnare Teddy Daniels?', and fail to be hung up there, we can wonder about other questions, including 'If it was necessary, if so many people were involved in the deception of who would be Teddy Daniels, the war veteran, to do what is attempting to trick him at all?' meaning 'they seemingly could have just lobotomized him?' Well, that ostensibly might have to do with Dr. Cawling's views of trying to be humane, if not being genuine, being what he hopes to project to the outer world, which would include trying to convince Daniels he was insane, to imprison him before he tried to communicate with staff, which would mean, for him to be lobotomized. Therefore, it would have nothing to do, in this scenario, with whether Laeddis ;'the firebug' was there at all, that the 'clue' ostensibly left by who originally seemed to be Rachel Solando was part of what would be the ploy to convince Daniels of his own lack of sanity, or his being someone he wasn't, or at least convincing the workers of such. Going from there, Sheehan might have begun to play the role of Chuck, joining Daniels, sometime before they embarked and before the film began. Otherwise, we would have to believe Chuck was somehow intimidated, or coerced, after his disappearance into playing the role of a psychiatrist named Sheehan who had supposedly existed prior to that point. Hence, when Daniels followed a trail of Laeddis who has been sent to Ashecliffe, which led to him 'doing some checking on Ashecliffe', it would have been by intention that Daniels' was drawn there, to see if Laeddis was still there. It might also explain why someone who turned out to be as dangerous as George Noyce reportedly did was let out of Ashecliffe in the first place, meaning, that would have been done to further the involvement and curiosity of Daniels in Ashecliffe, which he ostensibly became interested in after the disappearance of a man who burned down his apartment building which killed his wife. All of this, again, would have to do with the idea that Daniels was sought after by the forces represented by the psychiatrists and leaders at Ashecliffe before Daniels had lost his wife, and before he began inquiring about Ashecliffe, of course. Leading to their connections with the Germans, with the recollections of Daniels about Nazis serving to remind viewers of who may have cause of use whatever resources they possess to neutralize who they see as a violent person, which he's oft accused of being, throughout the film (and he admits to 'murder' when involved in the killing of the German Dachau guards). That idea of his being pursued and neutralized in this manner seems, out of the two, more plausible, overall, than believing it was a coincidence which the doctors realized that Andrew Laeddis was an anagram of Edward Daniels, then utilizing that fact to create this attempt to cause Daniels to surrender by admitting he was Laeddis. Finally, according to this thread, Rachel Solando was a fabricated name, and although Daniels has a real, not imagined, encounter with her, ostensibly the-former-Dr.-Solando-patient-Rachel-Solando in the cave. Ostensibly, a co-conspirator, Solando was hoping, theoretically, to be found by the protagonist. After such, she makes points made to convince him not to be lobotomized, because the psychiatrists ostensibly want to have a record of having lobotomized as few patients as possible, since lobotomies are falling out of favor. Finally, it would be the case that whether or not lobotomized, a different story is told to the outsiders if anyone asks what happened to Daniels, the encounter in the cave also happened to illustrate how this would be done to Daniels: ""your friends colleagues and family will say, 'he has cracked, and who wouldn't after what had happened?'"""

While knowing the end gave a lot less mysterious factor, the film still manages to have me intrigued in the movie, this is how powerful the movie is.<br/><br/>Nothing is perfect, so is this Shutter Island. Towards the explanation part of the movie, some part in my mind is still quite unconvincing. The scene where Andrew Laeddis has a conversation with ""Racheal Solando"" in the cave is totally not real is kind of cheap, just make this fake, that's the easiest and effortless way to explain. Also, why not a single person accidentally speaks something they shouldn't say, there's no way that people in the entire island knows how Andrew's fictional story's every detail, let along there are military people on there, and they didn't even know him. Nevertheless, this is just a minor gripe.<br/><br/>Other than little flaws mentioned, this film is cleverly directed, executed and certainly well-acted. This is one of the if not the most rewatchable film ever. The film also shows huge resemblance to last year's awesome film ""Get Out"", and this film was made 8 years ago! This will honestly make me give""Get Out"" less credit just because the existence of this one."

The film is visually striking, all the actors' performances are nuanced near perfection, and the atmosphere is set in in the first second with ominous music. The story seems simple at first and the big twist can be seen coming long away. And there lie this movie's big brilliance - the details. There is a subtle twist inside the twist that we are seeing first, but it is the least important one. The story is not about a cop looking for a missing woman, it is about the man looking for himself. With first time a saw beautifully directed mystery thriller, but on the second time, I noticed all these subtle details that told another story. The story that was hidden under the main one and that story is much more complex. And in this sense 'Shutter Island' is very hard to talk (or write about) without giving out all the spoilers (this is something, I don't want to do). When you were shocked by the first time, then I promise you, the second time you discover something more and you will be even more thrilled.<br/><br/>'Shutter Island' is considered technically a masterful film, but it is not held in high regard as some other Scorsese pictures. And I can see why. I can say, that the first time I saw it, I was rather disappointed because of the obvious twist (that wasn't very obvious as I learned). Anyway, I'm starting to repeat myself, but what I want to say is, that the second viewing (even years later) can offer you a nice surprise, and you start to appreciate this film much more. Pay attention to the details and you witness one of the most masterful subtle psychological thrillers of all time."

","Okey so I just watched this movie, shutter Island, and I am in totall shook. I have never felt as exited, terrified, nervous and sad at the same time. I litterally have no words.<br/><br/>As I dont want to spoil anything the only thing I can say is: WATCH THIS MOVIE. It is so interesting and it really makes you reflect afterwards.

","I have to understand correctly. Finally, I do not know why any movie was seen, it's strange to be the end of the movie ... This movie must have been seen twice since the first time may not be too much attention to the movements of the actors. But when it comes to the second time, I know how great this film is and how accurate it is. And the fine notes were made ... The movie was also very clear, Andrew was completely cured. Only because he had remembered the past he would not have liked to live his life anymore. He behaved like a show that he was not cured of being executed, and even psychoanalysis fully realized Andrew's message and he was treated, but he still respected his decision and did not say anything ... I dare say that I was one of the most spectacular films I saw."

"masterofxo","9","0","1","27 June 2019"," An intelligently made film that delves deep into the Human Psyche
","While I first thought of it as being really pretentious, Shutter Island is one of the more interesting (and mind-bending) movies I've watched in my life! Period.<br/><br/>It's not really a movie per se but rather a painting, expressing the multiple shades of human psychology and how heartbreak, betrayal, and loneliness can affect a person and his behaviour towards others.
In the story, U.S. Marshall Teddy Daniels (Leonardo Dicaprio) sets out to find an escaped patient from Ashcliffe Insane Asylum on Shutter Island. He's accompanied by a colleague, Chuck Aule brilliantly played by Mark Ruffalo. Throughout the film, we are under the impression that the main guy along with rest of the staff of Ashcliffe, is behind what has conspired. Gradually, the story gets more and more complicated, each character and his motivations get even more muddled and ambiguous.
Many psychological theories can be interpreted from the character of Teddy himself. It doesn't take long for him to start seeing everyone as his enemy and part of the conspirators. He's unable to trust anyone, not even Chuck who'd become his only confidante in Ashcliffe.
Teddy aims to expose Shutter Island as an expensive, cutting-edge torture chamber. This claim is dumbfounded at the end when it's revealed that everything happening is in Teddy's imagination, who is actually Andrews and Teddy is the result of dissociative personality disorder.
In reality, Andrews had retreated to alcohol to get enough emotional detachment to blind him from the murderous insanity bubbling up within his bipolar wife. This came to a climax when Saturday, an unsuspecting Andrews arrived home from a work trip to his three drowned children and a creepy, suicidal wife (whom he promptly put out of misery)
It's further enunciated that he is suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder due to his days in the army executing the enemy forces, but at the end, due to the twist, that is also rendered unclear. However, it is clear that Andrews is indeed delusional as he had developed an imaginary world of his own in order to hide from his painful past and present life. Thus, he can also be deduced as suffering from Delusional Disorder.<br/><br/>The film excels on a technical level, as well. The shots are immaculate and the atmosphere created by the cinematographer really complements the tone of the film.<br/><br/>Overall, it's a brilliant film which is a must watch for any psychology student who wants to learn about psychological disorders beyond his/her textbooks. The average Joe may be intimidated by it initially but if he/she pays close attention, it's a rollercoaster!"

My interpretation is that there are too many ambiguities remaining ultimately to resolve Teddy as Laeddis. The film's setting is well done. Highly recommended film!"

","I thought there would be a perfect straight story line in this movie but, Eventually Everything is gonna be different . It was just awesome. The way the director took the film is fantastic. Especially , In the climax the twist was top and even i didn't even unexpected that.
After chuck seems to be missed, the reality shows up , that's where the reality starts.
The climax blown me away.
Leonardo and mark performed well.
Actually , the story line is simple. But, the director tricked in screenplay and made people wow at the climax. He maintained the suspence till climax and revealed .
There are two stories in this movie.
One is reality and two is fantasy.
But, reality is the main story in this one.
A patient who was worked as solider in WW II and in police department, regreting for not admitting his wife who suffers from mental illness had killed their children by drowning them in a river.
Even he knows his wife isn't doing well he doesn't like to admit to mental hospital. So he regretted and killed his wife for killing their children and after he was gone mentally and admitted in hospital and so he created a story in his mind that he came shutter island as officer to investigate the missing patient and he has a partner chuck.
It is like a plan of doctors to made him realise that it is not true and he is mentally affected person.
Overall, it is extraordinary movie."

"KirkFogg","10","0","1","20 May 2019"," A layer cake of twists, turns and excellent film making.
","From the opening shot of Shutter Island, you can tell it's going to be a very special film. A genre that was once extremely popular, noire style mysteries have made their way out of the spot light. It's the exact kind of well executed period film I've come to expect from director Martin Scorsese. I have seen this film four times over the last nine years, and as is the case with many ""twist"" movies, you catch something new on every single watch-through. This illustrates one of my favorite features of this film, the fact that you're distracted from what you believe will be the twist. I experienced it my first time through--you're so busy looking for what's happening that you miss what isn't. I remember thinking how laughable Mark Ruffalo's performance as a 1950's US Marshall was. ""I can't believe they picked this guy."" I remember saying to my father as we watched in the theater. Every word out of his mouth was overacted and lacked real conviction. Over the course of the movie he eased in to it a bit and became less ridiculous, but I was still annoyed by that detail--until the end of the movie. I mean, what a perfect direction choice. Ruffalo's character Dr. Sheehan isn't a Marshall, and he's certainly not an actor. He's just doing the best he can based on what was on TV and in movies at the time. I love this detail, and feel it's often overlooked. Many cinematography choices and small details they chose to include perfectly add to the unhinged dreamlike reality of Teddy's that we are being told this story through. Regarding the ending, there is a lot to unpack. When it first came out we all debated his ending sanity. Maybe he as still crazy, or maybe he just didn't want to ""live as a monster."" Over the years it's become more and more apparent that there is no room for debate; he walks to his lobotomy fully sane and aware of his past actions. His memory is a curse, and he would rather it be gone completely and lose himself all together than have to live with the violent and sordid fate of his family. This is an expertly crafted movie that I feel like is sometimes harshly judged because people fail to see that the twist they ""saw coming"" isn't really the purpose of the movie, there's something much deeper here."

","Scorsese helms a virtuous psychological thriller based on Dennis Lehane's novel of the same title. Excellent direction, screenplay, cinematography, settings, costume, special effects, score, editing and acting. The score and settings are as chilling as the characters and storyline. The entire cast delivers superlative performances. DiCaprio and Ruffalo command the screen. Their portrayals of two U.S. marshalls, Teddy Daniels and Chuck Aule compliment each other perfectly. The plot is flawless as the two marshalls attempt to solve the mystery of an escaped patient, Rachel Solando who is considered to be extremely dangerous, from an asylum for the criminally insane. The asylum is located on an island and after brief questioning the detectives seem satisfied to return to the mainland. However an impending storm forces the two to stay on the island longer than anticipated which leads to more investigating and the uncovering of a miscount in the number of patients at the asylum. There should be 67 patients. Now the genuine mystery begins. The detectives are assisted in their search for the patient with the help on Dr. Cawley, the Assistant Warden and the staff. As their investigation continues events begin to unfold that trigger Teddy's subconscious forcing him to face the reality of his past which involves a horrific incident involving his wife Dolores Chanal. The investigation takes the detectives to the darkest depths of the asylum and the island where Teddy encounters Andrew Laeddis. Teddy's focus is turned to a lighthouse just off shore after he locates Rachel. He believes sinister acts are occurring there. When he eventually reaches the lighthouse the real truth about patient 67 is revealed by Dr. Cawley. Teddy learns that Chuck isn't he who appears to be, and through the law of 4 that Rachael and Andrew are also not as they appear. The shocking truth behind Teddy's investigation is a psychological mind bender. The plot is thrilling, creepy, intense, inventive, sublime, violent, dark, ingenious and has a cathartic ending. There are many memorable scenes filled with symbolism. There are also many profound quotes in the film none better than in the last scene when Teddy asks, 'Which would be worse, to live as a monster or to die as a good man?'. That scene confused many film goers due to it's ambiguity. This viewer's opinion is the investigation is starting all over again and the revelations at the lighthouse proved to be ineffective. It may have helped that I read the novel. In fact I've read all of Lehane's novels many of which have been adapted to film. Scorsese has proven he is one of the best directors in all genre of film. To date this is his masterpiece for this genre."

This movie will surely haunt you with curiosity. Nonetheless, any movie with Leonardo DiCaprio in it is indeed worth watching. You might as well get carried away with the scenes that you too might feel to be on the same shoes as Leonardo in this movie. Not knowing what is real anymore.

","When you begin to watch this movie, it seems like a detective noir on a lonely island, yet there is more to this than meets the eye. Every detail that the pair of detectives find is in fact part of the story and not just some scrabblings of a mentally sick pacient. All of this culminates into the revelation of the century, in the lighthouse, where everything that made sense is brutally murdered and replaced by a story that couldn't have been predicted, yet so simple and effective. Beside the story, the effects are all over the place offering us the real atmosphere of a rainy forest on an island; the acting is pristine, with Ruffalo, Kingsley and DiCaprio giving some of their best perfomances. In my opinion, this is one of the best movies of his genre in the last 15 years."

He couldn't come to terms with killing his mentally ill child-murdering wife, so he made a World of Make Believe instead.<br/><br/>This gets a solid 10, I was very impressed!

"aaronlbacks","8","0","2","4 March 2018"," Paralleling Shutter Island with my canned bread anecdote
","About 7 hours ago now, a friend coaxed me into cracking open some canned bread in order to fill our appetites. The lukewarm cylinder slid out of the container, innuendoly ribbed, and this was my first sign that this would be an evening that I would not forget soon, or so I thought. This is still a Shutter Island review by the way; I just haven't gotten to why this was relevant. I finish two servings about of the loaf before I cannot stomach anymore. It has a muffin-raison bran hybrid flavor that takes the least flattering elements of both ingredients and leaves a pungent aftertaste in your mouth. I already feel sad for making it this far, but my ""pal"" brought out the peanut butter and I just had to try more. The brown bread still had an overwhelming flavor but it was smothered by the peanut butter I slathered on top and I made it through another serving with this crutch before I had to tap out. About an hour after this endeavor, the stomach pains arrived. And they became stronger and stronger as time elapsed, and my forehead grew hotter and I broke out in a mild sweat. Pal, I said, I need to get out of here. So I left and I managed to keep it down, but I was in pretty bad pain so I took an ibuprofen and some pepto bismal and that quieted her down a little bit - enough to put on the movie that this review is still currently reviewing. And at the other end, I am not sure if the bread-induced fever dream heightened the experience or what, but I really loved it. I love this movie enough to display the parallels here in my canned bread story. I played Leonardo DiCaprio here. You could say the bread was the crime committed. And you could say that my friend was Mark Ruffalo. The story I told you here already was equivalent to how the movie started out. Leo appears in his right mind as he approaches the island and begins to investigate more and finds the bread suspicious. I'm not exactly sure how it got to be here and why it is laying prostrate on the plate in front of me, slightly warm and slightly squishy, but, might I add, keeps its original form at all costs. I figure my friend is on my side here because why wouldn't he be? I consume the food, and that's when this fabricated story supposedly falls apart. In my fever dream, did I imagine this all took place so that I couldn't blame myself for seeking out this masochistic pleasure? Was my friend really even there in the first place, or did I imagine him so I could shirk responsibility off on him? I don't think I'm going insane, but who would trust the insane person to right themselves a rightful bill of health? But then again, everyone that isn't me is an observer of solely my behavior and none of my thoughts. Did society push this on me to make themselves feel more normal, make themselves feel safer about my self-harm or me being a potential threat to others? Sure I can act weird and irrational, but it was a logical conclusion to me, and I'm not sure it even happened in the first place! Did you all connect dots that were unknown to me and deduce I was abnormal? Do I continue living knowing I'm a monster? Or do I go out knowing I was the good guy? Supposedly this bread has been around since the Civil War, so maybe it was really me in that movie - that timing makes sense. Idk, all I can say for certain is that my stomach does not hurt anymore, but I have a large migraine."
"parameswaranrajendran","9","0","1","17 February 2018"," One of DiCaprio's best film till date
","Shutter Island - Leonardo DiCaprio played a complex mind problematic character in this movie which was released in 2010. It was directed by Martin Scorsese. The way he brings up the character from a cop through his delusion to the real life as a mental asylum patient is really a psychological task for our brain to understand. Although the movie is from the novel but Director Martin Scorsese will be the best in this kind of genre which are mystery & thriller."

"pedrospiess","9","0","1","4 December 2017"," It's a review about how the psychological construction of the characters is genius and essential for the plot twist
","Shutter Island and the teaching of how to do a Plot Twist<br/><br/>When I went to the cinema to watch Shutter Island, I wasn't expecting very much. To be sincere, I just decided to watch it because of Scorsese's and DiCaprio's fame. That's all: I was motivated to watch a good movie with a great plot. When the film ended, however, I remained sitting on my place for five minutes trying to understand what had happened. And it was amazing. <br/><br/>The film starts with the arrival of two sheriffs, Terry Daniels and Chuck Aule, in Shutter Island – in which a hospice is located – with a unique purpose: solve a mysterious case of a disappeared patient, Rachel Solando. It looks like the whole plot will revolve around this problem, but at some point, Terry starts to distrust the faithfulness of the hospice's principal, and then it becomes a totally different plot with a distinct mystery. Here is one of the biggest hits of Scorsese: there is an immersion in Terry's psychology, which is getting kind of crazy with his new discoveries. We can follow his drama while he goes through the island – and about it, I need to congratulate DiCaprio. <br/><br/>It is important to have in mind that, after the first day of the sheriffs in the island, the whole plot is guided by the psychological issues of the main character, and this process is so subtle that we can't know what exactly is happening on the island at all. At this point, we don't know if Terry is actually right about his distrust or if he is wrong and is getting crazy while a disappeared woman is roaming the island. <br/><br/>All Teddy's distrust starts to make some sense when Andrew Laeddis appears in the story. According to the marshal, he was guilty in the death of his wife, Dolores Chanal, and he was there at the hospice as a patient. After realizing that, Terry ignores his first function – finding Rachel Solando – and starts to go after clues that prove he's right. A scene that makes this clear for us is when Teddy and Chuck interrogate some patients and, in all interrogations, Teddy asks if the interviewee knows something about Andrew. After that, we can feel the paranoia that Teddy's mind is on. He's unique objective is to find out if the assassin of his wife is on the island. <br/><br/>The brilliance of the plot makes us travel with the main character on his problem, forgetting all about Rachel Solando and everything else; that is, we truly believe that Teddy is right and if he looks for it, he will find Andrew. Now alone, the marshal walks by the island towards the lighthouse. On the way he finds a cave where the plot changes again. There he finds a woman who affirms that she was a hospice's doctor, and her name is Rachel Solando. She explains that she was diagnosed crazy to be silenced, just because she was totally against the methods that were being used to treat the patients. After that, the only way out for Teddy is to unmask everything that the women in the cave told him. I would like to emphasize here how Scorsese got everything exactly as it is in the book that inspired him, which is Shutter Island, by Dennis Lehane. <br/><br/>When Teddy enters in the lighthouse, the magic of the plot twist happens. He doesn't find any doctor making experiments with the patients; he just finds the principal, who starts to explain to him what was happening. As I said, the acting and the plot make us believe strongly that Teddy is right on his search. However, everything changes when we discover that the marshal was actually a patient on treatment and the plot was created by the doctors, who were trying to treat him alternatively. Even if we know it is true, we don't want to believe it because everything before it was built so perfectly that it immersed everybody in his psychological issues, and that's why this film is so amazing."

The novel was a master class in deception and misdirection ; the same goes for the movie, which shuffles twists and clues with all the talent of a professional card shark. <br/><br/>""Shutter Island"" is drenched both in period atmosphere and in ""noir"" sensibility ; there is a pervasive sense of danger, insecurity, unreliability, to the point where the threat of a natural disaster almost comes as a relief. There is also a deep sadness, as befits its main subject, the various horrors associated with mental illness.<br/><br/>The acting is excellent, particularly by Leonardo DiCaprio, who lights up the screen with an incandescent performance."

It is both satisfying and shocking.<br/><br/>It is atmospheric, and the combination of the effects and music brought me to Shutter Island with terrifying effectiveness.

","Few current-day filmmakers have eclipsed the reputation of Martin Scorsese. Everything he touches seems to turn to gold. In 2010, Scorsese made his last production on film, to date attempting to strike gold yet again. With a master director at the helm paired with his frequent star collaborators, Leonardo DiCaprio, as well as a stellar cast including Mark Ruffalo, Ben Kingsley, and Michelle Williams, Shutter Island, a 1950's noir thriller seemed nearly impossible to mess up. Visually breathtaking and a wonderfully told story make Shutter Island a resurgence of the great director's prowess. <br/><br/>A promising young U.S. Marshall, Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) has been assigned to investigate the disappearance of a patient from Boston's Shutter Island Ashecliffe Hospital, a mental institution. He and his partner, Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo) are ferried in to begin the investigation. Teddy has been trying for awhile to be assigned to the island for personal reasons, so when the opportunity arose, he leaped at the chance. Soon after arriving on the island, they learn that the missing patient has killed her children drowning them in a lake one by one. The troubling information about the missing patient rivals the troubling methods Teddy learns are employed by the hospital. Many of the methods are unethical, are even illegal. The more the duo finds out about the practices at the hospital and the cryptic messages left behind by the patient that disappeared, the more unsettling their surroundings become. As the vast island encloses around them, they are soon stranded due to a hurricane raging around them as it comes to light that Teddy might be part of a bigger plan the hospital is orchestrating which begins to bring his sanity to question.<br/><br/>I can't talk about Shutter Island without first talking about the sound design. The sound soon acts as a character itself, bearing down on Teddy as he desperately struggles for truth and eventually creating the claustrophobic atmosphere that nearly kills him. The cinematography at the opening ensures that the audience will stay put until the film's conclusion and cement the belief I hold that nothing is better than actual film. There is a series near the opening of the film in which there are a series of jump cuts that are an incredible tool for establishing the rapid pace Teddy's mind is working attempting to understand the events unraveling around him. The world building in Shutter Island was incredible. No bit of detail was overlooked, from the paintings chosen to decorate the offices to the statues lining the hallway every single detail in the film is important and nothing is overlooked. The colors are amazingly vibrant, especially in the wonderfully executed flashback scenes, and seem to be influenced by Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo. The low angle shots used throughout the film are positively captivating and engaging. I'm such a sucker for well-used low angle shots. Where the film really shines is in its brilliant reveals. When we learn the key elements of Teddy's life for the first time, the audience is gifted 30 of the very best moments in cinema. I was curious to see how well Shutter Island held up since the last time I saw it in the theatre shortly after its release, and I was thrilled to learn that it has only gotten better with age."
"Kingslaay","Null","0","2","28 April 2017"," Great thriller
","This was a really enjoyable thriller and honestly it's a lot simpler than people make it out to be. <br/><br/>Leonardo's character is investigating a murder and as the film goes on the plot thickens and becomes more mysterious. He is on an island that harbors insane people in an institution. We should note that we see things from his point of view and get immersed in his world. His point of view suggests that he encounters difficult and strange people who prevent him from solving a mystery. This is very well done because we later find out that he himself is an inmate and the whole investigation is in his head that the doctors or help indulge him in an attempt to help his condition. It comes full circle in the end and we see his character trapped in an ever ending mystery. It was well done and not predictable at all because we didn't see that coming."

So when I saw the poster of ""Shutter Island"" I was already sure that I will like it. And I was right. The description of the film intrigued me even more, because hospital for the criminally insane people isn't common place in films. The story line is great. I was worrying about main character during all time I was watching this film. Acting of actors is so natural, dark and gloomy island arouses anxiety, the atmosphere is gorgeous. I felt the web of mysteries entangle the marshal. The ending shocked me as much as ""The Game"" ending, for example. I've been thinking after the movie for a long time. I can advise this brilliant film to all thriller fans."
"davispittman","10","0","2","1 April 2017"," Excellent mystery/thriller DiCaprio film
","Shutter Island (2010) is one of my absolute favorite mystery thrillers. Leonardo DiCaprio is great in the lead role. And Michelle Williams is good too, you can hardly tell she's even acting, it all just seems so natural. Ben Kingsley plays his role very well. The script is well written and it keeps you very invested the entire way through. The visuals in the film also contribute to the eerie/creepy feeling the whole movie gives the audience. This feeling is what makes you want to keep watching, this is NOT a film that anyone will be checking the time during. The movie is kind of long but you never feel like it's slow or dragging, they make every minute count. When you put the awesome visuals, impeccable dialogue, and great masterful acting all together, it makes for a great film, course when has Martin Scorsese ever disappointed? His directing is very precise and very careful. If you like scary movies, I think you'll enjoy this one, as long as you like scary movies that give you a bit of a challenge, ones that are more then just cheap slashers. On the other hand, if you just want a piece of escapist entertainment, something simple like a Friday the 13th, then try something else. I 100% suggest this film! It's just so well made in every aspect and incredibly entertaining."

","So i just saw this one , and have to say Martin Scorcese ( and Dicaprion again ) does his own here , and never out-dated style ...Brilliant many ways ! And surely more value ,what comes watching this movie several times ...Now i already think ,that maybe i see this again, and soon :D<br/><br/>But. Just few things , out-side of the main focus I was just wondering ,and this is progress .. Why it apparently ,took 65 years , to that Dachau incident ,seeing the light of day ( in main stream media )<br/><br/>What happen was that USA soldiers randomly execute some prison guards , at first glance, and given what they had witness , was pretty unsettling And whole incident was censored until vaguely mentioning ,on war history documentary ,at decades later...<br/><br/>The Scene in the movie contains prisoner trains and lots of dead bodies inside , and Americans though, that the Germans had shoot them ,and then just left to rot. But !! It was instantly clear , from the angle of fire ,that it was done by ( possibly even British ) Fighter jet. And second scene showed ,the execution of more that one or two prison guards, but the whole bunch !! <br/><br/>Well. Dachau was created 1933 - 1945 ,last camp to liberated . And those guards where young boys and others , who where transferred , only some 3 weeks earlier, before the Americans arrive<br/><br/>What comes to rest of the camp ..The piles of bodies , suggest that they all been gassed ?? Well - NO. Field units quickly examined all those bodies. It was only years later conceded, that there was nothing except Typhus epidemic going on . American had Typhus vaccine ,and knew perfectly well ,what is going on. ALL THE TIME !! Germans didn't have Typhus vaccine. They try to use pesticide Zyclon B. But lets not go to this path any further ... Because it has nothing to do with this movie.<br/><br/>Thanks"
"filipemanuelneto","9","0","1","29 December 2016"," Ambiguous and mysterious in its essence.
","In this film, two American police officers try to solve a crime that occurred in a prison insane asylum, isolated on an island full of mysteries. Directed by Scorcese, it is carried out by an excellent Leonardo DiCaprio, always impeccable in his character, deep and complex. Ben Kingsley also did a great job as the prison director. Mark Ruffalo was fine, but his character is almost erased by the brilliance of his colleagues. Max von Sydow makes a short appearance, but in an intense and striking character.<br/><br/>The script is at least intelligent and provocative. He cleverly uses period elements, makes an unexpected but well-exploited connection to the drama of the Nazi death camps, the traumas of war, and the suffering that was felt in the early psychiatric hospitals. In fact, it is not by chance that most of them still have the reputation of being haunted, whether they are ruined or still in use. The psychiatric therapies used in this period, though they seemed absolutely barbarous to us, were the best at that time and contributed greatly to the better understanding of this field of medicine. Despite this, the movie is full of mysteries, unanswered questions or answers hidden in small details. Therefore, watch closely. If you blink, you may miss something decisive to understand the movie. The ending seemed disconcerting, but it made perfect sense. Cinematography makes an excellent introduction into the movie environment, which is pure mystery and suspense. It is dark, gray, misty, directing us to all the dark secrets that the island supposedly seems to hide. The soundtrack cleverly helps, as well as the shooting scenarios and locations, meticulously thought out to fit in history and historical time.<br/><br/>A ambiguous movie full of mysteries, that never answers all our questions but requires a lot of attention and perhaps more than a visualization to understand. It certainly will not please all people but fans of DiCaprio, Scorcese and thriller movies will be very pleased with the result."

","In 1954, two U.S. Marshals – Edward ""Teddy"" Daniels and his new partner, Chuck Aule – travel to the Ashecliffe Hospital for the criminally insane on Shutter Island located in Boston Harbor. They are investigating the disappearance of patient Rachel Solando, who was incarcerated for drowning her three children. Their only clue is a cryptic note found hidden in Solando's room: ""The law of 4; who is 67?"" They arrive just before a storm hits, preventing their return to the mainland for a few days.<br/><br/>Daniels and Aule find the staff confrontational; Dr. John Cawley, the lead psychiatrist, refuses to turn over records, and they learn that Solando's doctor, Dr. Lester Sheehan, left the island on vacation immediately after Solando disappeared. Though they are given access to the hospital, they are told Ward C is off limits, while the lighthouse has already been searched. Whilst being interviewed, one patient secretly writes the word ""RUN"" in Daniels' notepad. Daniels starts to have migraine headaches from the hospital's atmosphere and experiences waking visions of his involvement in the Dachau liberation reprisals. He has disturbing dreams of his wife, Dolores Chanal, who was killed in a fire set by Andrew Laeddis, a local arsonist. In one instance Chanal tells Daniels that Solando is still on the island somewhere. The same applies to Laeddis who everyone claims was never there to begin with. Daniels later explains to Aule that locating Laeddis was an ulterior personal motive for taking the case.<br/><br/>During their investigation Daniels and Aule find that Solando has abruptly resurfaced with no explanation as to her former whereabouts or how she escaped. This prompts Daniels to break into the restricted Ward C. There he encounters George Noyce who is a patient in solitary confinement. Noyce warns Daniels that the doctors are performing questionable experiments on the patients, some of whom are taken to the lighthouse to be lobotomized. Noyce warns Daniels that everyone else on the island, including Aule, is playing an elaborate game specifically designed for Daniels. Daniels regroups with Aule and is determined to investigate the lighthouse. While climbing the cliffs toward it they become separated, and Daniels later sees what he believes to be Aule's body on the rocks below. By the time he climbs down the body has disappeared, but he finds a cave where he discovers a woman in hiding who claims to be the real Rachel Solando. She states that she is a former psychiatrist at the hospital who discovered the experiments with psychotropic medication and trans-orbital lobotomy in an attempt to develop mind control techniques. Before she could report her findings to the authorities, however, she was forcibly committed to Ashecliffe as a patient. Daniels returns to the hospital, but finds no evidence of Aule ever being there."

","To hold to narratives in your mind at once and never knowing which way the outcome will land. What a great movie to be able to keep both narratives plausible almost to the very end, and still knock it out the park with the final narrative.... Teddy knowing what his final choice really is, and choosing it in order to live with himself. <br/><br/>I loved how the director kept us thinking with the Dachau scenes that the our Marshal could just be suffering from PTSD and could still interweave the moral discussions of lobotomy versus active mental illness treatment. Loved the film, and has to be one of the best thriller movies in its genre. Up there with the likes of Memento and Usual Suspects. <br/><br/>If you like thinking movies and can watch this movie through the lens of Freudian-type psychology (i.e. dream like images representing subconscious thought) then the whole film becomes magic.

It's tone really stands tall throughout the whole movie as well, which is truly something worthy of recognition, though it does bog itself down from the start of the second half UP TO the twist ending (which I refuse to ruin, and hope nobody else does as well for ANY users on IMDb who haven't seen it yet).<br/><br/>It's not perfect, but it offers a sly, dark, nuanced detective story that can often be thoroughly engaging, and often heartbreaking in it's own right."
"barryrd","8","0","1","18 September 2016"," A story that grips and fills the viewer with doubt
","Martin Scorsese has delivered a controversial piece of dark filmmaking with the movie Shutter Island, set in Boston Harbour during the 1950's. The film holds the viewers in its grip with Leonardio DiCaprio playing a federal marshall with his subordinate Mark Ruffalo, who are investigating the disappearance of a patient (prisoner) on the island, a horrible place of infamy contrasting with its beautiful green landscape. It becomes clear that the condescending and smooth doctors played by Ben Kingsley and Max Von Sydow are conducting experiments in eugenics, something he has despised ever since his wartime experience with the Nazis. Or so it seems. Then a series of traumas and flashbacks into his personal life cast doubt on the whole plot. We witness a series of exploits, family related tragedies, a cliffhanging on Shutter Island and a visit with a mysterious woman in a cave. The trauma of a troubled man on a mission casts a heavy doubt on the entire plot and his own personal sanity. A movie well worth seeing."

Even thought you could say she deserved death, he meant it was his fault, because he knew she was mentally ill and needed help, therefore her murdering their children was his fault, and he could not live with that.<br/><br/>This is a brilliant movie, and one of the most beautifully crafted movies i have seen."

"braddugg","8","0","1","8 September 2016"," It was one hell of a shattering film for me.
","It was one hell of a shattering film for me.<br/><br/>Definitely well written and well made, above all it was supremely acted. The poise by Ben Kingsley, the vulnerability by Leonardo DiCaprio and fitting into the characters by all others. It was a job well done by all.<br/><br/>It dealt with a lot of psychological elements and effects without bloating or being preachy. Right from the word go, we have an action-packed film in words. Though there is no physical violence, there is a lot of psychological violence. The content of drama is terrific I felt. The film is surely 140 minutes but for me most of it is justified and I did not find anything that was out of place or was deliberately added. So editing takes a bow for keeping the content that is just as required.<br/><br/>The master director Martin Scorcese comes with a terrific thriller and he seems to have done away with those gangster films, he made earlier. from ""Taxi Driver"" to ""The Departed"" there were always many dark shades to characters in his films and this film is no exception. The darkest character in this film was the protagonist himself like it was in ""Taxi Driver"".<br/><br/>Some of the appreciation must go to the original novel writer Dennis Lehane for writing the novel ""Shutter Island"". This would have surely been an unputdownable book.<br/><br/>There are hallucinations, metaphors, dreams, reality and philosophy and much more embedded in this package and I loved most of it.<br/><br/>My favorite line is ""I wonder, is it better to live like a monster, or die a good man?"" from the protagonist Teddy Daniels.<br/><br/>I am surprised that this is the third film that was made from his novel and I have seen the other two too. So Dennis Lehane should be the one I should make time to read some day. I saw his other adaptations ""Gone Baby Gone"" and ""Mystic River"" and I liked both of them too.<br/><br/>This film is a 4/5 and I am afraid I may not sit through this film another time. Yet, I am going to remember this for a long time to come."
"werdnaoslek","6","0","2","22 June 2016"," My thoughts on the Scorsese psychological mind bender
","The plot twist is really, really good because it is actually unexpected. This plot twist does bear flaws the more you think about it and makes the story even more confusing to piece together. This is a great movie to dissect and think about, but I would be lying if I said that Shutter Island gets better with each watch.<br/><br/>I will give this movie credit for being very engaging, and the suspense is handled really well. There is also an abundance of weird dream sequences that were well done and didn't feel like a cheap narrative device. Like I said, this movie doesn't try to spell out everything for you, and it makes the most with its visuals to delve into Teddy Daniels' mind. There were a lot of interesting and obviously director-specific stylistic choices from Martin Scorsese that were very interesting to see, especially in the creepy dream sequences. There was a lot of restraint for the amount of special effects used in the appropriate applications, which is good to see in a genre which suffers a lot from that. There was not, however, a restraint shown for the music and the fitting time to use it. The music was not an original score and was selected by Robbie Robertson. The music selected suited the mood and the tone of the movie well and was a blend of bold, grand and haunting. The music is used in scenes that would otherwise be deemed as fine without it, like casual scenes, extreme wide shots and other scenes that made the music, or at least the specific music selected seem out of place. More held back and less in-your-face music would be subtle and add to the movie in these scenes, rather than be kind of distracting.<br/><br/>After thinking about the plot twist at the end for awhile, I found that it was a little too far fetched. I still like the plot twist and enjoyed it, but there were events in the movie that didn't coincide and went against the logic of the plot twist. The final, ambiguous shot of the movie pulls a double plot twist on you, so it's hard to know exactly what to think of the story. After pulling a double plot twist in this movie's case, ((double plot twist - noun - 1. A plot twist and then another plot twist that directly invalidates the first plot twist's logic, meaning, reasoning and/or implications - 2. A plot twist and then another consecutive plot twist that reveals more information about the story and/or character/s that goes hand in hand with the first plot twist)) it feels like a cheap way to go against the other plot twist's logic, where if something doesn't match up with one plot twist, the story can have an alternate one to use that makes sense according to that other plot twist's logic, and therefore is the seemingly correct one. Laeta Kalogridis (or whoever executed this in the movie), if you want to pull off two entire plot twists only five minutes apart from each other, you need to make sure the details in the movie supports both plot twists, not go against both to make one seem more right than the other. Also, to make the plot twist/s feel more genuine, the information given in exposition should have been more spread out over the course of the movie, and not have an overabundance of revealing all the necessary information in the last ten minutes of the movie. There should have been more clues in the movie to make the plot twist make more sense by the end, where something confusing happens that is then revealed. It's hard to go over this in depth, but there weren't enough clues to make the plot twist be as smart as it could have been. There should have been more moments in the movie to refer to that seemed out of place, for the sake of the plot twist being revealed. Instead, the reveal of the plot twist uses clues that no one would have ever been able to refer to since nothing out of the ordinary or weird was implied about these aspects of the story! The plot twist did catch me off guard, and added to my experience with the movie, but there was a lot of small details that could have been put into the movie without that much hard work, besides some careful thinking, that could have made the plot twist's reveal feel less rushed.<br/><br/>Besides the story aspect of the film, the great colors, and camera-work, stylistic choices used and performances made this movie very entertaining to watch. I enjoyed Shutter Island for what it was, and this movie did a good job of at least engaging me in the story. The suspense was, again, done very well, and there were a lot of thrilling moments of this movie. After all the problems I discussed for this movie, my biggest is that there isn't a whole lot of rewatchability to this film. I feel like I would watch it again for fun in around a year, or maybe even a couple months from now. The first time you watch this movie will no doubt be the most enjoyable. Watching this again, I could imagine picking up on a few more errors than I would have encountered for the first viewing, and feeling a little more dissatisfied.<br/><br/>+ Good suspense - Music used inappropriately at times + Very engaging - Some hiccups with the story arc + Good premise - Rare occasion where a movie needed more foreshadowing + Performances were great - Not much rewatchability + Unexpected plot twist 6.2/10"

"heisenberg12","7","0","3","8 June 2016"," Sleeper hit
","When this movie came out, I didn't hear much about it. It sort of fell under the radar of top movies of 2010, despite having DiCaprio in it and Scorsese directing it. I'm pretty sure this had to do with somewhat of a marketing problem; with both top talents coming off the Departed, and Scorsese so stereotyped for his crime dramas, what is he doing making a psychological mystery drama? It just didn't add up on paper, and critics didn't laud it like they do with most of his movies (it only has a 63 rating on metascore).<br/><br/>So after a recommendation from somebody on IMDb to watch this movie, checking it and seeing it was in the top 250, and finally having a little spare time to catch up on some movies I've missed, I decided to give it a try and liked it.<br/><br/>There is so much to talk about, but to keep it simple, this is a movie for anyone who likes to think and enjoys being challenged when watching a film. In other words, Nolan fans will probably love this film. In fact, once it ended I could have sworn this was a Nolan movie. But, with that being said, I actually think Scorsese handles it better than Nolan would have. Scorcese has a more attentiveness to detail and is a true master at filmmaking. Although this is nowhere near his ordinary genre releases, he still has the master hand at nuance and his vision comes in handy for a film that might be less likable at the hands of a lesser class of director.<br/><br/>The thing that I really liked about this movie is that it showed its hand early on. Anyone paying attention and with a basic intelligence will know within the first fifteen minutes, or at least suspect one of the big twists. But that's what I liked; because Scorcese decided not to hide it early on, it isn't actually a twist. He lets the viewer know early on, but the way he unveils what you are expecting with little hints and nuances here and there until it delves more and more into what you are expecting until finally it is as clear as night and day is an entertaining journey. This is so much so that you know there has to be more to it.<br/><br/>Yet, he doesn't rely heavily on trickery; he is not trying to confuse the viewer. In fact, he is respecting their intelligence. He knows that they know, but there is still so much more to the story and so many more themes to be pondered, mentioned, and discussed, that knowing the reveal early on is just part of the perplexing puzzle. Now, he challenges the viewer in other ways, with themes such as medical ethics and psychological defense mechanisms. <br/><br/>I also found a powerful theme being that for anyone with any sort of psychological illness, the implied key to healing is to ""face"" reality, not run from it. The character must first admit the truth before they can make any progress and cope with it. <br/><br/>The most interesting part of the story and scene for me was the flashback to when he was a marshal and came home to his wife because this was the first flashback that was real and explained the story. Here, we see the reality of what really happened so we finally know after all those twisted delusions that you're never quite sure how real they are, and suspect they might not be. There were so many layers on layers in this film. <br/><br/>It is mesmerizing, well acted, and has several outstanding qualities, despite a few flaws. However, it won't be for everyone. <br/><br/>This is a film that will specifically be enjoyed by people who really like psychological thrillers, mysteries that make you think, and movies that are unique and different. I recommend this as an overall entertaining movie. If you like this, you'll also like Identity, The Game, Memento, and Inception."

","I've re-watched this movie and this time i was focusing on details given I had already known the ending. First of all how great is that fake Rachel played by the nurse? She was asked by Dr. John Cawley to play the role and when Laeddis treated her like a real patient and invented a story about a Communist subversive, even though she paused and share an eye contact with Cawley, she just improvised and did it splendidly. The eye contact is just one of many other clues we could've missed. Throughout the entire movie there are so many clues that Scorsese puts in some of which are other's defensive measure, like this one : when Leaddis was interviewing that beautiful nurse in the cafeteria, she had this syringe on the table. And before, Leaddis's reaction against that patient , he was angry and made an hypothesis about wife,kids, besides he knew exact way to provoked this patient. I strongly recommend you to re-watch this film but this time try not to focus on DiCaprio performance but other people's reaction. Finally, in the morning after Leaddis was lucid, again. This time Dr. John Cawley was so convinced that he was cured. But when he saw Dr. Sheehan shaking his head. Dr. Sheehan was disappointed too ""we gotta get off this rock, Chuck. Get back to the mainland..."". Here's the catch ""you know this place makes me wonder...which would be worse? To live as a monster or to die as a good man?""

","I got a link to Shutter Island (SI) via a review of the movie Lazarus Project, which was said to have similarities to SI. I agree with that from the point of the setting - the both movies (at least partly) are set in psycho clinics. However, the main idea of Shutter Island is close to Machinist (M).<br/><br/>In both movies (SI and M), the protagonist is someone who committed a sin. The sin is generated by taking the life of a human being. In the Machinist, the protagonist, Trevor, hit a little boy with his car and left him, without helping; In SI it's Teddy, who shot his mentally ill wife. Afterwards, as a payment of the sin, the both of them are hit by negative karma, which is reaching them in their present lives.<br/><br/>However, there are significant differences in these stories too.<br/><br/>The protagonist in the Machinist is the only one who pays the spiritual debt. Trevor is a very smart guy and he has been able to hide his crime from the society so that nobody knows about it.<br/><br/>In SI both Teddy and the society are guilty in his family's tragedy and they all pay for that. The sin of the society is not obvious. In fact, the society itself is blaming Teddy for the crime, avoiding to take direct responsibility for its own guilt. The society knew about the mental problems of Teddy's wife. Teddy, actually, has been very busy serving the society at the best of his abilities - he had a very stressful job. <br/><br/>The negative karma is following the society and it is supposed to allocate enormous resources to keep Teddy in an isolated psycho clinic and to improve his mental condition.<br/><br/>Accepting its sin would bring the society to a true cooperation with Teddy and his own identity. Denying the sin is only prolonging a game between them.<br/><br/>Excellent movie!"

A storm leaves them trapped there, and their suspicions grow over the institution and its intimidating chief, Dr. Cawley (Kingsley).<br/><br/>Despite running to well over two hours, it's a truly absorbing experience. The tense direction holds your attention, as do the converging mysteries. Alongside the ""present"" (1954) threat in the Ashecliffe Hospital for the Criminally Insane, Teddy has migraine-induced flashbacks to his murdered wife (Williams) and his role in the Dachau liberation reprisals.<br/><br/>In a terrifying game of cat and mouse, Scorsese directs brilliantly the claustrophobic action, with Max von Sydow as a terrifying sidekick to Dr. Cawley.<br/><br/>The story is as ingenious as it is heartbreaking.

","I have seen the film ""Shutter Island"" with Leonardo DiCaprio and Mark Ruffalo in main roles. The director of the film is Martin Scorsese. It is a psychological thriller.<br/><br/>The atmosphere of mystery wraps a spectator from the first minute. According to the plot, Edward Daniels and Chuck Aule are two U.S.Marshals and they come to an island. There is a prison for mental patients. Their purpose is to inspect the conditions of patients living. Besides, they want to find out if the patients suffer from some medical experiments. Gradually, Edward begins to hurt from headaches, dreams and awful visions. He hallucinates that he had been here before, but he cant understand everything.

In my opinion, this film is worth seeing, but it is not for the wide circle of spectators. I would recommend ""Shutter Island"" for those, who are interested in psychology of human relationships. I hope, they will appreciate this masterpiece of Martin Scorsese. As for me, I enjoyed actors' playing.

"Christopher_Reid","7","0","1","21 March 2015"," Good acting, great build-up but disappointing
","It's hard to write a review for a movie like this without spoiling it. My main frustrations with Shutter Island have to do with the eventual explanations for what is actually going on. It's obvious with a movie like this that there'll be twists and surprises, possibly betrayals, re-interpretations, changed meanings of scenes. I guess what's important is that people care - if people are talking about it, they must have been engaged by the story, the acting, directing, music and dialogue.<br/><br/>The plot is very reminiscent of The Wicker Man. I began to think I was watching a remake. So then I felt I knew exactly where the movie was going. Nevertheless, as a suspenseful thriller it was working very well. It was getting late but I ended up watching the whole rest of the movie. You feel that DiCaprio's character is on the verge of uncovering something, the bunny-hole continues to get deeper. You want him to prevail and confront whatever evil there might be.<br/><br/>All the people on this island are acting very suspiciously from the beginning. We wonder whether that means something is up or if there's a simpler explanation. Maybe they're all just tense because of the situation - a prisoner (or ""patient"") has escaped and gone missing. But the clues don't add up - there aren't any witnesses and the detectives are having difficulty getting the information they require. What's being hidden from them? Are the sinister rumours about the island true? What's really going on in the secret places they can't get to or don't even know about?<br/><br/>I found the ending cheap and ambiguous in a frustrating way. You trust a movie like this, you go for the ride trusting it will come together at the end. It's fascinating at least as a journey with Leonardo's tortured main character. We empathise with him and his frustrations, his anger. He has painful memories, unfinished business. We don't expect everything to be answered, but we do expect things to make sense, to be there for a reason. I can't stand murder-mysteries where every character acts like they might have done it and then randomly one of them was behind it the whole time. Like a Scooby-Doo episode. Shutter Island feels a bit like that.<br/><br/>It's clear the people on the island are not very smart or responsible. There are so many things that don't make sense in retrospect. The only interpretation that works for me would require more resolution or clearness at the end. Some follow-up. As it is, I feel cheated. A great idea for a story, well-made, ruined by the ending. The conclusion they use could work but then a lot of characters should have been acting very differently. It's convenient and feels like a last minute decision. It leaves a bad taste as Spielberg's War of the Worlds did (with its very rushed and anti- climactic ending).<br/><br/>I liked the atmosphere and the build-up a lot. Maybe there's more detail than I realised. But the more I think about it, the more holes I notice. Dumb, unnecessary holes. Huge gaps in logic. There is so little compassion. I was left disliking most of the characters. They could have made things so much simpler for themselves. Compare that to 12 Monkeys which had a completely unexpected ending for me. I sat there thinking for 10 minutes about it. It changed everything and made everything simpler. It fitted perfectly. I wanted to watch it again. Not to mention the spine-tingling twists in classic movies like The Usual Suspects and The Sixth Sense. With Shutter Island, I enjoyed the first 7/8ths but disliked the ending and don't really want to see it again."

In this story experts in that camp wanted to make teddy insane himself by doing various things.Then they can do all the things they want because it's not a murderer coz society thinks they are really insane as they behave like mad.They make people mind for their cruel aspects.This may be happening somewhere even in this moment.If this is not the story you will say 1st one , so why they wanted to bring that patient to an island in far away ?????"

","A 'GOOD' psychological thriller succeeds when you never see whats coming, but a 'GREAT' psychological thriller achieves its master feat is when you are left jaw-dropped and baffled even after you saw what was coming but you were hit by it when you least expected it. Usually thriller movies like Shutter Island have a really tight script and there is no creative freedom or much room for improvs or re-writes especially when its based on a solid source material - as most of the psy-thrillers are. So the filmmaker and the crew are slaves to a pre-ordained script, oops, the great Monsieur Truffaut would not have liked the sound of that as he believed in the naturalism of movies, that's where real life comes from and letting things flow. But then again there is Martin Scorsese way of doing it, and that is visualizing a script in the best possible manner by doing full justice to it. He is a true master of creating tension and showcasing the character dynamic, he added a new dimension to psychological thrillers with his innovative yet inspired ideas and he kept coming back in each decade with his freshness.<br/><br/>Since, the turn of the Century thrillers were taken to a whole new level with the entry of the likes of Takashi Miike,the Alfonso Cuaron ,Park Chan Wook, proving how the visual, the color scheme and the photography can add so much to the anticipation and tension. After all those decades Scorsese stayed young, at least his mind did, his ideas did. He gave the world, one of the most popular psychological thrillers of modern times - The Shutter Island, which is a brilliant adaptation of Dennis Lehane's novel of the same name. With a unique and intimidating narrative style, a grey-ish photography and most importantly stunning performances, an absolutely deceptive screenplay with an insane plot twist, Shutter Island had the audiences gutted as those credits were rolling in the end. Now, here in this article we take a look at seven essential psychological thrillers, since the turn of the Century, which are essentially movies like Shutter Island, with an unanticipated plot twist or if you did anticipate it, it hit you hard when it did ! <br/><br/>Read more here.... http://www.cinemaniac.in/2015/01/movies-like-shutter-island.html"
"dfa120374","8","0","3","19 January 2015"," A Classic From Martin Scorsese
","U.S. marshal Teddy Daniels is assigned to investigate the disappearance of a patient from Ashecliffe Hospital on Shutter Island (a place he's been pushing to investigate due to personal reasons). Before long, however, Daniels starts to doubt the reasons why he was given the assignment as he starts to piece together a seemingly twisted plot by hospital doctors, headed by Dr. Cawley. Daniels' investigation soon brings about a promising lead, but Cawley refuses access to records he suspects would break the case open. Daniels soon starts to have vivid hallucinations & dreams which start to question his sanity and the puzzling, improbable clues multiply, and soon he begins to doubt everything - his memory, his partner, even his own sanity.<br/><br/>If only all psychological thrillers were as good as Shutter Island we'd be in for a treat. This is an all-round great film...well written, great cast, excellent suspense with fantastic atmosphere. It's a very dark & moody film with a really good story that slowly unfolds nicely as it goes along.<br/><br/>The setting of a mental institution is perfect for a movie of this style as well (and is a favourite of mine) because when done right, you will be hard pushed to find a more darker, creepier setting. It IS a complicated story, however, and you do need to pay attention right from the off with no distractions i.e. no kids making noise or wife continuously asking questions.<br/><br/>The movie may take a couple of watches to see things that you possibly missed, and honestly if you do miss anything, make sure you re-watch them because when you understand what is going on, it will make it that much better, believe me. The ending is the clincher, though, and it's here that the whole movie comes together perfectly.<br/><br/>Shutter Island is definitely one of those ""must see"" films, and if you've not seen it then shame on you because you're missing a real gem."
"williampsamuel","9","0","3","15 January 2015"," An mind bending, deeply atmospheric thriller
","Shutter Island is as tense, frightening, and complex a movie as I've seen in some time. Paranoid and mind-bending are phrases it brings to mind. It thrills, it chills, it purposely confuses, and its looks deep into the human mind. I would expect nothing less from director Martin Scorsese, famous for his gangster and true crime films.<br/><br/>The Story follows US Marshall Teddy Daniels (Leonardo Decaprio) who's come to Shutter Island to investigate the escape of a dangerous patient from the island's high security mental institution. But he and his partner soon have reason to believe that the people in charge are hiding something. And Daniels has reasons of his own for wanting to come here, reasons that could prevent him from leaving. As the agents dig deeper, each revelation brings new questions, and the sense of dread becomes more palpable, leading to an incredible finale.<br/><br/>The true genius of Shutter Island is the way it protects itself from those who would try to figure it out. It anticipates the intelligent viewer, and puts up false flags and red herrings to mislead you. The better you are at seeing through deception and facades, the sooner you begin to appreciate the scale of the conspiracy at work, but without understanding its nature. Of course, if you're used to mindless shoot 'em ups and idiot plot romantic comedies, then you'll be completely lost.<br/><br/>But even if you're well versed in mystery and conspiracy films, Shutter Island never lets you believe that you've completely figured it out. It contains revelations that contradict, or at least seem to contradict, each other, and some that you simply will not believe when they're given. And it creates contestant doubt in your mind, and Daniels's about who's in on it, and who can be trusted. At times you simply don't know who or what to believe. Plus there are dreams and visions that simply will not make sense until all is explained at the end. It's somewhat reminiscent of Inception, which also featured Decaprio in a similar role.<br/><br/>And the acting is fully on par with the screenplay. The actors playing the doctors, the guards, and the patients perfectly portray characters who are themselves putting on an act. They give an air of knowing more than they're saying, but without being too obvious about it. If you don't know what you're looking for, it might be mistaken for bad acting. Even better is Decaprio, in what might be his best performance since Titanic. As Daniels he is intense, driven, haunted by events in his past, and more troubled than he knows. Through the course of the movie he conveys anger, suspicion, fear, desperation, self doubt, resolve, and more, and gets each of them down pat.<br/><br/>Plus it goes without saying that this is a scary movie. Like I said before, it gets pretty paranoid, with dark conspiracies hinted at and everyone a suspect. Then there's the fact that he's on an island with a bunch of violent mental patients, who pose a more immediate physical danger. Add to this the imposing prison/hospital, the darkened corridors of the Civil War fort, and a powerful, drenching storm that cuts the island off from any contact with the outside world, and you've got all the ingredients of a classic horror film. This is definitely not a movie for small children or the faint of heart.<br/><br/>If you enjoy horror, mystery, or complex thrillers in general, see Shutter Island. Hats off to Mr. Scorsese for another job well done."

","The film is a masterpiece from Martin Scorsese. It completely blew me away. It is one of those movies, that are dark, witty, ferocious and ultimately satisfying. Leonardo DiCaprio shines in the cold-blooded physiological thriller. True action-lovers may be dissatisfied with the pacing, but this movie is still worth the watch. Although, second viewing would be least likely once the plot is uncovered, but one time view is enough to praise the narrative and its characters.

"ryklinker","8","0","1","18 December 2014"," A Federal Marshal and his new partner travel to a psychiatric hospital on an island in search of a missing patient
","Federal Marshal Teddy Daniels and his new partner Chuck Aule have been given a new case. A woman has disappeared from a hospital for the criminally insane. When he and his partner arrive, they meet the head doctor, and they see the former patient's room. After noticing multiple inconsistencies, and the nurses and guards refuse to allow Daniels to see certain information about the patients, suspicion arises. As he tries to investigate further, Daniels experiences multiple flashbacks, both to his World War II encounter while liberating a concentration camp and his late wife. As the story continues, more and more questions arise, and the answers will be hard to find. <br/><br/>When I first saw the trailers and posters for this film, I thought it was a horror movie. It takes place mostly on a mysterious island, there is a mental hospital, and the lone still of a frail patient putting a finger to her mouth were enough to create this preconception. I have never been a huge fan of the horror movie genre. I can appreciate a film that incorporates shocking images to add to the story, but I feel like many horror flicks are simply made with the sole purpose of making its viewers wet their pants, Contrary to my previous thought, this movie is in fact not necessarily a horror movie. It may qualify as one to some people, but I found it to be more of a psychological thriller. Also, a twist ending, when executed properly, can earn my respect any day. I have found that the duo between Leonardo DiCaprio and director Martin Scorsese has produced many of our modern classics. Usually associated with the gangster sub-genre, Scorsese wanted to create a film that incorporated some of his favorite aspects of many thriller genre movies. The story does a fantastic job of portraying the human mind's wild nature, and how it can change how we see the world. Leonardo DiCaprio does a great job of showcasing the emotional aspects of his character, Sir Ben Kingsley does a fine job of creating a character that is both trustworthy and suspicious, and Mark Ruffalo's character also makes the audience unsure of what he is thinking. Though this film was not recognized by the Academy, I have found this to be one of my favorite thriller movies, and favorite horror-type film as well. Now I must warn you, this is a rated R film, and it is deservedly so. The violence and graphic images are pretty intense. That's my warning, and I hope that you take that into account before seeing this film. <br/><br/>While I see that it is necessary to show the intense images in order to understand Teddy's experiences and how the other characters act, they did not quite sit right in my stomach.<br/><br/>www.sportsandcelluloid.blogspot.com"

This film is filled with suspense and gives your brain some exercise at the same time - a combination that is quite enjoyable in my opinion. It makes you question your own judgments of the portrayed events, think back on what you might have missed or misunderstood, all while a dark, scary scene plays out keeping you on the edge of your seat.

","Martin Scorsese has always charmed with his style. Although his crime films are way too bland for me, his experimental works are in my favorites list.<br/><br/>Shutter Island is terrific: the story, the performances, the cast, the thrills and what-not. But I will focus on the two main aspects: music & cinematography. Every budding film-maker must go through this film first for the use of music here is what sets it apart from other films in the genre. I sat up on my chair every time Robbie Robertson sampled old classics in the score. The cinematography manages to capture out attention and throw it on screen. That was enough for me to be enthralled.<br/><br/>The photography is beautiful. Special nod for art department. The story is a bit complex and you might want to re-watch it to understand completely.<br/><br/>BOTTOM LINE: Highly Recommended!<br/><br/>Can be watched with a typical Indian family? NO"
"dom-lerose-8","Null","0","4","24 June 2014"," Martin Scorsese directs his most unique and suspenseful film in 'Shutter Island.'
","Martin Scorsese has been one of cinema's most iconic figures, delivering classic films that have his name written all over them. he has bis own style. In his film 'Shutter Island' based on the novel by Dennis Lehane, we see Scorsese direct a very bizarre and suspenseful film for his type of film making. Leonardo Dicaprio gives one of his best performances as U.S. Marshal Teddy Daniels. Teddy is a WW II veteran who is haunted from his past, and has a deceased family that still stick with him in his blackened soul. He and his partner come to an island off the cost of Boston that is reserved primarily for an insane asylum for the criminally ill. The patients are mostly violent murderers. Teddy and his partner are tracking down a missing patient who mysteriously escaped and could be anywhere. The film gives shocking results and suspenseful situations in the dark insane asylum with many wacky people. Scorsese does an amazing job adding terror and fear to the audience by creating intense scenes that make the dark and dirty island realistic. Scorsese hasn't done a film this unique and dark in his career, and still sticks with his love of crime dramas but adds darkness and mystery to this intense masterpiece. The adapted screenplay is written perfectly by Laeta Kalogridis who puts the true mystery behind this complex story and leaves enough work for Scorsese to turn the films suspense into a visual masterpiece. The character development and rich language are compiled beautifully as well. 'Shutter island' has perfect cinematic texture that will leave you hungry for more, and doesn't leave any unanswered questions which I was deeply worried about. The acting performance by Leonardo Dicaprio is so intense and powerful. Leo does great facial expressions and screams and cries his head off in scenes that will leave you speechless. Martin Scorsese has always been one of the most influential filmmakers cinema has ever scene, but now he's proving he can do suspense better than Hitchcock, and create cinematic gems that will trick you and will hit you like a hurricane off the coast of an island for the criminally insane."

","As this psychological thriller opens; we see protagonist US Marshall Teddy Daniels being sick as the boat he is aboard travels to Shutter Island; home to the Ashecliffe Hospital for the criminally insane. One of the patients; Rachel Solando, a woman who drowned her three children, has disappeared quite a mystery as she was meant to be locked in her room at the time. Daniels and his partner Chuck Aule set about interviewing staff and patients and soon Daniels is convinced that there is more to Shutter Island than meets the eye. It turns out Daniels has an ulterior motive for visiting the island; he believes that the man responsible for killing his wife is incarcerated there but his name appears on none of the patient lists something he sees as further evidence of something wrong going on. The more he searches the more convinced he is and starts to believe that he won't be allowed to leave the island because of what he has discovered. We also see, in flashbacks, how Daniels has been affected by his experiences in the war; most notably by what he saw at the liberation of Dachau concentration camp.<br/><br/>Going into this I knew there were some surprises to be revealed but had no idea what they would be; and that is the best way to watch the film for the first time. The opening premise of a prisoner escaping from a locked room is interesting but not as interesting as trying to figure out what is actually going on is the story as first explained? Is there a dark secret on the island? Is our protagonist gradually going insane or is it something else? Director Martin Scorsese does a fine job keeping the tension high and keeping us guessing what is really happening until the final scene and even then some people will be debating what really happened. The cast, which includes several well-known actors, does a great job; this is especially true of Leonardo DiCaprio who plays our protagonist; we certainly believe his character's increasing paranoia but as somebody once said, 'just because you are paranoid doesn't mean they aren't out to get you'. Overall I found this to be a taut thriller that kept me guessing to the end I'd certainly recommend it."

","This is a very interesting and mind bending film. I won't spoil the end in this review, so I will mention the details in a very general way.<br/><br/>I think I probably liked this film a little bit less than most people. But only a little. I thought it was an intriguing ride, but the twist kind can be predicted. If you look at this film knowing there's a twist, I think there are many clues that really help you figure it out before it's revealed. But the clues are what makes this movie fun. It's great trying to pay attention to little details that hint at what's going on, like the appearing and disappearing glass of water. It also includes some visual great flashbacks and dream sequences that I loved. I could have watched a whole movie in the style of the first dream that Teddy has of his wife. Really appealing to the eye.<br/><br/>As I said, I think the twist is a little bit predictable, but it's still fun to figure out. I also felt almost as if the 2nd half of the film was a bit less interesting as the first part. I liked the idea of something strange going on and the character trying to figure it all out, but once we start figuring bigger things out, it became less captivating. Maybe i'm the kind of person that prefers subtle hints to things and more things left to the imagination. <br/><br/>There are essentially two main interpretations of the ending, but in my eyes, the one that is being told to be true is the correct one. I can see why people would disagree, but too much evidence leans towards the other side. I think more room for speculation would have done this film good.<br/><br/>It feels different than a usual Scorsese movie, and it's not his best, but it's an entertaining and thrilling film."
"lasttimeisaw","8","0","2","11 May 2014"," A sterling genre thriller needs multiple viewing
","Scorsese and DiCaprio's fourth collaboration, SHUTTER ISLAND is an on-the-edge-of-the-seat nail-biter, a period thriller situates at the titular island near Boston in 1954, a patient mysteriously disappears from the mental hospital on the island, draws the investigation of US marshal Teddy Daniels (DiCaprio) and his subordinate Chuck Aule (Ruffalo). But on the sly Teddy volunteers the task under a more personal motivation, he is after a pyromania who is responsible for the killing of his wife Dolores (Williams). <br/><br/>But little does he know, what he experiences will turn his whole sanity upside-down, and blur the dichotomy between realness and illusion, in doing so, it also challenges audience's judgment of taking sides, a brainwashing hoax or an unorthodox therapeutic maneuver, and the ending testifies there is a right answer""Is it better to live as a monster or die as a good man?"". Teddy is obsessed with his conviction that the island is surreptitiously doing immoral experiments on their patients, to reform and manipulate their minds, due to his own military history during WWII and the trauma caused by Dolores' death, it seems rational enough for us to open a sympathetic ear for his pursuit, yet Scorsese deployed many evident glitches along the suspenseful narrative to suggest otherwise (with transitory editing tricks). When a hurricane sweeps the island and leaves no one exit the island, the film goes into a murky maze to screw up Teddy's mentality, the dream episodes where Dolores recurring as an ashen ghost and the horrific massacre in the WWII front comes to fore with indelible gore and grimness; the return of the missing patient Rachel (Mortimer) who is a murderess killed her three children, and the ominous lighthouse where the truth is insidiously hidden, not to mention the unusually odd atmosphere between Teddy and the rest of the people (the staff and patients), all indicate that it is too big a scheme to be covered up by a single conspiracy theory. <br/><br/>The uniformly engaging DiCaprio brings about consistent effort to lead or mislead us into his consciousness as a heroic marshal in order to divulge some unscrupulous activities, counterbalances the interventions of the film's not-too-subtle indications, his committed endeavor is the driving force and all the supporting group is equally strong, Clarkson and Earle Haley leave great impact in their short appearance as either a red herring or a truth betrayer, Kingsley and Ruffalo disguise their real intentions under a restrained pleasantry, while von Sydow unleashes a layer of vile confrontation, which enchants the entire enigma with a more mysterious and befuddling aura. But by and large it is a Martin Scorsese's film, a brilliant genre piece coherently inveigles its viewers to immerse into its maelstrom and exit with a thorough emotional catharsis, which is definitely not every industrial hack is able to achieve!"
"abdullahshanawaz","10","0","2","22 April 2014"," The ending makes you doubt your sanity too... Another great movie by Scorsese and Leo.
","I was scrolling down my movie collection, not knowing what to watch for that night. Using IMDb to make sure I chose a good one, I found my self clicking on Shutter Island. Now I heard from some friends that it was a great movie and it had an 8.1 on IMDb so that alone was enough. Plus all the Leonardo DiCaprio movies that I had watched until that point were awesome. So yeah. The first few minutes of the movie went quite slow, and gave an okay intro. The movie had so many thrills in between and the story was great. Two Marshals sent to Shutter Island to investigate the escape of one of the prisoners, a doctor (Ben Kingsley) who sometimes give you the creeps and so many dangerous Psychiatric prisoners. Just when everything was going smooth and I got the feeling of excitement that Leo's character was the only good guy, that is because I presumed Ruffalo's character to have died after falling from the cliff. And I wanted him to escape from the island and bring back more soldiers to investigate the strange happenings on the island and arrest Ben Kingsley LOL. But that was not what the writer of the book thought. And that's a good thing. The twist was so unexpected and... I don't know. For once I didn't imagine Leo's character to have been a prison inmate for the past two years, and seriously Wtf. The one hour and 50 minutes that I had watched until now was nothing but a projection of Leo's character's psycho imagination. I paused the movie at that point and it took me about 5 minutes to figure out what had happened, I was shocked. I don't want to disclose any more details of the plot. Now I have watched Shutter Island thrice and it still doesn't fail to make me feel creeped out. Overall great movie. And I recommend it!..."
"peterp-450-298716","8","0","2","2 April 2014"," In one word : """"Brilliant""
","A cuckoo's nest on an island A brilliant psychological thriller where nothing seems like it should be. You'll be mislead the whole movie. The denouement is extremely surprising and plausible, but then turns right back to an open end which raises the same question : Is Ted still living in his unreal delusional world or is he really aware of his ultimate identity and thus voluntarily commits suicide to get rid of the agonizing trauma that chases him for years? Indeed, a true ""mind f*ck "" in this movie.<br/><br/>Scorsese placed the whole story on a remote island. Superbly portrayed as an isolated, desolate, rough rock where escaping is impossible. Using the ferry is a possibility but it's in the hands of the institute. The movie begins as the ferry arrives on the island with Ted (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Chuck (Mark Ruffalo) on board . I'm not a huge fan of Leonardo, but I must admit that I could appreciate his performances in ""Django"" and ""Inception"" and I don't look at him as the youthful Jack from ""Titanic"", but more like a chameleon-like actor who has gradually found its place among the other big boys.<br/><br/>The other actors are not the least. Mark Ruffalo plays a decent role as partner annex personal psychiatrist Ted. Personally I thought he's more convincing in this role then as Bruce Banner in ""The Avengers"" and recently as Dylan Rhodes in ""Now you see it"".<br/><br/>Ben Kingsley is a class act who plays the head psychiatrist with bravado and suppleness . The has a unique view on the treatment of psychiatric ""patients"". It's masterfully to see how his deadpan expression can change from compassionate to chiding. Max von Sydow is a well established value with a finicky small contribution. In that split second, he shows how psychiatrists feel superior over other human beings.<br/><br/>What begins as an apparently simple detective story with a search for an escaped patient, turns into a whirlwind of claustrophobic proportions. The threat and insane atmosphere accumulates systematically. The interior of Block C was soaring and fits well with the idea that the most dangerous individuals are imprisoned there. Far off from the outside world. The lighthouse is a gloomy edifice that stands out against the dark ocean and could indeed turn out to be a place to perform true inhuman experiments.<br/><br/>Gradually the question arises whether Ted is indeed insane or that he's involved in a grand conspiracy to cover it all up. His flashbacks of Dachau and dreams about the alleged dramatic death of his wife, the delusions of rats on the rocks, the trembling of his hands and sometimes psychotic manners, point out to the first. The story of the hiding female psychologist Rachel, surely makes you doubt again. The story of the mark that you get after internment is credible. Whatever you do to prove the opposite, it will always be reduced to the fact that you're insane.<br/><br/>Fifty years from now, people will look back and say, ""Here, at this place, is where it all began The Nazis used the Jews, Soviets used prisoners in Their Own Gulags And we -.., We tested patients on Shutter Island."" The final revelation was also a surprise for me and explained everything that preceded. The turnaround to total awareness and to admit that he lived all those years in a delusional world, proved the successful outcome of the whole set-up. I only doubt that you can apply this technique in reality.<br/><br/>The final sentence then puts everything in an entirely different context : ""Which would be worse - to live as a monster or to die as a good man?"" Is Ted still that monster or is he the cured repented patient who deliberately commits euthanasia by using lobotomy ? Excellent movie !!! <br/><br/>More reviews at http://opinion-as-a-moviefreak.blogspot.be/"

","I decided to watch it only because of Martin Scorsese – I was not fond of the summary, I thought it would be boring detective story for entire film. Fortunately I was wrong.<br/><br/>Two federal marshals investigating the disappearance of a murderess who escaped from a hospital for the criminally insane and is presumed to be hiding nearby. The ordinary plot of thriller. But all is not as it seems at the first glance. With every minute plot twists and ends the film on the boiling stage. Atmosphere pumped by great soundtrack – it makes picture more horrendous. Maestro Scorsese keeps viewers at the screens for every second- with every scene there are more and more questions – Who is number 67? What is happening in the lighthouse? And lots of others. Incredible performance by Leonardo Di Caprio give the film charm. Sometimes I thought that I was Teddy Daniels and felt every single emotion that felt this character. Emotions, memories – the role of federal marshal is definitely the best role of Leonardo. The main topic of the picture is that every person imagines reality as he wants. It is very interesting theme because it is vital. Everyone one the island lives in his own fictional world in which this person is successful and happy. And not only psychopaths do that – I think every second or third person in the world can't accept reality and imagines their own world of fantasies. And ending is very unacceptable – I was completely surprised and discouraged by what is happening on the screen. And it smartly puts the point in the movie. Outstanding directing of Marty Scorsese raised the level of the picture to the rank of masterpiece. He made feel every episode and empathize to the characters.<br/><br/>Shutter Island is absolutely perfect movie at every aspect – from sound director to the cinematographer. It is bouquet of emotions and feelings – Scorsese plays with viewers in game for the entire picture and leads them around the finger at the end of the game. Definitely it appears on lists of the best thrillers in history.<br/><br/>I recommend to everyone to watch it because I'm sure that it will bring something new to your life."

","This is a brilliant film.<br/><br/>Starring Leonardo DiCaprio... a top actor, in fact one of the best actors out there, i love all of his work and this one was one of his best. He plays this role perfectly, i think he was the perfect actor for this film.<br/><br/>The film has a great storyline/plot and all the way through it had me hooked, it was very interesting and sometimes creepy/strange at parts (not scary). The film itself was a little confusing at the end... the ending could have about 3 different meanings... it was hard to get my head around what the right answer was to the ending and i still am not 100% sure (you will understand when you have watched it if you haven't already) but don't be put off by this, the film is meant to be this way, it is a film that gets you thinking and is puzzling (mystery).<br/><br/>Many people think they know what the ending means of this film, many say different things and believe they know what the ending means but i personally don't know the correct answer to this, so i suggest people decide what they want after watching and believe what you want i guess. It is a very good film.<br/><br/>I would HIGHLY recommend this to people who love a good mystery film. Worth a 9 / 10 at least."

","Martin Scorsese is a freaking genius. A GENIUS I TELL YOU! Its like he pay attention to every detail even minor ones with great care. This movie is one of the best in its genre. I'll even say that its one of the best suspense thriller of all-time. <br/><br/>Visually its intriguing, its simplistic, the cast is amazing (Leonardo DiCaprio was epic! Give this man an Oscar already!!!) and overall its simply breathtaking. The flow of the story is fluent and quite simplistic. The ending is something you won't see coming. There is no cheap thrills or below average scares in this movie, but it will keep you at the edge of your seat. <br/><br/>As you may have known the Horror/Thriller genre is dying. Its not even scary nowadays. With all the gore, the naked women and hours and hours of sex makes it look more like a pornographic movies with blood and body parts thrown in it. There is no genuine horror or thrill in it these days. Shutter Island gives you none of that. Its a genuine Horror/Thriller movie with genuine horror and thrill. That's why I love this movie so much. <br/><br/>Overall, this movie is a masterpiece. The Leo-Scorsese combination doesn't disappoint. These two are meant to work together. If you haven't watched it already, give it a go, and prepare your mind to be blown away.<br/><br/>RATING: 9/10"

","What a surprising plot! Absolutely brilliant. A perfect mixture of adventure, horror and drama. What I liked most about shutter island is its impressive turn of events. You pick your side with protagonist Marshal Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) and suddenly everything turn against you. As the viewer, you don't want to give up the fight. You struggle with film until the very last minute but you also can't ignore the truth. Jackie Haley (playing George Noyce) appears for only four minutes yet that four minutes is perhaps one of the most impressive part of the entire movie. <br/><br/>10/10"

"RaidenReviews","9","0","2","25 January 2014"," A U.S Marshall investigates a mysterious island for an escaped prisoner only to find out darker secrets lie within.
","Right off the bat this film is perhaps one of the most intricate I have seen. All viewers are in for major plot twists and a spiralling journey down the world of the criminally insane. DiCaprio unites again with legendary director Martin Scorsese to deliver an excellent performance as a U.S Marshall haunted by a mysterious tragedy. Mark Ruffalo joins DiCaprio as a new Marshall from Seattle, aiding him in the search to locate a missing patient from Ashcliffe Sanitarium located on the eerie Shutter Island. The weather in this film is essential in giving it a dreading, uneasy and very haunting appearance. The use of rain and dark imagery really emphasize the morbid presence the film bears. Although this film is a staple in any psychological thriller collection, it has it's flaws. Many of the shots that include driving look very unrealistic and DiCaprio loses his Boston accent multiple times throughout the film. Other than those minor details the film remains a mind-blowing adventure. This is one of those films that switches plots after the initial plot is solved. After the 'missing patient' is discovered back in her cell, unscathed by the treacherous island, the Marshalls begin to suspect there are other things going on at Ashcliffe. After beginning to suspect the sanitarium is part of a government mind-control conspiracy, the Marshalls begin to realize they were meant to come here as victims of government experiments. This is where the movie's web weaves itself more and more as the true darkness of the island is slowly unveiled. DiCaprio's character begins to realize similarities between some of the patients at the island to his own life and he is also plagued by flashbacks of his deceased wife. The climax of the film that really explodes is when DiCaprio goes to rescue his partner from 'the lighthouse' where the mind experiments supposedly occur. The doctor and his partner are waiting for him in the lighthouse and explain that everything that has happened was set up and staged to help DiCaprio release himself from his past trauma. This is the point where everything you have seen crumbles down and unveils an explanation for everything that has occurred. This is where I just sat back and said ""Whoa"". The huge plot twist at the end really en-ravels the viewer into the story and leaves you immersed in the uncertainty of the situation. The movie's ending has epic proportion, where DiCaprio's character chooses to die as a good man, rather than his former self which really shows the moral fibre of his heroic character and how his understanding and acceptance of reality has finally allowed him to achieve peace."

"Horst_In_Translation","8","0","3","10 November 2013"," Mesmerizing piece of filmmaking from one of the greats
","Martin Scorsese's ""Shutter Island"" went a bit under the radar after the big hype ended as it was released right before Christopher Nolan's ""Inception"" starring Leonardo DiCaprio also. This adaptation of the Dennis Lehane novel turned out very nicely, however. The screenplay was written by Laeta Kalogridis, who was also in charge of the script to the infamous ""Alexander"", but if her talent was somehow in question, it's all been made up by her work for Shutter Island. Some people say that Scorsese needs to move on to another recurring lead actor than Di Caprio, but I say, if Shutter Island has any kind of influence in that decision, he should actually be working with nobody else. ""Shutter Island"" runs considerably over two hours and DiCaprio as Teddy Daniels is pretty much in there from start to finish and commands the screen incessantly.<br/><br/>The whole supporting cast did a decent job as well, some more, some less. I'd like to emphasize especially Ben Kingsley whose work with Scorsese here and also, more recently, in Hugo worked out incredibly well. In this one, he plays the head of a mental hospital and seems to have a great time portraying that character. I definitely had a great time watching him. He was so much fun in all his scenes, in the more serious scenes, but also for example when he keeps giggling about the interactions between DiCaprio's and von Sydow's character. This was maybe the only one whose significance I really didn't see, which is a shame as von Sydow is without a doubt a very good actor. He's a bit of a link for the main character back to his time as a soldier and I could have done without these parts as they did not add very much to the story. In contrast to that, Ted Levine (known from ""Silence of the Lambs"" and ""Monk"") proves again what an underrated, brilliant actor he is and totally dominates his one scene, in which he delivers Daniels and the audience a memorable monologue on violence.<br/><br/>This was already the second or even third time I watched ""Shutter Island"", so the whole final twist wasn't new or refreshing anymore, but I remember being quite shocked the first time I saw it about how things unfolded and it was certainly good to see it again and pay more attention to details I may have overlooked earlier, now with the knowledge of what is going to happen. Apart from that, I'm fairly sure that I still haven't understood all that's beyond the surface, all the metaphors and symbolisms here and that's why it's surely a good choice for a rewatch. You discover something new every time. The setting is perfectly chosen and displayed: an isolated gloomy island that adds a truly claustrophobic note to the film. I was actually surprised how many songs were included. I hardly remembered any when the end credits began. I guess it's true that the best soundtrack is one you don't recognize. I felt the fact that there was rarely more than one well-picked noise, be it heavy rain or birds tweeting added a lot to how atmospheric this film was.<br/><br/>As you certainly know by now, I totally recommend this film. It's a bit of a pity it was overlooked completely at the Academy Awards, probably due to its early release date in 2010. ""Shutter Island"" is exactly the horror/thriller I like. Give me something like that over bloodthirsty zombies running behind a gang of cheerleaders anytime. People say, Scorsese is past his peak, but if this film and ""Hugo"" are any kind of indicators, I'd say he's shining more brightly than ever. Hopefully he can retain this level for another 10-15 years."
"Goranjake","9","0","2","1 November 2013"," A film that successfully tricks
","Going into this movie I figured it'd be a cool mystery with nothing more to it. This movie has a cover of a generic film but deserves to be better recognized. Upon the thrills throughout the movie it seems to let you know what's happening and brilliantly fools you while doing so. What's so good about it is the way it starts and continues fluidly without looking clunky. The setting is perfect, never letting the viewer think this is a cheap Hollywood set. Dicaprio gives a deep performance and is able to change levels of intensity appropriate to the scenes. To me it seemed like every bit of dialogue had purpose for later in the movie that works spectacularly for the premise. This movie actually fooled me and even question my own sanity afterwards. People will be mad they didn't understand or that the movie tricked them, but the truth is that this film is powerful and thought provoking if your upset toward it or not.In this movie the insane are accurately depicted and we get to see what it's like in a way... Martin Sorcese and Leo are made for each other it seems, and I can't wait to see what they dish out next."
"MoNsAiNt","10","0","1","16 August 2013"," Good twist
","Shutter Island is a movie that you would never want to miss if you like to watch movies with spectacular twist. There is no action or romance or comedy in this movie but little patience in the beginning ties you up to the movie. It seems to be a normal movie at the beginning but slowly the suspense starts to build up. This will deviate your idea about the movie. Initially the director makes you think about the mysterious things happening on the island. Leonardo starts his investigation with the help of his partner and uncovers some horrible truths about the island. Later as his investigation seems to come to an end, he will be drugged by the people on the island to make himself believe that he is also mentally sick. Now Leonardo has to fight for himself and escape from the island. To know what happens to him you should watch IT.<br/><br/>The movie is nominated for many awards and it had won few. There are many online forums and discussion debating the movie's ending. It really is a mind boggling climax. I am sure that you will question your sanity after watching this flick."

","For me, SHUTTER ISLAND is one of the best thrillers I have ever seen. The story starts with a simple plot but starts getting complicated every minute. The location and the ""early 90s"" setup looked very attracting and once you start watching the movie you cannot leave without completing. Also Di Caprio, as usual, played the role in the best of ways. One more thing about the movie is that if you see the movie 2 or 3 times, we come to know that the dialogues that were being said by various characters actually had two meanings which we can only understand at the end of the movie or the next time we see it again.

"mr-back32","10","0","1","4 July 2013"," One of the Greatest Emotional Thrillers
","A movie, an emotional ride, a work of art. There are many ways to describe Martin Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio's Shutter Island (2010). This film does something that very little other film can do, It keeps you in the dark and confused about the characters past, present and future while also drawing you very attached to them all with crazy and obscure symbols. The way they accomplish this is a riveting story line mixed with incredible scenery, lighting, color and sound, while the entire movie giving you hints about his past without you even knowing. The thing that is most shocking and breathtaking in this movie though is the acting. All the characters don't even feel like they are on a movie screen. It seems as though you are standing right next to them as all of this is happening right before your eyes because the acting is the best I think I've ever seen in anything, mainly from Leo Deo(Leonardo DiCaprio).<br/><br/>Let me give you the intro to the movie. It starts out following a man named Teddy played by Leo Deo and his partner Chuck played by Mark Ruffalo. They are federal Marshall's sent to Shutter Island(an island which only has a mental hospital on it.) to help investigate a missing patient at a who seemingly vanished. That's all I'm going to say about the story line because I will be mainly be talking about the execution of the movie itself, the story is amazing and I'd love to talk about it but I honesty feel like the story is something you discover on your own so just talking even a little about it would take away from such a great movie. It has so many twists and turns as more and more is revealed to you that it keeps you at the edge of your seat the whole movie. That being said, throughout the entire movie they somehow are able to draw upon your emotions and make you question certain things without them even telling you, just based on the eerie music, lighting and ludicrous dream sequences. There are many many symbols/ important statements said and shown throughout the movie that they don't even address and you don't notice until the end that they were even there. They keep you guessing so much that it seems the audience is so focused on the big picture that they don't see the clues right in front of them. It is incredible how they are able to hold the audiences attention just with the mood, scenery, and sound while constantly feeding you information that you try to make sense of in your head which draws you even deeper into the movie.<br/><br/>When you watch this movie, I want you to pay attention to the dream sequences very closely. Look and listen to what the characters are saying, wearing and their reactions to each other. It is insane the amount of detail and thought goes into these scenes and at first you just see the scenes as a confusing gaze into Teddy's past, but there are so many secrets to be found in the entire movies but especially in these very emotional and symbolic scenes of the film. Just looking at how the characters interact with each other is a treat because the execution of all the scenes is flawless. Take this dream scene for example, Teddy is walking near a pile of bodies at a concentration camp and he sees a woman and child dead on top of each other. The little girl eerily gets up and whispers that he should have saved her and all of ""us"". Then he is now walking through a very fancy house where he encounters the man that burned his apartment to the ground and killed his girlfriend. They stare each other down next to a fire as he plays with matches and he lights his cigarette. There is so much more to this scene, but for the sake of space lets just look at this. The heartache, shock, and regret on his face as he sees the girl rise and stare him down paints such an amazing picture and lets you know exactly how the characters feel and just how bad Teddy's past is. When he see's Latus, the anger and hatred on his face is so believable, it really draws you into the characters and makes you want to know exactly what is going on with them on the inside and out. The music and noises of these scenes only add to the incredible tension that you can just feel even through the screen. This movies feels like an emotional roller-coaster as you are trying just as hard as Teddy to figure out what is happening. It feels like you and Teddy are figuring it out together which makes you feel even more attached. <br/><br/>Like I said earlier, one of the best, if not the best tool that they use to draw on your emotions is the acting. Seeing every tear, every outburst and every wrinkle in all the characters faces as they traverse through this hell on earth is so believable and so heart wrenching that I feel like this pulls you in more than any other of the tools they use. We are all human and we all have feelings and pasts so it is easy for us to relate to other people who are going through something as crushing as this. It is something that all humans share, we have a past, we laugh, we cry, and we cherish moments. They use this truth like I've never seen before. Seeing the pain from Teddy's face and the anguish he is going through on the inside tears a hole in your heart because he plays such a perfect Teddy, that it doesn't feel like a character anymore, it feels like a friend."

","Finally got around to watching this on DVD, and this film was nothing like what I expected. However, I give it a 7. I am still unsure whether I liked it or not. I did find it fairly disturbing and I can say that I have not been as genuinely disturbed by a film since The Machinist which nearly made me physically sick and messed me up for days - and I am a fan of horrors like Saw! I think De Caprio is a very talented actor. However the fact that he looks about 17 just makes it unbelievable when he is playing a role where he is supposed to have some kind of authority. It doesn't work for me. An example is where he has his top off next to his partner. Leo has the smooth body of a child he also has crappy tattoos that I just don't feel a US Marshall would have had in 1954! I also find Ben Kingsley to be a very one dimensional actor. Psycho one or psycho 2. He is good in this but I find it impossible to get the image of him as Don Logan in Sexy Beast out of my head. He seems to be the ""dial a nutter""! We need a phsychopatic actor - phone SIR Ben and see if he is available. I find it hard to take him seriously.<br/><br/>Michelle Williams acts well in this and I found it quite poignant seeing what has happened in her personal life. There is just something too plain about her that i feel she has blagged her way into Hollywood and is not really a star.<br/><br/>The stand out performance for me was Mark Ruffalo. I have never seen his work before and he stole the show for me. I kept thinking it was Billy Zane and had to keep reminding myself that he is bald! The ""twist"" becomes so obvious that I was waiting for another one. Is that it I was thinking? Yes, the score was haunting but at times I felt it was too much.<br/><br/>I think Marty needs to get back to his gangster roots and make a modern day gangster flick using less obvious A list stars and sourcing his actors from some of the amazing TV shows like The Shield, The Sopranos and OZ.<br/><br/>Mark Ruffalo would make a perfect leading actor as he has that ambiguous ""foreign"" look about him.<br/><br/>All in all a disturbing, dark film that hits wide off the mark in my opinion."
"vijitkothari1","7","0","1","30 May 2013"," A Great new experience out of an hackneyed plot.
","So many times have we seen a movie which ends the way Shutter Island does. But this movie explains what difference a great story teller, what Martin Scorsese is, can do to any script, any story or film given to him. <br/><br/>Even though many of you would get a hint of a part of the ending while watching, the way I got, but still it didn't take anything away from the film. Just after watching for the first time I got irritated slightly and started cursing the film maker for messing up the whole plot but then I realized that it is where the greatness of the film lies.<br/><br/>The film is very engrossing, captivating and a must watch. It is not a film you can watch with a popcorn and a soda in your hands. You have to tickle your brain nerves to really enjoy it. Martin has really worked very hard to bring each and every detail perfectly out on the screen and you should do justice by watching it sedulously. If you do not do so, you would be blaming it on the ending, but this is a film where the body of the film makes such an impact that ending becomes just a puppet of it.<br/><br/>It is supposed that mystery movies are enjoyable only once, but it is such a good film that you can watch it several times without getting bored. The plot has been woven together so deftly that even when the mystery is out in the end you are able to relate it so easily to the subtleties that it all becomes very convincing, but again for that you have to watch the movie with a great focus and respect for the genre and the film maker."

","When I first saw the trailer of 'Shutter Island', I thought it to be a horror flick and I thought, what is Martin Scorsese is doing with this horror film ??? Apparently I got my answer after seeing the movie, and I am happy that I am wrong. Story wise, this is definitely one of the best thrillers that I have seen. The twists and turns in this story were simply great. With a Genius like Martin Scorsese as director, this movie will keep you at the edge of your seat. In the movie ' The Prestige ' a magic trick is said to have three acts- The Pledge, The Turn and The Prestige. The Prestige is the final and most important act because it will make the magic trick memorable. Similarly, the last couple of twists, which I like to call the Prestige, in the story of 'Shutter Island' will make your jaw drop. The work of Martin Scorsese was good as usual. He was able to portray the story well and gave the story its proper value. The cinematography was very good.<br/><br/>The performance of Mark Ruffalo, Ben Kingsley were phenomenal. Also the acting of Michelle Williams was very good. The performance of these guys made the twists and turns to develop.<br/><br/>Now on the downside of the movie was the performance of Leonardo DiCaprio. Though he did a fare job, but it was not a great performance for me. Somehow in all his movie, every character becomes all the same. Its as if, rather than Leonardo becoming the character, the character becomes Leonardo.<br/><br/>At the end, I recommend everyone to watch this film, especially thriller loving people. Because This movie will simply blow your minds away."

Perhaps if you spent a little time actually watching the film rather than guessing the ending non stop (hate people who do that),you wouldn't give such a close minded/boring opinion. You may actually enjoy a film for once rather than looking for tiny little mistakes that are made. Also to the people who didn't like the ending.

","A film like this is appreciated with repeated viewings, much like the Machinist, The Prestige, Fight Club, Memento, The Uusual Suspects, The Sixth Sense, Psycho, Saw, Identity, basically anything with a real good twist.<br/><br/>Not a lot of Scorcese movies have big twist outside the Departed but that was just because of what happens to the characters rather then a plot twist.<br/><br/>The twist here makes so much sense. I have seen this film four times now and have liked it more each time.<br/><br/>The whole movie you just want to know what is going on. You want to know why is everything so mysterious, why does Leo have these headaches, why are people being sketchy outside of it being a hospital for the criminally insane.<br/><br/>A lot of visually striking, eerie shots in this film. Scorcese does a wonderful job as always, and Leo is Leo. Top notch acting, one of his very best performances.<br/><br/>This movie is in my collection now and very high on my list. <br/><br/>You will not regret seeing this movie, it is not for everybody but you cant help but respect it.<br/><br/>A great, great story!<br/><br/>9 out of 10"

","Crime thriller films don't come much better than this. Shutter Island has great actors, a spooky atmosphere and a story that starts intriguing and develops into a sprawling masterpiece. The film deals with an investigation of a criminal asylum where one patient has inexplicably gone missing.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio is a tough cop with a past as a soldier in the Allied forces and traumatizing memories of the Nazi crimes they saw. Ben Kingsley is the chief of the institution who seems to be holding something back. Mark Ruffalo is DiCaprio's steadfast partner and Michelle Williams DiCaprio's loving wife.<br/><br/>The film works better on the second viewing and has a great emotional impact.

"tkubas1","7","0","3","19 January 2013"," One of my favorite Dicaprio flicks
","Shutter Island is my favorite type of movie. It has a complex plot, amazing acting, and stunning atmosphere. If you liked The Prestige or The Sixth Sense, this could possibly become one of your favorites.<br/><br/>Contrary to what the trailer leads you to believe this movie is not horror, its suspense. It literally IS suspense. From the opening minute I was enthralled in the dialogue and atmosphere. I couldn't help but analyze every word for clues about the characters true motives. I wasn't sure who to trust except for Teddy (Played by Leonardo DiCaprio) and his partner Chuck (Mark Ruffalo). The movie is set in 1954 Boston on an Island occupied by the mentally insane. Chuck and Teddy are U.S. Marshals investigating a missing persons case. Right away you can tell something's up. I'll let you decide on a theory for yourself, because if I went into the plot in detail it would only ruin some of the twists and turns. Don't miss a single scene, because there are subtle hints throughout the movie that you will pick up on if you pay attention to the details. In fact, I actually was able to predict some of the happenings near the end; which was somewhat disappointing. It didn't detract too much, and I certainly didn't understand all of what was going on. On a second viewing you actually gain a real respect for how much everything makes sense. There wasn't any plot holes that I caught. This movie is actually based on a book of the same name. If not sure how close it is to the original considering that I haven't read it, but I'd be shocked if you weren't satisfied with the adaption simply because it's such a well-directed film.<br/><br/>The cinematography in this movie is amazing. Each scene has a well thought out color pattern; blue hues and foggy grays abound. The lighting in each scene was perfect. Just right in the intense moments so you can't see all the details. At one point Teddy is holding a match that is lighting the room around him. When the match goes out the screen goes black and you can't see anything until he lights another match. It was very intense. The atmosphere is always eerie because of the island itself. It's always foggy or storming. It almost has a supernatural feeling. Some moments are especially frightening. In one of the final scenes when you see what has really happened; it's actually quite disturbing. The movie doesn't scare you with piles of gore, just its unstable characters. The ""Patients"" are grotesque. The makeup people did a superb job of making the most realistically scary faces. The soundtrack is haunting. It builds the tension to a boiling point. It's one of those scores where if it came on you would instantly say ""Oh that's from Shutter Island!"" Over all I have no complaints with any of the technical aspects of the movie.<br/><br/>I can't do a review of this movie without mentioning the outstanding acting. As usual Leonardo DiCaprio puts on amazing show. This movie is really all about him. He has the uncanny ability to reel the audience in with his emotion. The reason you are uneasy as you watch is because DiCaprio sells that you should be. Trust me, once you get to know all about the character Teddy you'll realize just how amazing his performance is. Mark Ruffalo was very good as well. He played a good Watson to Leonardo's Sherlock. When you know what to look for in a second viewing you can see a lot of subtle facial expressions that are hints of things to come. Ben Kingsley's Dr. Cawley was suitably bold. I was honestly cheering against him. After the credits rolled though, I realized that he was acting perfectly for his character's situation. Max Von Sydow was chilling as Dr. Naehring. He had a lighthearted evil about him. The rest of the cast was good as well. No bad acting to report.<br/><br/>This movie is among my favorites. It's not quite a perfect ten, but it's close. You get pulled in from the start by the acting and story. I can't recommend it enough if you like suspense/mystery movies.<br/><br/>tkuba1.wordpress.com"

","Shutter Island is sinister. Every twist and turn will leave you with some questions answered and some asked. At first, Teddy seems sane, but some things about him seem off. Over time, you see his nightmares and flashbacks. They're haunting. Creepy. He is troubled by the death of his wife, and we see her multiple times, as she tells him to do things in dreams and in his ""reality."" We also see dead children and other horrifying things. It then becomes clear that he is not fully sane. Then it is revealed that he killed his wife, who drowned his children, and he doesn't want to accept that. He had been living in his alternate world as a US Marshal, not a killer. However, you will be left guessing. There are multiple theories you can draw about different things in this movie, but all of them leave you wanting to watch it again and again."

","I say only one thing see it once and u would like to see twice.. <br/><br/>There is a quote that leaves us pondering: ""Which would be worse, to live as a monster or to die as a good man?"" For me, what it means is that DiCaprio chose to erase his memory and die a good man. The reason to it is simple. One of the saddest and toughest aspects of life is to have a good memory. Memories are what shape us, but also is what makes us more cynical and bitter about the world. At the end of the day, Martin Scorsese has created a movie that allows the audience to come up with their own viewpoint of what happens. Whether that is a good or bad thing, it is really the way you approach and think.."

"masounification","9","0","2","9 November 2012"," Shutter Island Is a movie that you will never forget
","Shutter Island is the best mystery movie of all time. It is on my list of top movies that I've ever seen. Shutter Island, set in 1954, has a lot of eeriness and mystery to it throughout the movie.It has great acting, and is like the first season of lost, only darker. <br/><br/>Shutter Island has a rich storyline. It's plot is about a U.S. Marshall and WW2 vet named Teddy Daniels, and his new partner, Chuck Aule. They are investigating the mysterious disappearance of a patient at the most advanced Mental Penitentiary in the U.S. which is located on it's own island. Which turns out there is more to the Island than it seems, and Teddy Daniels.<br/><br/>A lot of parts in the movie Teddy has twisted dreams that seem to have no meaning. Each one involving death.Like when he is in a dining hall and Teddy hears a scream. He turns around to find the patient he is looking for covered in blood and a dead child on the floor. Then the scene cuts to him putting the child in a lake, the dead child asks Teddy how he could let it happen to her, ""I am so sorry"" replied Teddy. All of the dreams seem to have no meaning until the end. Another crazy part in the movie is when Teddy is walking down one of the hallway of Ward C(I wont spoil what happens).When everything in the movie adds up.<br/><br/>There is a few reasons why you might not want to see the movie. There is a large amount of blood used in it, and there is only a small amount of gore in the WW2 scenes. There is also a lot of language and some sexual reference in some scenes. If you're not okay with some of these things you might not want to watch this movie. <br/><br/>This movie has great acting. A good example is Chuck, Teddy's partner. He has this mafia like way of talking which was common at that time. Also Teddy's wife does great acting and is very emotional. This movie sets its eeriness a lot within the way the characters act.<br/><br/>Shutter Island is and all-time great movie. It has an ingenious storyline and ending, it has great acting, and an amazing feel to it. If you watch this movie, It will be one that you will never forget."

"richy1024","9","0","3","7 October 2012"," A weary but gratifying experiment.
","Shutter Island exemplifies Martin Scorsese's wonderful intelligence and illuminations of motion picture art as an performer and now director. The mystery behind the fogginess suggests a bleak elude eeriness with this film, revealing an unexpected yet incredible finale. The camera also adopts feelings of apprehension, giving it a frantic feel and a true crime investigatory mind set. In addition, we see how DiCaprio's acting capabilities have become more convincing and have improved through age since his heroics in Titanic. This is potentially one of Scorsese's most experimental pieces of film making. His delicate perception of how sound and camera movement blend quite beautifully to create significant meanings and tempers, covering the picture with a blanket of vagueness and trepidation.<br/><br/>Set in 1954, U.S. Federal Marshal Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) embarks on an investigation into the mysterious disappearance of a patient by the name Rachel Solando, who has escaped or been potentially slaughtered at an asylum institute for the criminally insane. As Teddy tip-toes around the derelict Island he discovers more than he would have wished for, including a few home truths that reveal themes of true identity and false recognition of the enemy. Teddy's character recognition and re-acknowledgment of haunting images from his time serving during the Second World War, with visionaries of his army unit releasing free a Nazi concentration camp and the death of his wife and two children truly capture the emotion that Scorsese, Kalogridis and Lehane attempt to reveal to the narratives admirers. He begins to have reservations with his own memory, his wife and even his personal wisdom due the experience of radical experiments put in order by the mental institute, causing confusion and a host of suspects. As Terry and Chuck (Mark Ruffalo) find themselves marooned on the island, Teddy begins interrogating the internees, finding a haunting and unexpected hidden secret relating to Shutter Island.<br/><br/>DiCaprio's notions of confusion, conspiracy and misplaced sense of direction really give his character an incredible unbalanced movement, especially considering when detectives are supposed to steer from paranoia. Although his temperament is full of perplexity, Teddy fails to realise he has become the mechanism of a psychological experiment. This truly illustrates DiCaprio's maturity as a performer, feeding upon Scorsese's filming intelligence, congratulating the late 1960s psychological terror era on influence on tails such as this."

","Could any Scorsese/DiCaprio movie possibly go wrong?! I loved every minute of Shutter Island. The brilliant script is brought to perfection by DiCaprio's exquisite, getting-maturer-by-the-day performance and Scorsese's unfailing ability to entertain both your eye and mind.<br/><br/>The movie is a perfect thriller that will have you watch the movie more than once to pick up what you missed and put the pieces together. Even the twists and turns, as they unfold, make the movie richer both story- wise and suspense-wise without sacrificing the verisimilitude. And never think you've got it all after the first viewing, the second and the third, will surprise you even the more and leave you wondering what to believe.<br/><br/>Everyone in the movie's ensemble seems to know exactly what they are doing. I don't know whether it's the Scorsese effect or all of them are really good actors. Ben Kingsley is a master of his art as usual. Patricia Clarkson and Emily Mortimer, despite their small roles, flavored the film with some topnotch performance. As for Mr. Ruffalo, he has officially moved from my ""Can't Stand"" List to my ""Likable"" List."

"Aly200","10","0","2","1 August 2012"," A Thrilling, Suspenseful and Mystifying Tale
","One probably wouldn't associate Martin Scorsese with a psychological thriller, but this film was deftly handled by the master director. <br/><br/>The film's premise is relatively simple: two United States Marshals are summoned to a remote mental institution to find an escaped patient. However nothing is as it seems at Ashcliffe (the name of the hospital) once the Marshals begin their investigation and fear their sanity is fading away. There are many twists and turns as the film delves into the tortured psyche of anti-hero, Edward ""Teddy"" Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio). The climax is truly dramatic and brings the film's action full circle, but I will not reveal the surprise.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio aptly portrays the former alcoholic Teddy Daniels, a man whose dark past continuously haunts him throughout the film; particularly the tragic death of his wife (Michelle Williams) which is kept secret for the majority of the film's run-time until the end of the film. DiCaprio brings out the vulnerability needed for the part, but also has a strong reserve in his actions. <br/><br/>DiCaprio's chemistry with co-star, Mark Ruffalo who plays Daniels's partner Chuck Aule, provides the profound revelations that drive the narrative forward. Both actors play off each other in the fashion of a cat and mouse game as their pasts remain obscure until Teddy eventually tells some secrets to Chuck that spell the former's downfall. <br/><br/>The film's supporting cast of Michelle Williams as DiCaprio's wife, Ben Kingsley as Dr. Cawley and Max von Sydow as the asylum head, all add mounting suspense as their motives. Williams in particular plays a deceased character and remains a haunting presence as she is the driving force behind DiCaprio's Teddy's fractured mind; telling him to avenge her death. Kingsley and von Sydow stay subtle in their roles as psychiatrists; their motives remaining murky until the final act of the film. <br/><br/>If you have a taste for mind games, give this a viewing cause you'll want to see it again."
"BeneCumb","7","0","1","27 July 2012"," Too mind-twisting, Scorsese has made better stuff
","Actors are excellent (DiCaprio has pleasantly surprised me again), but the plot has its shortcomings -- there are so many issues unsolved or unexplained, e.g. whom did the main character meet in reality or why he suffered his illnesses. The movie itself is a bit lengthy (suspense is sometimes lost), and the ending is too sophisticated as well.<br/><br/>Director and cameramen, however, have done nice work, making Shutter Island definitely an A-movie. But, in my opinion, The Others and The Sixth Sense (among others) are better. But if you just like to experience in common or like to be captivated by gloominess and mystery, then this movie is meant for you :)"
"fabmaster","8","0","2","22 July 2012"," Well-written plot with an excellent execution
","This is my favorite genre, films with a self-referential architecture. The obvious structure of the film has two main layers with subtle variations of those two layers throughout the film. First layer is Teddy being an investigator and the second layer is Teddy being a mental patient playing an investigator. The variations come about with different characters exposing sub-plots, such as the Nazi schemes, while Teddy plays the investigator. The layers constructed as 'a very delicate but intricate architecture.' Scorcece did a superb job in threading the layers together with interesting lines throughout the film. However, considering that it was released in 2010, after films like 'Identity,' it could have more depth to it...maybe by relating the film situation more directly with our everyday lives. Besides that, the film had a good balance of intriguing plot and entertaining thriller elements. Also, DiCaprio added much color to the plot. He seems to be on an evolving track as far as this kind of acting is concerned, starting from 'Catch Me If you Can' to 'Inception.'<br/><br/>Her delusions...are conceived on a very delicate but intricate architecture. To sustain that structure, she employs and elaborate narrative thread to her life that is completely fictitious. And she gives us all parts to play in that fiction."

It is technically well done, generally well acted and for me at least, was quite suspenseful most of the way.<br/><br/>I think critics who have dismissed it are being harsh, but I also think its fundamental flaws stop it being a 9 or 10.

The case that both Marshall Danials & Aule are to investigate is the escape from the island's top security Ashecliffe Mental Hospital, that's run by the US Government, of child murderess of her own three children Rachel Solando,Patrica Clarkson. Both Daniels & Aule run into a number of roadblocks in their investigation in that the person who runs the hospital Dr. John Cawley, Ben Kingsly,and his assistant Dr. Jeremiah Naehring, Max Von Sydow,refuse to cooperate with them in releasing the escapee's, Rachel Solando,personal medical records! In fact as both Daniel's and Aule soon come to realize that this Rachel Solando may not even exist at all!<br/><br/>As the film plays itself out is soon becomes evident that it's Marshall Daniels who's suffering from a series of jolting and mind bending flashbacks coupled with migraine headaches who's a candidate to be locked up in Ashecliffe Hopital just as much as the escaped child murderess Rachel Solando is! We get to see Daniels's mind start to work on him in two events in his life that has changed him forever. His involvement in the liberation of the Nazi concentration camp Dachau in the spring of 1945, when he was 22, and what, in the hundreds of dead and emaciated bodies of the camp inmates, he saw there. What was also playing on Daniel's mind is the cold blooded massacre of over 500 unarmed and helpless German Army & SS prisoners at the camp that he participated in! The second and far more personal event in Daniel's life that's been burning him up for the last two years is the death of his wife Dolores, Michelle Williams,who died in an arson fire of the couple's home set by firebug and confirmed psycho Andrew Laddis played by the Robert De Niero looking,looking as if he's DiNero's identical twin, actor Elias Koteas. As we and Daniel's soon find out Laddis,whom he's been tracking down for the last two years, is in fact one of the mental patients at Ashecliffe Hospital!<br/><br/>Get yourself ready for a number big surprises as both Marshall's Daniels & Aule uncover a major psych ops operation going on at Ashecliffe Hospital. It seems that Doctor's Cawley & Neahring, by copying what the North Koreans did to helpless US POWS in the Korean War, are using the patients there in a number of drug induced mind altering experiments by turning them into mindless and murderous zombies for the US Government in future,like political assassinations, clandestine operations! But what turns out to be the true reason for why Daniels and Aule were assigned there is far more shocking that even that!<br/><br/>***SPOILERS*** One of the best psychological thriller in years that ranks right up there with movies like ""The Manchurian Candidate"" and 1956 Kevin McCarthy thriller ""Nightmare"" the film ""Sutter Island"" will keep you as well as Marshall Daniels & Aule guessing until it reveals the truth about what's really happening in it. The ending of the movie is truly shocking even if you saw it coming miles or minutes in advance! It turns everything that you saw up to that point in the film upside down and even more mind boggling shows who the real villain or villains, as well as good guys or heroes, in the movie really are!"
"robearbarrett","9","0","2","7 June 2012"," Genius unfortunately overlooked by Inception
","I watched both Shutter Island and Inception well after their initial cinema releases and chose Inception first, but despite the hype of the film I was very disappointed considering I'd set my hopes high. However with Shutter Island it was less anticipated and a huge surprise as it quickly became one of my favourite films. Originally I was expecting a horror film as the both the trailers and the narrative had not struck me that this was going to be a thriller. As always in a Scorsese film the atmosphere is established from the first shot with what appears to be the main character and his 'detective partner' on a ferry heading to the island in which the film is set.<br/><br/>The film wastes no time in getting straight into the plot and exploring the characters and it is through the interactions between these characters that suspicions arise. The plot is quite complex and requires attention from the viewer, but the experience is far more enjoyable if you can stay connected to the unpredictability of the story. The enigmatic lead role 'teddy' played by Di Caprio is of huge importance as the psychological side of the character is the centre of the plot and delivers the twists throughout the film.<br/><br/>Possibly the best part of this film is its ending which has been built up by all other events of the film and gradually unearthed the truth about 'teddy'. However the interpretation of the end of the film can be different as the view that I have is not the same as what others have said. Overall Shutter Island is a must watch, it delivers an intelligent narrative with elements taken from other Scorsese films, a powerful acting performance and is a film which doesn't have the sole purpose just to make money unlike Inception."

","The movie Shutter Island is about Teddy Daniels, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, an investigator who is put on an mission to find a patient who has disappeared from the island. Teddy had volunteered to take this mission because he was determined to find and expose his theory that Ashecliffe had been using these patients as lab rats to learn how to control them with drugs and surgery. Teddy begins to have hallucinations of his wife Dolores, played by Michelle Williams, who had been killed in a apartment fire by Andrew Laeddis who was also supposed to be on the island at the hospital as well. When a storm came and shut down all the power on the island the jail cells were all opened and Teddy and his partner Chuck, played by Mark Ruffalo, went into Ward C which is were he thought Laeddis was at. While in there he met George in there which is someone who he had known that originally told him about the secret things going on in that hospital. George told him that Chuck was not really his partner and that all of the doctors were playing a game with him; then went on to tell him that in order to see where they perform the surgeries that he had to go to the lighthouse. Teddy eventually does get to the lighthouse only to find Dr. Cawley, played by Ben Kingsley, who then went on to tell Teddy that he had been at the hospital for two years and that his real name was Andrew Laeddis. He then explained to Teddy that Chuck was not his partner, he was his doctor as well, he just stated with Teddy to make sure that he was safe; and that they allowed him to play the role of an investigator hoping that it would help him to come to the realization that he had actually killed his own wife for killing their children. <br/><br/>Although the movie was not scary in any way to gave off a look as if it were, the lighting was very dark in a lot of shots and with some of the camera angles there it looked as if something was about to happen. All of the characters did a great job with the acting, there was a good twist at the end of the movie that would definitely leave you confused.

","""Shutter Island"" stands out from the usual batch of generic, rehashed, remakes or just plain stupid, movies they are cranking out as fast as they can these days.<br/><br/>US Marshal Teddy Daniels is investigating a case of missing patient in an institute for dangerous mentally insane people. Along his investigation, he discovers that he is in a midst of a deep conspiracy. I won't go too much into the plot but I'll say this: The execution is nearly perfect. Shocking moments are delivered suddenly and swiftly. The twists and turns will keep anyone guessing throughout the movie. Intense, thrilling scenes which will keep a viewer's heart thumping are scattered throughout the film. Even after the final twist is revealed, the viewer can't help but suspect it due to the many deceptions before.<br/><br/>My only complaints would be the use of really loud music and pointless nudity which could've been easily avoided. If you're looking for a good thriller look no further. It's not 100% original but it will keep you intrigued and entertained, which is more than I can say for 99% of the movies Hollywood is blowing out of it's butt currently."

","All the actors in the movie are in top-form. Once again, you can't go wrong with a Leonardo DiCaprio/Martin Scorsese collaboration. As the protagonist, we the audience are thrust into his shoes and we are about as confused and scared as his character is, we feel what he feels. It becomes a psychological trip that poses many, many questions about oneself, that to discuss them here would spoil the entire movie. There are some flashbacks in the movie, but all of them are important clues to DiCaprio's character. DiCaprio gives a stunning performance, once again tempting the Academy to give him another Best Actor nomination. DiCaprio gives a vivid portrayal of a vulnerable, haunted and ultimately terrified man. Apart from DiCaprio there's really not much I can say about the supporting cast, because they are all also terrific. Ben Kingsley; Mark Ruffalo; Michelle Williams; Max Von Sydow; Jackie Earle Haley; Emily Mortimer; Patricia Clarkson; Ted Levine; Elias Koteas; John Carroll Lynch. All of them."

","Is Martin Scorsese's Shutter Island a police procedural thriller? A horror movie? Is it a film about someone offered the chance to this time uncover (and thus save) those being held against their will by an exterior force seemingly ungoverned by the rest of a broader representation of a community? Well, yes and no and then yes again and then no and then........well, to go on would be to reveal too much. Rest assured, the film is deceptively simplistic but at the same time non-cryptically complicated – or should that be deceptively complicated and non-cryptically simplistic? It is a film about a lead plunged into a situation that sees him with the capability to help a batch of helpless people trapped on the titular Shutter Island who're falling victim to all manner of sordidness, this at a time when recent demons of having stumbled across a Nazi concentration camp long after it was too late to do anything still resonate. At least, for the most part it is a film about this – irregardless of the bumpy, rickety road full of holes and lumps Scorsese takes us down, Shutter Island suffices as a piece of drama you're be hard pressed not to recommend.<br/><br/>The film follows a Bostonian man named Teddy Daniels, played with an impeccably balanced amount of remorse; fear and anger throughout by that of Leonardo Di Caprio. Daniels is a U.S. Marshall, and is assigned to the titular Shutter Island located off the coast of off Boston Harbor. The island is a place not unfamiliar to grey weather and storms, although rather more so to people stepping off its lone mode of transportation both to and from it in the form of ferry and onto its ground by those who think they can come along and boss about the individuals running it. Daniels is one of these people; a man there to look for someone based on the island who rather recently simply disappeared overnight, but not there to take orders from Ben Kingsley's chief doctor in residence, John Cawley. The two men and their antagonism is apparent from the beginning: where Cawley gives a brief outline of the sorts of people he has on this island of containment and rehabilitation, he is quick to label them ""patients"" present to be cured, with Daniels equally quick to counteract with his view that they are ""prisoners"" omnipresent so as to be punished for crimes.<br/><br/>Daniels nurses some painful events from his past, namely that of that aforementioned wartime discovery of a German concentration camp and the fact that he recently lost his wife. Daniels is there with a fresh face in U.S. Marshalling: that of Mark Ruffalo's Chuck Aule; a guy who verbally establishes Daniels' reputation as a guy to be reckoned with in this career field as they chug on over through the mist and mire to the island. Initial clashings between the somewhat gruff and more carefree investigative duo of Aule and Daniels and that of Cawley and his German psychiatrist Jeremiah Naehring (von Sydow) escalate beyond mere face value; appearance and the nature of how it is they carry out their investigative work: getting out and about searching for clues consequently lined up alongside that of using studies in psychology to uncover truths about people and past situations ""prisoners"" or ""patients"" were dramatically involved in.<br/><br/>Daniels begins to suspect the powers that be on the island are holding back on information, and he launches a crusade going against all the location's rules to try and figure out a bigger picture he believes is at foot – something which intensifies when the person shows up anyway and the film tries to tap into the paranoia and fear rife throughout the respective era in America born out of U.F.O. cover-up conspiracies and Communism infiltration fears. Like his 1976 film Taxi Driver, Scorsese is more than apt at distilling the reality of a lead's world through his own broken subconscious; that is to say, constructing a view of a place (or person, as was evident in The King of Comedy) so intensified that we are propelled into seeing the same object in the same fashion as we're launched into this lead's life and mind. There is about enough substance to keep this 2010 effort grounded throughout, the deft touches implemented during the course of the film allowing a continuous flow of cause, effect and reveal which adds to a burning sense of horror and things seemingly become clearer.<br/><br/>Without Scorsese's deft hand, the film may very well have broken down into farce long before the end credits and one fantastic example of his ability to just move and weave things along is evident when one of the island's chief wardens picks the lead up whilst he was out and about by himself in the forests of the locale following a string of 'reveals' which apparently tell of a greater, darker secret the place holds. Upon picking him up, we are suddenly aware of just how akin to a Nazi Gestapo uniform this warden's clothing actually looks and we think back to if it had always looked like that or whether the film is just toying with us in the immediate present. The film is not the great character study, nor extended piece of narrative film-making, that pieces like 1995's Casino or 1980's Raging Bull were; films playing out across this exasperated amount of time as tensions and distrust boil over between people we never particularly liked. Moreover, it is a genre piece feeding off twists and turns which we accept in a film made by someone we do not feel uneasy in the hand of – the likes of which need not be avoided."

","Leonardo Di Caprio is one of my favourite actors. His performances are flawless and enthralling. I know I'm going to see something special when I watch him perform. He is a fearless actor who makes a difficult craft look simple. He has heart and soul. He's the real deal as far as I'm concerned. Shutter Island is a psychological thriller that keeps you guessing right to the end. It's cleverly directed by Martin Scorsese. The script adapted by Laeta Kalogridis is from Dennis Lehane's novel. The story is set in 1954 on a remote, harsh island. There's nothing tropical and relaxing about this island. It is surrounded by craggy rocks, far from the mainland. The only way onto the island is by ferry. Those who are sent to the island never leave. They are the criminally insane. The most violent, and twisted men and women who are locked up, chained, drugged and experimented on.<br/><br/>US Marshall Teddy Daniels and his partner Chuck are sent to the island to investigate the disappearance of one of the patients who escaped and is believed to be hiding somewhere on the island. Her disappearance is a mystery and a search begins that reveals some shocking truths of what is really happening on this unforgiving, dangerous island where no one can be trusted.<br/><br/>I can highly recommend it as a very well written and directed film with excellent acting performances all round. Ben Kingsley plays psychologist, Dr. Cawley, Mark Ruffalo plays Chuck and Michelle Williams plays Dolores."

","A film with all the right talent. Based on a novel by Lehane, Directed by Scorsese and starring DiCaprio, everyone does a fine job, but play it far too safe. The film is just painfully obvious, but luckily in an enjoyable B-Movie kind of way. It's an island with no escape and the authorities seem as mad as those they are in charge of. If you write down 5 guesses as to what the twist is, chances are you'll get it right. It looks good, and Scorsese's talent does allow for some more memorable artistic moments, such as the dream sequences, but this could have been made for television. Some blink and you'll miss them supporting roles from Koteas and Haley are very welcome. It's DiCaprio and Scorsese having a lot of fun, but the biggest twist would have been having no twist at all."

This mystery,intrigue and curiosity of what's going to happen next fills us since at the very beginning fog scene. But the movie itself wouldn't be so great without its music, Mahler's quartet for piano and strings in a minor at Dr.Naehring introduction in the movie causing the main character Teddy's(starring Di Caprio) flashback about years ago when he liberated the Dachau Konzentrationslager from Nazis and executed them all. The music is important because it touches our heart's wires more then the visual part,as in the dream and nightmare sequences of Teddy. The music throughout the movie mostly expresses pain( Teddy's memories), suspanse and scare(first nightmare scene at Dachau), but Mahler's strings in a minor at a particular part became very ironic and sarcastic showing that this movie has all the colors of the rainbow.

","Without doubt this is one of my favourite films of last year, so here is my review, enjoy!<br/><br/>Plot Summary Shutter Island, adapted for the big screen from the book by Denis Lehane, is the story of U.S Marshall Teddy Daniels (DiCaprio) who is sent to Shutter Island, a spooky looking, fog covered island home to a mental institute for the criminally insane. He is too investigate the escape and disappearance of an inmate at the institute along with the help of his partner Chuck (Rufallo).<br/><br/>What I thought of it I must admit, I'm quite the fan of Leonardo DiCaprio, a lot of my favourite films have him in ('Departed', 'Inception', 'Catch Me If You Can' etc) so I was quietly confident that this was going to be another great of his especially as, like 'departed', it was directed by Martin Scorsese.<br/><br/>All of my pre-conceptions were true when watching this, both DiCaprio and Ruffalo give great memorable performances. DiCaprio's role turns out to be a very dark role, in which his character is struggling mentally with so much, not just with the job at hand but also the loss of his wife in an apartment fire. Throughout the film these thoughts going through his head get harder to ignore and completely change the character, which DiCaprio portrays exceedingly well.<br/><br/>Both actor and director do a fantastic job of messing with our emotions and feelings in this film, really making us draw strong opinions of certain characters, of which often change throughout the course of the film.<br/><br/>Summary Many people have criticised and labelled this film as being a typical DiCaprio film with a predictable and obvious ending, I must disagree! This film has some great twists and turns of which I expected none, and the performances given by all of the actors involved are some of there personal bests.<br/><br/>I would definitely give this film a watch whether your a fan of DiCaprio or not, this may change your opinion.... 8/10 Stars"

"itamarscomix","6","0","1","23 September 2011"," A disappointment
","After all these years, Scorsese is yet to have made a bad movie; while contemporaries Spielberg and Coppola sunk to mediocrity long ago, Scorsese is still one of the most versatile and skilled directors in the world. Shutter Island is no exception; it's not a bad movie. But it's not a great movie either.<br/><br/>Funnily enough, Scorsese, who used to stand at the forefront of avant-garde and artistic cinema in Hollywood, serves in the new millennium as the voice of classic, old-school cinema, often verging on nostalgia. That works perfectly in the often bashed The Departed, which was unpretending piece of straight entertainment. The problem with Shutter Island - an obvious call back to thrillers of the 40's and 50's, to Carol Reed, Hitchcock and Wilder - is that it tries to be more, and as a psychological film of substance and depth it barely succeeds.<br/><br/>It's a terrific success as an entertaining, gripping thriller though - that is, as long as you repress the urge we have as modern viewers to take the twist ending as the most important element in the film; because the twist ending is quite predictable and almost anti-climatic, it can easily disappoint if you put too much emphasis on it, and it's easy to miss the fact that the moment of reveal wasn't meant to be the film's climax. Shutter Island makes no new discoveries - there's no real insight and there's no real mystery. There's lots of atmosphere, solid acting, fantastic music, editing and cinematography, and above all - entertainment. Taken like that at face value, it's quite enjoyable, but don't expect a revelation."

","In ""Shutter Island,"" director Martin Scorsese presents a dark and twisted mystery, chockfull of heroes and villains. What makes the film exceptionally intriguing is the way the line between reality and fantasy is blurred.<br/><br/>The film is based on Dennis Lehane's novel and stars award winning actors and nominees Leonardo DiCaprio and Mark Ruffalo. It was screened at my local movie theater, a dilapidated building one step behind the time. You get what you pay for, which can be a good or bad thing. But the cheap ticket and food price and short lines add to the experience, and, ironically tied into the obscure film. ""Shutter Island"" takes place during the Cold War, a turbulent time enriched with conspiracy. U.S. Marshal Teddy Daniels (DiCaprio), and his partner Chuck (Ruffalo) team up on an investigation to Shutter Island, to investigate a missing person, Rachel Solando (Emily Mortimer), who mysteriously disappeared. The Island is home to a mental hospital that cures the criminally insane. It's located off the coast of Boston, but seems miles away from civilization and sanity. Once the investigation is underway, Daniels becomes suspicious. He thinks the institution is keeping secrets and spinning a web of corruption. And then out of nowhere, Solando is found. This detail begins the series of confusing mind games during the film. You begin to realize something strange is occurring, but you're left confused, musing over the possibilities. Daniels' investigation transforms into a relentless investigation of his own personal demons. He's forced to confront his past, hallucinations of his dead wife that become frequent as he loses grasp on reality. At this point in the movie, things become thrilling. The only way to get off the island is by ferry, which the authorities control. Daniels becomes trapped, physically and mentally. Suspense heightens as he desperately tries to distinguish truths from lies, unravel the hidden secrets embedded in the island, before he turns mad. Between the investigation, Daniels' hallucination, and the mysterious behavior of the hospital staff, ""Shutter Island's"" plot becomes a dramatic blur. The audience spends the entire film trying to understand what's happening, paralleling with Daniels experience of grasping reality. Warning: if you don't like puzzles or brainteasers avoid this film at all costs, because you are essentially paying for a mind game. The end of the movie is flipped. Daniels is cast as insane and the institution's presented in a new light. With all the chatter of frustration filling the theater, it sounded as if the audience was sent on a whirlwind. <br/><br/>A simple ""Google"" search for possible endings points into a direction of various theories. But, maybe the whole point of the movie is not to determine what exactly happened, but to get you to think in the first place. The beauty of this is, the story can unfold both ways. Each hypothesis can be supported with different evidence. This hazy line between the reality and fantasy is what makes ""Shutter Island"" a cinematic enigma. You're in for a dark surprise."

","In today's world, we humans rarely, if ever, compliment someone for doing a job well done. We are quick to criticize, but slow to congratulate good work. Perhaps because we see more bad than good. The movie Shutter Island, however, is an example of good (perhaps great) work and why I am taking the time to publicly say so. <br/><br/>For me, most of the movies made today stink. This is because the story-lines/scripts are usually moronic, full of logic holes and silliness. This movie is different in that the overall story makes sense and -at the end- left me with a complete feeling of satisfaction. It is a movie that requires patience. I found the first 1 hr and 45 minutes required me to watch and listen, but not think. To basically, ""GO WITH THE FLOW"". To try to guess the ending or anticipate what would come next was, for me, a waste of time and would ultimately only ruin this movie.<br/><br/>In my opinion, this movie has three things in its favor. A great script, strong acting and excellent directing. The first part of this movie sets the stage while the last 30 minutes provide the climax and tie all that has gone before together, which is why it pays to watch and listen. <br/><br/>Shutter Island is an excellent (horror, thriller, mind games, you decide) film. As an earlier reviewer said and I quote: ""There is one line of dialogue, right at the end of Shutter Island before the credits roll, that elevates the emotion of the film and makes it much more powerful."". I gave this movie 9 out of 10 stars not because it does not deserve 10, but because as I said before I spent the early part of the movie more as an observer than as a participant. It was not until near the end of the movie that I felt emotionally connected. This is an excellent movie and something VERY rare in today's world A movie worthy of public compliment."

The head warden Dr. Cawley (Ben Kingsley) outlines the mystery ""as if she evaporated through the walls."" <br/><br/>As Teddy carries out his investigation, things start to fall out of place more readily than they fall into it, and events start to lead Teddy to the conclusion that everyone is conspiring to let this dangerous criminal disappear without helping him locate her. Why then, was he brought here? And why can't he leave? At first, it's because a raging storm cuts off the ferry service. And then...well...<br/><br/>SHUTTER ISLAND conjures those fears of walking into a psyche ward and not being able to walk out again, because people start treating YOU as insane. Didn't we learn anything from ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST? Teddy arrived with his partner Chuck; halfway through his stay, Dr. Cawley begins asking him, ""What partner? You came here alone."" <br/><br/>One of the characters nails the paradox: ""People tell the world you're crazy, and all your protests to the contrary just confirm what they're saying. Once you're declared insane, then anything you do is called part of that insanity; any reasonable protests are denial, any valid fears are paranoia..."" <br/><br/>Ruffalo is enjoyable as always, bringing a breezy humor to what could have turned into a darker role; Max von Sydow brings enough dark for everyone as a foreboding old doctor; even Elias Koteas, a prisoner whose face looks like it was put together by Victor Frankenstein, isn't as scary as von Sydow; Patricia Clarkson makes an intriguing appearance as a woman hiding out in a cave, who may just be who Teddy is looking for. Or she may just be a figment of his imagination. Or our imagination. Or maybe we're just watching INCEPTION and need to stop kidding ourselves that they'll let us out of here alive...<br/><br/>From a novel by Dennis Lehane, Martin Scorcese directs - or should that be ""misdirects""? - brilliantly, never revealing enough information to give away the game, yet egging us on with just enough to tie us into a straightjacket.

It wasn't until a friend recommended it that I decided to watch it. I'm really glad I listened.<br/><br/>The pace of the movie is excellent and there's enough intrigue that it kept me going till the end and when the twist was revealed I sat back and thought ""Whoa!"" It's even better the second time through because then you know what's happening and the outcome and this time you just try to understand how it all works.<br/><br/>The whole cast, with the exception of Mark Ruffalo (whom I don't really much care for as an actor) are perfect for their roles and Leonardo Dicaprio really takes to the role of Teddy Daniels. Credit also goes to the writers for the movie, and the author, Dennis Lehane, who's book is the source of the movie and has also had a couple of other movie translations, most notably Mystic River and Gone Baby Gone.<br/><br/>So, in essence, this is one of 2010 best movies of the year, after Inception, and it is a must watch. To better understand and enjoy the clever and interesting story a second viewing is highly recommended!"
"Buddy-51","9","0","3","16 June 2011"," stylistically complex, sophisticated psychological thriller
","Martin Scorsese's ""Shutter Island"" is a psychological thriller done in a florid, grand opera style.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio and Mark Ruffalo play two federal marshals circa the 1950s who've been sent to an isolated institute for the criminally insane, run by Max Von Sydow and Ben Kingsley, to investigate the mysterious disappearance of one of the patients there, a Medea-like figure who killed her own children a number of years back. DiCaprio's character is also haunted by memories and dreams of his young wife (Michelle Williams) who died in a fire, and by his own traumatizing experience liberating Dachau at the close of World War II. The two investigators soon discover that everything is not quite what it appears to be on Shutter Island and that indeed something quite nefarious and sinister may be going on there.<br/><br/>Ever the agent provocateur, Scorsese brings a healthy dose of his trademarked purple-prose filmmaking style to the proceedings. He sets his tale against a backdrop of howling winds, crashing waves and falling trees, punctuated by thundering chords pounding away on the soundtrack. It may make the movie seem preposterously pretentious at first, but we soon learn that there is a method to Scorsese's madness, as what appears initially to be gratuitous showmanship on the part of the director becomes an integral part of the work once the details of the story emerge.<br/><br/>This theme of who-is-truly-mad-and-who-is-truly-sane in this world has been played out many times before in the movies, but ""Shutter Island"" brings a level of sophistication to it that is really quite impressive. The movie keeps us guessing at every stage of the drama, with the twists and turns of the storyline drawing us ever deeper into the surrealistic, fractured world it's created for itself.<br/><br/>DiCaprio and Ruffalo both turn in outstanding performances, but this is Scorsese's movie all the way."

","I watched Martin Scorsese's Shutter Island. To be perfectly honest, it is one of the best movies I have ever watched. Because it has some attractive points that can attract anyone else watched this movie and it has good pictures and music. If we touch on this film from different point, it is a film you should watch carefully. That is another thing that is needed to evaluate, it is a horror film that makes you actually think. In this day and age, I'm not surprised some found it excellent. Scorsese's ultimate goal here is to wake you up. And trust me, you probably will like it and be so surprise.<br/><br/>This is also a film I would recommend seeing a second time. In fact, it is even better the second time. All those pieces of that puzzle you didn't catch the first time, you will the second. You see, we as the audience are first put in the shoes of Teddy. The second? Well, without giving too much away, let's just say you are put in someone else's shoes entirely during the second viewing. Also the actors wonderful performances from Leonardo DiCaprio, Ben Kingsley and Mark Ruffalo. So it is worth watching. The problem with Shutter Island is that we know we are not going to get many laughs or big action scenes going in. It is a ""question mark"" sort of film, as in Who? What? Where? Why? How? Because it poses these questions we the audience start predicting and hypothesizing from the first few minutes. To sum up if you are trying to find a different film to watch in these days, it will be best choice that you can make. It is clearly worth watching and I don't want you become sorry that you didn't watch it yet."

"dave54t","8","0","1","16 May 2011"," what was the problem with this film?
","On its face, this film has all the right ingredients: great cast, the acting was superb, the story well told, there is a twist which i did not see coming- and still, when it was over, I felt as if something was missing. I saw it few times, and the feeling that something was missing did not go away. so what was it? and then, two nights ago, when I saw part of it, again, it struck me: the twist did not make things that happened throughout the film- sensible. let me explain: the sixth sense told a story that was engaging and well played. and then came the twist, and you said: woo... right!!! that explains! and seeing it the second time, things that in the first time went unnoticed, made so much sense now... all of the sudden you saw things that you did not really pay attention to when you saw it for the first time. Knowing the twist just added to the pleasure when you watch it again. That component is missing from Shutter Island. Nothing throughout the story evolves from the twist (when you watch it again), and the twist shed no new light on the events that took place up to that moment. The twist doesn't give new meaning to scenes played before it. on the contrary- the script up to the twist aim to confuse you and to make you think that you see the real thing. and when you see (watching it the second time) the cop that turned out to be something else, you don't see him differently. he is still the same cop that will turn out to be... something else. So while the twist does give different meaning to the story, it has no real depth. But nonetheless, it is a very good film, and you do want to see it."

","This film is way too long. The flashback sequences of both his wife and Dachau death camp need to be edited down, or out completely.

A friend says it gains on a second viewing, which normally I'm open to, but I don't know if I have the patience to sit through it again.<br/><br/>The film is very well cast - especially Kingsley and Max von Sydow! Leonardo and Mark Ruffalo are also very good.<br/><br/>Actually the best part of this film is the soundtrack - mostly modern 2oth Century composer such as Ligeti, Penderecki etc. As a rule, I don't buy soundtracks, but this is an exception!

","When I went o see ""Shutter Island"", all I knew about the movie was the obvious: it was about an island and DiCaprio acted in it. The Portuguese translation of the title, hugely misleading (""Ilha do Medo"" = ""Island of Fear"") made me believe this was going to be just another horror flick.<br/><br/>Boy, was I glad I was wrong!<br/><br/>""Shutter Island"" is filled with symbolisms and hidden meanings in almost 100% of the scenes composing the movie. So much interpretation can be drawn from this movie. Unlike many other movies out there, it feels complete. It feels perfect, there's nothing missing. Following Teddy (Leonardo DiCaprio) through his visit to Shutter Island will make you feel like you're there, going through the same things he is all throughout the numerous twists and turns the movie takes.<br/><br/>The soundtrack to this movie is just superb, fitting the movie like a glove and driving it through different feelings and ambiances. Visually this movie is just beautiful, the contrasts used are just a wonder to look at, I couldn't take my eyes away for a second.<br/><br/>The acting was incredibly top notch. Leonardo DiCaprio makes an outstanding job (which he got us used to). Mark Ruffalo (Chuck) and Ben Kingsley (Dr. Cawley) are amazing as well, bringing his characters into life making them feel like they are real. Even if a bit overshadowed by DiCaprio.

","It's a very great movie. An FBI Marshal is going to a mental institution on an island (Shutter Island) , this place is specifically used for this matter and just very special and dangerous patients are kept here. The case is a patient break out the facility. She is dangerous and they searched the entire island but couldn't find it. After a while the marshal finds out some strange evidence telling him the facility is doing illegal and barbaric operations on patients, in his way to find it he suspects his partner and finds out the entire mission was to catch him in here, when you finally think he is reaching his goal in finding the secret place of this facility, you will see that he was just a patient of this facility, his wife killed their 3 kids, and he killed her and after that because he couldn't forgive himself created a new self and named it Ted, (the marshal), all this movie he was searching to find someone named Andrew Leadis , the guy burned his town house to ground that made his wife delusional. The thing is, He, himself, is Andrew Leadis. But the reality is so hard to believe.<br/><br/>The hospital's Doctor made all this so he can live what he believes so maybe he finally accepts the reality. At the end you see him still believe in the strange facility and so on.<br/><br/>The direction and scenario is fabulous, one of the best. I hadn't seen like it for a long time. The acting is great as well, the thing is everything is so greatly directed that I just needed to see it once more, to find out everything. You see the story the first time from Ted's eyes, just like a mental patient sees so at the end, you understand why he can't believe the doctors. You really feel what a mental patient is feeling, and it's all normal to you, so you really will doubt about your health as well."
"Jerique","9","0","2","24 March 2011"," Leonardo shines!
","This is Leo's best performance on the year. I didn't see this movie when it came out but I saw Inception. I loved Inception and although, I thought he was tremendous in the film, he is far better here.<br/><br/>Shutter Island takes you on a tale of two Federal Marshals who visit a Shutter Island because a woman escapes the mental institute. Chuck (Mark Ruffalo) and Teddy (Leonardo DiCaprio) go to investigate the area for the missing person.<br/><br/>However, this movie plays a lot like A Beautiful Mind where a lot weird things start to happen and we as an audience and the main character start to believe this given world as ludicrous as it seems. Well, that's the genius in the movie, really. All these things happen and we believe them and in the climax of the film, they are all brought to us in a big connecting answer and we take that at face value too. It's the brilliance of the screen writing that does it.<br/><br/>But, I'm not going to miss on giving credit where it's due. Ben Kingsley plays a prominent role in being the reliable source for the movie as the doctor on Shutter Island. He provides a good grounding for the film and he is the main audience character. Michelle Williams, although I've only seen her in Dawson's Creek, does a good job of making us ask during every scene she is in: ""what is going on?"" Perhaps in his best role to date, Leonardo shines at all times. He plays the lead role and is mesmerizing from start to finish, and especially in the climax of the film, he truly seems like he is the character and not just simply acting.<br/><br/>My only flaw with this film was the slow pacing of the first 25 minutes or so. It takes quite a bit for the two main leads to tell the audience why they are really there on Shutter Island. I was questioning what the movie was really about up to that point. Once it was said, the movie took off at a faster pacing and it didn't let up.<br/><br/>It's definitely a disturbing film without being filled with gore like Saw, or profanity, or themes or scares like Nightmare on Elm Street, but it's disturbing in the sense that this gets under your skin. It eats at you and if you watch this at night in darkness, I guarantee you'll turn on all the lights afterward. It's one of those movies that you just feel the need to relax your mind after it is over.<br/><br/>I'm happy I finally watched the movie because it is truly one of the best on the year. It was a great psychological thriller (without needing the thrilling aspect) and I'm glad that Martin and Leo collaborated again and I can't wait to see the next film of theirs. Leonardo is quickly becoming my favourite actor. He's getting better and better; he's like a fine wine."

That was enough for me. I suppose I thought that it was some kind of detective tale, so I was surprised and shaken to find that this is a much darker and more surreal story than I had imagined.<br/><br/>Set on an American prison island in 1954 and based (apparently faithfully) on a novel by Dennis Lehane, we find federal marshal Teddy Daniels (DiCaprio) and his new colleague (Mark Ruffalo) investigating the mysterious disappearance of a prisoner from the institution led by a seemingly benevolent doctor (Ben Kinglsley) - but little is what it seems in a contrived but clever narrative that never releases its icy grip.<br/><br/>If you've seen the 1919 German silent film ""The Cabinet Of Dr Caligari"", you might have some idea of what to expect.

","A classic psychological thriller based on Dennis Lehane's eponymous novel.<br/><br/>The movie starts with the arrival of detectives Teddy Daniels and Chuck Aule at the Ashecliffe Mental Hospital on Shutter island to investigate the disappearance of Rachel Solando from her isolation room, and narrates the twists of the investigation, in which Marshal Teddy will find himself personally involved.<br/><br/>The film is well acted, especially by Di Caprio as Detective Teddy -in a role that he plays with great easiness and believability- and Michel Williams as his sensitive deceased wife Dolores. Ben Kingsley (as Dr. John Cawley), Max von Sydow (as Dr. Jeremiah Naehring) and Mark Ruffalo (as Chuck Aule) are all correct in their performances.<br/><br/>The plot is not especially original, somewhat predictable, but it is well carried out. There are a few flaws and inconsistencies in the story, but, overall, it is very engaging and enjoyable, thanks to Scorsese's masterful direction, Di Caprio's performance and the artistic team of the movie. The mood is excellent, and mixes the feeling of the noire films of the 1950s with modern themes. The oniric images are truly beautiful and intrinsically connected to the story, and so are the special effects used in them.<br/><br/>A very entertaining thriller, with a few flaws."

","This dark looking film was bigged up quite a lot at the time of release, and it was the fourth time director Martin Scorsese was teaming up with his star of Gangs of New York, I had to see what this film was about. Basically set in 1954, World War II veteran and current federal marshal Edward ""Teddy"" Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his new partner Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo) are heading to Ashecliffe Hospital for the criminally insane on Shutter Island located in Boston Harbor. They are investigating the disappearance of patient Rachel Solando (Emily Mortimer), who was incarcerated for drowning her three children, but the staff are confrontational, lead psychiatrist Dr. John Cawley (Sir Ben Kingsley) refuses to turn over records, and Solando's doctor, Dr. Sheehan, left the island for vacation immediately after her disappearance. Daniels has constant migraine headaches and is haunted by both his experiences in the Dachau liberation reprisals, and the death of his wife Dolores Chanal (Michelle Williams), killed in a fire started by local arsonist Andrew Laeddis, he also has a vision of his wife telling him that Solando is still on the island somewhere, the same applies with Laeddis, although everyone claims he was never there to begin with, Daniels tells Aule his ulterior motive for taking the case is to find Laeddis. Solando suddenly resurfaces, with no explanation of where she was or how she escaped, so Daniels breaks into the restricted Ward C, there he encounters patient George Noyce (A Nightmare on Elm Street remake's Jackie Earle Haley) in solitary confinement, he warns Daniels the doctors are performing questionable experiments on the patients, the lighthouse has significance, and everyone, including Aule, is playing an elaborate game specifically designed for Daniels. Daniels is determined to investigate the lighthouse, while climbing the rocks he is separated from Aule, below he finds a cave, with a woman hiding, she claims to be the real Rachel Solando (Patricia Clarkson), a former psychiatrist at the hospital, who discovered the psychotropic medication experiments and trans-orbital lobotomies, she was forcibly committed to Ashecliffe as a patient before she could report her findings. Returning to the hospital, Daniels cannot find Aule, he is convinced he has been taken to the lighthouse, he breaks into it, only to discover Cawley calmly waiting there for him, he explains to Daniels he is in fact Andrew Laeddis, ""the most dangerous patient"", incarcerated for murdering his manic depressive wife after she drowned their children, Edward Daniels and Rachel Solando are anagrams of Andrew Laeddis and Dolores Chanal. Cawley explains that the past several days have been designed to allow Laeddis to play out the role of Daniels and break his conspiracy- laden insanity, all hospital staff, including Dr. Sheehan posing as Aule and a nurse posing as Rachel Solando, were part of the test, Laeddis faints as reality and realisation hit him. Laeddis awakes in the hospital, watched by Cawley and Shaheen, the doctors are satisfied with his progression when he tells the truth in a coherent manner, Cawley notes that he achieved this state nine months before, but quickly regressed, this test was Laeddis' last chance to redeem himself. In the end, Laeddis calls Dr. Sheehan by the name ""Chuck"" and says they need to leave the island, Shaheen shakes his head to gesture the experiment has not worked, but before Laeddis is taken away to have a lobotomy, he says """"Which would be worse? To live as a monster, or die as a good man?"", suggesting that he is in fact sane, it is presumed Laeddis cannot live with what he has done. Also starring Max Von Sydow as Dr. Jeremiah Naehring, Ted Levine as Warden, Elias Koteas as Laeddis and Volcano's John Carroll Lynch as Deputy Warden McPherson. DiCaprio gives a terrific performance as the investigator who gets more than he bargained for when he takes on a case, and there is good support from Ruffalo and Kingsley, the Gothic surroundings and operatic thrills work well, you can predict the big twist before the end, and it is the slightest bit too long, but if you want something creepy and gripping then it is not disappointing, a quite good mystery thriller.

"mmichelletoby","9","0","2","21 January 2011"," A must see!
","Master filmmaker Martin Scorsese has returned to the big screen with his first full-length feature film in four years (2006's The Departed-winner of the Academy Award for Best Picture). Shutter Island tells the story of U.S. Marshall Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his partner Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo). The two Marshalls are called upon to investigate the mysterious escape and disappearance of a dangerous patient (Emily Mortimer) at Ashecliffe Hospital, an isolated and stark facility saturated with dark secrets, and run by the ominous Dr. Cawley (played magnificently by Ben Kingsley), and his associate, Dr Nehring (Max von Sydow). Everyone on the island seems to be hiding something, including the patients, who are mostly there for horrific and violent crimes.<br/><br/>Daniels and his partner begin to suspect that Cawley and his institution have hidden agendas, and as they dig deeper and deeper into the island's secrets, their investigation takes strange and startling turns, which lead them to wonder if they will ever be able to leave. The story is set in 1954, which allows Scorsese to skillfully play around with genre, and to tie in post WWII themes and looming Cold War fears and conspiracies. Daniels' traumatic experiences at concentration camps weave in and out of his dreams, as do visions of his deceased wife, Delores (Michelle Williams).<br/><br/>A great admirer of Scorsese's films, it's no surprise to me that his newest work has managed to seep deep into my thoughts, and to lurk there long after I've exited the theatre. Notice the words ""seep"" and ""lurk"". The diction I've decided on here is no accident, but rather a fluid way of describing the means by which the film works on our senses. It slowly and meticulously grinds its rusty gears toward the fascinating climax, and the foreboding hurricane approaching the island heightens the stakes and greatly enhances the atmosphere that Scorsese and veteran cinematographer, Robert Richardson, immerse us in. This will inevitable be compared to Scorsese's remake of Cape Fear in 1991, as well it should be. They are both exercises in pure style, and I myself went into this with Cape Fear in mind. It's better to examine this as a separate entity, and to appreciate the stylish elements by which the characters come to realizations and revelations.<br/><br/>Dennis Lehane, whose previous novels Mystic River and Gone Baby Gone were also made into excellent films, wrote the source novel. His material seems to translate very well from page to screen, and I look forward to reading the novel in the future. This may not be the best adaptation of his work, but it is certainly the most prominent of the three films, and that has everything to do with Scorsese's ferocity and craftsmanship. He doesn't make wimpy movies, and this is no exception. It's a B Movie, but its one made by a director who knows exactly what he's doing every step of the way. It's fragmented, sure, but maybe it needs to be that way.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio manages to deliver one of his finest performances as the tortured and hard-edged Teddy Daniels, and Mark Ruffalo does some excellent work here as his timid partner. Scorsese plays off of Hitchcock a lot in this film, and like in any Hitchcock movie, everyone is suspicious, and the truth is buried beneath layers of deceit. As more and more layers are peeled away from their surroundings, they become part of something much grander and enigmatic that they were sent for. The facility is a fortress, surrounded by electric fences and treacherous cliffs, which stormy waves slosh and grind against, corroding away the rocks below. It's a long way down."
"vogonify","5","0","1","19 January 2011"," Definitely Ambiguous
","Martin Scorsese again borrows material and creates a dark document of the workings of a disturbed mind. While doing so he also plays with yours and by the end of Shutter Island, you come with a solid coin back: heads, it ended this way, tails, it ended that way. Keeping the coin aside for a minute, it feels impossible for Scorsese to have given you the result of that toss himself. He walks on a fine, fine edge and more or less leaves the film there in a cloud of ambiguity.<br/><br/>The film begins with a sea-sick Leonardo di Caprio leading a team of two to Shutter Island, a mental institution for criminals, to investigate the mysterious disappearance of an inmate. As they approach the island, the captain of the ship asks them to disembark quickly, because a ""storm's comin'"". You know it isn't just a weather storm. The eerie look of the first five minutes will bring a more pressing storm which might affect both the protagonists and you. It is, as always with Scorsese's films, part of creating an atmosphere for the film to draw you in. A storm is worth it only if it can scare everyone on either side of the movie screen. Scorsese carries the film with utmost care: like a hero trying to disconnect a time bomb not knowing which coloured wire to cut. The only problem is that Shutter Island has to be definitely ambiguous. If it goes one way, it becomes a cheap action thriller and if it goes the other, it becomes a supernatural film. You can tell, very soon into the film, that there might not be many ways to end it. Because Scorsese won't sell his film cheap he has to resort to a more intricate formula, but formula it is. So what remains is some of the elements that make it his film. There is Leonardo di Caprio, of course. There is his unique way of using the camera to tell a story. There is the atmosphere which draws you in at least till the end of the film. But there is very little else Scorsese. Which is perhaps his most significant signature on a non- gangster film."

","This is Scorsese's first real step into the horror genre, or rather a step closer to it, as in reality this isn't so much a horror as it is a psychological thriller. It is based on the book by Dennis Lehane; it tells the story of U.S. Marshall Teddy Daniels and his new partner Chuck Aule, assigned to the case of an escaped patient at Boston's Shutter Island Ashecliffe Hospital for the criminally insane. Having arrived, it becomes apparent to Teddy that there is more to this escape than anybody on the island is letting on, and when he is refused access to the hospital records, he becomes convinced there is a conspiracy at work. With a storm cutting communications and transport off the island, the scene is set for a compelling, exciting, and rather mind-bending thriller.<br/><br/>The fourth outing for DiCaprio with Scorsese, and it is clear there is no stopping the wonders they work together. Truth is, this is a B-movie, but it's dressed up as a main feature by the production value, director and cast, which includes a very good Mark Ruffalo and a surprising turn from Max Von Syndow. We get hard-boiled, 50's pulp-style performances, with everybody having a lot of fun in their roles (most notably Ben Kingsley, as the suspicious Dr. Cawley), and an over the top, obtuse soundtrack. The film is self-aware, however, and the nods towards classic Film Noir (there are distinct echoes of the Alan Parker classic with De Niro and Mickey Rourke, 'Angel Heart'), and Hitchcock, are more than obvious. It could be said that if Hitchcock were alive, doing today what he was known for in his time, this is the film he would probably make.<br/><br/>There is a sense with the film that Scorsese picked it up to have some fun, in an area he hasn't really visited, before going back to being a ""serious"" filmmaker, but the things that make him one of the most important directors of all time are still very much present. His camera language to tell the story remains second to none (and on repeat viewing, it proves to be very clever), and his Hitchcock-style 'trick shots' and some devious editing are nicely shown off. The unexpected moments of humour never interrupt the dark tone of the piece, the tension ratchets up well as the drama unfolds, and the emotional level the film hits is actually quite surprising.<br/><br/>A big thing I would address is the twist to the film, which there is a already a lot of debate over. As previously mentioned, the device itself is one that we aren't unfamiliar with in contemporary cinema, and I did find myself thinking that if you don't at least have a suspicion as to the way it is going to play out by a certain point in the film, then you're really not trying very hard. That said, in watching how Scorsese executes the action, I genuinely got the feeling he already acknowledges this, and so it is no surprise that it is he, not Lehane, who is responsible for the extra spice added to the finale<br/><br/>Though I personally did see it coming, I must say the final act of the film is more elaborate than I would have expected, and what I really like is how its intension seems to be to put the audience in a spin and place you firmly in the character's shoes, which it does successfully. It is also rather impressive how the twist to 'Shutter Island', unlike most which simply turn the story in a direction you didn't expect, really opens up various interpretations on everything you have just seen, meaning the film begs to be watched a second time. Upon repeat viewing, it is clear that it is smarter than you first thought, multi-layered, with imagery and dialogue intricately woven to create a rich design, incorporating not only the story as it stands, but also very subtle commentaries on the treatment of the mentally ill, communism and World War 2. What is great about these things is that they are not over-bearing and don't have to be there if you choose not to look for them.<br/><br/>Is it Scorsese at his best? Certainly not; it's a little baggy and it doesn't carry the ""Classic"" stamp like 'Goodfellas', 'Taxi Driver' and 'The Aviator', but I would argue that he didn't expect it to. As I say, it still carries many of the technical fingerprints that make it undeniably Scorsese, so treat it as I think he did, a little bit of twisted, exciting fun! Go with it, and you'll thoroughly enjoy yourself"

","This movie, is simply one of the best I have seen. It tricks your mind in a very nice and amazing way, you will believe what you see, then you find out all that was wrong, that you've been tricked, it's truly amazing.<br/><br/>Despite the great story, the direction and all the acting was also brilliant. You just need to watch the movie twice to see what I mean. At first, when you have no idea that Teddy is insane, you won't suspect a thing. But when you watch it for the second time, you will find out just how great the plot has been pulled off. E.g, when Teddy arrives at the island, just take a closer look at the guards. They, as Teddy says, seem ""a bit on edge"". And as the chief replies, ""Right now marshal, we all are."" He is just regarding the fact that Teddy/Andrew, is no marshal, he's just another insane criminal, and they are not really happy to him being so on the loose.<br/><br/>I rate this movie 9/10 and it doesn't deserve any less<br/><br/>TO THOSE WHO HAVEN'T WATCHED THE FILM: DON'T MISS IT!!!"

"Ytadel","7","0","1","2 December 2010"," Broadly written but aggressively stylish noir pulp
","Shutter Island is the pulpiest film Scorsese's ever done. That's not in any way to say that it's the worst film Scorsese's ever done, simply the pulpiest. Martin Scorsese is a director who generally aims to make great, classic cinema almost every time he steps up to the plate, a tendency that would be annoying as hell if he weren't literally one of the best artists ever to work in any medium through all recorded history, so it's interesting and a bit unexpected to see him unleash his talent after a four-year gap since The Departed onto the first pure, unapologetic popcorn-muncher of his career.<br/><br/>And if you thought that the tough cops and thick Boston accents and blaring Dropkick Murphys music of The Departed lacked subtlety, then Shutter Island is gonna really ruin your day. This is noir pulp drawn in the broadest possible strokes: fog and gloom penetrate everything, the shadows are long and black, the buildings ominous, the cliffs jagged and foreboding, the wind and rain and lightning overpowering and exhausting, and the performances very flashy; all creepy glances and ragged dialogue and intense whispering that would border on overacting were they not in such able directorial hands. It's the cinematic equivalent of a master artist doing his latest painting in primary colors. It's such an immensely stylish movie that it overcomes any narrative shortcomings to stand proud as an impressive thriller.<br/><br/>The movie opens with a U.S. Marshal played by Leo DiCaprio on a boat to the Ashecliff Hospital for the criminally insane on Shutter Island. He and his partner have been brought in to investigate the case of patient, Rachel Solando, who seems to have impossibly escaped from her secure cell. As a hurricane settles over the island the findings of DiCaprio's investigation become less and less explicable and more and more personal and we descend into a psychological nightmare that comes to include secrets, conspiracies, escapes, chases, and at least one explosion. The film's format of exponentially swelling insanity restricted to one fixed location is more than a bit reminiscent of Kubrick's The Shining.<br/><br/>I'll say straight up that I don't think this movie has a particularly great script. Not a bad one, mind you, but the magic here is indisputably on the set and behind the camera, not at the typewriter. You don't have to be even close to as big a cinephile as I am to see exactly where things are going, and the movie adds insult to injury by incorporating an extremely lengthy exposition dump that goes so far as to include a character pulling out an honest-to-god blackboard on which to explain the plot.<br/><br/>So yes, in the hands of a lesser director with lesser aesthetics, Shutter Island could have been raw mediocrity. But man, the aesthetics — I just love the style of this movie, so much that I hope Scorsese does another equally blunt, subtlety-free movie, and soon. Shutter Island generates so much thick tension out of thin air that it's incredible; the nightmare just keeps building, the pacing aggressive and the movie getting more sinister by the minute. The cinematography is gorgeous, a perfect representation of what modern noir can and should be, except for when we cut to DiCaprio's dream sequences filmed in vivid, breathtaking color. Not noir, but still gorgeous.<br/><br/>Speaking of DiCaprio, I think this is probably his third best performance yet outside of Catch Me If You Can and The Departed, overcoming any vestiges of lingering boyishness and giving a driven depiction of the tough cop at the film's center. Ben Kingsley however still ends up dominating as the head doctor of Ashecliff, with some help from Max von Sydow, together forming a duo of unparalleled creepiness. Like most everyone else in the film they aren't playing it low-key, but they'll make your skin crawl and they greatly spice up any and every scene they're in.<br/><br/>I mean it in a good way, more or less, when I say that Shutter Island represents a triumph of style over substance. It probably won't be nominated for Best Picture and I don't think it needs to be, and it actively doesn't deserve any writing awards, but it's simply a really cool and stylish bit of detective pulp with a psychological horror coat of paint on it. I think the teenage male standing in front of me in line for Alice in Wonderland said it best: ""I went to see Shutter Island but I ran out and went home as soon as they showed a dick on the screen, because I was afraid I was gonna see another dick."""

","Shutter Island opens with two cops aboard a ferry destined to arrived at the titular destination, they are Teddy Daniels and his new partner Chuck, although we know them better as Leonardo Di Caprio and Mark Ruffalo.<br/><br/>It is 1954. Shutter Island is an isolated land mass, with the only notable feature being a large mental hospital to house the criminally insane. Once ashore Teddy and Chuck are given the rundown, no guns, nothing done without prior approval, and no going to Ward C, the local police are all heavily armed and seem very touchy, which is probably understandable when you are surrounded by homicidal lunatics each workday.<br/><br/>They are told that Dr Cowley runs the show, and everything that they do must first be approved by him, we learn that Dr Cowley has embraced some extremely way out techniques in an effort to cure patients without resorting to measures that society deems inhumane. (You know, the old slicing out a chunk of brain thing!) Teddy and Chuck are on the island investigating the escape/disappearance of a woman who killed all three of her children in cold blood, only she thinks they are still alive, her name is Rachel Solando.<br/><br/>In the early proceedings it seems that no-one is willing to be very forthcoming or provide much assistance to aid the investigation, and after an impromptu unflattering analysis from another psychiatrist, played by Max Von Sydow, Teddy decides that enough is enough and that he wants to call off the search.<br/><br/>It is around this time that tensions begin to run high, and Teddy starts having flashbacks to his own deceased wife, played in flashback by Michelle Williams. Teddy tells Chuck that a man named Andrew Latis is responsible for her premature death in a fire that he lit.<br/><br/>Teddy is also a war veteran and has very disturbing dreams and recollections about his time spent in battle. Aaaahh, the 50's, just good to be alive! Teddy's plan to leave is thwarted by a huge storm that sweeps across the island, with departure impossible Teddy and Chuck commence interviews with other patients who knew Rachel Solando, it shouldn't come as much of a surprise that most of the people interviewed turn out to be varying degrees of nutso. It seems everyone knows more than they admit, but no-one is willing to help Teddy join the dots.<br/><br/>Amid the confusion Teddy seems to fall under the Island's spell, having dream after dream, after vision, after dream, after nightmare, after it all actually got quite yawnworthy, every time something happened that built tension or seemed freaky, I immediately knew that it was a dream or vision and he would be jolted awake in a second. It must have happened half a dozen times at least.<br/><br/>Fast forward a little, Teddy tells Chuck that he actually asked to be on the Solando case as Andrew Latis, the murderer of his wife was imprisoned there. Ted also thinks that the hospital is covering up the fact that it performs extremely illegal experiments on its patients, Chuck proposes that maybe the whole thing is an elaborate set-up to get Teddy to the island.<br/><br/>Why? The rest of the film attempts to explain that. Unfortunately once I knew the ""why"", I moved on to another couple of questions; ""who cares?"" and ""as if!"". Not a question I know but I did say it.<br/><br/>There are meetings with almost every person references, including Rachel Solando and Andrew Latis, a power failure and a chance encounter with Rachel Solando. No that wasn't a mistake or a typo, there are two different Solando meetings or are there? Yes, there are.<br/><br/>All roads ultimately lead to a mysterious lighthouse on the island, which is where the climactic showdown occurs.<br/><br/>The problem with Shutter Island is that we know we are not going to get many laughs or big action scenes going in. It is a ""question mark"" sort of film, as in Who? What? Where? Why? How? Because it poses these questions we the audience start predicting and hypothesizing from the first few minutes.<br/><br/>By the time I finally got the end and was told all the answers I had gone through dozens of potential outcomes and reasons, including the actual outcome that they went with. Only the chosen finale would have demanded so many coincidences and leaps of logic that it lost much of its credibility along the way and I became uninvolved with the story.<br/><br/>Everything else was fine though, which is why the 6 I am about to give the film must be prefixed as a ""disappointing"" 6. Shutter Island is well made and well acted, and for the first half of the film quite absorbing, but by overreaching with the hammy climax it ruined a solid build up for me.<br/><br/>So from the half way mark on I was always very aware that I was watching a film, not involving myself in a story. That sounds dumb I know, but the best movies don't remind you that they are movies until the credits roll.<br/><br/>Final Rating – 6 / 10. To say it was underwhelming pretty much sums it up accurately I think.<br/><br/>If you liked this review (or even if you didn't) check out oneguyrambling.com"

"ptb-8","8","0","1","13 November 2010"," yes, it was a dark and stormy night...
","SHUTTER ISLAND is visually one of the most fascinating and compelling films I have ever seen. The eerie Gothic visuals and sodden hospital prison discomfort, lashing rain, wet rocks, cruel sea etc are ingredients that have the viewer really descending into the movie with great interest. Scene after scene is just visually great. However, I have come away with a very dissatisfied feeling about the story denouement and the graphic violence and distressing scenes involving children. With such a rich palette of visuals to celebrate, again Scorscese overdoes the mass murder. For me it was revolting, it yanked me from my enjoyment of the story and the film so greatly that it was actually irritating. One mass murder scene in a concentration camp is just a spandau ballet death gimmick and is really disgusting Tarantino level visual atrocity. The graphic deaths of some children are so meticulously displayed at great length that it is so upsetting that I really mostly felt anger towards the film maker instead of being more immersed in the storyline. Overall it is a fascinating topic and the subplots of WW2 liberation and the trauma from the frontline of day one liberation are excellent plot lines with disturbing results. SHUTTER ISLAND might be a better watch the second and third time around and I hope I can plunge more into it's Gothic hospital cyclone of fear and hallucination more. I want so to really embrace this film. I am just so sick of Scorcese's irritating desire to whack us with atrocity visuals when it need not be so explicit. Anyone who loves THE WICKER MAN (1973 version) and LA CONFIDENTIAL and THE INNOCENTS and THE SIXTH SENSE will get a terrific charge from the art direction and set design and Val Lewton style RKO noir imagery. Again Leonardo displays his remarkable talent for really being the character. He is absolutely perfect. SHUTTER ISLAND like CASINO before is flawed by the Scorcese atrocity excess but redeemed by the fantastic tech qualities and acting."

","I rented this movie as soon as it came out on video so i did not get the full effect of a movie going experience. I suggest this movie to anyone looking for a movie that will make them think and does fit the average movie mold. <br/><br/>I really like how in the movie everything in the plot came together. Throughout the movie I struggled to understand the events that were happening, but as it turns out the director wants you to struggle with understanding and then reveals to you how it all comes together.<br/><br/>One thing I did not like very much was the graphic nature of some of the scenes. It really did not seem necessary to include some of the scenes. I think the point was to create a disturbed feeling, but this ended up really turning me off to the movie as I thought some of the scenes were too graphic.<br/><br/>The acting of the main characters was pretty good in general. Dicaprio plays his role very well and it was a tough role to play. Some of the supporting roles though were not as good. The poor acting of some of the supporting characters makes their story less believable. Some of these characters are supposed to be scary, but because of their less than good acting they come off as over the top.<br/><br/>Overall i thought the movie was good. As I said before anyone who wants to be mentally challenged would probably have a fun time with this movie. Those who do not like very graphic scenes should be warned."
"Jona1988","7","0","1","4 November 2010"," In the end a good story but still flawed film.
","With names like Martin Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio in the credits I felt like this could and should be a great film. And the beginning of Shutter Island immediately put my hopes up even higher. It set the tone of a crime thriller set some time ago. But after a while I began feeling somewhat uncertain about it. The film continues slow and doesn't really take off. The tone given by the atmosphere and music manage well the sense of mystery but still I don't sit at the edge as one would have thought. Suspense is something that is totally lacking in this film. A lot of dialogue and the story moves forward so things are happening but it still doesn't really capture my attention in the way one had hoped and thought it would. The acting is good but I somehow feel Leonardo DiCaprio isn't perfect in the lead, nothing wrong with his performance but he doesn't fit the character. The actors who really steal the show are Sir Ben Kingsley and Max von Sydow, they are simply brilliant in all their scenes. However I feel the characters in this film are a bit wooden and hard to relate with. That the viewer doesn't feel much for the characters is a big weakness for a film. But the acting and directing is good so maybe the script is to blame. This brings me to the dialogue which at some parts feel pretty poor and some things that the characters say seem really awkward. The film gets better towards the end when some more interesting things start to happen. There are some strange twists and gets somewhat hard to keep up. The ending resolves some of the things that were set up but also asks some new questions which are left to the viewer to figure out how hold together. But this isn't a bad thing absolutely not, I felt the movie lifts at the end to become alright entertainment. Some surprising twist takes the plot away from any thriller type movie.<br/><br/>The plot is in the end pretty good and entertaining. I have not read the book. But the execution could definitively have been better. The film is presented as a mystery thriller but it lacks any real suspense, other problems include character development and very repetitive music and sound effects. Shutter Island turns out to be quite empty of substance. Good but not that good, I had expected more. Shutter Island is an entertaining film but sadly it's nothing more than just alright."

This is what I got from this film, but I also got the message of what you can distinguish from reality and delusion. Yeah nothing really original but the story is told in a style that keeps you captivated till the end. I think Di Caprio gives a reasonably good performance - some people are saying it's over the top - maybe towards the end I felt that a bit.<br/><br/>I think with the twist - which I won't give away - I could sort of sense that coming halfway. The ending is a bit ambiguous because I am not entirely sure what the truth is, though you do know what happens to Dicaprio's character. The tension that builds up to the climax is done very well so I really enjoyed this movie.<br/><br/>I think the whole look of the film has a grainy feel to it which gives you that sense of dread. You know it is going to get somewhere, so you are just waiting for it while having the plot build up to it, so the ending leaves you hanging a bit. I think there is a message to the ending which you will understand, and can also be interpreted as a message about the mental health system and how patients are perceived in their state of mind.<br/><br/>Definitely worth a look, but I don't think you should expect something spectacular, but entertaining nevertheless."

And that uncertainty really worked well for the movie. And I must say that I really liked the ending of the movie. Not your typically sappy Hollywood ending here.<br/><br/>I must say that DiCaprio actually put on a great performance in this role, as much as I dislike his previous movies, his performance in ""Shutter Island"" was actually astounding. And of course, he was helped good on the way by Ben Kingsley, who also put on a magnificent performance.<br/><br/>I haven't read the book, so I am not familiar with how true to the novel the movie actually is, but having read other reviews, it seemed that the movie is loyal to the book. But regardless, the result of this movie is a solid thriller with a really good story, and you are never given a bone as to where the story goes, and it is so unlike most other thrillers out there.<br/><br/>There is something dark and foreboding about the entire setting of the movie - having a mental institute on an isolated island somewhere. And on top of that, the patients there are criminally insane. Just makes it all more interesting (and dangerous). And, for me, the setting was very believable and very well detailed. There was a certain unique style to this movie, and I loved the way it was shot - superb and interesting camera usage here.<br/><br/>I surely was taken by surprise by this movie, and I recommend that you watch it if you haven't already seen it. Especially if you like thrillers that toy with the psyche and if you like movies that are totally unpredictable. I give it a 7 out of 10 rating because of the storyline and the setting, I didn't let my usual dislike of DiCaprio influence this rating in any way.

"estebangonzalez10","8","0","3","16 September 2010"," Scorsese + Di Caprio = Must See
","¨Which would be worse, to live as a monster or to die as a good man? ¨ Shutter Island has all the right ingredients for everyone to enjoy this movie. First of all, it is directed by Martin Scorsese, the guy who brought us such masterpieces as Goodfellas, Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, Gangs of New York, and The Departed. Martin Scorsese is one of the best directors and he is always trying different genres, being original, standing out, but with his classic trademark direction in every film. This time he brings us this dark suspense thriller that traps us from the very beginning and hooks our attention up to the very end. Shutter Island is based on Dennis Lehanes's novel of the same name. His previous two novels, Mystic River and Gone Baby Gone have also been made into feature films, and are among my favorite movies, especially the first one. If those two names alone are not enough for you to want to go see this film, then perhaps this might convince you: Leonardo Di Caprio, Mark Ruffalo, and Ben Kingsley star in this thriller and give great performances. I did not have to see the trailer to know that I wanted to watch this film because I really admire each of the people involved in making Shutter Island. The weakest link perhaps is the screenplay writer Laeta Kalogridis who wrote Alexander and Pathfinder, two movies that bombed in the box office. The script does have its flaws, but the performances and the direction are what stand out in this dark thriller. The atmosphere and the mystery that Scorsese masterfully creates are worth the ticket price plus some really good performances from the lead characters make this a very enjoyable movie experience. This is not one of Scorsese's best films, but that does not mean it is a bad movie either. Scorsese knows how to make movies and he does not fail with Shutter Island although he did take a huge risk with this film.<br/><br/>The movie is set in 1954 and like in all Lehane's previous novels it takes place in Boston. U.S Marshall, Teddy Daniels (played brilliantly by Leonardo Di Caprio who seems to shine every time he works with Martin), has to investigate a mysterious disappearance that takes place in Shutter Island where an asylum for the criminally insane is located. Teddy is teamed up with Chuck (Mark Ruffalo), a Marshall from Seattle and together they have to solve the case in which a patient from the asylum named Rachel has gone missing. There they meet the psychiatrist in charge of the patients, Dr. Cawley (played by Ben Kingsley who absolutely nails his role once again) who seems to be hiding some crucial information in the case, as do most every other employees in the hospital. Dr. Cawley works alongside Dr. Naehring (Max von Sydow) who also seems very calm during the investigation. Teddy and Chuck begin to question nurses and patients but they can't seem to figure out how Rachel has disappeared. During the investigation, Teddy has to battle with constant headaches and migraines as well with hurricane like weather, and he keeps on having visions of his dead wife, Dolores (Michelle Williams), telling him what he has to do. Torments of his troubled past begin to affect Teddy's role in the investigation and as the plot thickens we discover that he wanted to be assigned to Shutter Island for other personal reasons because he believes some unethical treatments are taking place with the patients. This is where the puzzle begins to get more complicated for Teddy as he has to fight his own personal demons while trying to solve the case.<br/><br/>Emily Mortimer and Jackie Earle Haley also have small roles in this movie as patients from the asylum and do a great job. Much of the success of this film relies on the good performances from the entire cast. Leonardo Di Caprio and Ben Kingsley prove once again why they are such great actors as they make most out of a not too strong script. The story is interesting, but the script wasn't able to fit all the pieces together as smoothly as I would have liked. Scorsese however is a master at his craft and really creates a mysterious and dark atmosphere so there are plenty of thrills and suspense spread out throughout Shutter Island. The twist at the end was kind of predictable, but it didn't affect the outcome of the movie as it hooked my attention from the very beginning. Perhaps with a stronger ending I would have given it a higher grade, but it is a good film nonetheless. It is worth a watch because Scorsese and Di Caprio are back together again doing what they do best, even though this is not their best effort it is still better than most other thrillers that have come out recently."
"MartianOctocretr5","6","0","1","11 September 2010"," What's really going on at that mental hospital?
","What better premise and setting locale for a thriller than a mental hospital for violent criminals? <br/><br/>With veteran Martin Scorcese at the helm, this mystery/thriller hits all its high notes for a suitably bumpy ride. Leo Dicaprio brings urgency to his portrayal of a federal marshal with a spotted history. He and his new partner (Mark Ruffalo), go to investigate the disappearance of a patient from a high security mental facility on a secluded island. The missing patient had brutally murdered her own children, and her treatment included innovative therapy. Soon, however, suspicions of something larger and more involved than one patient's absence begin to emerge.<br/><br/>The solid cast includes Ben Kingsley, as one of the suspicious and evasive psychiatrists in charge; an imposing presence who exerts power with monotonal speech always restricted to the same volume. Michelle Phillips may be the best of all as a wretchedly psychotic and ghostly apparition that shadows and torments the soul of the investigating officer. Jackie Earl Haley's one brief scene is convincing, even eerie. The action paces well, providing structure for the plot's concept, while never overshadowing it. The ongoing storm helps maintain the mood and objective of the story very well, and this familiar motif is made fresh in the way that it's used.<br/><br/>The movie's only weakness is that too much is strongly hinted at through flashbacks and other techniques that too soon give away the surprise of the vital twist ending. Everything that you see points in that same direction, which is more difficult to conceal than usual to begin with, since this particular twist (with minor variations) has been utilized before. Even though what is finally revealed seems an unlikely scenario,.<br/><br/>Still, although the script doesn't conceal key elements well enough, the cast and director make this a pretty entertaining watch."

Even the ending is low key and will not be there to satisfy anyone (though it is one clever way to end a movie, which left me with my mouth open).<br/><br/>Martin Scorsese might have gone thriller at least once before, with ""Cape Fear"", but this time we really dig into another world. Leonardo DiCaprio pulls out a great performance once again. Even small roles are cast with great actors to really give the whole thing some weight. It's a great psychological thriller ride then."

","US Marshall, Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) is headed to Shutter Island to investigate because of a missing patient on the island, Rachel Solando. Teddy is a veteran World War II soldier, and is messed up from some of the experiences he had there. The hospital refuses to let Teddy have access to the patient's records, making things harder for him and his partner, Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo). Soon after arriving on the island a storm hits, so Teddy finds himself stuck on the island for the time being. While Teddy is having serious migraines, he begins to believe something very wrong is going on at the island, and soon starts to fear for everyone's lives on Shutter Island.<br/><br/>I have to be honest here, Shutter Island was pretty disappointing for me. I had read mixed reviews on the film, but heard it was really good, so naturally with a director like Martin Scorsese I had fairly high hopes for the film. But in many ways it did not deliver. The story was interesting, but throughout the first half of the movie the whole thing seemed very random to me, as well as predictable. The second half absolutely saved the movie for me. It started to get much more interesting, and became more of the thriller/horror movie it was supposed to be. However, even with the good direction by one of the greatest directors in history, there was still something missing. I honestly thought one of the biggest problems was the screenplay. It was not but about 15-20 minutes into the movie that I had already figured out the ending.<br/><br/>With that said, there were some very good points to Shutter Island. For example, Leonardo DiCaprio and Mark Ruffalo's acting was brilliant. Everyone seems to be talking about hoe DiCaprio deserves to get an Oscar for his Role in Inception, and While I agree I think he at least deserves a nomination for this movie. I am not a huge Mark Ruffalo fan, but he did a very good job playing the sidekick of Teddy Daniels, the hero to our story.<br/><br/>Overall, Shutter Island packs a few scares in for some people, and has good acting by pretty much everyone, but with a not great screenplay a few things were messed up in the beginning. This was not Martin Scorsese's best film, but for the acting in this film I thought it was good."
"eddax","8","0","1","6 September 2010"," Not sneaky enough
","I realized after that Shutter Island is based on a novel by Dennis Lehane, who also wrote the stories behind the good Gone Baby Gone and the great Mystic River. All three movies definitely have parallels in terms of darkness and... film noir-ness. <br/><br/>From the trailer, I was expecting Shutter Island to be a supernatural thriller but I wasn't disappointed that it wasn't because it's still a very effective and engaging thriller. Scorsese set up the ambiance well, though sometimes the score felt overhanded and heavy. The story - an involved mystery - is interesting and twisty, but for all its sneakiness, the Big Reveal doesn't come as a huge surprise and afterwards, I didn't have that feeling of ""Omg, I have to watch the movie over again to see what hints I missed"" as I did with The Sixth Sense. And while the cast was good, there weren't any standouts as with Lehane's other two book-movies."

","Before I go any further, I have to say that I haven't read the book so I can't compare the two. <br/><br/>I'm one of those people who love books and movies concerning mental disorders, ghosts, mysteries, one's personal demons and of course jails. So of course this movie seemed like a dream come true for me. My friends recommended this one, although I still would've watched ""Shutter Island"" even if they hadn't. I thought Shutter Island could be like a combination of Jacob's Ladder, the Ring, Shawshank Redemption and...bunch of other movies. I think I was only 15% right, so don't be alarmed if you don't like the movies I mentioned.<br/><br/>We all know who's the director and which actors play the major roles. They deserve all the praise they get, and hopefully even the last DiCaprio-hater will look him-/herself in the mirror after this. The whole crew working on this film pulled through. Everything is in place and handled with care. The location is beautiful and cinematography is excellent. Script is tight, every actor does a good job. Sound and music are masterfully done, and I admit shedding a tear or two listening to the end credits-song. I could write a thousand lines about this, so I'll keep it short: simply great work by great professionals, great work indeed. <br/><br/>If you haven't seen this movie yet, try to avoid any spoilers if possible. The movie lasts well over 2 hours, but I found myself wanting more after the end. I could easily watch a 4 hour version of Shutter Island, and it would still feel like an hour or two. That being said - even if the film is relatively long, it doesn't have a boring or useless moment. Not one, not even for a second, and I'm hoping for an extended DVD-cut to be released. One can always hope.<br/><br/>The story has layers, and of course some twists. The twists are never stupid, forced or too over-the-top to destroy the first 120 minutes you have seen. You may, like I did, guess what eventually is going to happen and what everything means. That is not a bad thing and I think it's intentional. I even watched it again soon after finishing it and then I really noticed the amount of detail this film had in it. This film is not all about ""the twist"". The story was interesting to the very end, and hopefully makes you see it again like I did. I felt really rewarded the second time around.<br/><br/>There aren't much cheap scares, this film doesn't treat its viewer as an idiot. Scorsese doesn't work that way. He doesn't need to throw monsters behind your back to create this kind of gripping atmosphere. That little eerie feeling of suspense, it's always present. Main focus, of course, is on DiCaprio's character, whenever he's interacting with others or just following the trail of the mystery...or just dealing with his demons. We see everything through his character, and this approach works beautifully.<br/><br/>Luckily for us, there are still people that, when brought together, simply cannot make a bad movie. This is an instant classic for me."

","Maybe I was expecting far to much from this film. When I saw the rating I thought this is going to be good. I think nearly everyone thought at some point 'I bet he's a patient' but then thought 'no that's way too obvious there has to be a better twist than that'. Sadly I was disappointed he was insane, and a patient, simple as that. I was expecting much more, as this kind of twist has been done many times before and I personally thought Identity with John Cusack was much much better and definitely deserves a higher score than Shutter Island. That said the cast is great and the acting is very good and it's definitely not the worst film and lots of people will enjoy it and have, as the ratings show."

","I was told on several occasions to skip this film. While I felt it took a long way to get to the point, I found it intriguing and engaging. I've really grown to like DeCaprio and find him to be an interesting actor. One reviewer did criticize him for hanging around the dark side a bit much, but that could be said about Nicholson and a host of others. This is one of those mind puzzles that force one to guess a good deal. Because of the pace, I eventually figured it out. Nevertheless, it is told in a very interesting way. With ""Inception"" capturing the box office recently, this seems a mild effort to explore the subconscious. It is multi-layered and complex. It throws curves and red herrings, but I never felt toyed with. This is certainly worth a shot."

So that was quite a well done twist. I'm glad there is an unambiguous conclusion. Shows clearly what the reality is. Doesn't leave you wondering. It's well acted but why does Leo like such unpleasant roles? <br/><br/>There are a couple of bad points though they aren't major: If it was all an act feels a bit like you wasted your time. Imagery is quite unpleasant: holocaust, wards, kids. Maybe deserves a second watch to look out for things that fit into the twist.<br/><br/>In the end it leaves a rather depressed feeling.

","I'm a big Christopher Nolan fan (loved Memento and The Prestige) and a big Martin Scorsese fan (loved Taxi Driver and The Departed), so no bias here.<br/><br/>I went to the cinema excited to see Inception and was shocked to see a poorly constructed story that explained too much when it didn't need to and didn't explain enough when it should have. I look at it as a Matrix wannabe with action sequences that just weren't that great. It was not a thinking man's movie as was Memento or The Prestige either. It was a one trick pony - is he in a dream or not? Big deal - boring! 5/10 (given mostly for DiCaprio's acting)<br/><br/>I just saw Shutter Island in my Home Theater, and man was it well done! There are similarities between the two movies, in that they both aim to confuse you as to what is reality and what is a dream/delusion. But that is where the similarities end. Unlike Inception, Shutter Island is well crafted and engaging. Scorsese is at the top of his game, always keeping the viewer interested and on edge.<br/><br/>I know I'm in the minority on this view, given that Inception is the fourth ranked movie of all-time, as of this writing (what are you people smoking anyway!). But I thought a reasonable voice needed to speak out!"
"lediscipledessocrates","8","0","1","18 August 2010"," A Classic
","The movie is good. I t has all the ingredients of a genuine thriller and has no elements which deprive it of class. The screenplay is good and the movie beautifully meanders through the various stages of storytelling.<br/><br/>On the other hand , the mere fact that the movie is brilliant as a thriller also is a give-away as curious and vigilant viewers would be easily able to tear down the curtains off the mystery quite early on in the movie.<br/><br/>The thing which then captivates their mind is the question that is the Protagonist actually insane? <br/><br/>This is the question which holds the movie together from the time ""who is 67?"" appears in the script.<br/><br/>In fact the director's skill in substituting one mystery for another in the early stages of the movie is quite commendable.<br/><br/>No matter what the answer to that question may be, the movie keeps the viewer interested till the very last scene. The director also plays around with the time tested ""interpretative theme"" and lays before the viewer two highly probable alternate scenarios, which cannot co-exist.<br/><br/>The movie thus has two plots running simultaneously yet merged into one.<br/><br/>I would say a pleasing thriller, not entirely unpredictable in terms of what it reveals but uncommonly intelligent in what it seeks to conceal."

","Shutter Island is going to be a tough challenge to review without spoiling any of the intricate workings which are at play. If you trawl forums you're likely to find many comments from people saying how they guessed the ending right at the start. This isn't hard, as those same people will have rejected the other twenty theories they had before the films close only focusing on the right one, something I say time and time again, ""listing all possibilities of what could happengives a high probability that one of them is correct."" Part of the beauty of Shutter Island however isn't in trying to solve the mystery. Rather than try and guess, let the film do its work and the reward will be all the sweeter. A second viewing is a must, with performances going from excellent to outstanding.<br/><br/>The first few minutes will give you a reasonable idea if you'll find the next two hours enjoyable or not. We open with a boat heading through a foggy ocean. Two U.S. Marshall's Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo) are travelling to Ashecliffe Hospital, ""a high-security federal asylum for the criminally insane,"" situated on the impossible to escape, Shutter Island. On arrival it is clear that security is tight. They meet up with Dr Cawley (Ben Kingsley) and the German, Dr Naehring (Max von Sydow) who seem to have differing views in patient/prisoner care and treatment. They explain to the Marshall's about the disappearance of a patient Rachael Solando which as Dr Cawley explains ""we don't know how she got out of her room. It's as if she evaporated, straight through the walls.""<br/><br/>Shutter Island is a well-crafted psychological thriller which is set to some of the most aesthetically-pleasing backdrops to grace our screens. They not only capture the time-period of 1950s cinema but also that of the artistic vision which weaves like a rich tapestry throughout the film. In Teddy's memory of the liberation of the Dachau concentration camp during the war, the soundtrack, blood and paper caught in a storm flying around the room combine expression and feeling both of which enrich the experience.<br/><br/>The ocean bashing against cliffs are taken from a palette that makes us feel as though we're watching a moving painting. The prison itself provides rich colours, whilst maintaining enough mystery and uneasiness for us to watch some of the more disturbing scenes. Having the island painted for us, also allows for some of Teddy's dreams and nightmares to blur into the surroundings, making us not sure if he is still dreaming as a scene changes. The elements of fire and water are heavily used throughout the film to interesting effect.<br/><br/>I wish I could talk more in depth about this film, tough too much information would easily ruin the experience. Shutter Island is by no means the best work form Scorsese, however it shows us that he is still a highly talented director who not only appreciates but obviously has a deep passion for decent cinema. A must-see for anyone annoyed at some of the trash films around at the moment; as Shutter Island is a ray of light for anyone who is a fan of film-noir, 1950s and Hitchcock style and they will thoroughly enjoy this masterpiece.<br/><br/>by MaskedMovieMan http://maskedmovieman.blogspot.com"

"gossamer-6","10","0","1","16 August 2010"," Case in point
","I'm at a loss here. Let it suffice to say that this is an excellent piece of movie-making and stellar performances. Thing is, I always knew Leonardo DiCaprio was good. I saw him for the first time in a Western-European venture called 'Total Eclipse'(Please don't mix us with the former Soviet slave countries. They haven't changed much since the fall of communism)where he played the French poet Arthur Rimbaud. He was quite young then but it was obvious that the man had a great talent. I don't believe a word of those who say that he tried to stop its distribution in any way. His co-star David Thewlis(Verlaine)would never have agreed to that. Such cases tend to be counter-productive. Anyway I saw it televised and it was immense in all it's raw intensity and humanity. Something not often seen on television. I was wise enough to tape it, but that's another story. But back to Leonardo DiCaprio. He just does not seem to put a foot wrong. He excels in all his endeavors. On the table beside me I have:'The Aviator','The Departed', 'Blood Diamond', Body of Lies and 'Shutter Island'. In none of these cases does he falter. He marvels at what he does best; acting. I seriously doubt that any contemporary actor has shown such skill in his chosen profession. To cut it short I like the guy tremendously. There is actually nothing about him that irritates me, which is rare with me. Shutter Island is a great movie. Wheather your preference be DVD or Blu-ray doesn't matter. I guarantee you're gonna love this one. Or the beer's on me. A second viewing is even more rewarding, if you get my drift. In any case enjoy, and take a look at Mr. DiCapripo's other work. So let's all love him and have fun with him. He enjoys what he's doing and does so exceedingly well. Greetings from the North-Pole amigos. 'Vinir' in Old Norse. Remember the less you like my review the better the film is. I have that reputation, you see."

","Some of the sequences of this movie are outstanding. The shot of DiCaprio in the burning home looks like a real dream. The tracking shot of the Nazi murders is equally as impressive. Of course, with Scorsese behind the camera, you know you are going to get great cinematography. However, the movie is predictable. You know within the first five minutes that DiCaprio's character is crazy. New characters are introduced to try and throw you off the scent, but it is never very successful. Much of the dialogue is wasted, and I am still trying to figure out what the point of the movie was. All in all, though the movie is filmed very well, the plot comes up short."
"faraaj-1","8","0","1","15 August 2010"," Scorcese's on a roll here
","Scorcese has often been called America's greatest living director. Certainly with classics like Mean Streets, Taxidriver and Raging Bull to his credit decades ago, and others like Goodfellas and Gangs of New York in the intervening year, there is much weight in holding him in such high esteem, along with the expectations that come with it. My first impression with each new film since Goodfellas has been that its lesser Scorcese. He appears to have fallen from the lofty standards he set early in his career. The themes of the film do not have the gravitas one expects of a Scorcese film etc. On first viewing, I felt that way about both Gangs of New York and The Departed. Second and third viewings changed my opinion and I now know both films to be classics and the Scorcese magic is self evident.<br/><br/>Shutter Island, which is a big move away from the broad range that Scorcese normally works within, is a horror-thriller film - well, more thriller than horror and thus more mainstream than his usual fare. The only other mainstream Scorcese film that comes to mind is Cape Fear. While I was never impressed with Cape Fear, the original B&W noir classic being far superior, I readily admit to loving Shutter Island from the first frame.<br/><br/>People forget that Scorcese is the original film nerd and his understanding of cinema and the great masters is unparalleled. In this visually enchanting masterpiece, I saw clear shades of King Kong, the Val Lewton films of the 40s e.g. Isle of the Dead, Hitchcock's Vertigo and North by Northwest and of course the expressionist classic The Cabinet of Dr Caligari. However, it was all of a piece with a clear visual style that gelled and worked. There are remarkable set-pieces littered throughout the film - too many to mention. The performances are uniformly great. While, De Caprio, Ben Kingsley and Emily Watson are all acclaimed, Mark Ruffalo is less well known and shines in this, his best role since Zodiac.<br/><br/>I won't go into the plot details but given that this is a thriller, suffice to say that there is at least one major plot twist. I've seen several reviewers commenting on and emphasizing the big twist. Many saw it coming and disliked the film, others couldn't see the twist coming and loved the film as a result. I think that basing your opinion on the plot twist misses the point. With the large number of thrillers that Hollywood churns out each year, I don't think is a plot twist out there that hasn't been covered threadbare by multiple films. What is important to me is the visual sense and style, which is present in Shutter Island in bucket-loads!"

","This film was nothing like what I expected. I am still unsure whether I liked it or not. I did find it fairly disturbing and I can say that I have not been as genuinely disturbed by a film since The Machinist which nearly made me physically sick and messed me up for days - and I am a fan of horrors like Saw! I think De Caprio is a very talented actor. However the fact that he looks about 17 just makes it unbelievable when he is playing a role where he is supposed to have some kind of authority. It doesn't work for me. An example is where he has his top off next to his partner. Leo has the smooth body of a child he also has crappy tattoos that I just don't feel a US Marshall would have had in 1954! I also find Ben Kingsley to be a very one dimensional actor. Psycho one or psycho 2. He is good in this but I find it impossible to get the image of him as Don Logan in Sexy Beast out of my head. He seems to be the ""dial a nutter""! We need a phsychopatic actor - phone SIR Ben and see if he is available. I find it hard to take him seriously.<br/><br/>Michelle Williams acts well in this and I found it quite poignant seeing what has happened in her personal life. There is just something too plain about her that i feel she has blagged her way into Hollywood and is not really a star.<br/><br/>The stand out performance for me was Mark Ruffalo. I have never seen his work before and he stole the show for me. I kept thinking it was Billy Zane and had to keep reminding myself that he is bald! The ""twist"" becomes so obvious that I was waiting for another one. Is that it I was thinking? Yes, the score was haunting but at times I felt it was too much.<br/><br/>I think Marty needs to get back to his gangster roots and make a modern day gangster flick using less obvious A list stars and sourcing his actors from some of the amazing TV shows like The Shield, The Sopranos and OZ.<br/><br/>Mark Ruffalo would make a perfect leading actor as he has that ambiguous ""foreign"" look about him.<br/><br/>All in all a disturbing, dark film that hits wide off the mark in my opinion."

Shutter Island adds mystery and even horror to the mix to create a hit movie from a well crafted novel suspense thriller by Dennis Lehane.

Is it flashbacks to traumatic events? Is this a dream sequence? Certainly, nightmares are included, right?

","I won't call this one of Scorsese's best, but it is thought provoking and entertaining.<br/><br/>There were problems I found with this film. The visuals in the beginning, on the boat, looked very artificial. Was the intention to make it look cheap? There were quite a few bad edits and continuity errors, like when a character had something in their hand then didn't or their position changed in a jarring manner. I thought it might have been a side effect of the lead characters altered psyche, but on second viewing, they just look like mistakes. <br/><br/>Why did I enjoy this film? Well, it messes with your head. By the time you get to the end you don't know whether to believe Leo is Teddy Daniels or Andrew Laeddis. There are so many clues that point to either way, there's not really any actual reference point to use to show which persona is real. For instance, they don't give us much information on how Teddy arrived on the boat, let alone hooked up with a fake Marshall. Are we to believe there were people higher up in his office who put him on this case to trick him into getting trapped onto the island? <br/><br/>They don't explain what happens to the Deputy Warden character. Why was he the main character among the guards in the first half of the film, but then disappears as soon as the Warden arrives on the scene? Did he die? Was he on a ferry back to the mainland? He just vanishes into thin air. <br/><br/>I've read other people's reviews about this film and what is real and what isn't real, and what story should we believe. One person they always leave out is the real, Dr. Rachel who was in the cave. She wasn't a figment of his imagination. I think many of the flashbacks were slowly being put into his head to confuse his life story, but she wasn't part of that. Perhaps she's the clue that Scorsese wanted us to use as to who the real character was that Leo was playing? <br/><br/>It was interesting to note that Dr Rachel tells Teddy that the drugs take 36 to 48 hrs to make a patient more malleable. If you watch the movie, when he gets to the lighthouse, it's pretty much 2 days after he's arrived and been constantly drugged. That's when they put the suggestions into his head about his wife murdering his children, then he murdered his wife. But from my point of view, it's all lies. I believed it the first time I watched it, I'll admit. But second time, the brainwashing didn't work. :) <br/><br/>In the end, Teddy chooses to come back to earth knowing that they would end up killing him. His words he'd rather die good than live as a monster (making references to the doctors, including Ruffalo's Sheehan who he was talking to)."

You will find yourself on the edge of your seat at many parts of the film and even feel a little uncomfortable. The cast for the most part was pretty good. But this is only the main cast. Some of the side characters were too fake for my taste. Leonardo DiCaprio was pretty good. I bet it was hard for him to play an older guy though since he always looks 18. Ben Kingsley was a joy. His character seemed so nice, but more in a creepy way and he really pulled it off. Mark Ruffalo was a good sidekick to DiCaprio. Michelle Williams seemed a little off though. Now when you get to the halfway point of the movie you will either figure out the twisted story or be confused out of your mind. I can see a lot of people getting frustrated with how this movie was written. I know it was made to be that way, but it really took some of the fun suspense out of the film. Every time this happened though, there were parts to get you right back into the film. Even though the story seems in small pieces and some back story was missing, I still think Scorsese did made a pretty decent film here and it is worth watching."

","U.S. Marshal Teddy Daniel's and his partner investigating the disappearance of a murderess who escaped from a hospital for the criminally insane and is apparently hiding on the remote Shutter Island.<br/><br/>Martin Scorsese again demonstrates why he is one of the worlds best directors. The CGI is unnoticeable and only used to create the imagery of Shutter Island. A WW2 concentration camp, Dachau, is recreated for a disturbing and key scene. Scorsese perfectly recreates the 1954, bring the best of location, sets, lighting and sound together to deliver a fantastic psychological thriller.<br/><br/>The cast is a fine line-up that includes Leonardo DiCaprio who manages to get away with the complexity of the characters situation; Swede Max von Sydow is on usual perfect form. Zodiac (2007) and Collateral's (2004) Mark Ruffalo is excellent, although a little under used as Daniel's partner. Thankfully Ben Kingsley has taken on a role worthy of his abilities as the empathetic Dr. John Cawley. In addition, Ted Levine and Elias Koteas show up in almost cameo appearances.<br/><br/>There's plenty to like about Shutter Island, it exudes atmosphere, and it's foreboding and eerie. The story tackles alcoholism, mental health and asks the viewer to question what should be perceived as a dream and what should perceives as real. It's an intriguing mystery that not since Angel Heart (1987) have I seen such a well constructed psychological period film. Credit must go to the Laeta Kalogridis' screen-play and Dennis Lehane's novel.<br/><br/>Possibly one of Martin Scorsese best films."
"carflo","9","0","2","2 August 2010"," Questions, questions and more questions
","When I saw the trailers for this, I thought - Scorsese and DiCaprio - even their worst will probably be better than best by many others working today. It is far from their worst. It was mesmerizing and excellent and left me with many more questions than answers. It is not a ""typical"" Scorsese, but then if there really were a ""typical"" Scorsese, he wouldn't be the great director that he is.<br/><br/>It starts out in the film noir style turns into a twisting almost fractured plot that ends with far more questions than the in the beginning, Where is the missing/escaped patient, Rachel? In the end, it seems that Rachel is one of the lesser mysteries of Shutter Island. Where was the ferry and was it the only way on or off the island> Why couldn't Teddy and Chuck get any cooperation (or files) from the sinister Ben Kingsley and Max von Sydow. Teddy and Chuck were the powerful and feared G-Men of the time. Why didn't they seem to have any power and were obviously threatened? How could the missing/dead/lost Rachel be living in caves on such a small island? What are the scattered Nazi flash backs throughout the film?<br/><br/>As the plot goes on, Teddy's actions and the plot become more irrational and more fractured. Then it all comes to an ambiguous ending that left more questions than it answered. At least for me. I intend to see it at two or more times to knit all the raveled endings together into a comprehensible finale.<br/><br/>I do think there is a comprehensible finale. The questions make it more fascinating. DiCaprio is brilliant as Teddy and his performance is the best I have seen by him so far and that's saying a lot. It is an excellent movie that I would recommend to anyone who anyone who likes a good mystery mixed with a little Snake Pit and a lot of psychological terror. There are no monsters in this movie and there are no ghosts or ghoulies, but it is a horror movie nonetheless. Real horror is in the mind and not in the monsters or gore.<br/><br/>I think it is an excellent film. I rated it 9/10, but that may go higher after I see it a couple more times."

And the one of my favorite parts was the very last scene when they played the creepy music and showed the lighthouse. It just makes you wonder which story is the truth. Was he really Teddy Daniels who was set up and is now a patient at shutter island? Or is he actually Andrew Leitus who has been a patient at the hospital for two years? And you don't know which one it is. And that's the beauty of it. Because no matter how much you think about it and weigh out all the options and details there really isn't one answer. And I don't think there should be one and it should stay that way. This movie will mess your head up. I kept thinking about this for hours.

I know Scorcese left it open for a reason which makes all the more brilliant but I suspect the book would lean more toward one direction than the other instead of remaining neutral like the film.

","i read this review and its exactly my opinion so i thank <: politically_incorrect204> I hate to say this as much anyone else but for me this film had a horribly disappoint ending. First before I delve into that I'd like to say that the acting, the writing, the shooting, the film in general as far as quality goes was very good. But the ending was very disappointing. And no I am no idiot or newbie when it comes to film. But I thought the was very much a cop out. Now granted I know this is based off of a novel, hence there are certain restraints to adhering to this novel somewhat. That being said I found the idea of the medical experimentation, mental hospital, Nazi experiments, and astray patients much more tantalizing, realistic, and more full of potential. The trick ending where its all in someone's head is done far too often sadly. I was hoping that while it dragged one there at the end it would ultimately reveal he was playing them or that he would stay true and not give in. But that didn't happen. I guess for me I was just expecting something not so cliché for an ending from the likes of Scorsese's genius mind. But all things said and done I definitely can't give this movie all negative remarks, wonderfully acted and scripted. Great atmosphere, shooting, photography, etc. But I feel the ending should have been less cliché or not as cheap I guess. Felt like it was just an easy way out and not fully developing the tension and intrigue that they had built throughout. But either way its each to their own, so maybe you will appreciate the ending more than I. FYI - I do understand the undertones of the ending and the ambiguity, but I don't think that saves the ending or does the film justice in it's entirety."

It's a visual feast to be sure, very atmospheric, beautifully photographed, well acted but muddled and confusing to the viewer. DiCaprio turns in a valid performance and Mark Ruffalo I didn't even recognize until halfway through the film. What is likable about the film is that at its heart, it's a mystery, one that seems to point several possible directions, even hinting at the supernatural.

I mean, it opens with him being seasick, and not 10 minutes later, they are arriving at the island; the music choppy and intense. I think overall, I would have liked it more if it had more music in all, because music is part of the intensity of the plot in most movies. Leonardo DiCaprio is definitely 'easy on the eyes', but I think he could have given just a little more character to Teddy Daniels. Although, he did very well at the near-end when he discovers what his wife had done- that part gave me shivers it was so disturbing.

","Shutter Island<br/><br/>Of course building a hospital for the criminally insane on an island is a great way to prevent mentally unstable inmates from escaping; however, it does little to dissuade those patients who believe that they are Jesus Christ, a pontoon boat or a mallard duck. <br/><br/>Fortunately, the escapee in this psychological noir thriller doesn't consider herself a waterfowl, a watercraft or a water-walker.<br/><br/>Sent to the Shutter Island mental facility to help locate an escaped female prisoner, Rachel (Emily Mortimer, Patricia Clarkson), who's believed to be hiding in the island's cave system, US marshal Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) soon suspects a deeper issue involving the administrative staff (Ben Kingsley, Max von Sydow) and their unethical treatment of inmates. Later, as the investigation intensifies, he begins to question his own sanity.<br/><br/>Directed by Martin Scorsese, Shutter Island is a morose mystery that delves into the dark recesses of the human psyche. And while the intricate plot can be a tad challenging, and some characters unnecessary, the atmosphere and direction are commendable.<br/><br/>As for the best way to capture a crazy person on the loose: stage an open casting call for a new reality show called ""So You Think You're Being Followed?"".

"benoit-3","6","0","2","8 June 2010"," The product of a very sick mind... but still a pretty good film
","Do people still wonder why the Academy of Arts and Sciences hesitates to give an Oscar to Martin Scorsese every time he is nominated? Could it be because of his propensity to use his huge talent for directing and his academic knowledge of cinematic story-telling devices only to gross out his public? I mean, what are his real accomplishments besides upping the violence quotient in every film he makes and telling us that Italians are murderers and Mafiosi with colourful speech patterns and creative ways of killing the people who show them disrespect and even the people they love? Scorsese is like that distant cousin who is uniquely preoccupied with looking up women's skirts and wonders why he never gets a date. Except his particular vice happens to be showing, analyzing and brooding over the myriad facets of the wonderful world of violence and bloodletting, like a creep tearing the wings off flies.<br/><br/>In this case, the film is well put together and tells an acceptable story, not without a lot of channeling of Kubrick's ""The Shining"". It has atmosphere in spades and the hurricane scenes are particularly well thought-out. The art direction, acting and cinematography are superb even though the director has once again opted for the extremely clichéed blue-green colour scheme that has become, from sheer banality, the shame of the American cinema of the past 10 years. The script is semi-literate in spite of its numerous anachronisms (to name just three: the use of the phrases ""electronic systems"" and ""no problem"" and the depiction of an attempted mouth-to-mouth resuscitation).<br/><br/>The music is effective in communicating suspense and terror even though it is an anthology of every piece of modern writing that could never ever please an audience on its own except as an accompaniment to scenes from an insane asylum.<br/><br/>Violence is such a powerful force in modern American society that it is indeed a legitimate field of enquiry and exploration. What Mr. Scorsese should ask himself, however, is whether he belongs with the people who are legitimately reflecting on violence or whether, as one of the individuals who have contributed the most to desensitizing the movie-going public to its horror, he is part of the problem.<br/><br/>In that sense, the film is indicative of Martin Scorsese's own career: ***SPOILER*** in the end, the patient discovers all the crimes of which he is guilty and understands the measures that must be taken to protect society from his further abuses.<br/><br/>I'm not saying that his next project should be a remake of ""Heidi"" but it WOULD be therapeutic for him and certainly a step in the right direction."

The performances were all done though. I especially liked Elias Koteas' brief one eyed arsonists, especially after last year's body-artist serial killer in ""I Come With The Rain"", he's making racket out of the soft spoken maniac, the way Anthony Hopkins used to (or still kinda does considering ""The Woflman"").<br/><br/>Predictable for the most part, but the extended dream sequences were better than most and narrowly (but just barely at times) avoided some ""Number 23""-esque embarrassments.

","Let us all raise our glasses & toast Martin Scorsese. For well over fifty years now,he has made a mark for himself as a gifted film maker, film historian & a name in film preservation. Since his early student short films,leading to his first feature film, 'Who's That Knocking At My Door?' (which gave some fame to a then,unknown Harvey Keitel),to his work for Michael Wadleigh's Woodstock,as an assistant camera operator,as well as other projects. Now,he brings us his homage to Alfred Hitchcock in 'Shutter Island'. Shutter Island is about two federal Marshall's,investigating the disappearance of an inmate at a facility for the criminally insane,where the worst mental patients go, just off the coast of Massachusetts. Teddy Daniels,a crackerjack federal marshal,who is just gung ho about his job,has some serious issues of his own (he is a world war 2 veteran,with one too many skeletons in his closet for his own good),tries to crack the case,when he discovers something seriously wrong about the hospital/prison,where he is assigned,when he starts to poke around & makes some discoveries he probably should not have. Martin Scorsese directs from a screenplay written by Laeta Kalogrides (who also acts as one of the executive producers,among others),adapted from the novel by Dennis Lehane. The film's atmospheric cinematography (which goes for a nice touch of expressionism)is by Robert Richardson,with some ""right on the money"" editing by Thelma Schoonmaker. The cast includes Leonardo DiCaprio,as Teddy Daniels,Mark Ruffalo as his partner,Chuck Aude,Ben Kingsley channels some genuine creepiness as Dr. Cawley,with Michelle Williams, Emily Mortimer,Patrica Clarkson,Jackie Eare Haley (currently seen on screen as Freddy Krueger in the recent remake of 'A Nightmare On Elm Street'),and if that wasn't enough...the great Max Von Sydow (known for his work for Ingmar Bergman,among others),as Dr. Naehring. Despite the bad trailer for this film,which makes it look like your basic garden variety horror film,this is a shining example of a suspenseful thriller that one can sink their teeth into (and something Alfred Hitchcock would have approved of). Rated 'R' by the MPAA,for strong language & some bloody & disturbing images that could scare (and even scar) very young viewers"

Leonardo de Caprio played very well, with a performance reminding me of The Aviator, while the supporting cast, even if having rather limited roles, did their job very well. If you look at the distribution, though, it was only to be expected.<br/><br/>The way the movie was shot was very nice, with images both visually nice and emotionally charged.

After saying all of that I confess that Leonardo DiCaprio is one of the better actors to develop in the past fifteen years; if you have not seen Blood Diamond you must do so.

I won't say anything about the plot as it's basically your typical psych ward thriller type film in this regard. Scorsese does do a very good job at keeping us off our guard here and despite the fact that there isn't anything ground breaking here the sense of paranoia and uncertainty is extremely well conveyed. There is also some fine acting from the likes of DiCaprio and Ben Kingsly of course, especially from Kingsly. But I kept waiting for the film to turn into something more than a basic horror/thriller and sadly it never really delivers here. It certainly is better than just about 95% of any of the other psych horror/thrillers, and this is certainly because of Scorsese's hand, but it ultimately fails to step outside this rather clichéd and over trodden territory. There was potential here for something much better but it's never really utilized fully. Still if you like psychological thrillers I'd still recommend seeing it.

Shutter Island tells the story of two U.S. marshals, Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo), who are summoned to a remote and barren island off the cost of Massachusetts to investigate the mysterious disappearance of a murderess from the island's fortress-like hospital for the criminally insane. The film is a psychological thriller full of suspense, it will keep you on the edge of your seat, its fast pace rhythm won't allow you to blink even a second. It has a very interesting story with and unexpected ending and a perfectly developed plot full of twists. Its direction can't be less than great, Scorsese always manages to lead you to a enjoyable and entertaining journey. The cast is wonderful, Leonardo DiCaprio is excellent, these roles of tormented fellows fits him really well, Mark Ruffalo is also very convincing as Leo's sidekick, Ben Kingsley wonderful as always and Michelle Williams with a very short appearance but very important and with a decent performance. In conclusion, we all agree that this isn't one of Scorsese's finest works but still it has his mastery that make it very recommendable and worthy to watch."

","Scorsese seems like he had his mind in other projects while he was making this. Like he was saying, I am gone now but I've left my will working here so I can leave you here to watch this while I make something I really care about. The movie opens all guns blazing, all pomp and fury and circumstance, the pace is act 2 from the first couple of minutes, then we stop to find out the key trauma that haunts Ted Daniels and it's all furious clamor and loud ""ominous music"" again, helicopter shots and dream scenes and slabs of plot thrown at you like we need to get things out of the way fast.<br/><br/>From there Shutter Island segues into a convenient ""mystery thriller"" pattern, the kind of which the detective stoops down to produce important clues from under a tile in the floor which will invariably attain their proper meaning in key moments, where things are not what they really seem, the authorities responsible for helping out with the investigation are really trying to sidetrack it and crazed inmates anxiously scribble ""RUN"" on Daniels' notepad. The two detectives arrive at Shutter Island to solve a mystery much like Sergeant Howie does in The Wicker Man and Sean Connery's medieval Sherlock Holmes does in The Name of the Rose, except the shapelessness of something's not quite right here is not allowed to first become a faint outline before it becomes a definite shape. Shutter Island lunges forward, kicking and screaming and thrashing in the mist, it's all cut cut cut and plot plot plot, it doesn't stop to whisper anything, it hollers and cackles and carpet bombs its ominous scenes with ""ominous music"" so that we're never in the dark about what we're supposed to be feeling.<br/><br/>At some point Daniels loses himself inside the maze of Ward C and a warden, like the crazy old fool in a slasher movie come out of the woods to warn promiscuous teens of a strange prophecy, conveniently shows up to tell him that all the inmates are running loose and this is another thing Shutter Island does wrong. It shouts exposition to the back of the house. The only instance it kind of comes on its own is near the end, where Daniels' situation becomes wonderfully ambiguous in a ""is he crazy or is he not?"" way, except even that is followed by a long flashback meant to erase every trace of that ambiguity and the movie collapses on its knees and shouts ""nooo!!"".<br/><br/>There's a good movie kept locked in a cell somewhere in the basement, yet Scorsese seems hellbent to keep the audience from finding her probably because he has not only run off with the key and left her there, he has also lost the key so that he needs to change her name to keep us from finding it, and now when we find her at last, when we find out that *TWIST TWIST TWIST*, there's not even musing astonishment to be had. The premise is clever but a lot of the handling is lurid because for most of its duration the movie is not really asking itself ""what's eating Ted Daniels?"" but ""woo!! nazi experiments in the mysterious lighthouse"".<br/><br/>I saw this the same day I saw Chan-wook Park's Thirst and that movie still haunts my mind in the way Shutter Island is designed to, while Shutter Island is already beginning to fade and blur into something that is very grey and very loud."

","Scorseses' latest flirt with Leonardo DiCaprio takes us into the 1950's on the remote 'Shutter Island' through the eyes of U.S. Marshal Teddy Daniels. Daniels and his new partner, Chuck Aule ( Mark Ruffalo)have been sent to a hospital for the insane that dominates the tiny island in an attempt to investigate the disappearance of a child murdering and disturbed woman. However, events soon cloud the supposedly straightforward disappearance and also Daniels' judgement as they realise that the island harbours a much more sinister secret.<br/><br/>Shutter Island promises the usual grit and grime we've come to expect from Scorsese and much more. Trailers for the film suggest an 'edge-of- your-seat' thriller with images of a disturbed woman that resembles something out of The Grudge. However, if you're expecting the next scariest thing since Paranormal Activity then look else where, because this just isn't it. Although the tone of suspense runs throughout the film, it is in no way dominant. <br/><br/>I was personally surprised to see people attending the film expecting an out and out horror; that just isn't Scorsese. With this in mind, the film can be seen as a victim of its marketing. This has happened countless times previous, more recently with M Night Shyamalan's The Village. With The Village, masses of people were left let down by the lack of horror in the film, causing them to ignore a much deeper side. I fear this could potentially end up being the case with Shutter Island.<br/><br/>Poor marketing aside, Shutter Island takes the audience on an intense psychological journey that echoes elements of The Aviator. We are drawn into the increasingly paranoid mind of our protagonist, Daniels which evidently sets us up for a killer blow. DiCaprio, as we've come to expect, delivers a near flawless performance depicting Daniels to perfection. His co star, Mark Ruffalo similarly doesn't disappoint. Once again we see him playing the friendly supportive type we've come to expect and acts as the perfect tonic to DiCaprio's Daniels, ensuring the film never becomes too heavy.<br/><br/>All in all, I'd advise everybody to see this film, but to forget anything they previously expected from it in order to enjoy it fully. <br/><br/>Separated from generic convention, Shutter Island will take the audience on an intense ride before hitting them with a killer blow that will resonate long after the theatre lights are raised."
"rax86","8","0","2","9 April 2010"," Not Scrosese's best but still pretty good
","I love Martin Scorsese, the man has pulled out classics, Goodfells, Raging Bull, Taxi Driver etc the list goes on. Shutter Island, although not his best still shines as a soon to be classic. The movie's tone is dark and creepy, something a lot of Horror films are missing nowadays. Although this is no Horror, the elements of it scream HORROR. The editing is amazing, the cast excellent. However, to me the surprise twist is easily identified, i did have my few guesses whilst watching the film but the fact that it is all in his mind was the most likely of all. The thing that stood out the most for me is the creepy dead kids in blood. Scorsese knows how to scare the living dump out of you. It's not a conventional movie of Scorsese's but i am willing to bet that he could write up a mean one. The guy still knows how to hook in an audience and with Leo Dicaprio as his main man, he cannot and will not fail. I salute you Scorsese for bringing out one of your top films and it still isn't YOUR best. How can he fail? He wont."

","At the start, because of a few very poorly scripted lines, I was worried that Shutter Island was going to be a very obvious, very 'Hollywood' sort of movie. But by the end, it was clear that this is a very unique and excellent film! It had such a clever plot and there were many twists. Throughout almost all of Shutter Island, the tension was ratcheted up extremely high and I found myself genuinely very scared of quite a few of the scenes! <br/><br/>Some of the scenes were absolutely brilliantly done and were totally engrossing and moving; the cinematography of Shutter Island was fantastic! The acting was mainly very good and Dicaprio did a very good job of the main character. <br/><br/>This is one of those films which, when you leave the cinema, leaves you thinking very deeply- this is probably due to the fact that this whole film is basically based around psychosis. Any film that does this is almost automatically very good and Shutter Island is no exception to this rule- it's brilliant."

","WARNING! THIS ENTIRE REVIEW IS A SPOILER! For me, watching this movie was an exercise in recycling old ideas and making them work again.

","My interpretation of shutter island is very different from many others. Everything happened in the cave seems to be the key to the correct understanding of the beauty of the film.<br/><br/>With that in mind, you will be at a better position to understand the wonderful mind-control tactics the doctors used in order to persuade you to believe something that never happened. Finally, Teddy pretends that he believes what the doctors said (that he has been there for two years, that his partner is actually Dr. Sheehan, that he is actually a murderer, ...).<br/><br/>Anyway, he cannot escape because his enemy is too powerful to beat. Therefore, at the last moment, he gave up and became another ""patient"".<br/><br/>Maybe in Shutter Island II, we will see that Teddy suddenly refused to take the surgery at the lighthouse, killed all the guys around him, swam to Boston, and finally blew up the island."

","Well, I saw that movie. It was good. It was entertaining and captivating. One might say it was perfect... well everything except the ending. The guy decides to commit homicide because he can't live with himself. Weak. It was clearly missing the edge, and not the common one - when they are conducting those mind experiments and the psychic patient actually discovers it, but the original one, which I can't think about right now. DeCaprio, an actor which I don't really like played good, though I think that someone else might have been better for this part - someone like Collin Farrel. In any case still it's another master piece from Scorcese. I'd advice to anyone to goo see this movie."

","I feel sure most of the audience in the cinema did not like this! Anyone looking for a shock filled gore fest will be very disappointed. Oddly, considering the film's esteemed director the problem lies with that very person! It is somewhat LAZY and SELF INDULGENT. I do believe MR SCORSESE should become a food critic now and let someone new take over.As many people have pointed out it is fairly apparent after about ten minutes roughly how the film will end; however that is not necessarily bad and I don't think it mattered in this case. Far more problematic was the intrusive score; there were some places where silence would have been more appropriate.<br/><br/>Having said that I ENJOYED this film. Di Caprio was as earnest and professional as always and Kingsley was plain enjoying himself. One of the better scenes in the film was between Di Caprio and Max Von Sydow who fizzed viciously as they clashed. The scenes along the cliff were handled beautifully, albeit in a kind of sub Hitchcock way...Which sums it up really. If you like such films as Vertigo, Spellbound and film noir you gonna love this."

","While Scorsese has made a few psychological thrillers, 'Shutter Island' is somewhat different from those in that this one is rather atmospheric, claustrophobic and chilling. The sets look meticulously crafted, particularly the interiors. The visuals are quite good. However, Scorsese seems to have gotten sloppy with the special effects, particularly the green screen filter. Despite this flaw, the tension is built quite effectively and the cool atmosphere works. The cinematography is a little too erratic at times. The story is engaging and there are plenty of twists but certain parts remain contrived and rushed. Sometimes the sequences feel rather patchy than fluid. This does work in parts like where Teddy bounces back and forth between his thoughts, his fantasy and his reality. However at times, a fluid approach may have been more effective. I enjoyed the references to movies of greats like Hitchcock and Kubrick. The top notch soundtrack is used brilliantly. Scorsese has assembled a fine cast of fine actors like Ben Kingsley, Max Von Sydow, Mark Ruffalo and Jackie Earle Hayley. Leonardo Dicaprio is quite adequate in the lead role. The women, Michelle Williams, Patricia Clarkson and Emily Mortimer, do not get much scope to perform but they do shine in their roles, especially Clarkson and Mortimer. Clearly, 'Shutter Island' isn't among the best of Scorsese's works but it is an interesting film that raises a few questions."

","Pure and simple this is a must see. However please do not read this if you haven't watched it yet!! I have just finished watching this and have enjoyed it from start to finish! Although fairly evident near the beginning what was going to happen in this movie I cannot help but applaud Scorsese' in depth building of Teddy/Andrew's character and the resulting path he took him in Shutter Island. Scorsese has simply set another level for this genre. A level i'm sad to say will be hard to recreate. May I also add, I love the fact that Andrew committed what essentially was suicide in the end! It is a breath of fresh air to what I thought was going to be the usual, he was insane all along!! And all it took was a couple of lines. Brilliant!"

","I haven't seen every Scorsese film by any means - probably about two thirds of them - so I don't come to Shutter Island as a fan, particularly. I admire Scorsese's skill and talent, but I don't necessarily like his films that much. However, I do recognise that he is a movie maker whose work is strongly individualistic.<br/><br/>Which make Shutter Island unusual, because it is very much an accessible, mainstream kind of movie.<br/><br/>Two cops - Di Caprio and Ruffalo - travel to an isolated island, home to a psychiatric prison hospital, to investigate a missing patient. Information/clues start from the very start. Some of them are misleading, some are valid but possibly not in the way you expected, and some are fair clues. As a result, you are kept guessing nearly all the way through.<br/><br/>I suppose if you guess what's going on early on then you may be disappointed: I didn't, and wasn't.<br/><br/>The cast is uniformly excellent: DiCaprio is particularly impressive, although I wish he would avoid facial stubble.<br/><br/>If I had a criticism, it would be that the film is a touch overlong."

I went because my mum had just finished reading the book and watched it, she said it was amazing, but I'm not normally interested in what she is at all. For starters its not a horror film like it is made to look like. Its a complex story where even I felt I couldn't be certain what was going to happen. Its pretty simple man goes to random island to find missing woman. And everything seems to go wrong. The film is pretty long and i don't think many people will appreciate it because you have to pay attention and most people like the dribble most films are now days. There are a lot of clues to the ending and throughout i kind of built up a picture of what was going to happen. The ending took me a while to get because you don't really understand what happened but when you do you appreciate how good the film actually was.

","I'm not a huge fan of Scorsese unlike many others, some of his films are perfect (Goodfellas), some make me want to stamp on kittens (Gangs of New York). Shutter Island is a bit of a departure for him. It's a B-Movie. This is not a bad thing, this is a good thing. It's a glorious, wonderful paean to the genre and I absolutely loved it. Think Frank Daradont's Shawshank or The Mist. Actually if you're unconvinced by Scorsese, just pretend Darabont directed it.<br/><br/>Hard-boiled FBI man turns up on remote island, with new partner, to investigate a vanished patient from an mental institution. On entering institution, his gun is taken, patients mouth warnings, head shrink at facility offers him pills, people look shifty, mysterious buildings, Nazi psychiatrists, strange happenings etc etc In short-hand, there're plenty of classical plot opportunities offered up. In the best possible tradition of the genre, all possible plot threads are splayed out in front of the viewer, and then deftly pulled together ever so slightly faster than you could on your own. The twists and turns aren't unimaginable, but the tautness of the pace just drags you along with them - you're not left, as with so many other films of the genre, running increasingly obscure self-postulated theories, of where it's going, through your mind as you watch. If I had to sum up, as the credits rolled I just thought: ""That was a good film - I really enjoyed that"". No quibbles. Nothing I wanted to change. No bits that dragged. I just sat there for 2 hours came away happy."

","This film is certainly not a 'one star' - those reviewers who gave it such a low ranking are probably doing a knee-jerk reaction to a film that frustrated them. This is not a film for immature teenagers or twenty-somethings looking for visual excitement, it's a film that requires thought and attention. That aside, the formula is the same one as used in other movies like 'The Others' and 'A Beautiful Mind' - things are not the way they first appear. Given the fine cast it is no surprise that the performances are all very good, and I was especially impressed by the superb Ben Kingsley. Unfortunately the storyline is really rather thin to sustain a two-and-a-half-hour film, so the focus tends to be more on studying the personality of the character played by Di Caprio than running through an interesting plot; this is the fundamental weakness of the film. The wartime experiences of the leading character could have opened up some fascinating twists and turns but that was not exploited; also, as some reviewers have said, the ending was all too predictable once you realised that the leading character was not what he first appeared as. Nevertheless, the excellent acting alone made this film enjoyable for me, and, while not a masterpiece, it is certainly worth watching if you are prepared to be patient."

The film opens with two U.S. marshals on a ferry going to Shutter Island and the tension starts then and doesn't end until the very end of the picture.<br/><br/>Although a great psychological thriller, this movie could have been a fine mysterious adventure film in the sense that the film opens with everything seeming like there has been a murderess escaping from her room.<br/><br/>Scorsese's directing once again is unmatchable and he gives us a more eerie experience than Cape Fear (1991). It is a pity this film missed Oscar time because this had the ability to take best picture, best director, best actor (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Best Supporting Actor (for either Sir Ben Kingsley or Mark Ruffalo).<br/><br/>The only thing this film is missing is a cameo from Robert De Niro. It would be good to see the pair team up once again for a ninth collaboration seeing as though DiCaprio has made four films with Scorsese and their are more in the pipeline.<br/><br/>A must see - anyone going to the cinema soon - see this. 10/10 - excellent!"

","This is old Hollywood storytelling at its best. Dark and moody like an ink-dipped onion, peeling back the layers of this story is what makes it so pleasurable. I enjoy films that when the end credits roll I have to sit in my seat for a little bit and playback crucial points in the story that make me go 'ah-ha'. The setting, the acting, the subtle nuances, I enjoyed it all. What all good movies should be - a damn good piece of story telling. I recall reading an interview from Leo DiCaprio where he mentions that he 'just trusts Martin Scorsese to lead him in the right direction' and you can certainly see evidence of that here, all actors have been giving superb guidance in creating the vision of the director, who never looses his focus in making a film that has the viewer guessing until the last few shocking scenes. I want to go back and see this movie all over again!~"

I get the point the twist is making, but I felt cheated because virtually anything could have happened (a cameo by Elvis, a trip to the moon...) and it would have been explained.

","NOTE - THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS - The funny thing about this film is that those critical of it would be correct IF they were right in their interpretation. This is not some simplistic horror movie with a boring predictable ending that reveals De Caprio was crazy all along. That would be boring. Instead I think the correct interpretation is that he was who he claimed to be and those things that he accuses them of doing on the island they are in fact doing. He has a damaged past with the war and his wife and his sanity is on edge and they take advantage of that to manipulate him and then give him the opportunity to walk away by agreeing with them that he had a sort of nervous breakdown. Instead he chooses to die rather then live in their lie. This is the only interpretation in which the movie has power. Otherwise what is the point of his last remark - would you rather live a monster or die a good man- if he was actually insane. He is a sane and good man in an insane and evil world."

"ajs-10","7","0","2","14 March 2010"," A mystery thriller with a twist...
","I am quite a fan of the work of Martin Scorsese and as such I really wanted to enjoy this film. Unfortunately it didn't quite hit the mark for me. I try very hard not to compare any director's work with their previous efforts, mainly because we never really know what difficulties they faced in making any particular film. So I won't harp on about how it doesn't compare with 'Goodfellas', or it's not as good as 'The Aviator' or 'The Departed' as I feels that's unfair, I'll let it stand alone as a single piece of work.<br/><br/>It is 1953 and Teddy Daniels is a US Marshall who, along with his new partner, Chuck Aule, has been sent to Shutter Island to investigate then disappearance of one of the patients at a mental asylum there. They are met with a frosty reception and the mysterious Dr. Cawley and Dr. Naehring who seem to be hiding something. They find a clue, a note left by the escaped patient indicating a mysterious 67th patient at the facility that nobody will admit to the existence of. A storm prevents them leaving the island when the escaped patient, Dolores Chanal, mysteriously turns up out of the blue. Teddy is being increasingly troubled by flashbacks to the death of his wife in a fire several years earlier and also his experiences in World War II. Believing that there is a lot more than meets the eye, Teddy and Chuck set out to get to the bottom of things. I'll leave my short synopsis there; don't want to give too much away! A beautifully well made film, I cannot fault the cinematography at all. There were one or two continuity errors I spotted, but I'll let them slide. Really good performances from all of the major cast members, honourable mentions go to Leonardo DiCaprio as Teddy Daniels, Mark Ruffalo as Chuck Aule, Ben Kingsley as Dr. Cawley, Max von Sydow as Dr. Naehring and Michelle Williams as Dolores Chanal.<br/><br/>The film is made in the film noir style, and as such there a lot of scenes with quite a lot of dialogue. This is fine when the dialogue moves the story along, but I found in a lot of cases, these scenes were beautifully shot, but that was it, they didn't particularly add much else to the story. It's not a bad film for all that, there is a really good twist at the end, it just failed to meet my expectations at the end of the day. If you love film noir then by all means go and see it, otherwise I'm afraid you may be disappointed.<br/><br/>My score: 6.8/10"
"Argemaluco","7","0","2","13 March 2010"," An interesting movie, but I expected more from Scorsese
","Do not misunderstand me...I liked Shutter Island, because it certainly offers various positive elements.However, on a deeper level, it does not look like a film from director Martin Scorsese...I generally could not feel on it that fierce energy which identified many of his movies.Nevertheless, I will not deny this is an entertaining film which produces a good atmosphere.<br/><br/>I had special interest in this movie, because it represented the first incursion from Scorsese in the mystery genre; I suppose his remake of Cape Fear could get into that category, but Shutter Island has many traditional elements from the genre, from mysterious disappearances to dark dungeons where the danger lurks everywhere.On that aspect, the first half of the movie works pretty well at establishing the mystery, suggesting a treacherous motivation for the villain and showing the tortuous past from the hero, which adds a personal subtext to the investigation he makes.However, on the second half, the movie looses the focus with false clues, redundant scenes and narrative alleys.Besides, I do not know whether Scorsese did not feel very comfortable working with this material, or if he wanted to make a tribute to films like The Silence of the Lambs, The Shining and Spellbound (1945).However, I would have preferred a more personal vision of the genre, and not a mere reproduction of the innovations introduced by other movies.<br/><br/>The aficionados to film or literary thriller will know that the stories which involve asylums, psychiatrists and mental perturbations always end up falling on three or four narrative formulas.Shutter Island is not the exception, and it was pretty easy for me to predict the twist in the end which should have supposedly left us amazed.Dennis Lehane (the author of the book this movie is based on -which, by the way, I have not read-) may noticed that, so he decided to distract us and confuse the road from the story.However, the only thing he made is adding an extra half an hour which makes the story a bit tiring.However, on the positive side from this movie, we have Scorsese's efficient direction and the solid performances from Leonardo DiCaprio, Ben Kingsley, Mark Ruffalo and Michelle Williams.<br/><br/>Talking about Williams, she appears on the best moments of the movie, and it was there where I seemed to recognize Scorsese as I usually know him; unfortunately, the rest of the movie lacks of identity, and it limits to be a competent thriller, but which is not very ambitious or highly memorable.However, I recommend it to have a time of interesting mystery.In summary, this is a good movie, but I expected more from it."

No matter how hard one tries to suspend one's disbelief with this movie, there inevitably comes a point when it's just all too convoluted for words and the story falls apart. If this viewer had been watching it at home he would have put his foot through the screen at the ending. No question Scorsese is a master of cinema, no question there is enormous talent at work in the acting department and no question a ton of money was poured into this project. But the story begins to slide midway, everything clicks into place and all one can do is hope one's suspicions are wrong. Unfortunately, for all the red herrings, it isn't hard to work out. When the twist to the story is finally revealed all one can think is, ""Yeah, right. As if."" Quality film-making at work here and Scorsese manipulates like the master he is, but if only the damn story wasn't so unbelievable when it comes down to it."

But if you are, read on. <br/><br/>Without going into any bit of detail about the plot and the shape of the movie, let me just say that Scorcese lives up to his reputation, and has brought together an excellent piece of movie making from all respects. The camera-work and light is excellent and gives an all through eeriness to the feel of the movie, highlighting its character. The script is tight and keeps you guessing and confused (as intended) till the last scene.

","You got the master of directing Martin Scorese filming a horror film and think what the hell, but this film was great. All the actors rocked, the idea was brilliant, and it was shot beautifully. Heres the 1 problem, THE ENDING!!!!!!!!!!! It reminded me so much of the ending in the 2003 film Idenity. Here it is, it turned out Leonardo Dicaprio was actually a patient at Shutter Island, not a Marshall. He found his kids murdered by his wife then he killed her so it made him snap. So he made an alternate persona to hide from the truth. Ben Kingsleys character and Mark Ruffalos character let him play out the fantasy to hopefully have him snap out of it. Then he fakes having the fantasy after they think they helped him out of it so he could be killed. Now at the end of Idenity a man who killed his mother as a boy created many alternate persona's but his main one was a cop. At the end we find out John Cusack is actually a persona made by the killer. I loved this film and recommend it but it would have been perfect had they made a more original ending."

"glance_left","7","0","2","6 March 2010"," Has ""The Pledge"" and ""The Turn""...but where's ""The Prestige""?
","Michael Cain's character, Cutter, in Christopher Nolan's ""The Prestige"" says of magic...<br/><br/>""Every great magic trick consists of three parts or acts. The first part is called ""The Pledge"". The magician shows you something ordinary: a deck of cards, a bird or a man. He shows you this object. Perhaps he asks you to inspect it to see if it is indeed real, unaltered, normal. But of course... it probably isn't. The second act is called ""The Turn"". The magician takes the ordinary something and makes it do something extraordinary. Now you're looking for the secret... but you won't find it, because of course you're not really looking. You don't really want to know. You want to be fooled. But you wouldn't clap yet. Because making something disappear isn't enough; you have to bring it back. That's why every magic trick has a third act, the hardest part, the part we call ""The Prestige""."" <br/><br/>When one goes to see a great magic show....a premier show....a VEGAS show....it's the preceding reputation of the magician that draws the crowd. Scorsese is such a magician, in my personal esteem. Hell, let's say that, in this particular show, its a collaborative effort of TWO magicians....Scorsese and DiCaprio...which draws us in. I, like many of you, paid the price of admission because I've been thrilled before....been transfixed and then transported into that rarefied air...the sorcerer's aether that leaves one floating in a kind of post-hypnotic bliss long after the movie is over. So, once again, I sit down waiting to be intoxicated again. The lights dim...cell phones turn off...and the curtains lift...<br/><br/>The ""pledge"", as Cutter calls it, is the stage set for Scorsese's magic...a US marshal sent to investigate the disappearance of an inmate/inpatient of a whole island set aside for the treatment/detention of the criminally insane. Welcome to Shutter Island. And the set is a gorgeous one. Everything about it drips with the requisite Gothic, cloistered mystique required for this kind of story. Scorsese delivers here....in spades.<br/><br/>The ""turn"" is pulled off in a progressive, galloping crescendo of psychological tension as DiCaprio's character becomes embroiled in the ambient madness the cannot help but flourish in such a place. His outer circumstances are exquisitely reflected in his inner turmoil...those crystalline, fever-liveried dreams which are nothing short of pure Scorsese virtuosity. Without delving into the plot details, which has been done many times in previous reviews, magic happens throughout this transformational segment of the film. I'm well along for the ride, every step of the way...gut roiling...heart beating...feeling that delicious vertigo ""as if I'm there"".<br/><br/>This above is enough, I feel, to warrant going to see the film. It's a visual/emotional spectacle that will impact your state of awareness, without question. The real question is, however, ""is this a masterpiece?"" No...it isn't. It simply cannot be, perhaps by virtue of a certain code (if there is such a thing) amongst magicians (great film directors). The reason is clear, as in Cutter's final words of the above quote, ""Because making something disappear isn't enough; you have to bring it back. That's why every magic trick has a third act, the hardest part, the part we call ""The Prestige""."" ""The Prestige"" of Shutter Island is in the final twist....bringing the magically transformed, careening plot back somehow to tie those wildly flailing loose ends up in a bow. It does this in a single scene...but, in doing so, makes one of the most egregious mistakes a magician can make in comporting the final elements of his big act: it steals the Prestige from another magician...from several, in fact....and this is inexcusable. Perhaps its unfair...but it is reality. Magic can be many, many things...but it can never be redundant. It must always be fresh...must always be arising and precipitating from the edge of impossibility and artful creativity. <br/><br/>The simple fact is, the final twist of Shutter Island has been done before. And once I acknowledged this fact, sitting there in the theater, I came thumping back down to earth...looked apologetically at my wife and asked her what she thought of the film. Her response says it all....<br/><br/>""It was o.k."""

While constantly mixing reality with illusions and dreams, the whole movie seems like a magnificent trip to the very depths of what a film should be. The viewer himself is nothing but a tool for Scorsese to play with, and you would be surprised of the changes your mind will go through, throughout this film. It keeps you in super high suspense and has some pretty scary parts, while also pointing out philosophical, political and mostly psychological aspects. I assure you, this movie will grab you in every minute of it, and will stay in your head for a long time. 10/10"

Shoud it have been therapy, loaded or not he could have killed the guard with a rifle. And, so much care was given to detail in the film, the rifle is a Mauser K98? At least it looked like a Mauser K98 from the few angles, it could have been a Springfield 1903, but the curve toward the butt after the trigger guard was rather distinct. That just may have been a gaffe by the props dept, or it may be a clue as to how Martin felt about the story, that they were connected to Nazis.

","It's hard to knock a movie with a good ending even if the bulk of the movie stinks, which is case for this over-hyped thriller. Much of the movie is exceedingly underwhelming and at times outright boring. The gloomy sets, the hackneyed acting, the dumb dialog all combine to make the first two-thirds of this movie quite bland, the stuff that makes the eyelids feel heavy as you are sinking into slumber-land. Yet something amazing happens. The movie actually turns itself around and becomes an engaging and exciting cinematic event, marked by strong acting by Leonardo Di Caprio as his confused character struggles to unravel the riddle of his very identity. How this movie manages to avoid creative oblivion is fascinating. Somewhere, some how, the director must have realized that he had to turn this movie around to avoid flop-ville. Two problems with the movie is that the sinister characters aren't really all that sinister and that the setting, a psychiatric hospital is, well, a psychiatric hospital. One must remember that when a story is based in a hospital, drama can be taken just so far because along with the doctors and nurses who interact with patients, there is also a virtual army of clerks, housekeepers, accountants and other support staff who actually keep the hospital running. So when watching Shutter Island, one should ask: who is paying the bills, mopping the floor, dealing with account payable and receivables and maintaining the phones? They have a story too but once again it goes untold."

Scorsese has created an amazing, dark mystery where half the time I had not quite a clue what was going on, even though I was totally gripped by it. I pretty much liked everything: the story, the acting (which features DiCaprio's best performance since The Aviator), the atmosphere, all of it. DiCaprio is able to bring forth such great feeling as Teddy, that he has really shown his acting chops here. However, I never truly believed Ben Kingsley, not that it was bad acting, but that he was a bad liar. Most times he didn't sound very sincere when he's trying to deny that he knows anything about what's going on. On the whole it was a great performance. Also, the dream sequences and constant plot-twists just kept pulling me in until I was trying to work it all out in my head, even when it was all over. Overall this is another Scorsese masterpiece that will probably be watched and studied in the future."

","I've been an avid Dennis Lehane fan for a while now and have read and seen Mystic River and Gone Baby Gone. Although I favor Gone Baby Gone because of the questions it raises, I believe that Scorcese's Shutter Island is the best adaptation of a novel in a long time. The sheer creepiness that he captures is amazing. I thought that the movie would be a little too Hollywood for Lehane fans, but I was completely wrong. Scorcese captures every emotion in the book perfectly. The great thing about books is that the mind can produce images of what is going on depending on the reader's interpretation. I feel that this movie digs to the core of Teddy Daniels and Leo does an absolutely amazing job of portraying this character. When the scenes unfolded, I could truly feel the sincerity of the role. I've never been a huge fan of books becoming movies because I feel that it takes away from the creativity and numerous interpretations of the book, but Shutter Island is everything that Lehane writes. Every scene was exactly how I interpreted it to be in the novel and I loved it. The last words uttered by Teddy (Leo) will be haunting to viewers who have read the story. I really think Lehane could watch the movie and just nod his head as if to say, ""Yep, that's exactly what I tried to say."""
"mrvlhs","8","0","3","26 February 2010"," Well produced and directed, could have ended better
","I am not going to extend too much on this review. First of all, before you start taking my teeth out one by one, let me say I pretty much enjoyed the overall quality of the movie. From the shots, to the actors, lighting, sounds effects, music, all was at a very professional and captivating level. The plot was also very interesting as things started to, in a strange way, become simultaneously clearer and harder to understand.<br/><br/>Now moving fast-forward: in my perspective the worst part of the movie was the end. I don't like open endings for a very simple reason: I payed for someone to figure it out for me. Else I would stay home and make my own movie in my mind. Anyway, if Martin wanted to leave an open ending he failed to do so. This means I didn't like it because of both things, 1st he tried, 2nd he failed, and now I'll explain why he failed: If the guy wasn't mental, why would anyone have all the trouble of making him believe he was? Why not simply doing the surgery to his brain right away? What would stop them from doing it? They could easily create an excuse.<br/><br/>Oh I would also like to say something about many of other reviews are saying which is ""Martin created a new genre"". My response would be: ""Oh really? I also created this new thing, it looks like a camera, behaves like a camera and does all things a camera does, no more, no less, but it's called Parptrokypus and I invented it..."""

","Scorsese put forth a deep, multi-layered suspenseful story here. Some people will say ""Aw, i figured it out half way through"". Well congrats. You have seen a thousand movies and are a semi-intelligent film. If you can't watch ""Sixth Sense"" or ""Usual Suspectss"" more than once, stay away. But if you love classical film-making, please revel in this rich tapestry of Marty touching on a Lynchian/Gondryesque film. Amazing performances, a solid cast, and accurate accents all collaborate to deliver this strong release. Thelma's editing really stands out from the first frame. it is the true essence of the film in the disjointed access it allows you. See it."
"blackbriar246","Null","0","3","22 February 2010"," Meh, alright
","From the trailer, I expected Shutter Island to be a thrilling, edge-of-your-seat, gripping experience. To be frank, it's not. This is probably partly due to the movie's fairly long run time, 2 hrs and 18 min. It's very rare that a movie that long can hold my attention successfully. Lord of the Rings was almost the death of me. But I digress. I think that this movie wouldn't have dragged so much if they cut out, or at least severely shortened all of the main character's hallucinations. But there are some good points. Leonardo does a good job as a mentally disturbed cop, and this movie does get a bit disturbing and creepy at parts. The twist at the end is pretty awesome too. So, there isn't much wrong with this movie, but what is wrong really hurts it. To summarize: Good: Nice acting, good twist, creepy and sometimes disturbing Bad: Not as creepy as hoped, way too long with too many boring parts"
"tkslack","9","0","3","22 February 2010"," Bravo Scorsese
","Scorsese has yet again constructed a deeply layered and thought provoking piece of work. There is so much style and visceral emotion. You really feel his love of film when watching his movies. A perfectly cast and acted movie. Not one weak character. Amazing cinematography by the always great Robert Richardson. The production design and wardrobe are all spot on as well. A great throwback piece, feels a bit like a Hitchcock picture at some points. Absolutely love the source music he used. I love the dark mood of the picture. Watch this film more than once. You'll appreciate the little details more throughout. Bravo Scorsese."
"dragoncaine","8","0","3","22 February 2010"," Great Movie!!!
","This is the only movie in the theaters right now that is worth your time. It has great acting, and a wonderful twist. The plot at first seems rather simple, but it eventually spans out to be much more deep than you originally thought. Leonardo Dicaprio is very good in this movie, and Mark Ruffalo is also pretty solid. The supporting cast is nothing sort of great, and I honestly couldn't notice any bad performances. In the middle of the movie some parts may seem a tad confusing, but do not worry! Everything gets cleared up in the end, and I don't think anyone will dislike the ending of the movie. The ending boosted my rating up by an entire point. The beginning sets the mood and atmosphere for the rest of the movie, the middle has intense scenes, and the ending is the resolution. Don't be surprised if you see this at the Oscars!!!! 9.2/10"

","It's 1954, and up-and-coming U.S. marshal Teddy Daniels is assigned to investigate the disappearance of a patient from Boston's Shutter Island Ashecliffe Hospital. He's been pushing for an assignment on the island for personal reasons, but before long he wonders whether he hasn't been brought there as part of a twisted plot by hospital doctors whose radical treatments range from unethical to illegal to downright sinister. Teddy's shrewd investigating skills soon provide a promising lead, but the hospital refuses him access to records he suspects would break the case wide open. As a hurricane cuts off communication with the mainland, more dangerous criminals ""escape"" in the confusion, and the puzzling, improbable clues multiply, Teddy begins to doubt everything - his memory, his partner, even his own sanity. alfiehitchie. The Shutter Island is the best film. I really think so. I think that direction and cast are excellent! I watched all his films on http://fullmoviereview.com/ I read a lot about it there. And find a lot of fotos too. DiCaprio is very good in this film."
"wjn44","9","0","8","21 February 2010"," Outstanding
","If this movie is not worthy of many awards then none are. Its just has it all! Hard to give a review without spoiling the movie for viewers. So I'll just say this, it is a ""don't miss"" with multiple of 10! The actors and I mean all of them have outdone themselves! The locations and camera work are surreal and vivid. You try to figure out what is going on and somewhere during the movie you might figure it out, partially, but the final scene just leaves you dumbfounded. Just a great film that may rival ""Chinatown"" and certainly equals it! Just shell out the bucks for this one and you will not regret it! No one actor carries the film, its like a ensemble but without the heavies and with a cast of great character actors at their best!"
"sevencurses1986","10","0","8","21 February 2010"," Psychological thriller that makes you think and comes together well...
","Set in a time of an ideological shift from inhumane psycho surgery (such as lobotomies) to psychotropic medication, combined with therapy, this thriller takes us on a psychological journey. In a time when movies are becoming less and less thought provoking, it was a pleasure to see this movie tonight.<br/><br/>Martin Scorsese, the man who brought us Goodfellas, Casino, The Departed, No Direction Home, the Aviator and many classics, again teams up with Leonardo DiCaprio, and his direction is beautifully haunting. The dream sequences, ""flashbacks"" to Nazi death camps, and shots around the island are all well done.<br/><br/>This movie is not the standard fare, but leaps and bounds above any new release in the past few years. I can't stop thinking about it and hope Hollywood sees there is still an appetite for something more than car chases, silly comedies, and romantic fluff."
"MatthewLong23","8","0","3","20 February 2010"," Awesome confusing movie
","This was a very good movie to watch. I wouldn't consider it one of Martin Scorsese's best but it's up there. It tells the story about a mental institution where a patient has escaped and 2 US Marshalls have come to investigate. They find themselves not finding more answers but questions as they figure out how she escaped and who may have been involved. Early on you find out that Leo Dicaprio mainly took on this case as the man who set the fire who killed his wife is on the island and wants to confront him. In his mind you see him thinking about his wife and she gives him clues as to what he needs to do to find this missing person. The movie takes a crazy turn in the last bit as to what is real and what isn't. The twist in the end was awesome and made the whole film great. The last bit where Leo and his supposed partner are talking makes you think about what was really up with that but unfortunately the film just ends right there."
"traveler_nl","9","0","3","20 February 2010"," powerful thriller, yet too disturbing
","Intriguing story of a Marshall investigating a missing criminally insane inmate at the Shutter Island facility in Boston Harbor. LD did an excellent acting job of playing the role of the Marshal. MvS played the cynical doctors roll with great zeal. The direction was very good and acting was superb. This movie showed a glimpse into the treatment options for psychosis and extreme anti-social behavior.<br/><br/>But, beware; the movie does contain graphic depictions of violence, mass graves, and young children's death. The scenes of the concentrations camps were surreal, so not as disturbing as what followed. The death scenes near the end of the movies were so vivid and disturbing that we ended up leaving the theater before the movie finished. Anyone with young children should be cautioned about the graphic nature of the final scenes of the movie. I was surprised that this film was not rated NC-17 due to this graphic scene. <br/><br/>I personally think the movie was excellent and up there with ""Abre los ojos"", but would have been better a better movie with the disturbing scene by the lake being cut out of the movie."
